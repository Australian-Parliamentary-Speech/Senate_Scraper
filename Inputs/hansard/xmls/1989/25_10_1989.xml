       Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;
      </para>
      <para>
       The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to ensure adequate remuneration levels for pharmacists, so that they may be able to provide a high quality health care service which is the right of every citizen of Australia.

       The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:

       The proposed cuts in funding to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will have serious effects on the viability of many family chemists, leading to increased charges and reduction in services and availability of medicines to the community.

      <para>
       The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.

       That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.

       That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.
      </para>
      <para>

       That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.

      <para>
       The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.

       The Petition of citizens of Australia points out:
      </para>
      <para>
       that all State Governments, States Attorneys- General, most womens' groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of Members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia.

      <para>
       that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported.

      <para>
       that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the A.C.T. Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material.

       that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.

        Today a large number of pharmacists, particularly female pharmacists and women employed in pharmacies around Australia, have come to Canberra for the purpose of indicating to the Government their dissatisfaction with the way in which the Government has been dealing with matters of pharmacy and with questions relating to the provisions of remuneration for pharmacists. These matters are dealt with in the National Health Amendment Bill and in the amendment made by the Senate when this matter was debated on 27 September. The purpose of our moving for the suspension of Standing Orders is to facilitate the moving of a motion to deal now with the question of the National Health Amendment Bill and the remuneration of pharmacists.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe this is a matter which should be determined as quickly as possible. After all, to put this legislation on the Notice Paper after we have allegedly dealt with the Budget will mean that the matter will not be resolved for many months. We believe that pharmacists have to a very large extent been made the scapegoats in this debate-a matter which I shall come to if the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is carried. Nevertheless, I do not propose to speak at any length about the reasons for the suspension of Standing Orders. It is quite simple: we wish to have the National Health Amendment Bill and the Senate amendment to that Bill dealt with as expeditiously as possible. We believe, therefore, that the Standing Orders should be suspended. If they are suspended, we should then debate the National Health Amendment Bill, determine what the Senate's position on that matter is and then proceed to the other matters which are on the Notice Paper. I therefore seek support for the suspension of Standing Orders and, if that is carried, I will move to bring on debate on the National Health Amendment Bill forthwith.

         —The Australian Democrats will support this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. From time to time a great deal of criticism has been levelled at Canberra being remote from the capital cities around Australia, where most constituents live. Today, there are a large number of pharmacists in Canberra. They have made a very specific, deliberate and costly effort to be in Canberra to demonstrate their opposition to the Government's changes to pharmacy remuneration. It is very appropriate that this matter be debated today so that those people present in the gallery can be aware of the proceedings in the Senate and, in that way, can participate in the proper democratic process. To deny them that opportunity by putting this matter off for further weeks and months would be quite inappropriate. Therefore, there is considerable pressure for supporting the suspension of Standing Orders so that this matter may be debated now.

        I can listen to and disagree with some of the points that were made by Senator Puplick and I will do so. But Senator Coulter has come in here and proposed that we should debate something today simply because people with a self-interest have turned up. When Vietnam demonstrations were being held outside the old Parliament House in the 1960s, would Senator Baume have come into this place and argued that we must debate the Vietnam war because people outside were protesting against it? It is absolutely preposterous to suggest that the timing of debates in this chamber is related to what lobbyists are outside. That is an absolutely pathetic suggestion. Senator Coulter even said that the debate should be held today because people have gone to the cost of coming here.

        It is a pity that we were not given a little more notice that a motion would be moved to suspend Standing Orders. However, I thank Senator Puplick for giving me some notice because I have to recall a Minister who is not here but delivering a speech somewhere else. I do not know whether he will be back for this debate.

         —That is a typical attitude by Senator Knowles. One of the great democrats of the Parliament says that it does not matter. As far as I am concerned, the reality is that one of the few privileges this Government has in this chamber is ordering its own business. That has always been the case. How many times from 1975 to 1983 was the placing of business taken out of the hands of the Government? How many times was such a motion moved?

It may just be-I have not been privy to whether this debate goes on today or not-that one of the strongest arguments for its not going on today is that there might be people here putting views that would influence government, but all those opposite are intent on is putting on a performance for the gallery. That is what this is about-so that members of the Opposition can put on a performance because an election is coming up. They have asked for honesty before; the Senator Baumes demand honesty. Why do they not get up and say that that is the reason they want to debate this matter today?

         —No, I am just saying that that is one of the rights-the Senate has other rights-usually accorded to government. Members of the Opposition have broken that today which is something that they will regret one day because it was never done to them when they were in government. They ordered their own business. The people sitting in this chamber since 1974 and 1975-and there are three or four of them here-know that they always had the right in that period to schedule business in their own order according to their own legislative program. This is another example of this chamber eating more and more into any government rights. It is often said that it is the Executive or the Government eating into the chamber's rights, but there is a balance, those opposite know there is a balance and they know that today they are tipping that balance in a particular way whereby this chamber will lose its relevance. One of the relevant factors of this chamber is still a legislative program. All the other rights are there to speak, divert and waste time, but one of the reasons this chamber still exists-to go back to the founding fathers-is to pass legislation. We seem to have lost our way on that. I think that we have carried three pieces of legislation in six weeks. We have something like 91 Bills of an urgent nature still to come.

         —That is the pathetic point about it. What the honourable senator is virtually indicating to me is that when the present Government goes out of office the Australian Democrats will support us in the same grubby tactic. That is what he is saying. I am asking those opposite to reflect on this suspension of Standing Orders because it is not just a question of one day's opportunism. The question at heart is: Does the Government have the right to consider its own legislative program according to its own timetable? It is something we never sought to prevent when we sat on the other side of the House because it was one of the balances in this chamber. The Opposition had Question Time, Estimates committees, the adjournment, private business and matters of public importance. All those things balanced it off. One of the few things the government had to balance it off was that it was entitled to put its program in its own way.

Little did I realise that the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill would blow out all day, and it did. I do not think anyone in this chamber realistically expected the banking Bill to go through until 10.30 p.m. Had it finished at 9.30 p.m. or 8.30 p.m., I would have moved--

The request came in yesterday; it did not come in late last night or this morning. This is the first time I can remember in my time in the chamber and from my reading of debates back to 1975 that it has been decided to reorder the priorities of the Government's legislative timetable in the Government's time. Plenty of other devices are available to debate matters in this chamber and they are used extensively. The opportunists in the Liberal Party will have a little laugh today, but they have a problem-and I agree with Senator McLean. He put the nail right into it when he said, `Right, they have done that to you today. Don't worry; sometime down the track you will do it back to them'.

I do not really care whether honourable senators opposite take my word for it. A couple of other people here, who are not politically motivated, prepared for me the motion to defer the health matter yesterday and to move on to the electoral Bill.

        I will not waste much more of the time of the chamber. I think a precedent is being set today that people on that side of the chamber may live to regret. I cannot guarantee that they will regret it because I cannot guarantee that people on this side of the chamber will drop to that level, as we believe that there should be a balance in this place between government legislation and the rights of honourable senators.

Senator McLean is saying that the Government behaved badly last week; therefore, they will behave badly today. Welcome to the majors, Senator McLean! Welcome to politics! Apparently Senator McLean knows better than us. He might strut around and say that he is superior to us but, by his own admission today, he is nothing more than a grubby politician like the rest of us. Welcome to the majors, Senator McLean! He talks big about principle but when it comes to delivery it is another matter. Some of us do not pretend; some of us just say that we are practising politicians-living by conventions though, not breaking them. It is interesting that the most principled people in this place are the first to break conventions and, when the opportunity arises, the most conservative defenders of the bastion of the Senate and its procedures are the first to rip them up.

I know that I cannot change the numbers, but I also know absolutely that on this occasion I am right in my attitude in opposing the suspension of Standing Orders. I know that at least on this occasion I am right-and I do not threaten to do the same thing if the other side wins at the next election, because I believe that we need some standards and some principles in this chamber. It is not tit for tat and it will not become a case of tit for tat in which a minority party tries to play off one major party against the other all the time and has the luxury of not having to take responsibility for its actions. The Opposition does have responsibility for its actions long term, and I am very disappointed with its attitude.

          —The Government opposes this motion for the same reason it opposed the suspension of Standing Orders. I am also tempted to oppose it because I do not think we have enough people in the gallery yet. That is the reason why it has been moved. Maybe Senator Puplick would prefer to delay this motion for another half an hour to allow Senator Coulter to rope in all the people who have arrived so that we can have this debate today. That was the only real reason for putting it forward. The galleries are pretty empty at the moment. It is going to be a disappointing debate. Senator Puplick is not going to have an audience, so in his own interests the Government will be opposing this motion.

          —This is not a matter of playing to a gallery in this chamber. It is a matter of a large number of people having come to Canberra who can participate in the democratic process and who have a choice to come into the gallery and be aware of what is going on in this chamber and to participate through interaction with their elected representatives. That is a very different process. Senator Robert Ray attempted to claim a moment ago that it was the Government's prerogative to set the agenda. Standing Orders have specifically allowed the Senate to change the order of procedures and that is exactly what we are seeking to do in this case. It is a process that has been allowed for and I believe that it has been written in specifically so that when the Government behaves in a totally arbitrary and fickle manner, as it has on this particular occasion, the Senate has an overriding right to change that order of business and deal with matters according to its wish. That is what we intend to do.

        In speaking to the motion, I do not wish to canvass any great length the proceedings of the previous debate.

        I open my remarks on the motion by picking up a point made by Senator Ray as he was concluding his speech. It seems now that the gallery is sufficiently full for the opportunistic actions of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to be able to be proceeded with. This signifies the absolute paucity and ineptitude of the Opposition and I hope that all Australians can see their actions today.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government is not about yielding to the sorts of pressure group power that we now see operating in this place. Government is about working for the whole of the community. What was said earlier by the Australian Democrats, when Senator Ray was debating the motion, that we were somehow working in an elevated political plane simply because there were constituents in the gallery, is, I would put it, rubbish. There is a pressure group in the gallery with a particular point of view that it wants to put forcibly on this Government. That pressure group wants to prevail against the interests of the wider community in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want it on the record, up front, right now, that what this Government is not about is yielding to the puny pressure of individual groups that are motivated by self-interest. What this Government is about is governing in the interests of the wider community and taking the responsibility of our mandate on behalf of all Australians. That is what this Government is about and the sorry, sordid excursion into political opportunism in this place does not in any case reflect credit on the Opposition which aspires to being the alternative Government. It enshrines in public understanding the belief that the Opposition, if ever given the reins of government, will take the short term, the expedient and the superficial route. If faced with either the hard option or the soft option, it will take the soft option all the time. There is no better example of this than what we have here today in the chamber. We also had a recent example just the other week when the Opposition's economic policy came out and we saw an attempt to exploit, for purely crass and short term political gain, the economic reform that the Hawke Labor Government has built in this country. I will now turn to the motion rather than the means by which that motion has been brought before this chamber.

        The debate that we are about to have ignores history. In 1981 it was a Liberal-Michael MacKellar-who introduced legislation for there to be an independent arbitration on pharmaceutical fees. It was a Liberal Party initiative. This initiative grew out of a procedure before the Public Accounts Committee because there was widespread public concern about the way in which those fees had been set in the past, the process by which they had been set and the outrageous amount of public money, taxpayers' money, that was being spent in this area. So a prudent measure, which was supported by us in opposition, emanated from the Fraser Government. If this matter goes to a vote, some members of the Opposition will vote against the spirit of the MacKellar Bill when, at the time of its introduction, they voted for it. If that be a definition of hypocrisy, let it be seen to be that. If this motion is not carried, we are asking this chamber to overturn one of the precepts upon which the MacKellar Bill was based-that is, that decisions of an independent tribunal be binding.
       </para>
       <para>
        Back in 1981-and let the Hansard record stand as true testimony to what was said then-that precept was relied on as being the substantial cornerstone precept in the whole proceedings. We, as a Government, have accepted that precept-the Fraser Government precept; the precept originating out of hearings of the Public Accounts Committee and one that we supported at the time. If one is to have an independent inquiry into fees one must accept the independent outcome; otherwise the process is a sham, it can be manipulated by power or pressure groups and it is a shield for political football and sordid political manoeuvre. That point was made then and it remains shiningly true today. But we are now facing the possibility of its being overturned. We, in government, have done nothing more than accept the precepts under which the MacKellar Bill was adopted by this Parliament in 1981. That is all we have done. When we hear the argument, `Why does the Government not overturn the legislation?' we point to the arguments made by Liberals back then and say that if this is done, and those decisions are able to be overridden politically, the argument no longer depends on merit; the argument depends on political power. One cannot make decisions, as the airline pilots in this country know, based on who has the biggest stick; one has to make decisions based on merit and principle.

        As a consequence of the concern expressed by the proper organisations accredited to represent pharmacists, those organisations met the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, and later the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). As a consequence of that round of discussions, the organisations accepted an agreement, as reported, that the determination of the Pharmaceutical Remuneration Benefits Tribunal would stand and that they would look for other areas of negotiation, which they then committed themselves to, to settle their claims. This motion should pass because, in the properly structured negotiations with no less than the Prime Minister of this nation, it was accepted that the determination should stand. That was accepted by the advocates and appointed leaders of the pharmacists themselves. If it does stand, albeit that we have amended it to make it operative from 1 January, not 1 October, proper negotiations can flow. Therefore, it is not now a matter of this chamber deciding whether it should try to work the Government over to help the pharmacists; that is not the issue here. It is not a matter either of believing the pharmacists and not the independent tribunal and wanting the pharmacists to win. The issue that this chamber has to consider is whether there will be a proper process; whether Rafferty's rules or the proper rules will be laid down.

       <para>
        Irrespective of the type of energy being generated by the protest out front and now in the chamber, there is a consideration more fundamental in this motion. It does not matter whether one believes the pharmacists or supports them against the wider community. What matters is that the process to be followed is rational, logical and something that the Opposition, were it in government, would be able to follow also.

The Minister has proposed that there be further negotiations to settle some of the claims. Indeed, he has made offers. What has he received in reply to those offers?

If that is the level at which Senator Cook wishes to conduct this debate, let me remind him of one feature of his Government's record. He comes in here and says, `We are governing for all Australians. We are not yielding to pressure groups. We are here on behalf of the greater community'. The greater community, according to Senator Cook, is Sir Peter Abeles, Mr Rupert Murdoch, the waterfront unions, the four big banks, Kodak International, Alan Bond, Rothwells Ltd and Laurie Connell. That is his definition of what constitutes the greater community. There have been hand-outs to Sir Peter Abeles and Mr Murdoch. It is no wonder that Mr Murdoch comes back to this country and makes comments about the Opposition. After all, if one is here to pick up one's cheque, the very least one can do is say thank you. There was $60m to Kodak; pay-outs to the waterfront unions; $200m to the big banks; and $30m to Mr Bond for his America's Cup defence.

        It is not as if this is an unusual procedure. If one looks back to the days when Senator Lionel Murphy was the Leader of the Opposition, and the government of the day did not have a clear majority, attempts to reorganise the business-take it out of the hands of the Government and put it into the hands of the Opposition-were not infrequent. If Senator Ray wants to know why it was that this reorganisation did not take place during the period that Sir John Carrick was the Leader of the Government and Senator Messner was a Minister, he ought to contemplate the fact that for a very large period of that time it was the Government that actually had the numbers in the chamber and, therefore, was able to ensure that there was not a reorganisation of the business of the chamber.

        This motion by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has two elements. The first disagrees with an amendment made to the National Health Amendment Bill by the Senate on 27 September. The second agrees to a House of Representatives amendment which changes the commencement date of the increase in the maximum patient contribution from $11 to $12. That was originally scheduled to take place on 1 October. It had to be changed because of the passage of the amendment to the Bill and the Government is now seeking to have that amendment apply as of 1 January. The Opposition asks for this motion to be taken in two parts. We do not disagree with House of Representatives amendment No. 1, which relates to the change of the commencement date, and we are prepared to support the Government in agreeing to that amendment. But we will insist on the Senate amendment and, therefore, vote against that part of the Minister's motion which asks the Committee not to persist with its amendment.

        What is the Senate's amendment? The amendment is quite simply to strike down, in legislative form, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) determination of 28 August. The Opposition believes that that determination is flawed, is wrong and should not be allowed to stand. Because it cannot be disallowed by any means other than the passage of legislation through both Houses of the Parliament we now invite the Senate to join with the Opposition in striking down that determination of 28 August.

        A couple of points need to be made about this. The first is that, in essence, the Government is seeking to transfer the responsibility for its own incapacity to maintain the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) on to the shoulders of the pharmacists of Australia. The Government has failed fundamentally to address the underlying issues in the pharmaceutical scheme. It has failed to respond to the fact that there is a blow-out in costs. That blow-out in costs could well have been anticipated. The largest component of that blow-out in costs results from a change in the Australian population. The fact is that in 1986-87, 59.3 per cent of the payments made under the scheme were made to pensioners, a figure of $514m. By 1988-89 that had risen to 70.2 per cent, and a figure of $797m. That increase was clearly capable of being anticipated as the population aged.
       </para>
       <para>
        What steps has the Government put in place to come to some understanding and accommodation of that problem? For example, has it looked at the items that are covered by the scheme? When the scheme was originally introduced by the Menzies Government in the early 1950s it was a safety net to allow people access to life-saving drugs. At the moment, there are things such as analgesics, eye drops and antacids on the list which may, or may not, be appropriate to be maintained on the list in terms of what really are life saving drugs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1986 the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) reported on the whole operation of the scheme. None of the major recommendations of the IAC report was picked up and acted upon by the Government. The Government has had before it the dimensions of the problem, the financial consequences of leaving the system unaltered, the recommendations of the IAC report and, indeed, a number of other reports with which I will not deal today. It has not sought fundamentally to restructure the scheme in a way which will address the budgetary implications which it says are its primary concern. Instead, it has decided to make individual pharmacists the scapegoat for its own incompetent behaviour.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has penalised them as it has penalised almost no other section in the community. In September 1987 it moved to reduce the wholesale margin from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Under its new arrangements it is now moving to make further changes to abolish mark-ups in most areas and wind back and reduce the remuneration paid to pharmacists, and that much is admitted all round. There is absolutely no doubt that pharmacists are to have their remuneration cut. For example, the statement issued on 22 October by Dr Blewett talks about the new flat rate mark-up of an average of 53 per cent. That particular mark-up is most misleading. Dr Blewett admits that there will be a cut to the remuneration of the pharmacists from the introduction of the new scheme which he describes as, at most, `only a third of the amount in question'-that is, from $1.05 to 35c.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us remember what has happened to the patient contribution. When this Government came into office the maximum patient contribution for pharmaceutical products was $4. This Bill will now take it to $12. In other words, under the way in which this Government has conducted the pharmaceutical remuneration scheme and the PBS scheme as a whole, since 1983 the Government has managed to raise the maximum patient contribution from $4 to $12. The Government is still not content with believing that it should do anything other than adopt this purely confrontationist attitude with a group of skilled and dedicated professionals in the community. The Government has ended any attempt, any pretence, that it governs by consensus. The Prime Minister has decided to abuse pharmacists in exactly the same way as he abuses pilots or anybody else who will not become part and parcel of whatever temporary deal he wishes to stitch up at any particular moment in order to prop up his Government and to prop up the arrangements which he wishes to put into place.

        I propose to take a little more time on this matter because one of the issues I want to raise is this question of campaigns. Senator Cook proclaims himself an expert campaigner. I do not know who precisely was responsible for the publication of this pamphlet The truth and nothing but the truth about the cost and supply of prescription medicine. There has never been a document of such a tendentious nature as this. The Government has entered into a campaign with advertisements in the newspapers. If people had phoned the hot line numbers that appeared in the advertisements they would have got absolutely no assistance from whoever was on the other end of the hot line. They did not know anything. Perhaps it was that they did not know anything or perhaps it was that they were not prepared to be part of the lies and misinformation which the Government has sought to put out in relation to this particular pamphlet. I propose to go through some of the assertions in this pamphlet. I shall certainly be seeking the assistance of my colleague in a moment to intervene to allow me to continue. Let me look at a couple of those--

         —I refer to the first assertion that the PBRT decision represented only a 23 per cent cut in pharmacy incomes. Only a 23 per cent cut-is that not a wonderful idea? That 23 per cent cut was in gross payments which directly equates to a 60 per cent cut in net profits for most people in this industry. The Government then asserted that there was an average subsidy-note that word `subsidy'-that the Government provides to each pharmacy of over $100,000 a year. It is not a subsidy. It is, in fact, a payment the pharmacies are entitled to for rendering a service on behalf of the Government to people in the community as people who are, themselves, primary health care providers and whose role as such is integral and important to the maintenance of public health in this country.

       <para>
        The pamphlet then goes on to make assertions about over $1 billion being paid out under the scheme. That may be correct but of that $1 billion it ought to be remembered that only about 16 per cent was given by way of an increase to pharmacists. The 89 per cent-the blow-out in most of the rest of the area-represents increased payments to manufacturers. That is not stated. That is not indicated in the pamphlet. That is misleading. The Government asserts that it is committed to ensure that Australians, no matter where they live, continue to have access to pharmacists. Yet, quite clearly, pursuit of the PBRT determination will lead to a significant reduction in the number of viable pharmacies and the access that people will have to pharmacists around the country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The pamphlet then goes on to describe the PBRT report as having been concluded after an extensive study, including 600 submissions. There may have been 600 submissions but people will know from the debates that we have had about pharmacy in this place for some considerable time that the response to the questionnaire upon which the PBRT based most of its determination was absolutely derisory and simply could not sustain the conclusions to which the PBRT came in its ultimate decision. The Government then asserts that the pharmacists will not accept the umpire's decision. Let the Minister, who is responsible as a member of a Government for the rort of the postage allowances and for fiddling with the Remuneration Tribunal's determination for cheap political purposes whenever it suits the Government's convenience, get up in here and talk about adhering to the decision of the umpire. One thing that this Government cannot claim is to adhere to the decisions of the umpire. In exactly the same way as with the pilots, the Government will not even let the umpire pronounce on the matter.

         —One almost sympathises with the Minister who does not even have the good grace to get done over nicely. The next point to which I wish to move is the assertion about the escalating costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by the Government. The Government implies that this is caused by the pharmacists' earnings. The Government takes into account in the gross earnings of pharmacists all of the other activities which pharmacists have been pushed into. They have been pushed into a lot of them because of the pressures that the Government has put on the pharmaceutical side of their business. The activities are lumped in together. The Government talks about gross incomes in a way which is absolutely dishonest. Finally, the Government makes comments that pharmacists are needlessly alarming the public. The Government means not that the pharmacists are alarming the public but that the pharmacists are alarming nervous Government backbenchers. That is what the Government means. After all, in today's Sydney Morning Herald one sees the heading `MPs to tackle PM over pharmacy row'. The little coterie-on this occasion Mr Lee, Mr Cleeland and Mr Edwards-are off to see the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to tell him how nervous they are about this particular matter. Honourable senators will remember Mr Lee and Mr Edwards on the last occasion were with Mr Snow, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, putting out statements telling everybody, `Do not worry about these pharmacy problems. We are going to see the Prime Minister and we will fix these things up'. That is what they were telling the public. They were going to see the Prime Minister. They were going to sort out Mr Staples. They were going to sort out Dr Blewett. They were going to look after the pharmacists. Well, they got short shrift after the Prime Minister had had a little think about the matter.

       <para>
        That is what a Labor backbencher thinks of his Minister-putting out absurdities. One of the absurdities that Senator Cook has been putting out today is this business that pharmacists are misusing their position, that they are frightening people in the community and that the sick, the elderly and the unwell are unsure and uncertain. Of course people are unsure and uncertain. They understand that this Government is determined to pursue a war against the pharmacists and against the people who practise the profession of pharmacy because it is unable and unwilling to tackle the structural and underlying problems which exist within the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as it operates at the moment. We have all this backing and filling as far as the Government is concerned.

        Honourable senators will recall that there was an announcement some weeks ago that the Government was going to defer all of this. In fact, there was some light at the end of the tunnel at the end of September when the negotiations between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild took place. But why was there a discussion between the Guild and the Government? On the very day that the Opposition parties in this chamber introduced an amendment to the National Health Amendment Bill to strike down the 28 August determination, the Government suddenly rang the Guild and said, `Please come and have a talk to us'. It knew that the Senate was not going to cop it sweet as far as its attack upon the pharmacists was concerned. So there was a meeting between the Guild and the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister indicated that there would be scope for delay, that the system would not come into place until 1 November. Indeed, on 4 October the Prime Minister told Federal Caucus that there would be scope for both parties to approach the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal after the November deadline if the dispute was not settled. The prospect that there would be some resolution was held out by the Prime Minister. However, we then find that within a few days of that the Prime Minister decided to beat his chest and to put the pharmacists in the same category as the pilots by saying, `No negotiations, no compromise'.
       </para>
       <para>
        One suspects that the Prime Minister simply misread his brief that morning which said, `Get out there and kick pilots'. He misread it and went out and kicked pharmacists. Having fallen into that signal error, he said that there will be no compromise, that he is not going to be pushed around and that Mr Staples, who has the great advantage of having failed first year pharmacy, is going to go out there and fix them all up. All of a sudden we will find that there is going to be no attempt to negotiate and deal with this matter in a civilised and proper fashion.
       </para>
       <para>
        People have been sent out to undertake a government-funded survey-a secret survey which attempts to portray pharmacists in a poor light by saying that there is overcharging. If one reads the details of what is supposed to be in that survey, one can see that it quite simply says, `Where a prescription drug is on the maximum patient contribution, that is charged in 93 per cent of cases. Where the patient contribution is less than the maximum, a large number of pharmacists charge the maximum price available'. This is the sort of behaviour in the marketplace that anybody would understand and nobody would be surprised at because it is taking place at the very time that the Government is otherwise attempting to reduce the incomes of pharmacists and cut the remuneration which is available to them. The Government is not going to get away with that shabby trick either. I conclude by putting squarely--

So I suggest that Senator Cook sit quietly because we can go as long as we like on this matter. I want to talk about the services currently being provided by pharmacists which we regard as absolutely critical and central as far as the public health system of this country is concerned. Pharmacists provide a first stop for a lot of people who want to make inquiries about preventive health care. This country is sadly negligent and deficient in the investment which goes into preventive medicine. Indeed, the huge report which just came down from the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) entitled Profile of Australian Science mentions Australian strengths and weaknesses in basic research. It says:

        Areas of relative weakness include preventative and community medicine . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        At a time when ASTEC has identified one of our research weaknesses and preventive and community medical services are being provided through community-based pharmacists, the Government is attacking pharmacists with vigour. Pharmacists provide the service of the actual pharmacy dispensary. They are often involved in the delivery of services outside their pharmacies to people who are sick or housebound. Undoubtedly, they do a great deal in terms of providing other than pharmaceutical prescriptions. Very often pharmacists provide first aid services. They provide free health care advice and after hours services. They also provide advice about the correct use of drugs-something which the Government has refused to acknowledge or pay for. Pharmacists are part of the general community health and education service. Above all, they are people who, by and large, practise as dedicated health workers and community professionals.

        It is an absolute disgrace that the Government, hiding behind the device of the Tribunal, seeks to make an assault upon the pharmacists' position in the community. It abuses them in personal terms and it assaults their income and their financial viability. It does so quite simply because it is not prepared to address the fundamental underlying problems of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which it has had 6 1/4 years to address and has manifestly failed to do so. For those reasons, the Opposition parties will insist upon the Senate amendment striking down the 28 August Tribunal determination. The Opposition has insisted that the matter be dealt with today because it is appropriate that it should be. Last week and, indeed, as late as yesterday, the Government indicated that it would deal with this matter today. The reason that it has pulled it off the Notice Paper today has more to do with its political fears and judgments than with our political judgment. The Government did not want to debate this matter today. The Senate has said that that grubby, political trick will not be allowed to pass, that the issue can be determined today. It does not have to be delayed further and it will not be delayed further. It will be dealt with today and the proper position of pharmacists in the Australian community will be protected by the Opposition in this Senate even at the same time as the pharmacists are the subject of abuse, vilification and attack by a failed and incompetent Government.

That is what lies at the core of this debate today.

        It is simply untrue that the Government has accepted the recommendations and reports of other independent bodies. Indeed, in 1986, dealing with this particular industry, the Industries Assistance Commission recommended, firstly, that wholesale and retail margins not be regulated; secondly, that pharmacists be able to vary their margin according to market forces; and, thirdly, that pharmacists be free to advertise their prices. The Government accepted none of these recommendations. It is certainly well within the competence, the rights and the historical experience of this Government to reject totally recommendations from independent tribunals when it believes that those tribunals have simply got it wrong or have reported in ways which are unacceptable to the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next point that needs to be made is that, while the Government, through Minister Staples, has held out to pharmacists a period of negotiation, it is absolutely clear that there has not been good faith on the part of the Government. The Government has made it clear that it is not prepared to negotiate the terms of the Tribunal's determination. Frankly, I do not know how one can engage in a Clayton's negotiation-a negotiation while not really negotiating. It is not surprising in the light of that predetermined position by the Minister that the so-called negotiations have been remarkably unfruitful because clearly the Government was not prepared to change. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) has said that the Government was seeking to work around the determination; in other words, to try to pick up in these negotiations aspects which were not covered by the Tribunal. How arbitrary it is to accept the core of a tribunal's determination and then try to find things on the fringes around which one can work and negotiate. If that process becomes necessary-a necessity accepted by the Government because it is one evidently entered into by the Government-it becomes equally obvious that the Tribunal's determination in the first place was wrong and therefore should have been changed.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we pointed out when we debated this matter in the committee stage the last time it was before us, the Government should have accepted the amendment which was put by the Opposition and supported by the Australian Democrats, which was to reject the Remuneration Tribunal's determination. That would have cleared the decks and the Government could have gone into proper negotiation with all matters open and come up with a properly considered position.
       </para>
       <para>
        Beyond that point we are substantially going over ground which has been debated in the previous debate on this matter. Since then we have seen an excellent report from the Legislative Research Service, by John Gardiner-Garden from the education and welfare group, on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the pharmaceutical industry. A number of the points made in that report underline and amplify points which were made in the earlier debate. It is absolutely clear-it was clear then and it is even clearer now-that the increasing cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) is not due to and cannot be controlled in any way by pharmacists. The increasing cost of the PBS is due to the change in the nature and the number of prescriptions which are written and those matters are under the control of the doctors. The pharmacists have no control in those matters whatsoever. The report goes to some lengths to point out that the costs of pharmaceuticals in Australia in relation to their costs overseas are extremely low; indeed, even the prescription cost to the patient as a percentage of average weekly earnings is very low by comparison with other countries. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The average price of an Australian prescription has dropped from 6.6% of average weekly earnings in 1955 to around 2% in 1989 (compared with 4.2% in the UK and 4.3% in the US).
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, even the cost of a prescription on average is less than half what it is in the United Kingdom or in the United States. That refers to the cost of PBS drugs, in terms of both the Government contribution and the patient contribution. The costs of drugs have increased and prescribing habits have changed. We have certainly moved from the use of cheaper drugs in particular treatments to more expensive drugs-a matter again not controlled by the pharmacists but one which is within the control of doctors and their prescribing habits.
       </para>
       <para>
        As long ago as September 1988 I called for a complete review of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to look at the efficacy of these drugs compared with the efficacy of drugs which they have replaced but, more importantly, compared with the efficacy of preventative measures and other measures which may avoid totally the use of the more expensive treatments. The report from the Legislative Research Service deals with a very interesting example of this change in prescribing habits and its effect on the cost to the PBS. In dealing with the two groups of drugs, the anti-hypertensives and the anti-hyperlipidaemics the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1988-89 Antihypertensives cost the Government $127m and the Anti Hyperlipidaemics $26m (about 14% of the total bill), including patient contributions of $12.3m and $3m respectively (about 9% of total patient contributions). The Ace Inhibitors Captoprit and Enalapril Maleate cost $42.1m (including patient contribution . . . so in 1989-90 these two Anti-hypertensives alone, although on the Authority list, cost the community nearly $100m, a significant proportion of that year's total PBS budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is certainly a very significant proportion for two drugs only. The report continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        For all this expense, the benefits of Anti-hypertensives and Anti Hyperlipidaemics are disputed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if one were to accept the benefits which flow from those drugs, clearly when one is looking at such a large percentage of total PBS costs and at a substantial increase as a consequence of the move to the use of these drugs, one needs also to look at the benefits. The report continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        More cost-effective way of reducing the risk of heart disease include discouraging smoking, promoting reduced salt and fat intake and encouraging the maintenance of physical fitness.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was precisely the point that I was making in September 1988 when I called for a thorough review of the PBS in the context of alternative modalities of treatment which did not involve the use of drugs. We may well find that the costs of the PBS could be substantially reduced and the numbers of prescriptions for the more expensive drugs reduced if we engaged in far more effective preventative health care. As Senator Puplick has already pointed out, the recent Australian Science and Technology Council report draws attention to the poor showing of Australia in respect of research and the application of that research.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Legislative Research Service paper goes on to point out that there are difficulties facing the Parliament and any government in looking at cost effectiveness in these other areas. It states that, while the cost of drugs can be located precisely in government budgets, the cost of a thorough preventative health strategy would be spread through numerous portfolios and that the Government presently spends only $45m on health promotion and disease prevention. When one looks at that $100m in the area of anti-hypertensives and anti-hyperlipidaemics, the cost of $45m for preventative health care is seen to be relatively small. One might reasonably presage the results of a thorough review and suggest that they would indicate that the cost could be reduced through that mechanism.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, this function has been entered into by pharmacists at no cost to the Government. In recent times pharmacists have been preparing a number of excellent, brief pamphlets, which they are making available to patients, on such things as diet, salt intake, sugar in the diet and exercise. Those pamphlets have been made available to their clients at no cost either to the client or to the Government. They have entered into this function because they see it as desirable. It is a function which could well be picked up and supported by government, but at this stage the Government seems far more intent on reducing the cost to the PBS merely by quite arbitrarily and wrongly attempting to take the costs from the hides of pharmacists around Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Puplick also mentioned that part of the increase in costs was due to the increased age of the population. The report to which I have been referring also mentions that fact, although it draws attention to the fact that that part of the increase is not substantial. Whilst we have an ageing population, we also have a smaller number of young people entering their earlier years of life, and the costs to government of all the services provided to those young people between the ages of 0 and 15 are less than the costs of providing services to the elderly. Of course, the Government is making substantial savings in those areas, particularly in the area of education, and I think that needs to be borne in mind. The facts show that, over the next 30 years, the dependency ratio in Australia-that is, the ratio between the numbers of people working, earning and paying taxes and those who are dependent upon them-will be lower than at any time since 1947. So the Government cannot hide behind the claim that the ageing of the population is a major factor in pushing up the PBS. In the few seconds left to me I again return to the point that the pharmaceutical benefits--

        The trouble that this Government has with democracy is that the people seem to get in the way. So what does it do? It puts up its own argument that it wants to abide by the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. Let us take a look at the Tribunal, headed by one Mr Riordan. He is well known to us in New South Wales; he used to be the Australian Labor Party member for Phillip. When he lost the election and Jack Birney became the member, the then accommodating New South Wales Labor Government, under Neville Wran, picked him up and Paul Landa appointed him as head of the State Electricity Commission. Its costs then blew out in unmitigated proportions and it has saddled New South Wales with debt ever since. Mr Riordan was accepted for another Labor Party appointment at the Federal level. Now we finally have him as Chairman of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. And we are told that we have to listen to what he has to say because it is fair and reasonable.

         —Of course, it was Mr Riordan who, as Chairman of the Tribunal, made a decision to reduce the fee paid to pharmacists by 10c in February this year. Then the Federal Court chose to say that the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have exercised that power. That is exactly the sort of tribunal we have. The Government likes to say, in a high-minded manner, that the underlying principles for the administration of and access to drugs by the Australian community are to enable a public subsidisation of the delivery of the most reliable and modern pharmaceuticals at affordable prices with maximum assistance going to those in greatest need and that those principles, which have been in effect for 40 years, are just as sound now as they were when they were first instituted. But what has happened is that the cost of administering the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) has gone up simply because the cost of new drugs has gone up and this Government is trying to make the pharmacists wear the cutbacks.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is well known in this country that, during that 40-year period, the PBS has delivered to the Australian people cheaper drugs than can be obtained in the rest of the world. Indeed, in one way, the purchasing policy of the PBS, which determines the cost of drugs in this country, prevents the pharmaceutical industry in Australia from becoming an export competing industry because of the manner in which international prices are set. But the cost of the delivery of pharmaceuticals and devices to the ordinary Australian consumer is about to be increased again as the therapeutic goods Bill will soon be introduced into this chamber. The therapeutic goods Bill will impose upon both the pharmaceutical industry and the devices industry a further impost whereby they will be required to pay a set fee, to be set by regulations, which fee is to be a cost recovery exercise, which some people say amounts to a tax. No doubt it will be subject to a challenge, but it will be an additional impost which will be borne by the pharmaceutical companies, and such cost will undoubtedly be passed on to the consumer.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present we have a system whereby the Government determines the cost of the drugs. It allows the wholesalers a mark-up, which used to be 15 per cent but which is now 10 per cent, and the Government determines that it is stuck at 10 per cent. The wholesalers are allowed to make up that 5 per cent that has been cut back by Government action by putting a surcharge on to the wholesale cost to the individual pharmacists if the pharmacists do not choose to buy the product in what one might describe as job lots or in the manner in which the manufacturer supplies the commodity to the wholesaler. But the Government does not allow the individual pharmacist the same right to surcharge where he or she cannot recover any additional handling charges that may be incurred simply because the Government has the power to arbitrarily say, `This is what you are permitted to do and this is what you are not permitted to do'.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, on top of that, the Government now says to the pharmacists, `No longer will we recognise your professional skills and your ability to counsel and to give advice outside the actual dispensing of pills and potions; no longer will you be paid a professional fee of $2.64. Instead, we will merge the professional fee and the handling fee, which was hitherto 25 per cent of the given list price-the given list price not including the surcharge which may be payable on drugs which chemists choose to order in smaller amounts than the manufacturers' package of 10 or a dozen'. So the net result is a downgrading of the pharmacists' skills and professional recognition. It is a downgrading of the fee they are paid to handle stock that they keep and maintain at cost to themselves in this climate of high interest rates-which has been deliberately brought about by actions of this Government. Small business men and women in Australia are now having to meet interest rates of 25 per cent. That is the level of interest rates that Mr Keating said at the Metal Trades Industry Association dinner the other night might come about some day. But people are paying that now. With chemists having to meet that sort of interest bill, and with the Government at the same time saying that they may not in any way seek to alleviate those imposts by having a surcharge and that it will cut back the handling fee that it arbitrarily said that they may have, we find that they are being squeezed at both ends.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clearly a deliberate policy, firstly, to make pharmacists wear the blame for the increasing cost of the PBS and, secondly, implement a policy which will simply force many of them out of business. The Government's policy is simply to say to pharmacists that with the same amount of money and more work they may be able to keep body and soul together. The Government is entering into a scaremongering campaign, trying to frighten people into believing that they will be unable to have drugs that they would ordinarily expect the chemist to dispense, yet it is the Government's own policy that is forcing this plight on Australian citizens. How on earth can the Government expect chemists, who probably have a mortgage on the premises where the business is conducted or, alternatively, pay high rental, to maintain expensive and costly stock lists and pay interest rates of 25 per cent?
       </para>
       <para>
        No consideration is given by the Government to the economic plight it has brought about overall, yet it is singling out pharmacists to wear the heat and the blame. Is it any surprise that thousands of them have bothered to congregate here to try to have their will heard by the government of the day? The reality is that the government of the next day, the coalition government, will listen to what they have to say. The Government's rendition will be given when the next election is held, judgment made about its competence and it is voted out of office.

But, for the benefit of people listening to this debate, it might be a good idea to get back to the point that the Opposition intends to oppose the message that has come back to us from the House of Representatives, which opposition would in effect mean that the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal of 28 August 1989, and made under section 98b of the principal Act, is and shall be of no force or effect. This would in effect overturn and ignore the finding of the Tribunal made in August which happened, of course, at the end of a long period of negotiation and attempted negotiation between the Government and representatives of the pharmacists. Despite what has been said this morning by the Opposition and implied by the Australian Democrats, there is a great deal of room for movement in every aspect of what is a very wide ranging dispute between the Government and the pharmacists.

        The one issue which the Government considers is not negotiable is the decision of the Tribunal. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) who represents the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) in this place has put the case very clearly, very succinctly and very accurately. It is just extraordinary that so many people are not prepared to accept that what an independent tribunal determines legally, with complete force of law, must be accepted by the Government and by the community. If there are arguments about the way in which it is made, about the basis of the information on which it is made, about the points of law in the course of its determination, it is open to appeal in the courts. But it certainly is not open to the Government or anybody else to say, `We do not like this very much; let's ignore it'. For the Opposition to expect that course of events is extraordinary and indicates, as has been very carefully explained already this morning, the Opposition's current attitude. The Tribunal was of the Opposition's design and its activities over the years have been open to question but have been accepted. I understand that on this occasion the decision has been appealed, but it is just extraordinary to assume that this decision could be overturned simply by a decision of this place.

        I would like to follow through a little further the point that I was making earlier about there being considerable room for negotiation on a lot of issues. When we debated this matter previously there was the question of essential pharmacies, the issue of a surcharge and the issue of professional recognition. These matters, I understand, are being dealt with by the expert group and there is considerable agreement on how they should be dealt with. The Government is seriously considering a suggestion from this group that the $41m which is available to pharmacists-if they can come to an agreement about how this should be dealt with, excluding any change to the Tribunal's decision-be invested in a trust fund to be administered by a widely representative group of people, including consumers and pharmacists. It seems to me that there is an enormous amount of good sense and goodwill within that range of issues and that they probably can be dealt with fairly expeditiously.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many pharmacists believe that the only way to deal with this dispute is to terrify elderly people who are dependent upon the PBS for their drugs. To put it mildly, they are dishonestly implying that this Government is intent on closing every pharmacy in this nation. What has happened to the supply of pharmacies around the nation over the last few years? I am not looking here at government figures. I am looking at data provided from the Guild and published in the Guild Digest of 1989. Here we see that between 1977 and 1983 the number of pharmacies in Australia remained fairly constant. It fluctuated between about 5,400 and 5,425, a very small fluctuation. Some were coming and going during that time. The total number remained very much the same. Between 1983 and 1989 there was an increase from 5,400 to 5,625. That is, 225 new pharmacies have established themselves during those recent six years as against a drop of 25 in the previous six years. One can only assume from that that, although we are told that theirs is a highly competitive industry, pharmacists on the whole are doing very nicely-a point that has been picked up by everyone with the perspicacity of the pensioners, who take an intelligent interest in this. Once again, the Guild's own figures suggest that this may well be the case.

        During the seven years from 1976 to 1983 average pharmacy profits ranged from a little over $30,000 a year to about $42,500 a year. The range in the six years since then has been quite extraordinary: it has gone from $42,500 to very close to $80,000 a year. No-one can tell me that this is an industry that is on the bones of its shoes, or whatever. I am looking for a delicate way of expressing it. I am getting my metaphors very mixed.

        In the last half hour I saw Senator Michael Baume with a retinue of about 30 or 40 women carrying placards. I assume that they are pharmacists or pharmacy assistants. I and other women in the parliamentary Caucus have received quite a number of letters from women who work in or own pharmacies. They are making the point very strongly that this is an industry which is heavily populated by women. That sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Pharmacy sounds like a good occupation for a woman who is looking for a career, though I would not say quite the same for the shop assistants. One of the things that they fail to recognise is that they work in the retail industry, where on average there is a 30 per cent turnover accounted for by their pharmaceutical benefits. I do not think that they can expect to be continually subsidised in the way they perhaps have been over the last few years with burgeoning profits on their prescriptions.

        I do not think that gender is a point here. I am very happy for the women who have entered the work force, whether by getting themselves degrees or diplomas or by gaining positions as shop assistants, cosmetic advisers or people who fit shoes or sell the enormous range of goods that we find in pharmacies these days. But I do not think there is any reason why the women who are so employed can make any arguments other than those which would apply to the retail trade in general and to the degree of competitiveness that applies to the retail trade. I do not think that they have a case by invoking matters of equal opportunity. I think that their opportunities are there, and I wish them well.

        This has become a pretty fraught sort of a dispute in many respects. Every pharmacist I have ever dealt with has been an efficient and caring person. Pharmacists are not accustomed to industrial disputes or to operating in the political field. They all recognise, too, that their leadership has not been providing them with value for money, certainly over the recent months of this dispute. I come back to the point that we simply cannot accept that a legally constituted tribunal making a totally justifiable decision, in the Tribunal's eyes, should have that decision overturned by this or any other government.

         —I will not detract from my statement one iota. Let us look at some of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's decisions that have been rejected by the Government. There is nothing to say that a government has to accept the recommendations in a Senate committee report, an Industries Assistance Commission report or a tribunal report. Governments regularly do not if they do not believe in what a tribunal states and if the recommendations are not in the best interests of the Australian public as a whole.

        I say unequivocally that the decision of this Tribunal is not in the best interests of the chemists or of the Australian people. There has never before been such a sustained attack as the one on the chemists of this nation. There has been a sustained attack against them since January 1988 and it has continued to this day. Firstly, the wholesale margins were lowered from 15 to 10 per cent. Then the number of items and prescriptions was doubled. In August 1988 the pharmaceutical benefits hit list was established and it was abandoned later that year. On 28 August 1989 the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal reduced remuneration by $1.05 per item and abolished the mark-up. The latest attack is to reduce the mark-up from 25 per cent.

       <para>
        I ask members of the Australian Labor Party who have ever been in business-and there would be very few of them, if any-how they expect a trader to buy an item in at, say, $1 and sell it for $1. The chemist buys it in, warehouses it, borrows money and pays interest on it to meet the cost of the purchase of the item and then has to sell it at the same price. Anyone who tries to tell me the business rationale behind that does not understand business and I do not believe that such a person would be taking the matter seriously.

        What we are all about today is the socialisation of Australia's pharmacies. That is what it is all about. If a person cannot live under the Australian Council of Trade Unions agreement and cannot agree with the ACTU, the Government does not want to know about him. Unless a person gets under the ACTU umbrella, he is finished as far as the Government is concerned. This is a typical Labor Party ploy to hurt small business. An election will soon be held in Queensland and the Australian Labor Party in Queensland is saying that it is at odds with the Federal Government. The Courier-Mail reported:

        The ALP has conducted polls and found that the pharmacists in Australia have great credibility. People actually like them. So the ALP set out on a determined plan to discredit the pharmacists and to reduce their standing. The pharmacists who have become used to looking after little old ladies and weighing babies have had to get into a dirty, grubby fight with all of the union hacks who are used to stabbing each other in the back on their way up.

In addition, it ran a quarter page advertisement in the Australian at taxpayers' expense claiming that the chemists are misleading the public.

        These are the points that must be made in this debate. The Government is running away from the debate. This motion was listed on the business paper for discussion today and when the Government saw that a number of people were coming here, it tried to squib out of it. The Government was not prepared to face the people; so it wanted to remove this matter from the business paper today.

       <para>
        The meeting was held after the Guild advised the Prime Minister that while it accepted the fact of the Tribunal decision and the integrity of the budget it required Government to redress remuneration in other ways to ensure a satisfactory level of remuneration for community pharmacy.

       <para>
        Then the Government flaunts that in front of the pharmacists and says, `You agreed'. If any honourable senator can establish from that press release that an agreement was made, he is a better man than I am. There was never any agreement. What was referred to was the agreement that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) claimed that he made with the pharmacists. There was never any agreement made with the pharmacists and the Government reneged on its decision to postpone the actual reduction of the mark-up by a month.

        I was advised only the other day that Tasmanian pharmacists are running a very good commercial in Tasmania. It is absolutely correct. It shows a pharmacist shutting his shop at 5 o'clock at night. A lady comes along wanting assistance. The chemist sits her down and tries to help her. The next picture shows the Prime Minister talking to a pensioner and saying, `You silly old bugger'. That is what it is all about. That is what this Government thinks of the pensioners of Australia. Then it tries to discredit the pharmacists and remove their credibility by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on pamphlets and advertising in national magazines. That is absolutely disgraceful.

        The pharmacists today are facing an average loss of up to $27,000 each. Many pharmacists will not be able to sustain that loss of revenue. Very few pharmacists will be able to keep their doors open. Probably one-third of Australian pharmacies will go out of business. In Queensland, 82 towns and communities have only one pharmacy and many of them will be placed at risk. The Government does not seem to care about that. It comes up with some half baked idea on how it will be able to sustain pharmacies in one town, but it will be an arbitrary decision; it will depend on the good wishes of the Government. When that happens, many towns will be left without a pharmacy.

        All businesses in Australia have the right to mark up the price of a product. The Government does not understand the basics of business. It is impossible to buy a product and then sell it at the same price. Many pharmacists carry stock worth around $70,000 to $80,000. They then have to pay interest rates of 23 per cent to 25 per cent, again inflicted on them by this uncaring Government, which says it knows what small business is all about. It is impossible to survive with a revenue loss of $27,000 and then have to pay interest rates of 23 per cent to 25 per cent. It just cannot be done. Yet no-one in the Government has addressed that problem.

        The Government will send more small businesses to the wall. In the year in which the Liberal-National Party Government left office, 1982-83, there were 6,035 small business bankruptcies. Three year later, in 1987-88, bankruptcies had gone up by one-third. That is this Government's sorry record-a one-third increase in bankruptcies. Senator Richardson has been attempting to interject. I will not be diverted. The Government's decision on pharmacies will increase last year's figure of 9,421 bankruptcies. That is the record the Government says it is proud of.

       <para>
        The brochure put out by the Labor Party entitled The Truth and Nothing but the Truth about the Cost and Supply of Prescription Medicines is absolutely disgraceful, dishonest and misleading. It is designed to remove the pharmacists' credibility. As the pharmacists know, and as the Government's research has proved, the pharmacists have a high credibility level. The Government's research shows that, for it to win this argument, it has to indulge in some grubby little scheme and get out there and spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars on a carefully orchestrated move to discredit the pharmacists. The Government is not succeeding; it is not winning. In three months time, or whenever the Government decides to call a Federal election, not only the pharmacists but the whole small business community will be in full attack because they know that what the Government is doing to the pharmacists is a forerunner of what it will do to the small business community-that is, the ones that have survived six years of the Government's shocking mismanagement.

Since that time we have had a lot of heat and probably very little light in the debate. People do not seem to understand the nature of the industry and how it works. If one thinks about it in relatively simple terms, one realises that it is the doctors who prescribe the drugs. The amount of money spent on medication is primarily determined by doctors, not by pharmacists. To attempt to come in at that end to save money, as the Government is attempting to do, is really to misunderstand the procedures that have over a very long time been developed in the pharmacy industry.

         —The honourable senator asks how many. It is important to look at where we are in world terms. Let us compare ourselves to the United States of America and Britain to see how prescription prices compare to average weekly wages. That is a reasonable comparison. We like to compare ourselves to those types of countries. In Australia, prescription prices as a percentage of average weekly earnings are 1.8; in the United States they are 4.3; and in Britain they are 4.2. Our pharmacies in world terms are highly efficient and are doing very well on very little. They are providing a tremendous service for a much lower remuneration than their counterparts in other countries. Indeed, in Australia in 1955 the figure was 6.6 per cent; we are now down to 1.8 per cent. So before we start denigrating an entire industry, as is happening in this debate, we should see precisely what the industry is doing and how it is providing a service to the community.

        There has been some talk about the need for rationalisation. Probably in any industry there is need for rationalisation over time. I certainly accept that. But, indeed, as honourable senators know-or hopefully know if they have paid attention to the range of debates we have had in this country when we have restructured industries-we have not attempted to restructure industries by driving people into bankruptcy. We have sought to restructure industry in such a way that small businessmen could leave that industry with their assets intact so that they could start up again.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, the structure that the Government is attempting to impose on pharmacies with this draconian legislation will target the older pharmacies. The stability of ownership of pharmacies in this country is quite remarkable. What we are doing-probably unbeknown to people in the bureaucracy, who do not seem to understand the way the system has been structured over a number of years-is targeting the pharmacies that have been in existence for 30 to 40 years. They are the inner city pharmacies, which have tended to be in locations not accessible to cars because they are not able to pull up outside the pharmacies. Newer pharmacies have tended to locate themselves in places such as major shopping centres and the like where there is parking. Older pharmacies have not done this, and they will be the first to go to the wall. It is those pharmacists, often over the age of 50 and with their entire life savings in those pharmacies, who in reality are the people who will be hurt. It is not just a conglomerate out there; it is not just a pharmacy industry; it is people's lives and the people who will be hurt are the people who have given marvellous service to this community over many years. They are the pharmacies that will first go to the wall; not the ones in convenient locations and at better access points.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very difficult to know where to start in this exercise because there have been so many distortions. The 25 per cent mark-up is not a 25 per cent mark-up; it is probably more like a 20 per cent mark-up. The reason for that is that the shelf pack discount that is sometimes waved at by the Government and certainly by the Minister, as though it applies to every item, does not apply to every item. Indeed, I will give an example. There are a number of gels of which the average stock for a pharmacist is one a month. There is no discount on that. The wholesalers are responding to the squeeze and lowering their mark-up by 33 per cent. Again, the squeeze comes through from the Government on the wholesalers, who then pass it on to the retailers. But the retailers have nowhere to pass it on to. So the 25 per cent mark-up is much more like a 20 per cent mark-up.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are so many other things that the Government seems to have neglected. For example, let us look at some of the primary health care inquiries that have been made in Australia. I have figures from a previous inquiry which are four or five years old and need to be updated but which constitute the most recent authoritative information I have been able to get. In 1985, 44 million primary health care inquiries were made of pharmacists compared with 29 million general practitioner consultations. Considering the Medicare arrangements in this country, if the 44 million primary health care inquiries had to be paid for because people wanted to see a doctor, it is obvious that this country could not afford it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The professional input of pharmacists to the community has been enormous, and not only in terms of their care of the community. That is acknowledged by the community in a way in which it does not acknowledge our jobs, for example. Every year, the pharmacists are at the top of the list of people to whom the community looks up. That has been achieved by long and meritorious service to the community. It could not have been achieved by a group of people seeking to rip off the community, as a number of Government spokesmen have said, and they know it. The only way to get such a rating from the community is to do a job and do it very well. That high standing is grudgingly earned. A standing of 80 per cent is good in any terms, particularly as politicians rate about 12 per cent. That standing is well earned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Computerisation has not been mentioned in this debate. Australia has moved, ahead of the rest of the world, to computerised dispensing, at no cost to the community. No other country has reached the level we have. This has been done solely at the cost of the pharmacists. Why do I mention this? The Government has agreed to pay pharmacists on computers within 10 days of the lodgment of their monthly claims, whereas non-computerised pharmacists' claims will take up to 30 days. Of course, it now takes about 90 days, if it manages to come through at all. The average saving to government of that exercise, financed by the pharmacists themselves, is conservatively put at $20m a year. That is another area where the pharmacists have sought to provide a service.
       </para>
       <para>
        We could go on to look at the rates the Government pays its own pharmacists on contract. That is about $40 an hour compared with the rates currently being paid in the largest State, New South Wales-somewhere between $11 and $20 an hour. At the end of the day the Government is talking about dollars. The difficulty is that our community is changing. For example, we know that in 1986-87 about 60 per cent of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme went to pensioners. That figure is now 70 per cent. Demographic changes in our community will increase the costs. Unless we can actually slow down the ageing process, costs will increase in that area. That has to be recognised and accepted. The structures have to be reorganised.
       </para>
       <para>
        The pharmaceutical benefits scheme as a percentage of the total health bill-I think it is a reasonable exercise to consider this, in view of what the Government is currently about-was 22.5 per cent in 1961, 14 per cent in 1975 and 8.4 per cent in 1986. In anyone's terms that would suggest a movement of costs away from pharmacists into other areas. Those movements may be legitimate but, whatever one wants to read into those figures, one cannot say that pharmacists have been on a money grabbing exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Minister and others talk about the incomes of pharmacists and others, I wish they would tell us whether they are talking about gross or net income. I heard the Minister on the radio a couple of weeks ago carrying on at great length about the increased income of pharmacists. When I checked, I found he was talking about the gross income. Perhaps the Minister has not run a small business, but it is a pretty simple fact that can be readily grasped that one can have an enormous gross increase in income and still manage to go bankrupt. The reason is that there can be an even larger increase in costs. At the end of the day it is not what the gross income is; it is what is made out of the exercise as to whether one can stay in business. That amount has been dropping, not increasing. The fact that new pharmacies open does not mean that everyone is making a great killing on the exercise. Nor does it mean that every time a new dress shop opens everybody is making a killing in selling dresses. There is an enormous movement in costs which is nowhere near as great as the movement in income.

        In this dispute with the pharmaceutical industry the Government has directed its attention towards a group of people who have provided very good service. Let us be clear about this: the Government was seeking $30m to give to the doctors to buy them off in their dispute, and it took the money from the pharmacists. Because of the way that budgets work, the money has to come out of the same budgetary arrangement. That is all very fine. It may have saved the Government's bacon with regard to the doctors, but not with regard to the pharmacists. Now is the time to go back to the status quo, sit down at the table and discuss all the types of rearrangements that are necessary to take the industry into the 1990s. Many are definitely needed.

         —I rise to make a brief contribution to this debate partly because I am appalled at the contributions from the Opposition. I include the Australian Democrats in that, but I will come to specific comments about why I am appalled by them. Senator Puplick led for the Opposition. His speeches are becoming dangerously boring. One just has to take out the word `pharmacy' and substitute anything else on which he has been leading the debate in this place for the last six months-his speech can be categorised as fearmongering, scaremongering, creating confusion, misrepresentation and abuse of the Government ad hominem par excellence: `When one has done over the Prime Minister, do over the Minister'. Senator Puplick is not at all interested in the issue; it is called playing politics.

        The Government does not mind Senator Puplick doing that, but let us put it on the record that he did not want to discuss the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, the way in which the Government is dealing with this dispute or any other details at all. Senator Puplick wanted to make a good old political speech-head-kicking, tub-thumping, bash 'em smash 'em. We have heard it before. It does not make anyone wiser. But it was not a bad performance except, as I say, that it was in danger of becoming boring, as he has done it too often.

He did not want to talk about the issue at all but wanted to go on at length about the cost of preventive health. It is quite an interesting point, but not the issue of the day. Senator Coulter added his whining reasonableness and got Senator Macklin to say the same thing, which was very depressing because it added nothing. I have to say, in passing, that righteous indignation does not sit well upon Senator Bishop.

         —We are discussing whether or not this Parliament, this Senate, will overturn a decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal as part of its process of negotiation with the pharmacists of Australia about some cost containment in their profession. Opposition members come in here and whenever we are debating these matters their argument is that we are dreadful because we try to restrain costs. The Opposition seems to be devoted to spending money like mad and in terms of its recent document I would be delighted to know whether it is intending to give to the pharmacists everything that they want and whether the Opposition will take that money from the unemployed people of this country to do that too. Just what does the Opposition want on the pharmaceuticals question? Is it planning to increase the outlays or will the Opposition seriously address the need for proper cost constraint?

        For the nth time on the record, but for the first time for me, I want to say that the Government strongly supports a proper, responsible, professional pharmaceutical industry. It always has and is continuing to do so. The claims from Senator Boswell were absolutely outrageous. His comments can only be justified by the fear he must have as Queensland faces an election. What he said had absolutely no relevance to this matter at all. Somehow charging a dollar for what was a dollar outlaid is part of socialism and it is all part of bringing down something. The only sense one can make of Senator Boswell's comments is that it is still relevant for the Nationals to run their campaign in Queensland on the fear bogy of socialism. This has nothing to do with the discussion at hand. Then Senator Boswell went on to another very important point-that a number of towns in Queensland have only one pharmacy. If he knew what this discussion was about, he would know that those pharmacies have nothing to fear, that the communities have nothing to fear.

        It is the Opposition that has contributed to the misinformation. The pharmacists may not all know because sometimes I think they have not had full information from their own Guild. This is not a new dispute. This discussion has been going on with the Government since May. In May the Pharmacy Guild, on behalf of the pharmacy profession, decided not to go ahead with the nearly agreed negotiated position between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government. It was quite clear to the Pharmacy Guild that one of the consequences of not accepting negotiations at that time was that it would go to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal.

In terms of Senator Boswell's fear about sole pharmacies in country towns, he needs to inform himself about the essential pharmacy allowance. It is a matter for continuing description and negotiation between the Government and the pharmacy industry to ensure that where there is a pharmacy that is the only provider of pharmaceuticals for a community this allowance is available. The easiest example is the sole pharmacy in a country town. Those pharmacies will benefit from the essential pharmacy allowance and continue to operate.

I am ashamed of you, Senator Bishop, positively ashamed, for bringing that personal attack on the independent Chairman of the Tribunal. It does not become you.

I would like to put on record that the South Australian Branch of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the pharmacies in South Australia have not agitated in anywhere near the same way as other pharmacies and other sections of this country. As I understand it, that is because the Pharmacy Guild and the pharmacists in South Australia are very reason- able people, have been at pains to be informed and have got a fair understanding of what the issues are. They have also been in the business of understanding costs in a very different way. While there are some concerns amongst pharmacists in South Australia they are being dealt with and managed in a very proper and honourable way. I will say it again for the record: this Government and I strongly support the work of pharmacies and pharmacists around this country. I also find it remarkable that Opposition members stand up here and somehow discredit the pharmacy profession because pharmaceuticals are so moderate in cost.

We need to appreciate in this industry a balance between the needs of the community and the needs of the profession. That cannot be dismissed lightly. It cannot be overlooked. This Government, and this country, ought to be proud of the contribution of the pharmacy industry and the way in which costs to the consumer have been so efficiently and effectively restrained. At the same time we have to take the point that the industry has to look at all of those issues. The Government certainly takes into account the concerns for consumers as well as for the profession and the industry. Regarding the problem of costs, the reason the Government put out this pamphlet was that there was a campaign being run to terrify particularly pensioners and users of pharmaceuticals.

In so far as the September figure is $2 billion, of course it is not a satisfactory result. It is only marginally better than the August figure which, as Senator Stone might have pointed out, was a record figure. I am sure that he pointed that out in August. In terms of the Government revising its Budget estimate, I do not know whether the Treasury intends to revise its estimate, but if at an appropriate time that is considered necessary I suppose that will be done.

In light of the reply by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, which placed great weight upon the difference between the two halves of the financial year, I put the question to him this way: given the $5.8 billion seasonally adjusted deficit in the September quarter, a rate for the first half of, let us say, $11.5 billion, is he therefore saying that the deficit in the second half of the year will be falling to a rate of only $7 billion?

I concur with them in part in that, when Australian companies look at investment prospects in Indonesia, they think of that country of 180 million people as if it is all a subsistence economy. But at least 10 per cent of the Indonesian population live at standards that would be akin to Australian consumption standards. There is, within that population of 180 million people, a market of 10 per cent, about the size of the Australian market or better, which offers Australian companies, I believe, great prospects.

        On the resource side, there has been a recognition by the Indonesian authorities in recent years that Indonesia's reliance on its economy as an oil and gas exporter is too narrow. It wants to promote investment and expand its minerals production base. It is very eager to tap the mineral exploration, resource development and planning and construction skills in Australia, its nearest neighbour and one of the countries most suited to sell those skills and participate in those investments. Indonesia wants to attract investment from Australian industry. Already CRA Ltd has two significant investments in Indonesia, both on the island of Kalimantan, one of $130m in a gold project in East Kalimantan--

Conditions are offered for further development. In that I join with Ambassador Flood and commend to Australian industry, in particular to resource industry, prospects for development. I direct the attention of Australian resource companies to the idea of participating more strongly in winning contracts for feasibility studies of major contracts and major development. Unfortunately, feasibility contracts tend to be won by other countries. If it is for, say, Japan the specifications for the development are written to suit Japanese industry and Australian companies then have to participate in supplying plant and equipment to meet those contracts to Japanese specifications. Australian companies tend to be more even-handed in that respect.

        I believe that Australian companies can do more in terms of resource development and in packaging financially the development they get involved in. It is not simply a sale of engineering skills. There should be a holistic approach to development, including selling training skills on the side. Ambassador Flood is right to draw our attention to this, but I do not think the scenario is entirely bleak.

Senator Colston brought the latest one to my attention last night. He adequately and properly described the advertisement as being in very large super print offering `Britain &amp; Europe, $400 return'. When one reads further on, one finds out that that is not the actual fare but a rebate that one can obtain if one books with Qantas by 19 December 1989.

Given the existing precedents, will the Government have its representatives in the United Nations General Assembly move to have the Cambodian seat declared vacant?

         —I am not sure that I can add terribly much to what Senator Button said last week in answer to a question from Senator Vallentine on just this subject. But let me go through it, nonetheless. The Cambodia seat at the United Nations is held by so-called Democrat Kampuchea, the government of which is described as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea or CGDK. CGDK comprises, of course, the Khmer Rouge, the Funcinpec group, so-called, led by Prince Sihanouk, and the KPNLF, or the Khmer People's National Liberation Front led by Mr Son Sann. The head of the CGDK delegation at the United Nations is a member these days of the Khmer Rouge faction. Australia has never accepted the claims of the CGDK to be the government of Cambodia. Nor, for that matter, has it accepted the claims of the Phnom Penh regime-the People's Republic of Kampuchea-led by Hun Sen to be the government of Cambodia. We have stayed aside from the issue.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        For the issue of CGDK credentials to be considered by the General Assembly Credentials Committee, there has to be a formal challenge. There has been no such challenge since 1982 and on that occasion Australia abstained, reflecting the position that I have just described. There are no indications that a challenge will be mounted by anyone else at the current session of the UN General Assembly. In fact, the report of the Credentials Committee has already been accepted by the Assembly this year. Australia's present assessment is that if a challenge were to be mounted now or were some other procedure to be adopted to get the matter back before the Credentials Committee, that challenge would not be successful in view of the strong majority support which is presently continuing for the CGDK among the ASEAN countries, most Western countries and many developing countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        In any event, we take the view that the Cambodia conflict is not simply going to be resolved by a vote as to who is entitled to hold the Cambodia seat at the United Nations. I think the question of seating is seen these days by pretty much everyone as a secondary or subsidiary issue which will be relatively easily able to be resolved in the context of a larger settlement. I do not think it is seen by anyone, except some of the people who write to members of parliament about it, as being the key which will unlock the whole Cambodian conflict. If it were, it may be that more time and attention could sensibly be devoted to trying to build a new consensus for tackling the seat issue head-on and finding some way through it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's position, as I described it yesterday, is that a durable solution, as we see it, in the present environment can be achieved only by a comprehensive political settlement-one which, among other things, does establish an interim administration which would assume, under the kind of plan which is being talked about, Cambodia's seat, pending elections taking place. Another alternative variation to that plan is for the seat to remain vacant during the tenure of any such interim administration and pending elections. A number of other things are, of course, necessary in any such comprehensive settlement, one of which is the provision of the necessary safeguards to ensure that there is, of course, no return to the atrocities of the Pol Pot era.
       </para>
       <para>
        All Australia's efforts are devoted to ensuring that there is a durable settlement which, at present, we believe can only be a comprehensive settlement-not a piecemeal one addressing part of the problem. That is the view that is taken by all the other ASEAN countries and the United Kingdom and France, which has been active in Paris-as well as the United States. I have to say that the United States has not played and is not playing a prominent or central role in any of the current or previous rounds of deliberations. It is present but it would be quite wrong to regard Australian policy-or for that matter anybody else's policy-as driven by United States perceptions at present. We do not want to take any action at all which would compromise any effort to achieve a durable solution, and we certainly do not want to settle for some kind of partial solution which would do no more than condemn the Cambodian people to another round of civil war and another round of killing.

         —I am sure that it will not be inviting the honourable senator in the future-in what I am sure is quite a significant statement on social policy in this country. It is one that emphasises very strongly the need for a policy to target need in welfare expenditure. Mrs Tom is reported as attacking the Opposition's economic action package because it discriminates against families in need. The fundamental problem with the Opposition's policy-that it is not targeted-is the thrust of the attack. The question which I think honourable senators would be interested in is Mrs Tom's statement:

       <para>
        This comment comes very much from the heartland of the constituency of members of the Opposition. It undermines the credibility of their package. It exposes its inequity and exposes it as a document born out of cynicism and opportunism and very much an uncaring document. It is quite apparent that the Opposition has replaced social policy planners with advertising agents.

        It is quite curious that Senator Chaney is rolling over with laughter. I remind Senator Chaney that in the Senate on 8 September 1976 he had a much different view about this. He might be turning red now. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is terribly important that within that framework of financial restraint the Government has concentrated on looking after the needy.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is one comment, but we can find others. What does the Country Women's Association want? Basically, it wants a package which provides extra assistance to families most in need and it recognises in its statement that rural families fit very much within that category. It is quite apparent as time goes by that the Country Women's Association is another group which has come up objecting to the Opposition's approach in this particular area.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also pertinent to compare the two approaches in terms of targeting the needs of people such as those in the constituency of the CWA. On the one hand we have a government which has had its policy driven from years of research and the Social Security Review. It is a policy which assists two million families with 3.8 million children. It is a policy which gives additional assistance to half a million families with 1.2 million children through family allowance supplement or its equivalents. There are five basic features of that policy which are fundamental to obtaining fairness and equity in the system. Under the Government's policy, firstly, assistance is paid to the mother fortnightly; secondly, it is fully indexed to maintain its real value; thirdly, it is targeted; fourthly, it is tax free; and, fifthly, and most fundamentally, it gives assistance to those most in need. It is very much a policy geared towards achieving fairness, equity and certainty. On the other hand, we are offered a tax rebate which, firstly, is not targeted; secondly, is not paid to the mother; thirdly, is not paid regularly; fourthly, is not indexed; fifthly, does nothing for those most in need; and, sixthly, and probably most fundamentally, the Australian community is asked to wait until September 1991 or thereabouts to achieve the benefits of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has, for quite some time now, seen assistance to families as a priority that needs to be addressed systematically and with fairness and equity. In doing so, we will proceed to develop policies along those lines. We will not replace the social policy planners with advertising agents.

We are told that the Opposition is planning to introduce a child-care tax rebate which is worth $20. However, we do not know-and Senator Newman failed to give an undertaking on this in a debate I had with her last week-the amount of resources the Opposition will put into the child-care program.

        It has been said by two people-honourable senators can believe either Connolly or Peacock-that the children's services program will remain intact. For the children's services program to remain intact there has to be a commitment to capital costs, operational subsidies and fee relief. When I asked Senator Newman on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio last week whether the Opposition was committed to those three factors I did not get a response. Furthermore, I did not get a response in relation to the indexation of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. So when Senator Chaney talks about targeting, about the specifics of the Opposition's policy and whether the Australian family will buy that policy, I reiterate that there is a great deal of confusion.

        As my colleague Senator Bolkus has indicated, people in Australia-I think the Country Women's Association of Australia typifies the views of middle Australia-want fairness and equity.

They want a system that is fair and equitable. I believe that that is a system to which the Hawke Government has been committed. I believe that, even though Senator Chaney is smiling now, basically he is deeply disappointed that targeting has not been adopted by Andrew Peacock.

Certainly, the Government will continue to pay a great deal of attention to the needs of working women and to the needs of women at home who are entitled to have occasional child-care-something that the Opposition's child-care rebates do not address. We will continue to place a high priority on policies that have an important impact on Australian women. We are not going to an election, as the Opposition is, suddenly discovering that we had better put something together to attract the women's vote.

         —I have been asked, firstly, to describe the relevance of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I think it is fairly self-evident that, as Australia is a major exporter of primary industry products, it depends on a quarantine and inspection service that guarantees the health and freedom from disease and contamination of our agricultural products. A quarantine and inspection service is necessary to intercept the exotic diseases that may come into Australia, because of the increase in trade and travel, and to protect a fragile environment in this part of the world.

        We rely on clean, contamination-free products to succeed against world trade barriers; we have an enviable reputation for that. If an outbreak of foot and mouth disease were to occur in Australia it would cost about $1.2 billion in lost agricultural production. For example, we would lose about $2 billion in lost trade, and about 43,000 jobs would go. That is one graphic example of what the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service does to prevent this type of disease. But there are other areas of our primary industries-sheep, wheat, fruit, rice and so on-that it protects and it guarantees the health of our products.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since we came to government we have made significant changes in the Quarantine and Inspection Service resulting in cost savings. We have reduced by about 30 per cent in real terms the budget allocated to it initially. The savings on meat inspection have been about $10.5m, on fruit and vegetables, $1.3m, and on general quarantine, $5.3m. I could go on with others. We have transformed the Service into a lean and efficient service without any loss of quality in terms of the work that it does. We have consulted with agricultural producers on the way through, to guarantee that that is so. There is an acceptance and a recognition that it is a good service.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we were to cut $10m from the Service, I have to say that, given the reforms that we have undertaken, we would run a very real risk that the quality of the service that we now present would be reduced significantly and there would be a threat of exotic diseases and contamination coming into Australia which would threaten our standing as a world exporter. Assuming the cuts were to manpower, as seems likely, if they were to meat inspectors we would have, given the very delicate nature of the negotiations on reducing the number of meat inspectors that this Government has entered into, a real threat of industrial disputation in the abattoirs of Australia which would not help our reputation. If the cuts were in the area of quarantine, we would have overcrowding in existing quarantine facilities, long delays in processing quarantined animals in Australia and a substandard service. If the cuts were on the inspection side, it would open up the possibility of more disease.
       </para>
       <para>
        I recognise the words that Senator Burns has used in his question as coming from the Liberals' Economic Action Plan, which threatens to cut $10m from the quarantine service. If that were to occur, the consequences that I have just described would become very real. If we look further at that policy, we see that, in addition to the proposal for cost cutting of that magnitude, it also proposes to change cost recovery from 60 per cent as at present back to 50 per cent. That would impose a further cost reduction of $13m, so the total cost reduction would be $23m. Given the description I have been able to provide the Senate with about the effect of a $10m cut, there is absolutely no doubt that, if the measures advocated in that Economic Action Plan were to be imposed on the Quarantine and Inspection Service, Australia's standing in the world as an agricultural exporter would be at risk, if not directly threatened, and the quality of life we enjoy with our environment would also be dramatically threatened. Given the responsible changes that this Government has made to quarantine, and the cost cuttings that we have been able to achieve in that area, to impose an extra $23m cut in this area would be absolutely disastrous.

        The major impediment is not the alleged lack of a check and training organisation but rather the AFAP's active discouragement of its members from offering themselves for employment with the airlines.

        It is in that context that I asked my question of the Minister, who was repeating allegations made by Willis the previous day, by Morris in August and September, by Abeles and by very many other people, that intimidation by the AFAP is preventing a return to work. I remind the Minister that the Government has the power to get an injunction under the Trade Practices Act to prevent any hindrance of interstate trade and commerce. I remind him of the provisions of the industrial relations legislation which he put through the Senate and which prevents such behaviour and I ask him why the Government has failed to take any action of the sort that the Opposition has consistently sought from the Government to prevent this intimidation, if that is what is occurring.

It also reflects the fact that Ansett and Australian are steadily increasing their own services on that route. On 20 October, for example, there were about 40 flights on that route. It is the case that passengers find it more convenient and time saving to travel between domestic terminals rather than through the international terminals when domestic flights are available on those particular routes. It is also true that many of the international services linking domestic capitals operate at inconvenient times of the day. That again is a disincentive to significant usage for domestic purposes.

        The domestic airlines are coordinating the bookings on the international airlines and on their own services to ensure that passengers are offered the fullest possible choice of times to travel. That is the reason and, so far as I am advised, the system is working perfectly sensibly. It has not been in itself a constraint to the effective utilisation of those international seats. It is the case that Ansett and Australian recognise the need to restore a full range of services across their networks as soon as possible. The airlines are presently working on schedules with additional capacity provided from their own and leased aircraft which will enable people to book with confidence over the Christmas holiday period and beyond.

Who understands it except the person who wrote the question for Senator Vallentine?'. Let me say two things about this. The Government has under consideration draft guidelines for kraft pulp mills. I would not get agitated at this stage. The guidelines are being considered by the Commonwealth Government and by State governments. They are being exposed to environmental groups for consideration and so on. They are drafts. We will resolve these issues and a final set of guidelines will be produced, as the Government undertook when it set this process in train.

        The second observation I want to make is that it is quite implicit in Senator Vallentine's question that she does not understand the expression `environmentally sustainable development'. She does not understand what that means. It does not mean that any industry which has any effect on the environment at all is not a sustainable development. Sustainable development means sustainable development which has no long term deleterious effects on the environment in proportion to all the other effects on the environment from all sorts of human behaviour in various areas of human activity. It is a matter of arriving at a balanced view about these things. The question clearly implies that Senator Vallentine does not understand that.

I take this opportunity to state quite categorically that I am very well aware that there are people on Senator Chaney's side of the chamber who have a range of views on this subject just as out in the community there is a range of views on this subject. Clearly, it is an issue that the Government's Caucus committee is particularly concerned about. Violence in videos and violence in the media are of great concern.

        Consistent with the moves towards enterprise employment the in-principle agreement provides for statutory and non-statutory industry levies to be progressively phased out and at the end of the implementation period the levy system will have been substantially dismantled. The in-principle agreement specifically envisages the discontinuation of industry levies for funding of sick leave and long service leave. Clause 3.1 of schedule 2 to the agreement indicates that the employer parties to the agreement can either contribute on a voluntary basis to existing industry funds administered by the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour or fund such liabilities directly.

Senator Ray undertook to refer to the Minister for Defence a part of that question which sought details of legislation and other documents concerning the deployment. The Minister for Defence has provided the following information in relation to the honourable senator's question: No specific legislative authority is required for the Government to assign tasks to the Defence Force. This is a normal aspect of the executive power of government. However, it should be borne in mind that, under section 8 of the Defence Act 1903, the Defence Force is subject to the directions of the Minister for Defence.

        Senator Vallentine also asked about legislative authority for the activities of the Defence Force personnel deployed to Nurrungar. Under section 23 of the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952, Defence Force personnel at Nurrungar were lawfully entitled to arrest persons who entered the Nurrungar prohibited area without permission and to hand arrested persons to the Federal or State police. In fact, those powers were not exercised. In this respect, it might be noted that, apart from the provisions of the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act, members of the Defence Force have always had the power, under section 82 of the Defence Act 1903, to arrest persons who trespass on defence installations.

As I explained to Senator MacGibbon at about that time, the primary responsibility for complying with safety requirements rests with the operator. Systems are established to ensure that operations can be conducted only in accordance with approved procedures. The airlines have established check and training organisations for this purpose and they are approved by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Variations to CAA staff numbers on location do not prevent an airline from continuing safe operations. The CAA expects to have a BAe146 endorsed examiner available in Perth in four weeks' time. Meanwhile, Ansett Airlines of Australia is utilising BAe check captains from the United Kingdom, who are performing an independent quality assurance role as well as assisting with the training of foreign pilots. The CAA has also required additional surveillance of Western Australian operations by the Melbourne based chief pilot of Ansett and has sent staff from field offices in other States to Western Australia for temporary purposes.

       <para>
        Q. Is it a fact that the crew of the Royal Brunei 757 Boeing aircraft, currently chartered for use internally in Australia, operated a period of 14 hours 40 minutes duty time one day last week?
       </para>
       <para>
        A. No. In the week 24-30 September 1989 Royal Brunei company records show that the longest overall duty period of any flight crew member was 12 hours and 45 minutes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Q. Is it also a fact that the Captain and crew elected to take only a nine hour rest period before resuming flying next day because they are operating under British CAA regulations which permit both this and the former action?
       </para>
       <para>
        A. No. The minimum rest period after the 12 hours 45 period of duty specified in the Royal Brunei Operations Manual is 12 hours and 45 minutes, which was observed in this case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Q. Is the Minister aware that under Australian CAA regulations a maximum period of only 11 hours rostered duty is allowed, which may be extended to 12 hours but that where this is done a subsequent mandatory rest period of 24 hours must be observed?
       </para>
       <para>
        A. This is incorrect. Following a 12 hour tour of duty, the Civil Aviation Orders require a pilot to have a rest period of 13 hours or 14 hours, depending on whether the tour of duty was completed before or after 10 p.m. The rest period of 24 hours is only required when the tour of duty exceeds 12 hours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Q. Is the safety of the Australian travelling public being put at risk by having different safety rules for the same task or situation?
       </para>
       <para>
        A. No. Foreign aircraft presently operating over Australian domestic sectors are required to demonstrate compliance with internationally accepted standards in precisely the same manner as existed before the dispute. While in some cases these standards may differ from those normally applicable to Australian domestic operations, there is no suggestion that these standards are in any way less safe when examined in the context of the foreign Authority's entire regulatory structure and certification requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, in the interests of uniformity, the CAA has requested foreign operators who wish to conduct operations in Australia for a protracted period to demonstrate closer compliance with Australian regulatory requirements.

It is also apt in the light of the further revision of the foreign debt figures and the foreign international investment position of Australia, also issued by the Australian Statistician today. Today the international rating agency, Standard and Poor's, said-I quote from the Reuters report from New York:

       <para>
        The report went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's net external debt rose to 200 pct of total exports in June. S/P said a rapidly growing private-sector borrowing more than offset lower Commonwealth external debt.

        Further, the report said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the rating agency said Australia's growing foreign interest payments will slow the process of stabilising the external debt burden.
       </para>
       <para>
        It added that the recent external imbalance occurred despite a sizeable increase in the terms of trade. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Treasurer (Mr Keating), back in 1985, 1986 and early 1987, blamed all of this country's problems, all the great difficulties that the Government was contending with in stabilising what was then thought to be a very large balance of payments deficit, on the adverse movement of the terms of trade-a term of art used by economists. For the last two years, the Treasurer has been saying that the even further adverse movement in our external balance of payments has been because of the improvement in the terms of trade. I do not have time to spend on that further inconsistency of our shameless Treasurer.

        What did our Treasurer, Mr Keating, say last night when the announcement by Standard and Poor's was received from New York? The Treasurer, in his press release issued last night, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        U.S. ratings agency Standard and Poor's today changed Australia's long-term rating. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        He did not even have the courage to say `downgraded' Australia's credit rating. He said `changed'-the kind of weasel word we are accustomed to from this Treasurer and this Government. With the abrasiveness which characterises every statement these days, the Treasurer then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        This was not an unexpected development given the alternative ratings agency Moodys had already adjusted Australia's rating in August.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Government totally rejects the need to downgrade Australia's rating it can understand that Standard and Poor's had little alternative given their competitor, Moodys, had already done so two months earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat: this is a Treasurer without shame. This morning what Paul Keating said on this matter a few months ago, at the time when Moody's Investors Service was announcing its downgrading of Australia's international credit rating, was replayed on the AM program. I express my gratitude to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for once. At the time the Treasurer said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Standard and Poor's, on their record, have been a more professional organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, more professional than Moody's. He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        They don't go in for these publicity stunts . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        He concluded by saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        But the point is, I think they're a more professional body.
       </para>
       <para>
        The introducer of the program, Mr Peter Thompson, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Paul Keating, singing the praises of the international credit rating agency Standard and Poor's a few months ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the agency about which Mr Keating had the impertinence to say last night that its decision to downgrade our credit rating was not an unexpected development because of what its competitor, Moody's, had done a few months ago. This is the totally professional body which can do no more now, in the Treasurer's eyes, three months later, than simply follow its leader.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had an answer to the Treasurer's words by the representative of Standard and Poor's, Mr Chambers, who, when the Treasurer's remarks of last night were put to him, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The competitive position-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the competitive position vis-a-vis Moody's-
       </para>
       <para>
        really doesn't enter into the discussion and the decision at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        We see no problem at all in having different ratings and really, we don't consider that at all in terms of whether we should make a rating change or not.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here we have Standard and Poor's, this totally professional body according to the Treasurer three months ago, saying in as plain words as one can find that the Treasurer speaks with two tongues and that last night he was speaking with a tongue with which this agency totally disagrees.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a Treasurer without shame-a man who, in the House of Representatives debate yesterday, made some comment about this Labor Government having built the Empire State Building and the Opposition coming along, putting another brick on top and saying, `Look what we've done'. I continue to be astounded by the gall and effrontery of Mr Keating, but that was a bit rich even by his standards. To talk about digging a $108 billion hole of foreign debt and saying that that is building the Empire State Building, even by Mr Keating's standards, is an extremely rich proposition to be trying to put to the Australian public. I predict that this is a proposition that the Treasurer will not succeed in putting to the Australian public. The fact is that Mr Keating and his Government are still digging. As I said, they have dug a $108 billion hole, of which there was $23 billion to start with, I say to be fair. They have increased it by $85 billion in the last six and a bit years. But they are still digging, as today's release by the Statistician of the balance of payments figures for September illustrates.

         —As Senator Boswell said, that will be very necessary. Today I put a question to Senator Button about these balance of payments figures. I remind him and his few colleagues opposite of some of the numbers. The September balance of payments figures, in unadjusted terms, show a deficit of $1,776m. That is for one month alone. The September seasonally adjusted figure that the Statistician now produces was $2,016m-just over $2 billion for one month of the year. As I said in my question to Senator Button earlier today, that means that for the first three months of this financial year-the July to September quarter-we have racked up a seasonally adjusted deficit in all of $5,819m-$5.8 billion. Since these are seasonally adjusted figures, this is equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $23.3 billion.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If one does not like the figures on the three-month basis one can add the month of June, which also happens to be in the Statistician's release. Doing the same kind of calculations one finds that over the last four months the seasonally adjusted annual rate of the deficit is $22.8 billion. It is a little bit less but it is much the same. We are looking at a balance of payments deficit of about $23 billion, or if one wants to be generous to the Government, $22 1/2 billion-in other words, a blow-out. By comparison there is the extraordinary estimate of $18 1/2 billion put forward by the Treasurer in the Budget Papers. This is a repeat of what happened at the same time last year when, I remind the Senate, the Treasurer forecast a balance of payments deficit of $9 1/2 billion. We finished up with a figure which has been further revised upwards only today by another $180m and is now just in excess of $18 billion for 1988-89. That was the degree of blow-out last year. We are already developing a blow-out again-although of not quite a similar percentage size-this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Month after month during the last financial year the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who is not here today, unfortunately-and I regret that he is ill-stood in this place and tried to defend the Government's balance of payments forecast and tried to justify the fact that no revision was being made. Then gradually revisions were leaked to the press and there was a further edging up of the figures, but at no time during the whole of last year did the Minister for Finance, representing the Treasurer, ever find himself in a position to be able to defend the forecast; and I predict that he will not be able to do so this year either.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his response to me today, Senator Button tried to suggest that the answer to the problem concerning these figures was to be found in the fact that the Treasurer had stated in the Budget that the balance of payments would be weaker in the first half of the year than in the second half. As I said in my supplementary question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), although he did not choose to deal with it, on the basis of that arithmetic-if that is the rationalisation in which the Minister is putting his faith-it is a claim that, somehow or other, in the second half of this financial year there will be a balance of payments deficit running at only around $7 billion per annum, seasonally adjusted. All I can say is that, if we were to see a balance of payments deficit running at around only a $7 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate-which is just over $1 billion a month compared with the present $2 billion-that could come about only because the bottom had fallen out of the economy. It could come about only because of the recession which this Government has shied away from admitting it has actually forecast in the Budget Papers and which it keeps saying the Opposition will achieve through its policies. That is the implication of the Minister's defence during Question Time today. Whether or not he is aware of it is another question. No doubt he has not done his arithmetic. I have just done it for him and I hope that, at some future time, he will find some means of responding to this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said before, not only has the balance of payments figure been issued today, but also a revised figure-not very much revised, I should say-for debt for the period ended June this year; indeed, not just debt, but what the Statistician these days terms Australia's net international investment position. At 30 June last year it amounted to net-and I emphasise that word-foreign liabilities of $142.7 billion, which was an increase within the June quarter alone of $4.6 billion. Within that total figure of $142.7 billion is a net foreign debt figure-as distinct from the other forms of net liabilities-of $108 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The wording of the matter of public importance we are discussing today speaks of the failure of the Government's policy to deal with the fundamental problems of the economy, as reflected in these matters I have been speaking about. The fact is that this disastrous balance of payments deficit, our extraordinary international debt and, indeed, our net foreign liabilities position are merely symptoms of what is wrong in Australia today. It is the lack of any policies on the part of the Government to deal with the fundamental problems which is producing these outcomes. Frankly, we have a non-competitive economy; an economy which is simply not hacking its way in the world; an economy in which the growth of productivity has been basically stalled for the last three years.

        There is a continuing shambles on the waterfront, with $150m of taxpayers' money being allocated to pay golden handshakes averaging $100,000 each, to 3,000 waterside workers in return for having sat on their backsides for the whole of their lives. The Government has done nothing in the coastal shipping situation. The Government is unable and unwilling-because the Public Service unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions will not let it-to tackle the gross problem of the need to privatise government business enterprises in order to give them, among other things, a chance to be more efficient and to provide a better working environment for their own employees, and more job satisfaction in the process. The tax burden for 1989-90 is still at a record level. More than half of our taxpayers are now paying over 40c in the marginal dollar of their incomes in tax. I am sorry to see the Minister leaving; I am sorry if he cannot take it, but there we are.

        Inflation is mounting. It is 7.6 per cent in the 12 months to June. There is another consumer price index figure for the September quarter coming out tomorrow. I do not know what that figure will reveal, and I am not making any predictions, but I would be very surprised if it in any way significantly reduces that figure of 7.6 per cent, for the 12 months ended in September. In other words, the inflation rate is stuck between 7 per cent and 8 per cent.

        What is this Government's policy to deal with these matters? Its only policy, which it has been following now in a manic manner since April of last year-18 months ago-is to put up interest rates higher and higher. It is true the Treasurer has done a sleazy deal with the four major banks to put a cap on bank mortgage loan rates, but all that means is that other people in the community will have to pay higher interest rates for longer. That is all it can mean. There is no free lunch in this area, as the Treasurer used to tell us. We have had nothing at all from the Government. By contrast, the Opposition has an Economic Action Plan which was brought down by the Leader of the Opposition nearly a fortnight ago and to which the Government has made no response. All we have had from this failed Treasurer, this man without shame, has been-if I may adapt a smart phrase of his of a few months back-what could be described as all lather, all heat. There has been no substance at all. In other words, we have had two wasted years from this Government since the last election.

That means that by the middle of June next year Australia will have an economy in which demand has been savagely deflated; in which the growth of production will be at a halt, at best, if it is not actually falling; in which inflation will still be running at around 7 per cent to 8 per cent; in which the balance of payments figure will still be running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of probably $12 billion to $15 billion, not Senator Button's ridiculous implicit $7 billion; and in which foreign debt will be coming out of our ears even faster than it is today. Having arrived at that point, what then? Where do we go from here if demand is to be cranked up? Or is the Government to be content with that situation of total stagflation? The fact is that this Government has no answers.

         —I suppose we are having a general economic debate this afternoon. The thing that has always struck me is the enormous dichotomy between what is promised by the Opposition and what is delivered. That dichotomy was most revealed to me over the weekend when I was listening to a news program and Mr John Elliott, the Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia, was getting fairly excited. One of the things that he said was, `What we are about is taking it off the bludgers and giving it to the workers'. Mr John Elliott, senior figure in the Liberal Party, its national President, its bagman for the next election, said that. When I picked up the Melbourne Age on Monday morning I found the same person has received a $10,000 a week pay rise-not $10,000 a year but $10,000 a week. I wonder at this dichotomy between what the Opposition promises and what it delivers. Here is the most senior figure in the Liberal Party next to Mr Peacock saying, `We will take it off the bludgers and give it to the workers'. Well, he certainly took it off someone-$10,000 a week-and we know whom he gave it to.

       <para>
        For a clear example of what the Mr Elliotts of the world bring about-not many people in this chamber would have had the privilege this year, but I did-people should go to Princes Park, Mr Elliott's football ground, the one he has redeveloped. If people want to see the two classes that someone like Mr Elliott will bring about, they should go to that ground and have a look at the $30,000 and $60,000 a year corporate boxes with people slurping away at four- and five-course meals, generally ignorant of football, as Senator Aulich would know, all by way of a tax deduction. Then people should look at the rest of the crowd stuck in the outer ground or in the wooden Gardiner Stand with the splinters, a fire trap. For people who wanted something to eat, one pie stall was provided by Mr Elliott's club for 15,000 people with a 150-yard queue going in one direction and another 150-yard queue in the other. At the end of the queue the pie stall happened to be selling export pies because ordinary ones had run out. That is Mr Elliott's vision. What is promised and what is delivered are absolutely entirely different.

         —A caring person in terms of his staff; I also know that. But I believe that, if he has had a major role in developing the Opposition's economic package, he has gone to mush. He has gone through the metamorphosis from an economic rationalist to a carpetbagger. Far from taking the opportunity to make the Liberal Party tax policy set out some grand design to reshape the Australian economy, Senator Stone has participated in putting together the traditional grab bag of hand-outs and like all previous coalition fistful of dollars packages it was not adequately costed and cannot be funded from the savings measures described. We know there is a gross estimating error of about $835m. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot say, `We are going to take everyone off the dole after nine months but we will give them special benefits anyway'. Where is the saving there? When we look at the problems we should look at child-care. The Opposition's latest package now means that the $20 child-care rebate will become $11.70 and the $4.80 child tax rebate will become $2.80.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On top of this, over the last three days we have seen the development of the Opposition's child-care policy farce. Mr Connolly revealed the hidden agenda to the Sydney Morning Herald when he promised an end to the national child-care strategy with the axing of the Government's commitment to create an additional 30,000 publicly funded places. He also promised the discounting of fee relief for the rebate and the denial of access to publicly funded centres for all except those on very low incomes. On Monday Mr Connolly's leader dumped on him and said that he had just got it wrong about Liberal Party policy, that the Liberal Party would build the additional 30,000 places and it would not discount fee relief for the rebate. Mr Connolly's story was much more plausible. But Mr Peacock would not have any of the gloss knocked off his Economic Action Plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        This morning we have another Opposition frontbencher, Mr Braithwaite, making another child-care promise, saying that the coalition would extend fee relief to the private sector-a new promise and one which certainly was not stated in Mr Peacock's famed Economic Action Plan and was not incorporated in the costings. I think Mr Braithwaite should be in the Australian Democrats. He expects us to believe that we can extend the fee relief to a whole class of people who do not already get it and that it will not cost anything. We are talking about subsidies of almost $80 a week and about $3,800 per child and it will not cost anything according to Mr Braithwaite. I admit that the Department of Finance has not costed it but I can tell the Opposition that it has the potential to cost a very significant amount of money. We have had three days of the Opposition making child-care policy on the run. Now Mr Peacock has a major problem of trying to salvage some integrity for his costings.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we are on the subject of the lack of the Opposition's fiscal discipline, I think it is about time that Senator Stone demonstrated that he is performing the function of the shadow Minister for finance and stopped the shadow Minister for land transport and shipping support, Mr Sharp, putting out ridiculous press releases on road funding. Mr Sharp's press release of 23 September stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Labor Government had made it plain that it does not take its responsibilities in roadworks seriously. By contrast, the Coalition is committed to a major increase in road funding-one that would permit the return of our road standards to those we used to take for granted as a right.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators may wonder why, if the Opposition is committed to increased road funding, nothing was included in Mr Peacock's Economic Action Plan. Again, it is a case of the National Party of Australia, having accepted general parameters, trying to wag the coalition dog's tail. Out of this Economic Action Plan, firstly, we will get unfunded promises; secondly, the policy making and additional spending promises will be done on the run. We also have the Opposition's flawed fiscal policy which has left Dr Hewson with far less scope in which to manoeuvre on money and wages policies. In our view he would be forced to engineer a recession through higher interest rates to create the climate he needs for market deregulation--

         —If Dr Hewson tried to deregulate the labour market without putting the economy into a recession, he would cause a wages explosion as surely as the coalition would have caused that wages explosion had it caved in to the pilots. I really wonder where the Opposition will go. I am not suggesting that the Opposition is in two factions. I wonder whether economic strength and rationality, even if it returns-and I hope it does-to Senator Stone, will prevail over the life of a coalition government or whether the Peacock pragmatists two years in will go to water as most Liberals go to water. Then we will see a replay of 1982 with a wages explosion, a recession, massive job loss for this country. I think the Opposition is just offering us a rerun of 1982.

        In his mini-campaign Mr Peacock has raised hopes that he might have something else to offer with his proposals to adjust the tax treatment of interest for inflation. Yet it turns out that this has been yet another example of policy making on the run, of form without substance. The Treasury comprehensively demolished the tax treatment proposal. It was a partial proposal that would introduce new distortions into the tax system. It was too administratively complex. It had implications for Australia's international competitiveness for investment. Even Mr Brian Loton made reference to a certain South American country when he was asked about it. Mr Peacock's colleagues declined to offer him any support. In the end he dropped it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where is the coalition's alternative economic vision? Last week in the Australian we read that Dr Hewson had pushed for a consumption tax. We are told often that this is the panacea which will discourage spending and encourage savings. What happened to Dr Hewson's advocacy of a consumption tax? I think we all know the political reality and who intervened to put the fix in to belt that one out of the ring. I think everyone would also remember-no doubt it was said in a different context-Senator Stone's great comment, `Don't trust us on tax'. I do not think we can have any real trust in the Opposition on tax, especially when we look back this week at what has happened with Mr Braithwaite in regard to child-care and with Mr Connolly in regard to child-care places.

        I want to mention one or two other things. It is not what was said today that is interesting. It is what is not being said. I raise this question and I invite Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Hamer to answer it. I want to know how the Opposition would fund the refund of bracket creep. We have had all the various one-liners. Let me remind honourable senators what was said on Channel 10's Face to Face program. Mr Peacock was asked:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Peacock, I will go through this once more and then move on. Rain, hail, snow, no matter how big or how small the amount, you will be handing back to the Australian taxpayers the bracket creep that they lose in the year 1989-90?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Peacock answered:
       </para>
       <para>
        We will be doing that.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is interesting. I ask Senator Stone, Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Hamer: How would the Opposition fund that? Would it fund it out of the surplus? Why does the Opposition not come clean and tell us? How would it do it in successive years? Would it hand back all bracket creep? If so, how would the Opposition fund it? There is no mention in the Opposition's policy about how it would achieve that. That is a major problem. There is another major problem. The Opposition, in its economic policy, talks about privatisation and assets sales. I want to hear a commitment from Senator Stone or other honourable senators today regarding what the Opposition would do with the proceeds of those sales.

Well done, Senator! Welcome back. What happened in Thatcherite England is very interesting. The Government used the proceeds of privatisation and assets sales to fund its general programs.

When did they ever take the tough option? When did they put up serious restructuring proposals? When, apart from one occasion-and I will come to it-did they ever get into the tax system? The only time they ever got into the tax system was in 1982, on bottom of the harbour tax-not out of principle but out of terror, the terror that hit them in late 1982 that unless they did something about bottom of the harbour tax they would be thrown out of office.

He will not take on anyone. He gives in all over the place. So where is the credibility of the coalition? Honourable senators opposite talk a terribly tough fight-they are going to sort out this industry, and that union. What did they do with the Builders Labourers Federation from 1975 to 1983?

        Then there was the fringe benefits tax. Does Senator Aulich remember the months of criticism of the fringe benefits tax as we tried to get rid of the free lunch and the rest of the rorts in the system? The Liberals fought it like the Russians fighting in the Stalingrad tractor factory. They went back post by post and fought it. What are they going to do now? They say that they would keep it all. It is all okay now. All the hard work has been done. The bugs have been knocked out of the system. `We will take the $1,500m' say Senator Stone and Senator Sheil. `We will cop the dough, even though we opposed it in principle'.

        The same thing happened with the assets test. Opposition senators went to water and would not have an assets test. Now they say they are going to take the money. The only one they would renege on is the biggie, the capital gains tax. If they ever come into this chamber and pass a Bill that reneges on capital gains tax it will be a tragedy for this country. It will erode our tax base and give enormous rewards to people who do not deserve them. We put a lot of thought into the capital gains tax and introduced it in such a way as to bring a lot of equity into the system. But no. They would get rid of it. The Opposition should have a good look at what the editorial of the Australian Financial Review said about this matter today because I think that for once, whilst I do not often read editorials or note their contents, it contained a fairly devastating criticism of the Opposition.

        People listening to this debate should remember the dichotomy, the difference, between what the Opposition promises and how it postures when it acts tough, and the past reality. It has never had the courage to tackle the economy. In its Economic Action Plan it merely recast part of Government economic policy. It is a redistribution of income, and that is all. Where is all the Opposition's talk of its grand vision and of restructuring? It does not exist. The Opposition has no track record in this area. Senator Stone comes in here and attacks Mr Keating. Mr Keating is not perfect, but he will be remembered in this country for all the restructuring he has done, long after the Opposition is forgotten. He will be remembered as the Treasurer who first tackled Australia's long term problems. Those problems should have been tackled long before this Government came to power. I suggest they should have been tackled long before the Fraser Government came to power. On too many occasions political parties showed a lack of will and courage. I will always remember the visit of a French economist to Australia in 1968. He had a really good look at our economy. He said `Mr Ray, the Australian economy reminds me of the village idiot who wins the lottery every day of the week'. That is where we were in 1968. We are no longer winning the lottery. The hard things need to be done. This Government is willing to do those hard things. The credibility of the Opposition's promises is thin when we look at its record.

         —What we are supposedly debating today is Senator Stone's motion relating to the fundamental problems of the economy reflected in particular in the further downgrading of our international credit rating and in the continuing crisis in our balance of payments and foreign debt situation. We have heard a lot, certainly from Senator Ray, about a great deal, but not much of it has been central to the topic that we are supposed to be debating. A lot has been said by both the previous speakers, Senator Stone and Senator Ray, on the minutiae of each other's policies but almost nothing has been said about what Standard and Poor's lists as the major cause of the problem, that is, our increasing foreign borrowings and the fact that private sector borrowings are increasing.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am not going to argue with Senator Ray's comments about how much the Australian Labor Party has done since it took office in 1983 to iron out some of the greater inequities in our tax system. After all, notwithstanding the furore, we were very much in support of a lot of those initiatives. I must say that I share the Government's cynicism when I read Mr Peacock's tax policy that essentially accepted a lot of the changes, with the exception of tinkering around with the capital gains tax, that the Opposition had opposed so vehemently in the past. I guess there is a certain irony in that the hard work has been done by others and has been accepted by critics. But I would not have thought that that is central to the debate that Senator Stone raised today. An article in yesterday's Age newspaper stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The influential Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating agency . . . lowered Australia's long-term debt rating from AA-plus to AA.
       </para>
       <para>
        It said the downgrading, which affects $10.4 billion in direct and guaranteed debt, reflects Australia's sharply higher current account deficit, prospects for protracted external adjustment, and increasingly heavy foreign debt burden.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, importantly, it went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's net external debt rose to 200 per cent of total exports in June. Standard and Poor's said lower Commonwealth external debt was more than offset by rapidly growing private-sector borrowings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the rating agency said Australia's growing foreign interest payments would slow the process of stabilising the external debt burden.
       </para>
       <para>
        It placed the responsibility for that very squarely on the shoulders of the private sector in this country. Given the size of the September deficit of over $2 billion, one has to wonder how much worse it will be in, say, the next quarter as tourism earnings fall because of the pilots strike and as we continue to pay foreign companies for the planes that we are hiring from them. Those are not small matters to be taken into account in the short term future of this country's economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        As any ordinary Australian family knows, when things get a bit tight economically there are really three major options that can be looked at. They can earn more between them, they can spend less between them or they can go into increased debt. There is a short term option available to them-they can sell off everything they own, including those things that are making money for them and hope, like Mr Micawber, that something will show up in due course to get out of the deep hole that they are digging for themselves. What has happened in Australia is that the government of the day has chosen option 2, to cut expenditure. The business sector in Australia has chosen option 3-to go into increasing debt-subsidised, I might add, by the taxpayer because of the tax concessions that are available to them if they move towards debt and away from equity financing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Worse than all of this, I suppose, is the fact that both the Government and the Opposition are currently leaning more and more towards what I would have thought was the most short-sighted of the options. They are adopting option 4 as a viable part of their strategy, that is, selling off whatever they can to raise short term funds. The recent current account figures are a clear indication that the Government strategies are failing. Yet considering how similar they are to the Opposition strategies, it is really only the matter of pace that is different. One wonders where we are going to be if there is a change of government. Certainly, this Government's policies have led to increased budgetary surpluses. But this has happened only because expenditure on the least well off in the community has been slashed. Australian families are feeling the pinch, which is at least partially the aim of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), as he keeps telling us, in order to stop ordinary Australian families from spending money and contributing to our trade deficit by buying imported goods. The Government has made those families feel the pinch by reducing their capacity to spend on locally made products as much as on the imported products. It has been beating them over the head with increasing interest rates to such an extent that many of them cannot even afford the home that they are living in and trying to buy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Neither of those successes in the eyes of the Government can offset the real problem, namely, that Australian businesses are actually encouraged by the current taxation system to borrow huge amounts of money from overseas. As Standard and Poor's has pointed out, this is a very significant factor in our increasing foreign debt and, hence, in our increasing current account deficit. Until we attend to that problem, we are going to continue to have these sorts of debates on a weekly, if not daily, basis. To make matters worse, the interest paid on those foreign borrowings is tax deductable. First of all, that means the Consolidated Revenue is run down because the money that could go in is not going in there. Secondly, the taxpayer is subsidising those businesses to the point where some of them are paying little or no tax at a time when personal tax payments are increasing because of the fiscal drag.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Government's only response to this has been to deregulate the financial system to the point where the only monetary policy weapon left is to bludgeon people around the ears with high interest rates. The Government did that. It deregulated the financial sector with the support of the Opposition. We were promised a better deal from the financial sector. We were told that services would improve, charges would go down and interest rates would go down-that everything would be much better in a deregulated, highly competitive market. Quite the reverse is true. If we do not have an unofficial cartel in the banking industry, I would like to know what we do have, considering the nexus that always seems to obtain between the charges banks impose, the interest rates they each set and the services they offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has also supported Labor in what I consider to be another short term and short-sighted policy-that is, allowing virtually unfettered foreign investment in Australia. What is even worse is that the major form that this foreign investment has taken is the outright purchasing of property, businesses and so on-not leasing, not minority ownership, but total ownership of urban and rural properties and an increasing ownership of elements of such vital industries in Australia's trade as the beef industry. When one adds to this the fact that both major parties are looking to sell off Australia's most profitable non-private enterprises such as Qantas Airways Ltd and Telecom Australia, we have in place a recipe for a country looking bankruptcy down the throat.
       </para>
       <para>
        We often look at Japan as a model for where Australia should go. I think it is worthwhile pointing out that the so-called economic miracle in Japan is not something that has come as a result of deregulation. It has come quite specifically as a result over four decades or more of government intervention. That intervention has been put in place to create domestic savings for investment, for a start. A decision was made after the war not to tax the interest on savings in order to provide low interest rate loans to companies that wanted to invest. Japan has also provided government support for businesses until they become viable. It has incorporated a much more cooperative system within industry between management and the factory floor than we have in Australia. Companies have gone as far as providing incentives to work and increase production, profit sharing and other benefits to workers. If we are looking for a model that Australia can pick up and run with, it should not be the deregulatory model that allows businesses to get away with blue murder that we are currently using in Australia. We need a much more government controlled cooperative based system of the sort that applies in Japan and I guess, to a lesser extent, in West Germany. One has to ask why the Australian Government and the Opposition continue to push an economic system and a monetary policy that to date at least it has been proved are not going to work. I do not know for how much longer we have to live under this sort of regime.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose some fairly drastic change is needed to the way in which governments and the Parliament itself operate the fiscal and monetary policies of this country. We could start looking to that issue which Standard and Poor's isolated as the major cause of our problem; that is, foreign borrowings by private companies. It is ludicrous in this country to keep interest rates high in order to encourage foreign investment because we need the foreign investment to offset our foreign borrowings. Those foreign borrowings are not only the catalyst for those two things; they are also causing difficulties with regard to Consolidated Revenue, so that companies such as Bond Corporation and others pay little or no tax. An article appeared in the Age today which indicates that over the past few years four of Australia's most ambitious entrepreneurs and their companies have racked up debts of about $12 billion. If we continue to encourage that when no increased export markets are developed and no additional import replacement items are produced, we are asking for trouble. What we have to do as a primary step is to remove, reduce, or put strictures on the sorts of tax deductions that are offered to private companies in this country when they borrow from overseas. That is the first thing we need to look at.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second thing we need to do is ask why we do not have a pool of savings in this country that business and industry can use, at much lower interest, for investment purposes. The answer is that we have a prohibitive tax regime applying to the interest that people earn on savings. If Japan can become afloat with money to the point where last year it started to impose a 20 per cent tax on interest, then Australia too can improve its savings pool by offering at least partial relief from the tax burden that individuals face when they put money into banks and building societies, the major lending authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe we need not to look at the policy that Mr Peacock considered and then discarded, inflation indexed taxing, but to take the bottom $1,000 or $2,000 of interest earned and say, `All right, you are not going to be taxed on that, but you will be taxed thereafter'. Certainly, that would encourage savings. There would be an incentive for people who bitterly resent losing 49c in every dollar of interest that they earn and for pensioners who object to the fact that they are paying provisional tax the minute their interest earned reaches $1,000. While we are looking at incentives, let us give some to our rural exporters to help them compete against the subsidies and the dumping policies of our so-called allies-the United States of America and the European Community. If we cannot afford to import, as Treasurers and others complain that we cannot, then we ought to take active steps to reduce imports. If that means using tariff and non-tariff barriers of the sort that many of our trading partners, such as Japan and France, are using, so be it. But until businesses stop borrowing, until we start to make ourselves competitive on international markets, until we protect our export industries and develop new import replacement items, we will not be in a position to see a reduction in our current account deficit and its attendant problem of high interest rates for ordinary Australian families.

         —We are debating a matter of public importance submitted to the Senate for discussion by Senator John Stone in the following terms:

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The failure of the Government's policy to deal with the fundamental problems of the economy as reflected in the further downgrading of our international credit rating and the continuing crisis in the balance of payments and foreign debt situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Stone said at the outset of his speech, it is a very timely matter of public importance, particularly in light of the circumstances and events which have taken place in the last 24 hours. Even the most objective commentator cannot help observing that this Government is now simply tired and it has lost. It is a failed government, bereft of ideas, initiatives and direction, and, most of all, it has lost hope and a sense of purpose. Perhaps this is best epitomised by the meandering, discursive and stumbling performance of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the last week. He has finally dropped his bag. We saw him on the Face to Face program, on the Sunday program and then at the Metal Trades Industry Association dinner. He now knows that he is at a dead end. He is out of ideas and, tragically, Australia for the time being is out of luck. In my eight years in both government and opposition, I have not seen a more dispirited and dejected bunch than I see sitting opposite me for the better part of most days. They have the smell of death about them-it reeks in their nostrils-and they are showing all the hallmarks of the Unsworth Government. Their attitude is simply, `Let us hang on and hope that something will turn up'. No doubt in retrospect they are now all aching for the prospect of a half Senate election. They know that that is off the agenda because it would be the Bass by-election all over again, but they would dearly love to have another six months of a wish list of hope that something might turn up by accident. They all know that as that is now off the agenda they are in very real trouble.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has failed on almost every single count. Worst of all, it has failed most dismally in the area of integrity. I raise that matter particularly because it goes to the heart of the conduct of the economic management of this Government. I am reminded of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the early years of this Government depicted in cartoons-I think they were in the Australian-carrying around his little box labelled `Integrity'. We know what is said about men who have to talk about their integrity. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Mr Keating, have said, `Trust us'. For six years the people have been trusting the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. I ask: How many families in Australia can put their hands up now and say, `I am better off, my family is better off, my kids are better off and my mortgage is easier to cope with since the day the Australian Labor Party was elected.'?

This is a Government which in rhetoric takes the high moral ground but in practice adopts the policy of the lowest common denominator. It has consistently claimed that it is a responsible government committed to making tough economic decisions which are for the long term national good.

It is not driven by political expediency, it does not have its eye on the next election, it does not have its eye on short term political advantage, and it is not worrying itself about votes; it is worrying about the high moral ground, the well-being of Australian citizens in the future! We are told that the Government can take these tough decisions because the Prime Minister, rising to the height of 5 foot 4 1/2 inches, tells us all that the Australian community, the Australian voters, are sufficiently mature to accept the medicine that is necessary to readjust economically so that we have a sustained economy for the future.

        What is the reality of this Government? It is one of expediency, equivocation, vacillation, dithering and, worst of all, flight with fear when confronting what has to be done to put this country in a position where ordinary Australians have some economic hope for the future. I will take up Senator Stone's point. Let us look at the most recent graphic example of duplicity, economic delinquency and crude political expediency. The decision was not taken in the national good or in the national interest. Rather, it was taken for the political good of the Australian Labor Party-a grubby decision made at enormous cost to all Australian taxpayers in a desperate bid by this Government to grab a hatful of votes, to allow it to cling to the last vestige of power. It was a decision based on broken promises, cowardly determinations and financial irresponsibility.

         —He promised him in writing that Coronation Hill would proceed. So BHP, foolishly in retrospect, spent $14m at the end of the day proving up an ore reserve, only to find that the deal was off. Yet it was told that the project could proceed. What did the Government do? The Prime Minister spoke first from the chair of Cabinet and put his imprimatur on the decision. In addition, the decision was made to close down the conservation zone-another broken promise for future exploration. What is the net result? The average Australian taxpayer is $500m worse off straight up. Add to that this bizarre three-mine uranium policy, arrived at for the same reason, politically expediently driven, which stops Jabiluka, Koongarra and a whole range of other mines getting off the ground. The best estimates by the Government's own Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics indicate that the resources of those mines are worth about $70 billion. That used to be about three-quarters of our national debt; it has now shrunk to almost half. That decision was arrived at as a result of the Prime Minister spending 90 minutes talking to the leader of a conservation group and getting his starting orders. When the Chairman of Directors of BHP rang up to put his oar in the water, to remind the Prime Minister of his promise, he had to leave his message scribbled on a pad with a secretary. That is the Prime Minister's judgment as to how we ought to be making these decisions.

What is the Government's attitude to micro-economic reform, privatisation and selling off all government corporations? We were told at the beginning of this parliamentary term and after the 1987 election that this would be a period of micro-economic reform. What have we seen? Mr Keating has endorsed the push by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to have Labor's anti-privatisation policy changed before the next election; yesterday Mr Hawke endorsed a ministerial call for the full sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines; and Mr Willis has strongly urged that sale. What has the Government done about it? It has done absolutely nothing. It knows what it is costing. This year alone Qantas is expected to have to raise $600m in borrowings because it cannot get the capital equity it requires.

It is because Mr Hawke, Mr Keating and Mr Willis get to the barrier, get frightened and tear away because they have the Right of Victoria, the Right of New South Wales, the Left right across the nation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) telling them, `You will not sell'.

In 1987 there were 250 different disputes on the waterfront, affecting about 360 ships. It is estimated that capital equipment on the waterfront is running at about 40 per cent capacity. If the proposals of the Inter-State Commission had been adopted it could have saved Australia approximately $620m.

         —We are debating here today a matter of public importance brought forward by Senator Stone which is basically critical of what he describes as the failure of the Government to deal with the fundamental problems of the economy. Senator Stone is correct in the sense that he strongly supports governments facing up to fundamental changes to an economy, which our economy needs and has needed for a very long time. So I am in agreement with him there. But that is as far as our agreement goes because it is Senator Stone's solutions, particularly as they come from a man who has had experience as the head of Treasury, his understanding of the problems and the advice he has given in that role as an influential economic guru, that have in many cases been wrong.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let us look at some of those fundamental problems facing Australia before I return to Senator Stone's prescription. First, for more than 30 years we have had an economy insulated from the rest of the world and basically uncompetitive and a group of businessmen and governments that were unwilling to see that a domestic market is not sufficient to sustain both primary and manufacturing industries. Secondly, the productivity of our work force, both at a management and at a worker level, has needed to be dramatically improved by world standards, especially by the standards of our competitors overseas. But I stress there that it was both a management and a worker problem. Thirdly, our taxation system needed to be constantly reviewed to ensure that it was fair, that it was seen to be fair and that it rewarded the true entrepreneur and not the paper shufflers and those who expend their time and energy in rorting the system rather than competing out in the real world.
       </para>
       <para>
        When this Government came to office it was determined to address all three of those problems. If I have time I will expand on the Government's program later on in my speech. I mention this at the outset because it is important to put this debate in its historical context so that the debate about the solutions is a little more sophisticated and productive than is usually the case in this chamber. Historically, we have been the lucky country. In many ways successive governments, mainly of a conservative persuasion, have failed either to see the problems or to address them with intelligence, courage and tenacity. It is not easy. We all understand that in any democracy-Australia is like most democracies-the government has to deal with the power of lobby groups and vested interest groups attempting to preserve their special positions. In many ways those positions have been counterproductive in toto to the national interest. Of course, government has a major role to play in not only balancing the interest groups and maintaining itself in office but also making the hard decisions which in the long term will make us competitive by world standards without necessarily losing our cultural and social advantages.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone is leaving the chamber. It is interesting to note that he was the Opposition spokesman in this debate because he has been and still is very much part of that syndrome which has thwarted Australia's moves to be competitive and its capacity as a nation to address the fundamental problems inherent in our economy. In some cases Senator Stone's recommendations about economic policy have been plainly wrong. In others his attacks on Government reforms have been politically biased. Either way he has been very much part of that old guard which has been responsible for many of the problems or difficulties that Australia faces today. He has been an integral part of the decision making process over the last 30 years which has brought us to the situation which needs to be remedied here and now.
       </para>
       <para>
        During those many years Australia relied on a policy of running down its manufacturing sector at the expense of promoting its mining and farming sectors. That has been a fact of political life in this country for more than 30 years. It is a fundamental flaw in economic thinking, which this Government is desperately trying to overcome in its major policy programs. I will give one example of why over the last 30 years Australia has pursued this failed line. A lot of it comes back to the thinking of people such as Senator Stone.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer honourable senators to a paper entitled `Australia in a Competitive World-Some Options' which he, as Secretary to the Treasury, presented to the twenty-first general management conference of the Australian Institute of Management in Sydney on 19 November 1979. I will quote from page 4 of that paper because it gives us an indication of not only the way Senator Stone thought and still thinks but also the way in which he could be so totally wrong in his predictions about what would happen to the economy and what needed to be done. If he, when he was Secretary to the Treasury, could present this viewpoint in a paper to such an august body and be so blatantly wrong, how are we to believe him today when he comes into this chamber and starts to criticise this Government for the way it is trying to renew this economy after 30 years of total and absolute negligence and wrong direction taking on the part of previous governments? At that conference Senator Stone said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Rather, I want to note the expectation of a strong growth of mineral exports on which they were based-an expectation I agree with. I want also to note that even in the brief time since those fears were current the outlook for energy exports has immeasurably strengthened. In short, in the decade ahead-
       </para>
       <para>
        we should remember that this was in 1979-
       </para>
       <para>
        there seems every reason to believe that we are going to be very successful at exporting.
       </para>
       <para>
        That brings me to my first major point which is this: the more successful, in the decade ahead, we prove to be at exporting, the more successful we are also going to have to be at importing.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on further about the impact of a future export based boom in Australia. How quaint and out of date those ideas of the young J. O. Stone, Secretary to the Treasury, now appear to be in a country in which imports are far outstripping exports, in which the mining and energy products boom has crawled to a standstill, leaving us with enormous infrastructure debts to service, and in which our competitiveness as a manufacturing country has only slightly improved. That is apart from the situation in which we find ourselves now in which the prices for our commodities have been reduced by a value close to $6 billion. Yet in that 1979 speech the young J. O. Stone, before his reincarnation in the Senate, was happily predicting a brave new world in which Australia in the future would be cashed up and would require more expenditure on imports to soak up the liquidity caused by an export boom especially in commodities-a boom which never occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        By coming into this chamber today to tell this Government how it should be organising the economy and to talk about the fundamental flaws in our economic thinking and economic policy, Senator Stone is exposed not only for the charlatan he was in those days but for the viewpoints that he had which were so totally wrong. Heaven help us if the treasury bench was to be occupied by the same man who was so wrong less than a decade ago. But, of course, Senator Stone was a victim of the circumstances of the day. He was reflecting a commonly held view amongst both the conservatives and Treasury-in many cases they were one and the same-and by their conservative political masters who governed this country for so long during that crucial period of the 1950s and 1960s. That was a time when Australia had sufficient prosperity to enable it to make vital structural changes that would make it competitive in the 1980s and 1990s.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, I am saying that the conservatives threw away the opportunity to change this country for the better and to do it with less pain than is now necessary under a genuine reformist Labor Government. To summarise that conservative attitude, I need to repeat the fallacy that has set us so far behind-the fallacy held and pushed by those people. First, they believed that the manufacturing industry in this country was less important to our national standard of living than it really is. They were prepared to protect the manufacturing industry behind a wall of high tariffs, import quotas and an overvalued dollar. But that protection had nothing to do with making it competitive in terms of export potential.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the government of those days was able to hide the structural problems by using a policy of heavy unemployment to dampen down consumer demand, sedating the economy in effect while simply waiting for something to turn up with our traditional exports. Thirdly, the conservatives believed that the international resources boom would solve Australia's problems, that we would be flooded with wealth from shale oil, coal, exported energy and other projects as described in their 1980 election campaign, which was an attempt to create a false picture of an expected boom. Fourthly, they borrowed as a Federal government and encouraged State governments, semi-government instrumentalities and Australian industry to borrow in massive amounts the loans necessary to fund infrastructure development for this anticipated boom. Fifthly, they were never able to address the issue of increasing productivity and creating a labour market that was not responsible for wage caused inflation. Their approach was fundamentally one that could be described as an ivory tower based upon the view that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the industrial relations structures needed to be abolished so that the law of the jungle would reduce union power and dampen down wage demands. This was a very simplistic view about what needed to be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        The conservatives were never able to do as this Government has done, which was to create changes within the existing structures that would increase productivity, reduce real wages, reduce industrial disputes and create an atmosphere of cooperation between unions, management and the economy. Because they would not take on the structures of the day and try to stretch them to accommodate the changes that we have been able to make, they were doomed to failure. They were simply trying to knock down Australia's industrial relations structures rather than trying to work productively within those structures.
       </para>
       <para>
        What have they learned from those past mistakes in which Senator Stone was intimately involved? The answer is almost nothing. For example, let us look at the labour market question that Senator Stone talks about so often and that Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned today. Senator Stone and his supporters continue to push the line that the accord between the Government and the unions is a disaster for Australia. Yet that flies in the face of the fact that for the first time since 1949 real wages have dropped in a time of high economic growth. That is a vital factor in making Australia competitive and taking the problem of wage demand caused by inflation out of the system. For example, since 1949 there have been five occasions when a year of weak economic growth has been followed by at least three years of strong economic growth. Much of the benefits of that strong economic growth has been diminished by the fact that real wages did not decline or stay static and increased in most cases during those periods of boom by at least 6.7 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where was the Australian government in those days? Who was in charge of the Treasury? It was none other than J. O. Stone, the man who is bringing before this Senate today a criticism of the way in which this Government is operating in terms of its economic reform and its attention to the fundamental issues that confront this economy. The accord has been today's Government's method of achieving growth without an increase in real wages, in other words, maintaining some competitiveness on a wage level with our counterparts overseas. That could only have been done through the accord, and in no other way. It involved cooperation, understanding and a broadening of the issues in relation to our discussions with the unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have set out in terms of industry plans to try to make Australian manufacturers more competitive. It will not be achieved overnight. We have had 30 years of conservative government, 30 years of conservative policy to overcome. The trouble with the economic debates that occur in this chamber is that people are looking at what is happening now, today and maybe tomorrow. They are not looking at the long term development of policy, the long term implementation of policy, and the cooperation that is necessary within the Australian community to achieve those goals and make sure that we are part of a world marketplace. That is to do with attitudes and will not be changed overnight.

         —The matter of public importance we are considering relates to the failure of the Government's policy to deal with the fundamental problems of the economy. Senator Aulich's contribution makes it very clear what the problem is. The Government does not seem to understand in the slightest what the real fundamental problems of our economy are. We are living beyond our means to the tune of $22 billion a year. Since this Labor Government came to power we have borrowed $85 billion to maintain our current standard of living. We are now the third most indebted country in the world to overseas banks. We have just overtaken Mexico. It is often said that this debt is largely private and therefore it does not matter. The Government's own Reserve Bank made it quite clear that that was economic nonsense. Debts, whether private or public, have to be serviced out of the Australian economy. In any case the reason there is so much private borrowing overseas is the economic policies of the Government, the drying up of savings, the fact that it is now easier and cheaper to borrow overseas than to try to borrow in Australia. This is the inevitable result of the economic policies of the Government.

        We are like a family living recklessly beyond our means on hire purchase and credit cards, saying, `Look how well we are doing'. Eventually the credit card debts and the hire purchase debts come in. They are coming in now for this Government. How did this Government get us in this appalling mess? When it took office in 1983 there was a world recession. In this country there was the most severe drought of modern times. It had the benefit of a wage freeze introduced by the Fraser Government. Straight after it took office the world recession ended and our terms of trade improved. The drought broke. I am sure that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) thinks that it was his intervention that broke the drought. Economically it was very dramatic. In the first year or so of this Government things were improving economically. It was nothing to do with the Government; it was entirely to do with external factors.

       <para>
        In the early years of the Labor Government the Treasurer, Mr Keating, introduced some beneficial economic management plans. They were, in fact, coalition policies that were in the pipeline when the government changed. But at least he introduced them. Unfortunately, there was one crucial failure. He deregulated the financial markets but did not deregulate the labour market. In that respect he has the worst of all worlds. That system cannot work. He has deregulated the financial markets but kept the labour market very rigid. As we have seen in the last six years that is a recipe for disaster. Nevertheless, the deregulation efforts of Mr Keating did get him the award for the world's best finance Minister. What his supporters do not often mention is that two years later he was the runner-up for the title of the world's worst finance Minister. They do not mention that very much. That is a more realistic appraisal of the consequences of having this Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the Treasurer used up the ideas he inherited he has frankly just run out of ideas. He now uses vulgar and childish abuse when anyone questions what he is doing, abuse at a level most year 11 students would regard as excessively juvenile. His problem also is that he picks up on ideas that he only half understands. He thinks they are the cure-all for our problems. Do honourable senators remember the J-curve and how that was going to cure our balance of payments problems? We do not hear of the J-curve these days. We were told that interest rates would solve the problem of excessive demand created, incidentally, by the Government's economic policies. Interest rates were going to be held tight and we were going to cure our economic problems, ignoring the negative effects of these high interest rates and the very great pain they inflict on people, particularly home owners. To some extent he is trying to alleviate that by a rather sordid deal of $200m with the banks to hold down interest rates on home loans. He ignored the fact that others have to pay for those and, nevertheless, he did that. He ignored the pain of that. He ignored the effect of high interest rates on investment which he desperately needed in the manufacturing industry. He ignored the effect on inflation, which, at 7 to 8 per cent, is much higher than that of our competitors. Above all, he ignored the very great damage that these high interest rates do to the value of the Australian dollar, holding it higher than it should be on economic terms and making our exports and import replacements much more difficult.

        The Government has nowhere to go. What it is hoping for rather forlornly is some export upsurge. The problem is that, in the two key areas of wool and wheat, there will be no upsurge this year. Wool prices are down and wheat quantities are down, so we cannot look for any help there.

         —A billion dollars down, as Senator Crichton-Browne says, for wool this year. That has to be made up some other way. Any halfway economically literate government would be looking at ways of solving this problem. What must the Government do? Firstly, one would think that it would be looking at improving internal savings so that it does not have to borrow so much overseas. Personally I am in favour of a consumption tax which would improve savings, provided-I emphasise `provided'-it was matched by a corresponding fall in the take from income tax. Nevertheless, the extraordinarily inept handling of the whole consumption tax issue by the Treasurer has put it off the political agenda for some years, to the great detriment of the economy of this country.

        Then one would think that the Government would look at other ways of raising income, and one is tourism. What has this Government done to tourism? It has engineered the most stupid and damaging strike in recent memory. The airline pilots strike has done enormous damage to our tourism industry, and not just temporarily; it will be years before our tourism industry recovers from the damage done by the Government very largely but not entirely, because the airline pilots have a good deal to answer for. Basically, the handling of the dispute by the Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, has been extraordinarily clumsy and stupid, with great damage to this country and its tourism industry in particular.

        Then one would think the Government would realise that we must have more exports. One would think that it would look at mining. What does it do for the mining industry?

        One would think also that any halfway rational government would look at improving our ports and shipping, because they are central to any exports. The Government has not tackled the problems with our ports. It has done a deal with the unions so that they get about $250m, or $100,000 per person. The productivity rise promised I doubt will ever be delivered. The unions say quite frankly that they can give no guarantees that it will be delivered. We do not have time to discuss all of the manifold defects of our coastal shipping and overseas shipping industries, but they are very severe and have not been seriously tackled by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Above all, one would think that the Government would be tackling manufacturing productivity. In the six years of this Government, the rise in manufacturing productivity is almost zero. In six years it has not done anything. Productivity in other countries is rising steadily; ours is not. Not only are we not catching up, but we are falling further and further behind. Australians can be very productive. In the agricultural sector we are probably the most productive country per head in the world. If we could get rid of the shackles that the Government and our industrial relations system impose on the Australian worker, we could be one of the most productive countries in the world. We have to tackle these problems, and the Government just does not.
       </para>
       <para>
        I listened with some interest to the solution to these problems that was put forward by Senator Haines on behalf of the Australian Democrats. On my understanding of what she was saying, she seemed to be espousing the doctrine of General Peron, the President of the Argentine, who led the Argentine down the track to a total economic collapse. The only bit of Peronism that Senator Haines forgot to mention was a reference to the shirtless ones. I do not think that we can pay much attention to their solutions, but what we must look at is what the Opposition can do that the Government does not do. We will inherit a real mess next year. There are many things that we must tackle. The first is that we must control government expenditure so that we are living within our means: not what we would like to do but what we can afford to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, we must privatise as many government instrumentalities as possible. By the way, the aim is not to transfer a public monopoly to a private monopoly. Although it would be a bit better, a private monopoly is not that much better than a public one. What we must do is to privatise so as to increase competition because competition is the key to economic efficiency. That must be the aim of our privatisation-to improve competition, to remove monopolies. And the Government will not tackle privatisation. It talks about it but it does nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third area which we must tackle but which the Government will not tackle is industrial relations. Our industrial relations are a very unhappy blend of English trade union systems and multiple unions with a `them and us' philosophy. We have a highly centralised and legalistic wage fixing and dispute settling mechanism, a system that was fashionable in the 1890s and has proved over a 100 years not to work. Finally, we have a very unfortunate division of responsibility between Federal and State governments imposed by our Constitutions. The results are awful.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we desperately need and must work towards if we wish to get out of our economic mess is an industrial relations system that has one union in each workplace so that the people in each workplace are insulated from disputes in other workplaces that do not concern them. Finally, the workers in each workplace, in each enterprise, must have an involvement in the success and profitability of their enterprise, both in the wage fixing area and in the profit sharing area. These are the things we must do. We must work towards those as quickly as we can. Without that, we are heading steadily down the South American road.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is moving in the opposite direction from this. What it wants is bigger, more powerful and more influential unions, with multiple unions in each workplace in most cases-very powerful ones, totally divorced from the local concerns. In my view, this would be an economic disaster. As I said, the Government is opposed to privatisation. It will not move down that road at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will not restrain expenditure. It believes in buying off its friends. Remember the $150m given to the waterfront, to buy off workers who have not been doing a proper day's work for years, and buying off Kodak with $60m to stay in Australia. Look at what it is doing for its friend Sir Peter Abeles in the airline industry. Look at what it did for Alan Bond. What it is doing is using public money to buy off its friends. It tries to buy off-or buy, I suppose, rather than buy off-its other friends in the environmental movement by taking economically disastrous decisions because they will be popular with the environmental movement. I do not say for a moment that environmental factors should not be properly taken into account in making economic decisions, but this Government is handling them by making irrational and economically very damaging decisions without proper consideration of anything other than what it thinks will affect the results in the ballot boxes in marginal seats. That is not the way to run a successful economy. This Government is a total economic failure. The sooner this country is rid of it, the better.

         —One disappointing aspect of the debate this afternoon, until we came to the last speaker-and I shall mention something about him in a moment-has been that the Opposition has not articulated to the Australian public what its alternative strategy is, if it has one. It is not necessarily disappointing to have criticism of the Government, as we had this afternoon, but it is disappointing that the criticism has not been tempered with some indication to the Government and to the public of what the alternative strategy of the Opposition is. I can remember well that, when we were in opposition and had debates like this, we were critical of the Government-and rightly so-but we also outlined our alternative strategy. Over months, and perhaps even years, it was possible for the Australian public to see the Australian Labor Party's strategy. It was possible for that to be debated in here and in the community. That is probably the reason why we are now on this side.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        All we heard today from the Opposition, until we heard the last speaker, Senator Hamer, was criticism. At least he put down some alternative roads that perhaps the Government and the country could look at going down. Unfortunately, at present the Opposition is not willing to take some of those roads. For instance, we have been told that, in the event of a change of government, there would not be a consumption tax in the first term but that it would perhaps be looked at after that. Some of the aspects that Senator Hamer mentioned, such as privatisation, probably are part of the Opposition's strategy. Privatisation does not fit readily with the stance of many on this side of the House, but I would have preferred speakers opposite to at least put forward some strategy, and perhaps to outline an Opposition strategy, rather than the type of personal strategy that Senator Hamer put forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        The alternative strategy that the Government does have is the Opposition's economic plan, which was much vaunted. It was a frequently debated plan but it is now a really discredited plan. After years of thought, planning and analysing the Opposition has come up with a dud. I suppose that the Opposition believes that its economic plan is an irresistible vote catcher. I was rather amazed to see something recently which reminded me of these irresistible vote catchers. It happened in Queensland. On the very hour that the election date was announced, the Minister in charge of transport in Queensland, whoever that was-it is pretty hard to keep up with Queensland because it has had 36 Ministers in the last three years-said, `We've got something that we'll give the Queensland public as soon as we're re-elected, although it won't be until July next year: every child will be able to travel for one dollar a week on the trains in Queensland'. I presume he meant the suburban trains. One dollar a week for all children sounded very good, until it was realised that some children already travel free as they have free passes to go to school.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will go back to the policy on which the credibility of this Opposition rests. Senator Robert Ray and, I think, Senator Aulich mentioned that the Opposition's economic plan was flawed according to Department of Finance assessments. Apparently even Mr Connolly seemed confused by the figures in his own policy on child-care. My old friend Ron McAuliffe used to refer to David Miles Connolly as `David Smiles Cunningly'. But I do not think that Mr Connolly was smiling this week when he became confused about his policy on child-care. It is no wonder that this afternoon's attack did not try to rely on this as an alternative. It just cannot be done. The credibility of the Opposition as a potential government is now in tatters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Stone waxed at length about the balance of payments and overseas debt, but he and the Opposition have comprehensively failed to address any practical solutions to Australia's balance of payments and external debt. Instead, Mr Peacock-and therefore Senator Stone by implication-has chosen to base his entire economic strategy upon the most vulnerable area of his policy, which of course is wages. It must be remembered that the Opposition has never presided over an economy governed by the vagaries of a floating exchange rate. Having not done that, it fails to comprehend the effects of fluctuating global economic conditions on Australia's external debt. It fails to appreciate the subsequent domino effect of the type of wages breakout which would have resulted from the Opposition's capitulation to the demands of the airline pilots. The previous speaker, Senator Hamer, mentioned something about that dispute, but he did not analyse its underlying dangers to the Australian economy. He glossed over them, as so many in the Opposition have done. The Opposition fails to understand the enormous brutality of overseas markets, particularly if they are offended in policy terms. It seems not to be concerned about how dependent we are on often fragile markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the domestic front. The Opposition would choose to shatter the successful consensus model, which has ushered in an unprecedented era of wage restraint and industrial harmony. As my colleague Senator Aulich said just a few minutes ago, the Opposition seems to be obsessed with destroying the accord and would, in the process, court international concern as the stability of Australia's wages policy was opened up. The failure of the Opposition to appreciate the watershed and disastrous effect of a fractured wages policy on the external financial markets would result in it consigning this nation to the economic dustbin.
       </para>
       <para>
        The destruction of the accord mechanism in favour of direct bargaining is the Opposition's plan. Yet enterprise bargaining outside any system of industrial jurisdiction would result in wage increases far greater than under an accord. Wage increases would be far greater for some time, but I wonder whether in the long term this would be in the best interests of the economy. I believe that it would not. We would probably end up with what has often been predicted by Senator Stone, namely, a recession. I sometimes wonder whether that is what the Opposition wants. In a recession interest rates would be far higher than they are now. In a recession the Opposition would see us walking away from an agreed income determination structure to one in which craft unions had to negotiate with individual enterprises. Under this type of policy, whereby we might be moving towards a recession, we would be staring down the barrel of interest rates much higher than they are now.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the sort of grim scenario that Australians would be faced with under a Peacock, Hewson and Stone-if he is re-elected to the seat of Fairfax-economic plan. Compare this recipe for a recession and resultant collapse in investment with the Government's firm resolve to continue with the wages accord; compare it with the Government's determination to press on with the restructuring of our manufacturing base and its plans to create a position for bringing into balance the overseas trade deficit. The Opposition has failed to take the hard decisions and present the Australian public with a strong alternative economic policy. The Government is proud to stand by its record in the field of economic management and innovative policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unlike almost any other government in the developed world, the Hawke Labor Government has successfully implemented a strategy which has attacked inflation and unemployment at the same time. The Government has recognised that only through a growing economy can effective assistance be provided to the needy in the community. Our economic strategy, forged with the Australian people and the trade union movement through the accord, has been an outstanding success. It is worth mentioning that Australia has emerged from the inherited Fraser doldrums economy of 1983 to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world. I can well remember being in this place in 1982 and the early part of 1983 when, month after month, more and more people became unemployed. That contrasts with what has happened since we have been in government. More than 1 1/2 million jobs have been created. More than 1 1/2 million more people are now in the work force, being productive and not a drain on the economy, than would have been the case if we had carried on with the strategies of the Fraser Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Inflation is not as low as we would like, but it must be remembered that it is far lower than it was when we came to government in 1983. The massive Budget deficit of the Fraser years has been transformed into a record surplus. We have reformed the Australian economy and we are restructuring and modernising our manufacturing base to ensure that we can compete effectively in the international marketplace. The Government has been the party of change, of reform on an unparalleled scale and of innovation and ideas. Under this Government the financial system has been deregulated, the tax system has been made fairer, the labour market is being restructured and we are eliminating abuse in the welfare system. Australia has become more flexible, more dynamic and more competitive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part of the revitalisation of our manufacturing base has relied on modernisation through the purchase of new equipment. Obviously, much of this equipment must be purchased overseas, and this investment has placed pressure on the balance of payments. The major component of imports driven by demand for capital goods accounted for approximately 40 per cent of the increase in the total of imports. This naturally reflects to our detriment in terms of the balance of payments in the short term but, in the long run, this investment will give Australian industry a far greater capacity to produce export and import-replacing output. This will be vital to any substantial improvement in the balance of payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, the high demand for imported goods and machinery may continue to be reflected in a relatively high imbalance of payments. However, this Government has made a long term commitment to stimulate a sustained recovery of those many manufacturing industries which ground into obsolescence under the inertia of the economy during the Fraser Government. The strategy of the Hawke Labor Government is to cut the current account deficit, and is also directed towards stabilising and reducing the level of foreign debt which is currently growing at a rate that we do not think is satisfactory, and one which we are addressing. In relation to the matter before us, all I would say is that we look forward to criticism, but we also look for some strategy from the Opposition as to what it would do if it happened to be in government which would give us something to debate.

        This report from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) is most disappointing. It is a report which was called for by legislation passed in December last year, at the insistence of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, for this Parliament to be informed about two particular innovations on the part of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). They are, firstly, the profile system in a unified national system of higher education in this country, which has been a great step backwards because of its centralised control of higher education and, secondly, the higher education contribution scheme-the graduate tax-and the impositions it has brought to Australia's 400,000 higher education students. Because of these quite important innovations we in this Parliament wanted to know, periodically, what the evaluation by the Higher Education Council of these two schemes is and the Council, through NBEET, has reported to the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        First of all, the report is disappointing because it is late. Parliament insisted, in the Bill that was before it then, that there be reports in February and August. Here it is, towards the end of October, and the Minister has brought this report to our attention only now. Already there is planning in train, not only by the Minister and his Department, NBEET and higher education institutions, but even by us in this Parliament, with regard to schemes for next year, and we have been delayed in gaining this report until the end of October.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, there is nothing in the report of any real substance. There is a brief mention of the higher education contribution scheme that detailed that conclusions on the impact of the scheme would not be able to be made-I quote from page 9-`until February 1990 at the earliest'. So, a full year and a half of planning and operation of this new scheme and its impact on all of the higher education students in Australia will not be able to be evaluated in the way that this Parliament has called for until February next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Minister sits on the report from the Higher Education Council in the way in which he has on the August and February reports this year, the Parliament will not see it perhaps until after Easter. By that time we might be in the last weeks of the Hawke Labor Government because the election would be upon us and there would be a change of government but without this Parliament having the up-to-date evaluation of the higher education contribution scheme. It is not good enough to give vague statements in this manner when the Parliament has expressly called for a more detailed response. With regard to profiles, I find it perplexing that the Higher Education Council, including its chairman, Dr Gregor Ramsey, has chosen language in this report that is totally accommodating to the Minister's White Paper, totally accommodating to the Minister's views of being integrated with the Department. I have yet to see any substantial conclusion from NBEET or the Higher Education Council in these crucial and controversial areas which has in any way differed from the Minister or the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Higher education institutions and this Opposition are yet to see any credibility in independent advice about these matters. So it is a disappointing report. It is flimsy. It is thin. It is preliminary. I can only say that we look forward to a more substantial report subsequently. I am afraid it will be too late because by that time the Hawke Labor Government will be over.

       I rise to speak to the medical research report 1988 put out by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). This report tells us that Australia has a very high reputation in the field of medical research and deservedly so. The report documents a large number and a very considerable range of research projects which have been funded by the NHMRC under the Medical Research Endowment Act. While appreciative of the amount and high quality of the research which is described in this report I wish to make some comments about the broad direction of medical research in this country as revealed in the report.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first point I would like to make is that I gain the impression from the report that the primary focus of medical research in Australia is on the cure of disease and the correction of problems rather than on prevention. I believe that it is time for the NHMRC to review the focus of its research activities and to begin to place the emphasis on research which will improve our ability to prevent sickness and accidents. Over the past 80 years or so medical research aimed at the curing of disease has had some spectacular successes. Mortality rates have been reduced and life expectancy has been increased. But as things now stand, it would appear likely that greater and greater expenditure on research aimed at finding cures will yield relatively smaller rates of success than in the past. Research in these areas which yields successful techniques tends to result in high technology medical developments which are increasingly expensive. As our national health bill grows from year to year and consumes more and more of the funds available to the Government to provide services to the community, the time must inevitably come when we simply will not be able to afford to use all of the high technology medical options which may be available to us. It is also true that the high technology curative options which are often invasive, while these may prolong life, do not necessarily yield improved quality of life. On the other hand, research which promotes prevention will yield enormous benefits at relatively small cost. This would also tend to preserve an enhanced quality of life at the same time.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have scanned the report to ascertain whether the NHMRC is involved in any research into the prevalence and prevention of iatrogenic disease in Australia. As far as I can see this topic is not covered in any of the research projects documented in the report. Iatrogenic disease is disease or disability brought about unintentionally by doctors and other health workers in their attempts to cure problems reported to them by patients. Iatrogenic disease may result from incorrect diagnosis, leading to incorrect treatment and the exacerbation of the condition or the development of new problems. It may result from gross errors. It may result from errors in prescription-overprescription and overservicing-or it may result from sociological factors.
      </para>
      <para>
       I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that on 8 June I spoke of the use of epidural injections of a drug known as Dep-romedrol which is used for the treatment of back pain. I tabled a number of statutory declarations from persons who claim that their health had been adversely affected by this form of treatment. I am certain that there are other forms of iatrogenic disease which are as damaging, as expensive and as unrecognised as were these epidural injections which I raised just some weeks ago. I am glad to be able to report that the Western Australian Department of Health has now approached the NHMRC and asked it to investigate the epidurals. I hope that a research project will soon be launched on this issue.

        —I rise very briefly to put on the record some of the good work that epidural injections and the drug Depromedrol can do for people. I received that treatment a number of years ago. It gave me a very great deal of relief from very intense pain-pretty near crippling pain-at that point in time. During the time that I was receiving that medical treatment it brought me into contact with a number of other people with whom I shared hospital wards who also received tremendous relief from intense and almost crippling pain. I think there was some publicity generated, not only in my home State of Western Australia but in other States throughout the nation, from an earlier speech of Senator Jenkins casting fear into the minds of people who may benefit from this drug and this procedure.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is unfortunate that such fear can be brought about in the minds of people simply because a senator makes a statement. What concerns me most is that people who might receive advantage and benefit from such treatment might choose not to. Certainly, different people have different metabolisms and different procedures affect different people in different ways. There are people in our community who cannot take the drug penicillin-a very popular and very important drug in our society. It is unfortunate that this fear is generated in the minds of people. It is actually irresponsible to raise these issues without the benefit of detailed research, detailed factual analysis and a deep understanding of the benefits of the procedures and these drugs.
      </para>
      <para>
       I welcomed the closing statement by Senator Jenkins who called for research but I think our first step in talking about drugs and procedures in this way should be to call for the research rather than to go out and to condemn the drug and to condemn the practitioners who give people relief; people like myself who, probably in the very near future-hopefully not-will need that drug and the procedure to keep upright and to maintain a place in the community.

        —That is right; quite the contrary. Nor has it done many other people harm. As is so often the case with the Australian Democrats, we might get isolated incidents where people are affected in a counterproductive way by the application of any particular thing and the Democrats blow it up to try to get some mileage, a few cheap political votes. It is very sad that Senator Jenkins has not actually talked to some of the medical practitioners who administer epidurals. Epidurals are of enormous benefit. Anyone who has been in the position I have been in would know this. I can only talk from my own personal point of view in terms of the benefit I gained from the procedure after suffering two very serious whiplashes. I was absolutely and utterly incapacitated. I had two epidurals, and I know how different my life is today. Senator McKiernan has had serious car accidents as well.

      <para>
       It is a great tragedy that the Democrats, Senator Jenkins in particular, can come in here and belittle a procedure that is so beneficial to so many people. It can get them back to work. It can get them off special benefits. It can get them off unemployment benefits. It can get them back into the work force and alleviate a lot of pain and suffering, not only for the individual but for the family. I suggest, with respect, Mr President, that Senator Jenkins actually get out there and talk to some of the people who have received great benefit from this procedure. It is a great tragedy if she pursues this line without due consideration of the benefits that are attached to it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The medical research report highlights the intricacies of a lot of these procedures and how important they are to us as a community, to say nothing of how important they are to individuals. I do not know whether Senator Jenkins has ever had an epidural but maybe it would help her. She might get some sense as a result. It is a tragedy that she has continued over a period of months and months to come in here and push the line that she has pushed. If she is not aware of some of the medical practitioners who perform this procedure I would be only too happy to provide her with the names of those medical practitioners. They are very concerned that they are now being pushed into the position of not being able to adequately treat their patients because of the terrorism that has been attached to this procedure by Senator Jenkins. It is important that Senator Jenkins not only talks to the practitioners but also talks to those who have actually undergone the treatment.

         —I am glad to hear that from the Deputy Government Whip because this report outlines the Government's failure to undertake the key areas of economic reform which are absolutely essential and which the Opposition has been repeatedly asserting must be undertaken if Australia is to get out of its current economic mess. We have already had the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia dramatising this Government's monumental incompetence and failure to proceed with the policy solutions which the Reserve Bank says are urgent, essential, immediate and all the other imperative terms that it used in its fascinatingly, refreshingly frank annual report. Now we have EPAC outlining the fact that, in the many areas of economic reform that are needed, this Government simply has not faced up to what has to be done.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government's policies are not addressing the problems. EPAC says, basically, that the task will not be an easy one, that is, the basic task we face of getting the current account deficit down. We had another disastrous figure again today. The Government's Budget forecast of how much further Australia would go into debt this year, how much more we could go down the gurgler, has been massively shot to pieces already. The incredible thing that this report shows is that the Government simply is not meeting the major targets that must be met if we are ever to get out of our problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the current problems? What are the Government's policies? Certainly none of the Government's policies in the Budget are addressing the major question of inflation. According to the Budget figures, inflation is set to remain roughly at the same level as last year. We will certainly go further into debt, even according to the Budget estimates. We will go a lot further into debt than those Budget estimates show. It is interesting to see that the EPAC annual report talks about the need for higher sustained rates of domestic saving. What is the Government doing about that? It is doing absolutely nothing, either in its stated policies or in the latest annual report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The annual report says that the savings and exports tasks that Australia must face `would be greatly facilitated by decelerating inflation and stronger productivity growth'. What is the Government doing about that? It does nothing in the Budget. In fact, as I said, inflation will increase a little during this year. The report says that EPAC believes that `the psychology of inflation must be broken and a sustained community effort undertaken to attain income claims and maintain price restraint'. The Government is simply failing to address what EPAC says are the key things that must be done. EPAC says in the report that there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency and cost competitiveness of Australian industry. What is the Government doing about this?

         —What would the Opposition do about it? The Opposition has put out a clear, determined and readily understandable statement of what the Opposition will do when it is in government. It has been recognised by the media and all commentators as being a very effective political statement. What we want to know is: what is this Government going to do after six years, after six Budgets? All of the Government's forecasts continue to be totally wrong, not meeting the objectives which its own bodies say must be met. When is this Government going to come out with policies that address the problems which EPAC, for example, says are vital and which the Reserve Bank says must be met with urgency, but which this Government is sitting on its backside doing nothing about, watching Australia go continually and steadily down the gurgler?

         —I rise to speak on the annual report of the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC). I make the point very early in my contribution that the point of agreement between Senator Michael Baume and me relates to Senator Baume's open description of EPAC as a very competent and capable collection of individuals, a collection of individuals which, I note from the report, includes such notables in our society as Laurie Carmichael, the former Assistant National Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and now the Assistant Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It also includes the President of the ACTU and a number of Labor Party Premiers.

        We agree on the competency of the EPAC committee but I am afraid that after that we differ. Senator Baume then proceeded along familiar lines in criticising the Government and what the Government is doing with the economy. He then proceeded to attempt to sell the Opposition policies which were released 13 days ago. Those policies are already in tatters on the basis of the calculations and figures contained in the documents released by Mr Peacock. The Opposition parties have just now discovered child-care, which is a very important aspect of our society. Seven years ago, except for what the Australian Labor Party Opposition was saying, one did not hear anything about child-care.

         —Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. If I might say so, that is a very good ruling. The point of order was not necessarily taken on what I was saying. But I remind Senator Baume that if he cannot take the heat he should get out of the kitchen. Of course, Senator Baume is seeking to stifle any criticism from this side of the chamber relating to the Peacock economic statement. He has not succeeded in doing that and the criticism will continue. Not only will the criticism of what Mr Peacock had to say continue but also the Government will be putting out prior to the next election detailed economic policies-policies which will take Australia into the twenty-first century. Without going into the finite detail of the policies that will come from the Government, the difference will be that our figures will actually add up. Senator Newman seems to be surprised about that. But this is not the first occasion on which Opposition figures have not added up. They do not add up on this occasion and they did not two years ago prior to the last election. On that occasion our figures added up and they will continue to do so. I commend the report of EPAC to the Senate.

         —The second report of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure actually deals with an issue that goes back quite some time. After a very prolonged debate in this chamber on 23 October 1987, Senator Haines made some suggestions with regard to the length of time debates on the suspension of Standing Orders may continue that were the basis of this reference to the Procedure Committee. The Committee met and came up with a very short report. I think the fact that it is short illustrates fairly clearly that, on any rational view, the reasons for suspending Standing Orders in order to deal with matters of urgency ought to be debated within a very limited timeframe. The difficulty is-and, according to my memory, this stretches back to when I was on the Standing Orders Committee, which preceded the Procedure Committee-that we do not get a chance to address these issues. In fact this chamber seems incapable of addressing them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are concerned here essentially with the way in which we proceed. There is an enormous amount of debate in this place about how everybody else in the community ought to improve procedures and increase productivity. It goes on and on endlessly. When it comes to this place, we suddenly find that a reverse argument applies. There must be no changes, there must be no updating and there must be no streamlining of procedures to make this place work better.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts of the matter are that every year an increasing number of items come into this chamber, not just simply in terms of legislation but in terms of reports. We pass legislation which requires more reports. We pass legislation which requires more reference to the Parliament. We pass legislation that contains more disallowable instruments and so it goes on and on. We load more and more work on to this chamber, yet we seem to be unwilling to streamline our procedures to enable us to deal with it efficiently and effectively. There is no doubt that this chamber will resist sitting longer, so that is not an option. It already sits 30 per cent to 40 per cent longer than the House of Representatives and that is likely to continue, but we will not be sitting much longer than that. We will not be sitting anywhere near the length of sittings of the House of Commons or the United States Congress which actually sit twice as many days as this chamber each year. That will not occur. If that is so, it seems to me that we ought to have the gumption to tackle the procedures in this place when we get a report from a committee which says, `Let us get on and do this', or, `This is our recommendation'. At the very least we ought to get a vote on that. I bet my bottom dollar that when I finish my speech some honourable senator will stand up and actually move that we no longer consider this matter at this time. It will be a reiteration, quite precisely, of the points that I have been making in my speech now.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are seemingly incapable of streamlining our own procedures and becoming more effective because we deny ourselves a vote on it. Whether the vote goes one way or another, that is fine to me on this issue. I would like it to be carried, but if it is not we move on and look at some other way of dealing with the issue. For goodness sake, at some stage let us vote on the various reports from the Procedure Committee that have been piling up all over the place. Why do we have such a committee? When I was sitting on the Standing Orders Committee I thought that it was more like a committee on still life. The Committee used to meet and make reports, but we never got a vote out of this chamber. In the 2 1/2 terms of parliament in which I was sitting on that Committee we did not have one vote on an issue. We nearly voted on an issue; we spent four hours discussing whether we should read from notes or not. As I remember, that was defeated and we were not allowed to read our speeches, which I thought was a good result, but that was the only vote we had which was at the end of a very long debate. Ever since then I think that governments have been unwilling to provide the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The suggestion by Senator Haines with regard to the suspension of Standing Orders I think is eminently sensible, but whether we agree to it is not the point I want to make here. We ought to vote on whether we agree to it or not. I ask that at the end of this debate no one stands up and adjourns it yet again to another day until we get to the end of the term of this Parliament because that is what has happened with every other report. Let us actually bite the bullet and have a vote. If it is carried that is all right, if it is defeated that is all right, but at least we have had a vote on it.

         —As a matter of fact, I agree with the thrust of Senator Haines's suggestion and I have said so before. I have always thought that prolonged debate on the suspension of Standing Orders is a waste of time. If it is to be carried it is normally carried very quickly; if it is not to be carried the purpose of the people, usually the Opposition or a party such as the Australian Democrats who move for the suspension of Standing Orders, is to make a political point on a current issue. I think in terms of time allocated by this Senate for that sort of political point making-important though it may be-that half an hour is reasonable. Senator Macklin nods. I think he is about to shake his head. My problem with this, particularly in bringing it to a head today, is that there are widely divergent views on this matter. Discussing it as we are I think we have had a very prolonged debate today on the matter. If Senator Macklin remembers-I think he was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure-in order to bring it to a vote we undertook to consider a number of other measures in the package in December. I for one will be voting against any attempt to adjourn the debate without the Senate making a decision on that issue.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am open to argument as to whether in this particular motion, with which I repeat I agree, the allocation of five minutes speaking time is correct. Certainly I entirely agree with an allocation of not more than half an hour for the suspension of Standing Orders. It should be considered as part of that package and voted on separately when that package is considered. I would certainly resist any attempt to adjourn debate at that time without a formal decision by members of the Senate. As Senator Macklin says, we can reject it or accept it, but let us have a decision. I will be voting against any attempt to adjourn it. I hope that Senator Macklin will be with me when we vote again and make decisions on all the other matters raised by the Standing Committee on Procedure. I do not think it will be very rewarding trying to bring the matter to a head now. I think all we will do is provoke a very prolonged debate and anticipate the debate we will have again when this matter comes up in December.

         —I was speaking on the National Health Amendment Bill this morning and am pleased to take the opportunity, firstly, to reiterate a few remarks and, secondly, add some things that I did not have time to say this morning. Essentially, the Senate is debating the rejection of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal decision. I think that this is clearly nothing more than a straight political act by members of the Opposition. I made that point this morning and I think it is important to reiterate it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What members of the Opposition are doing in opposing the Tribunal decision is nothing more than prolonging debate on this issue. The decision by the Tribunal has been handed down and the Government accepts the Tribunal's decision. It is interesting to note that members of the Opposition also accepted it and they have said on a number of occasions that this legislation was theirs initially-it established the Tribunal precisely so that there could be an independent decision maker on these matters. Now they actually want to change their line and disagree with the Tribunal decision, not because they are committed to it in their hearts, but because they know that if they keep the debate running they will keep the pharmacists stirred up, the prospects of settlement of this set of negotiations on the boil and deferred and, therefore, that will be embarrassing for the Government. If they want to argue that there should be a serious commitment to the good of pharmacies, pharmacists, pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers, people employed in the pharmaceutical industry and people who actually go to pharmacists for health advice and medication, they could not possibly support what they are doing in here. It is nothing more than a cheap political stunt to try to keep the issue on the boil so as to prolong the argument in the community, give the pharmacists a false sense of prospect and defer the possibility of proper negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I was saying earlier, those negotiations are proceeding. They had almost reached completion in May. The Pharmacy Guild decided then not to accept the Government's offer and agreed that, as a consequence, it would go to the Tribunal. It has done that. The Tribunal's decision has been handed down, and those people speaking for the pharmacists are not prepared to settle for that. Having agreed that they would settle for it, they now seem to want to open the matter for negotiation. But I do not think that is the view of most pharmacists. Any of them involved in speaking with the Government would know that that matter is not open to negotiation. What is open to negotiation is the essential pharmacy allowance, the definition of what shall be an essential pharmacy, and of course the allowance for professional services provided by pharmacists. I believe that those matters are continuing to be discussed by the Guild and the Government and they are the matters that can be a proper part of continuing negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will say again, as it seems to be something that the Opposition wants to completely misrepresent in the community as well as in this chamber, that the Government recognises and acknowledges the importance of pharmacies, pharmacists and their professional contribution and work. It is vital for the Government's health care policy, let alone for anything else, that people in this community be provided with their pharmaceuticals and medications in the efficient way in which pharmacies around this country have provided them to this point. It is also quite proper for the Government, in looking at cost containment across the board, to look at the potential for cost containment in this area as well as in any other area of government expenditure. I am quite surprised that members of the Opposition come in here and argue that we should have cost containment when the only conclusion that we can draw on every position that they take is that they are actually about allowing continuing growth of outlays expenditure. What else can we conclude when they are not interested in seeking a solution here, are not seeking to support the Government on this matter, and are so tedious that they actually want to overturn a decision by the Tribunal? They are not interested in the broad play or in the provision of good pharmacy and pharmaceutical advice to the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        This morning I also said that the position of the Australian Democrats was bizarre in the extreme. They talk about costs being engendered by the doctors who write the scripts and seem to suggest that that is where we should tackle this issue of cost containment, but they should know very well that, if anyone were minded to interfere in the prescribing practices of a doctor in the treatment of a patient, not only would there be an outcry from the profession but also the Government would be outraged.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other point I made earlier which I think is worth reiterating is that cost containment needs to be examined across the whole range of services, not only in the engendering of scripts. It we want to accept that that may be the principal cause of costs, it is proper to look at the supply and delivery of those pharmaceuticals. If there is a potential for cost containment there, it is entirely proper and responsible for government to deliberate on that matter also.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage of my contribution I think it important to weigh up the cost of pharmaceuticals to the community. Australia and the Government can be very proud of the moderate cost to consumers of medications in this country. That is not something to be overlooked or dismissed lightly. If we are serious about the concern of the community as well as of the pharmacy profession, we must make sure that there is a proper balance between the costs to the community of medications and the costs to the pharmacists of delivering them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all of this there has been a campaign to confuse, particularly by the Opposition, which I find utterly disgraceful but entirely in character. Members of the Opposition do not actually target people who are in the position to know; they target those people who are most dependent on the provision of medications and who are most likely to be affected. Their scaremongering campaign has been targeted at pensioners in a very mischievous and, I think, fairly disgraceful way-to the point where pensioner groups in this country have actually appreciated that they have been the awful victims of a terrible campaign and have written in opposition to what they understand that campaign to be about. I would like to read again from a letter dated 20 October 1989 written to the Sydney Morning Herald by Noreen Hewett from the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation in Sydney:
       </para>
       <para>
        In Ashfield, two brand new pharmacies opened recently in competition with the plethora of long-established ones. The new ones didn't hesitate to display, along with almost all the others, propaganda in their windows to the effect that the Government `wants to close this pharmacy'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why open in such a competitive milieu if they didn't anticipate healthy profits? Patently they don't believe their own propaganda.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that the pensioners' organisations have realised that this vile campaign has been targeted at them, informing them wrongly that the cost of pharmaceuticals would increase, and so on. I think it is a very dangerous campaign. It is also important to note that the pensioners have appreciated that this is misinformation and have been at pains to say that they will no longer buy that misinformation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been very little effort to deal with the facts in this matter. In concluding my remarks, I would like to put a few facts on the record. There has been confusion about the truth in terms of pharmacy incomes. I would like to quote from Mr Robert Davies, Executive Director of the Pharmacy Guild, who wrote to the Canberra Times on 17 September. Mr Davies stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Contrary to Mr Waterford's implication, he is talking about gross incomes (from which all overheads must be met by the Pharmacists). Gross income per pharmacy rose by 81% in the past five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        That statement confirms claims by the Government about the incomes of pharmacists. I think we should stop asking whether they are lies and accept that quote by Mr Robert Davies, Executive Director of the Pharmacy Guild. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables. The first is a graph showing `Average Pharmacy Incomes (Profits)'. The source is the Pharmacy Guild of Australia Guild Digest 1989. The graph shows the average increase in pharmacy incomes compared with the consumer price index (CPI) over the same period. The average increase in pharmacy incomes was 83.6 per cent and the CPI increase for the same period was 41.8 per cent. In that time the average weekly earnings of the Australian work force increased by 38.6 per cent. The second table lists the number of chemist shops and shows a clear increase-although it tails off-in the number of pharmacies in Australia. As we have had some misinformation about the number of pharmacies, I seek leave to have those two tables incorporated in Hansard.

         —I thank the Committee. Finally, I would like to mention the campaign by some people in the Pharmacy Guild, or the community and pharmacy support group, known as CAPS, which I suppose is more accurately described as an offshoot of the New South Wales branch of the Pharmacy Guild. According to an article by Pilita Clark, that group has actually provided instructions which say, amongst other things:

The important point to make here is that it is very dangerous to use people involved in a profession in this way.

         —I am certainly not implying that they are stupid. I suggest that those women involved in the pharmacy industry would have access to a lot of information and would have no doubt contributed to the provision of pharmaceutical services. But I am not unaware that many times mischievously organised campaigns can actively lead to people getting the wrong end of the stick and campaigning for what they think are rights in a matter when they are not provided with access to the full information. The concerns of pharmacists, be they women or men, are something that the Government is very well aware of and concerned to take into account. But one cannot enter into negotiations or seek a satisfactory solution unless one is dealing with facts and talking with people who are fully aware of those facts and committed to a satisfactory outcome of the negotiations.

        It is disappointing that women are now being co-opted in political agendas in a way that is not the most convincing of women's activities. I only hope that those women who are now becoming politically aware and informed in this manner will continue to be politically involved and informed on a whole lot of other issues of concern to women. It is important that women in the pharmacy industry want to be involved in their profession; I have no objection to that. But I hope that they will be fully informed and will bother to make themselves fully informed about what are the exact terms for negotiation in this debate between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is concerned to seek cost containment within the pharmacy industry in the fairest and most just way. It is concerned to see medication continue to be provided to the community and in the least expensive way. It is concerned to make sure that the misinformation put about in the community on this matter is countered. It is particularly concerning for me and for the Government that campaigns of fearmongering and misinformation are being used to justify a case and are targeted to the people most in need of medication and most dependent on the proper services of the pharmacy industry.

        The best thing we can do is to accept the Tribunal's decision, as the Government has said, and proceed to finalise the negotiations and get a happy resolution that allows the continuing good practice of pharmacy in this country.

         —It was pretty cold and windy and anyone out there demonstrating must have really meant it. It is most significant that the women did demonstrate because in the debate we had previously on this issue it was mentioned that 80 per cent of prescriptions are written for women and that 80 per cent of the staff of pharmacies are women. So a reduction in the incomes of pharmacists will have a devastating effect on the employment of women in the pharmacy industry. With the enormous demonstration today we saw the antipathy that these people have to the actions of the Labor Government.

        I rise to lend my voice to the forces in the Senate that will insist on the Senate's amendments to the Government's National Health Amendment Bill, which seems to be such a minor Bill, just putting up the price of prescriptions by $1 and indexing that to the consumer price index-none of which money goes to the pharmacists anyway. The money goes to the Government, so it is an additional tax on people who require medication. In other words, the Government is hitting the lame, the sick and the blind with an additional tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The vital thing that the Government should realise-this point has been made before-is that it is not the chemists who generate the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). They merely dispense the prescriptions written by doctors. The Government has been trying to reduce dispensing fees and mark-ups for some time now. Some months ago it unilaterally reduced the dispensing fee. The chemists, under their agreement, decided that their rights had been infringed, took the Government to court and won their case. I do not see this attack on the chemists in isolation; we should see it in perspective.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another feature of Senator Crowley's speech was that she was intent on proving that this was not socialism at work. But it is socialism at work because this attack on chemists forms part of a concerted, relentless and remorseless attack on the professional people of this country. Who would want to be a pharmacist today? After the legislation dealing with the vocational registration of general practitioners, who would want to be a doctor today? Who would want to be a pilot today? Who would want to be a miner or a farmer? Who would want to be a radiologist or a pathologist? I make the point again that the Government unilaterally cut the number of items on the pathology list in half. The pathologists had to take the Government to court. We were muscled in the Senate and the Government forced the Bill through. The pathologists won their case in court as it was an incorrect action by the Government. All of those people have been under attack by this Government, which I suppose is part of the socialist plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note also that the economy is worsening all the time, which is also part of the socialist plan to wreck the economy and make such a mess of it that the Government has to institute centralised control. The Government blames everybody but itself for what is going on today. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) considers that he is on track. On talk-back radio this morning someone made the point that he certainly is not qualified in any way to handle the Treasury of this country whereas his Opposition counterparts, such as Senator Stone and Dr Hewson, are qualified to handle the Treasury of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has been heavy-handed about this. I noticed when Senator Cook was talking that he said that the Government had to accept the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal on the remuneration of pharmacists. But that was not so; it was only a recommendation, after all. In this case the Tribunal did not take a sufficient sample in order to come to a recommendation. It took a sample of 53 pharmacists out of about 5,500. It did a few telephone surveys after that. I suppose it realises the error of its ways. Telephone surveys are notoriously inaccurate anyway. But to take a sample of 53 pharmacies out of 5,500 and come up with a recommendation for them all is an entirely inadequate sample and really an unprofessional way for that Tribunal to behave. That is what the pharmacists have been kicking about since the inception of this row, which has gone on and on.
       </para>
       <para>
        I notice that the Government has now deferred the implementation of this measure for some time. This shows that it now realises it is in a shaky position. It wants to go on negotiating but it does not want to come to any conclusion that will help the pharmacists. The Government wants to reduce pharmacists' incomes. But many of them are already stretched financially. Pharmacies today look more like supermarkets than pharmacies and sometimes chemists are out in the street with a microphone or megaphone trying to sell to the people wares other than dispensed wares.

In pharmacies one has to walk through aisles of supermarket-type gear in order to get to the small dispensary at the back of the pharmacy.

       <para>
        Pharmacists will not store expensive drugs, particularly as they are the least used drugs at the moment, if that is at a cost to them and they lose money by doing so. By reducing the income of pharmacists the pharmacies that are most likely to shut are the ones that are least economic. This does not mean that they are bad pharmacies. It means that these pharmacies are providing a service that the other pharmacies are not. The older pharmacies provide that sort of service and have not expanded into the supermarket area as vigorously as perhaps new and younger pharmacies have. Those pharmacies will be the first to go. The pharmacies in one-pharmacy towns are probably not economic. But the pharmacists operating them are getting a small amount of job satisfaction out of doing the job. Until now they have been prepared to wear the lower income. The measure the Government is taking now will stretch things far too far. The Government says that it will provide an essential pharmacy allowance. The Government is deciding which is an essential pharmacy and which is not. Here again we have socialism in action because that is straight out social engineering with the Government telling people what they will do and where they will work. The Opposition is not into that kind of game.
       </para>
       <para>
        When Senator Cook was speaking he said that the Opposition was following the policies of greed, envy, hatred and avarice. That is not so. He says that we are trying to feed the greedy chemists. That is the usual argument that the Government uses in its attack on professional people. Previously we had the greedy doctors, the greedy radiologists, the greedy pathologists and now we have the greedy pharmacists. It is the normal socialist argument to generate hatred and antipathy against whoever is coming under attack at the moment. The Labor Government is actually following the politics of greed, envy, hatred and avarice because it is exploiting the fact that chemists are professional people who do charge people. The Government says they are charging too much and earning too much.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am opposed to the social engineering aspect of this legislation. I am opposed to the fact that the Government is dictating to the chemists almost what drugs they will keep in their shops because they cannot afford to keep the more expensive ones. The more expensive drugs are the drugs that are used in preventative medicine to treat the illnesses that are more expensive when they occur and require greater hospitalisation. It is cheaper to use the expensive drugs for preventative medicine than it is to force patients to forgo them and require more expensive hospital care for the conditions that they have. I am particularly thinking of the cardiovascular accidents at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The thrust of this legislation is that it is all bad; there is not a good thing we can say about it. The Government is refusing to see this point. Not only that, but judging from Senator Crowley's speech, she was deluded into thinking that what she is doing is for the greater good of the community. She says it might be stretching the pharmacists a little but she has a higher responsibility to anybody else. The Government should realise that the whole health edifice exists for the patients. That is what we invented it for. This measure can have nothing but deleterious effects on the patients.

Pharmacists are even more resolute in fighting the injustice that this Hawke Labor Government is inflicting upon them and the public is rallying to their side. The Government is exerting itself in spreading misinformation. It was very sad to hear Senator Crowley bleating not once but twice in this debate, just before the lunch break and just now at the resumption of the debate. Yet she did not even have the courage to go out to the front of Parliament House today and talk to the women in pharmacy. She talks and bleats endlessly in this place and outside, saying that she represents women and women's interests. But when she is in the gun she will not go out there. Where was her colleague Senator Reynolds, who represents women's interests? She was absent. Where was Senator Giles? She was absent. Where was Senator Zakharov? She was absent. Where were all the women from the House of Representatives in the Australian Labor Party? They were absent. Where was Mr Staples? Heaven only knows!

All I can say to that is if that is not hypocritical, what is? If that is not objectionable, what is? If that is not patronising, what is? She does not care about that. She just goes on and on. It was a wonderful piece of tall poppy chopping-the politics of envy of Senator Crowley-because she believes that the Labor Party looks after all the little people. It sounds a bit like Senator Robert Ray when in this chamber on 16= October 1989 he said, `We will always stand for looking after the less well off in the community'. The less well off are people such as Abeles, Harris, Murdoch, Packer, Connell, Bond, the banks and Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. The list goes on and on. They are the less well off, according to this Government, not the pharmacists or the pharmacy assistant who are standing to lose their jobs because of the pig-headedness of this Government.

         —Or the pensioners, as Senator Tambling interjects. The pensioners are the people who are going to lose because of the pig-headedness of this Government. Yet we have a Minister in this place who represents Minister Staples who does not have the faintest idea about what this Bill is going to do for pharmacy. He could not even get hold of procedure in this place, let alone the subject of the debate this morning.

        The great problem for the pharmacy industry in Australia generally with this Government is the fact that the Government has been unwilling to budge on what it must know and understand to be the wrong decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. It says, `We cannot change it'. Then we get Minister Staples sending out pamphlets to all and sundry. I do not know how many copies my office received but it was too many. They are Government propaganda, paid for by the taxpayers. They are headed `The truth and nothing but the truth about the cost and supply of prescription medicines'. I will go so far as to say that that needs to be reworded. It should read `The truth and nothing like the truth about the cost and supply of prescription medicines'. The Government says that the PBS will cost Australia $1,500m this year and $600m will go to the pharmacists; the average chemist will receive $100,000 for handling prescriptions. What a whole lot of rot! This is claimed to be the truth. It is nothing like it. According to the Federal Budget, spending on the PBS for 1989-90 is actually $1,330m. The figure of $100,000 per chemist is pure and utter fantasy. The average pharmacist faces a cut of $26,000, with average PBS remuneration over the last six years having risen to 46 per cent compared with a 51 per cent rise in the consumer price index and a 52 per cent rise in average weekly earnings.

        Senator Crowley comes in here waving doctored tables around such as the doctored research that has been done of late. How about the other research that shows exactly what the community thinks about pharmacy? That is a different kettle of fish. No, the Government will not release the information about that. The research shows that 55 per cent of the people believe that the pharmacists have a better case in the debate and 13 per cent believe that the Government has, and the 13 per cent have probably been fed the taxpayer subsidised propaganda. That is why they believed it, but any thinking Australian knows that the pharmacists are the ones in the gun. Of course, the Government wants to look after the less fortunate in the community such as Sir Peter Abeles, Laurie Connell, Kodak and the banks! But there has been no change at all since the Government tried to hoodwink the Pharmacy Guild of Australia in the Government's lack of preparedness to face facts and negotiate with pharmacists rather than confront them. All the Government wants to do is confront them. It has had the doctor bashing exercises, the farmer bashing exercises and now it is convenient to have a pharmacist bashing exercise.

        The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) recently visited my State of Western Australia and made it clear that the Government will not budge an inch from the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to cut income by 23 per cent. I wonder whether the Minister for Housing and Aged Care or the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is in the chamber, would like their income cut by 23 per cent. Oh, no, ministerial incomes are a different thing altogether. They just go through with a wink and a nod, do they not?

        We now have the spectacle of this Labor Government threatening Western Australian pharmacists with the Crimes Act if they take action next month to recoup the loss of $1.05 by a charge to customers-customers who are often eager to pay this rise to see that the community pharmacy does not go down the gurgler as this Government wishes it to do. In Western Australia we now have an umbrella group called Pharmacy WA, which was formed to resist the destructive policy of the Government which, in characteristic fashion, seeks to misrepresent it as a splinter group rather than a group representing all pharmacists. In the same way, Senator Crowley said a little while ago that the thousand-plus women who made their way here in pouring rain today and stood in the rain to voice their opinion, to which she was not concerned enough to listen, did not represent women in pharmacy. How would she know? She did not have the courtesy to go and talk to them.

         —How would I know? Because I talked to them, and I have talked to them in Western Australia. Where was the Minister? Nowhere to be seen. Probably that was a blessing for them. When Minister Staples went on radio in Perth on Monday morning, he kept saying that average pharmacy remuneration was $79,000. He is about as bright as a blown globe and carries on like a parrot. He could not state the average profit made by pharmacists in their administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The answer supplied by Pharmacy WA is that the net dispensing profit for Western Australian pharmacists averages $1,816 per year. Some professional reward! In case this Government thinks that there is any political mileage in scapegoating proprietor pharmacists, I repeat that the latest opinion research shows that 55 per cent of respondents believed the arguments of the pharmacists, so the Government should start to think again.

        Only last week, the Western Australian Council of Retail Associations gave its support also to the pharmacists, but I suppose in the mind of this Government it, too, would be wrong. The pharmacists have earned that support, because for 38 years they have been supplying lifesaving drugs through the PBS at reduced fees. But, of course, the Government can get rigged surveys about anything, and we have seen that happen only today.

        Pharmacists, I believe, have every right to be sceptical of the $41m bandaid package that the Labor Government is offering. The essential pharmacies allowance of $12,000 applies to pharmacies that are 10 kilometres from the nearest pharmacy, are open at least 20 hours a week and are dispensing fewer than 15,000 prescriptions annually. As I have asked in previous debates on this subject, what right has this Government, or any other government for that matter, to dictate where anyone should set up a business, whether it is a butcher's shop, a deli, a hairdressing salon or anything else? The Government is restricting where pharmacists will establish their business.
       </para>
       <para>
        This last typically bureaucratic requirement would have unintended consequences for one pharmacy in the rural area of Western Australia-the State from which Senator Cook comes, and he could not care less. That pharmacist makes a 90-kilometre round trip to a smaller town to dispense prescriptions and that takes him over the 15,000 limit. To receive the allowance, he would have to cut out that part of the service. The Minister could not care less about that, could he? Again we are confronted by the fact that this Labor Government does not care about patients and consumers when it sets out to crush pharmacists, pilots, farmers, doctors-you name it. Anyone who may not be inclined to vote for this Government is under the thumb and will be crushed, crushed, crushed. That is the whole aim and objective of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Western Australian pharmacists are very sceptical when the Government foreshadows an additional 3 per cent subsidy to pharmaceutical wholesalers for drugs costing more than $45. It is a fact that the surcharge on national health scheme drugs to Western Australia is 6.82 per cent and a drug, therefore, that supposedly costs $44 will cost a Western Australian pharmacist $47, so that the remuneration of the pharmacist will be cut from $4.20 to $3.50. The pharmacist will receive $47.50 in total, that is, 50c profit for a professional service. And this Government is relaxed about that. A 50c profit! I would like to see anyone else running a business on a 50c profit. But the Government does not care.

        Returning to the cost of drugs, if a drug costs $80 it will actually cost the Western Australian pharmacist $85.46 with the Federal Government remuneration of $3.50, and the pharmacist will be out of pocket by $2. What other small business people in Australia would be expected to survive in these appalling conditions? They just would not be able to survive and that is what this Government is all about-crushing the pharmacists. These are the problems that are being faced. (Extension of time granted) This Labor Government shows greater generosity to the wholesalers who receive a 10 per cent mark-up together with the 6.82 per cent surcharge from Western Australian pharmacists, payable not on the size and weight of the package but simply on its price. Of course wholesalers need and deserve to make a profit, but so do the pharmacists. Nobody is trying to deny the wholesalers money. But gee whiz, we have to do something about maintaining pharmacy in the community.

        Whenever we in the Senate or the pharmacists talk about the pharmacy closures that are the inevitable result of the policy stance of this Government, either the response is blank or we get a lecture about there being too many pharmacies, about how wealthy the pharmacists are or about how much it is costing the Government and the taxpayer. But how much more is it going to cost the taxpayer if we do not have pharmacists in the community to advise people on the right prescriptions and on the right medications so that they do not end up in hospital? Is that a consideration? No, it is not. We already have a medical system, a health system, that is collapsing all around us and that cannot take people. People are dying in queues now, let alone in the future.

        In Perth there have been two decisions in only the last few weeks to close pharmacies. Such a closure may not be the same as a closure in a country town, but nonetheless it is a very important and sad reflection of what this legislation is doing. For some people it means the loss of a convenient service. Most importantly, it means loss of livelihood not only for the pharmacists but also for their employees. Does this Government care? No. Where a Perth proprietor pharmacist owns two pharmacies, one may now be closed, costing the jobs of the pharmacist manager and two assistants. The main pharmacy will try to survive on an annual income loss of $20,000. This Government does not care a continental about young proprietor pharmacists, who may be carrying heavy mortgages when confronted by this imposed income loss. There is no knowing how many of the 456 pharmacies in Western Australia may be forced out of business, but I can guarantee that it will not be the painless kind of rationalisation that this Government consistently talks about. It will mean loss of service, loss of service quality and loss of jobs.

        Only this week I received a letter from a young lady in her final year of pharmacy. She had been offered a job in a pharmacy for next year as a trainee pharmacist in her first year out of university. She said that she had now had that offer of work withdrawn because the pharmacist could not afford to pay her. How many more are there in that category? Of course, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care adds insult to injury when he circulates the pamphlet The Truth and Nothing but the Truth about the Cost of Supply of Prescription Medicines. As I have said, it is a poisonous little document because it is nothing like the truth. If anyone wants any further information on that, I would be only too happy to give it to them. The Government says in its brochure that six out of 10 pharmacies have another within one kilometre. So what! That is a business decision made by the pharmacists. If they cannot get the customers, as Senator Tambling said, they will not be in business long. It is their business decision. But of course this statement is designed to promote the impression that Australia has simply too many pharmacies.

        This Labor Government continues to make dishonest comparisons with overseas countries where there are dispensing doctors, depot dispensaries, greater population densities and dearer prescription prices, and the cost of pharmaceuticals is determined by the volume of prescriptions, not the number of pharmacies. The marketplace has successfully determined the number of pharmacies in the suburbs, until now when this Government appears set on forcing pharmacy closures. The Government wants the pharmacies to close. The Government in this brochure also says that it pays essential chemist shops extra money to survive in country areas. This is only a bandaid measure. We know it, the Government knows it-and so do the pharmacists.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also says that chemists will get increased profits by selling the most popular PBS medications. Who determines what the most popular drug is? The Government or a doctor? According to this Government, it is the government; not the doctor-the doctor has nothing to do with it. The doctor would not know what drugs to prescribe; the Government knows better; Minister Staples knows better; Senator Cook knows better! In fact, anyone knows better than the doctor or the pharmacist! The push for generic drugs, whose prescription the Hawke Labor Government is encouraging, sometimes to the exclusion of drugs that are more effective if more expensive, is absolutely unbelievable. Selling these to increase profits is true only in the sense that pharmacists to stay afloat will need to increase the volume of sales in an assembly line manner which reduces the time for patient counselling.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government simply cannot disguise the fact that it values the work of a proprietor pharmacist at $14.30 per hour-far less than for a salaried pharmacist. Why is there that distinction? It is not practical. The Government also says that it wants to give the pharmacists extra money to provide health care. The Government does not want to give them any extra money at all; it wants to take it away from them. But these are all the so-called facts in The Truth and Nothing but the Truth about the Cost of Supply of Prescription Medicines-paid for by the taxpayers: propaganda.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government says that it cannot alter the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal decision-the independent umpire's decision. What a whole lot of rot! As I have mentioned before in this place, when the pilots dispute came about, the Government did not blink when it allowed an increase in parliamentary salaries, just so that Government members could make big fellows of themselves. That decision was made by an independent remuneration tribunal too, but the Government changed that faster than Flash Gordon. It then happened with the stamps. That was not part of a remuneration tribunal decision. But the Government changed the stamp allowance. It attempted to give $30,000 worth of stamps to members of the House of Representatives. And on the list goes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The argument that the Government cannot change the decision is just wrong. The Government appoints the Tribunal. It has the responsibility for the flawed and inadequate data on which it based its August 1989 decision. Governments can and do take action to alter or overturn tribunals' decisions with which it disagrees. But not this time. The pharmacists are just unlucky. The Government does not see it as important enough to change the decision this time. The Labor Government has not hesitated to grab political kudos by overturning the decision relating to parliamentary salaries. But not for the pharmacists. Its proposal to pay a subsidy for essential pharmacies contravenes the decision. It can change the decision, but it simply will not.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other exaggeration made in this place by Senator Crowley and others is that the pharmacists are greedy and that they want more. All the pharmacists are asking from the Government is a restoration of the gross margin of 1987-88 in real terms adjusted for cost increases. This is a modest proposal when other sections of the community want hefty wage increases. A mark-up separate from the dispensing fee is necessary to deal with the impact of wholesaler surcharges. That is another element of this pamphlet that is wrong. It says that the pharmacists are using scare tactics on pensioners and other vulnerable members of the community. They are not using scare tactics at all; they are simply telling it the way it is. It is their responsibility to tell it the way it is because if they do not, who will? Minister Staples in his little pamphlet paid for by the taxpayers? Not likely. It is up to the pharmacists.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately time does not permit me to rebut point by point, all the misstatements made by Minister Staples but I think I have covered the most important ones. Equally mind-boggling is the statement that this Government wants to give chemists extra money for helping to provide health care. When pharmacists suffer a 23 per cent cut in incomes after a 12 per cent cut last year, that can only be described as deliberate falsehood. The Government cannot, on the one hand, claim that it wants to give the pharmacists extra money and, on the other hand, take money away from them for two years in a row.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thousands of Western Australians and thousand of other Australians are hoping that the pharmacists successfully stand firm against the bullying of the Hawke Labor Government because they know their health care depends on it; and that is the fact of the matter. The Government was unable to hoodwink the Guild a few weeks ago, and is now unable to walk away from this situation without making another decision. Unfortunately, we know which way the Government will vote tonight-it will yet again vote against our proposal to overturn this decision.

         —We have heard a lot in recent months about the Australian Labor Party's policies of perestroika. Perestroika is restructuring. This Government is restructuring so many industries and activities that it puts its chest out, parades itself around and says, `We are restructuring this, we are restructuring that'. But it is really perestroika. Mr Gorbachev is moving in the opposite direction; he is seeking to restructure his administration and the public service to move to an era of improved efficiency and economies. This Government is restructuring the industries in this country in such a disastrous way, as other speakers today have said, that it can only be described as a form of social engineering. If Senator Crowley, Senator Giles and some of the others had said that the purpose of the Labor Government was to move the provision of health care to community health centres and public hospitals, and stated what the implications of the pharmacy arrangements were, they would at least have been honest. But no, they are hiding. Even in this instance, we have not once heard the word `restructuring' mentioned. Why? Because the nature of pharmacies in Australia and the very important role that they play in neighbourhood and suburban life are very important. This goes beyond a prescription-beyond essential health care.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I believe there is a proportion of roughly one pharmacy for every 4,000 or 5,000 people in an average suburb. Those figures are very similar to those for a business that I ran before I came to this Parliament. I was a newsagent and serviced a similar number of people. That meant that in every two- or three-week period every family in that suburban environment turned up in my shop, in the shop next door or in the shop just around the corner. And in every one of those shopping centres there is a pharmacy which provides essential services. This Government is trying to move away from any recognition of the important social roles and functions of shops like newsagents and pharmacies in a particular environment. It wants to perestroika them back to the public hospital or the community health centre. Who will be the losers? It will be the ordinary people who walk in, week after week, to demand the services of a pharmacy, which are vitally important.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we could strongly debate the Government's economic initiatives, they are certainly not initiatives but demands. The Government seems to hide behind the costs with a series of averages. What is an average? It is really only a mathematical calculation of a middle line. Generally, when working out an average there are a lot of figures which are lower and a few which are significantly higher. I can assure this chamber that there are in Australia pharmacies in which the magic $26,000 figure would pale into insignificance because of their size or that of the shopping centre or community in which they operate. There are many pharmacies throughout Australia in which the figure would be much lower than the $26,000 median figure. It is wrong to cite such situations as average in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me quote from an article in the Northern Territory News containing an interview with a pharmacist in Darwin with regard to these particular proposals and changes. Mr Reeves, a Darwin pharmacist, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Most Darwin chemists will close if this goes ahead. This pharmacy would lose about $40,000 a year. We just couldn't afford to keep going. Only Darwin's biggest three pharmacies would survive the slashing of fees. Out of about 12 chemists in Darwin I think only the three bigger ones would keep going and they would probably be open just five days a week from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a chemist who runs a good, average viable operation, and one can see the sort of impact that this Government's proposals will have on his business.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about the services that are so crucial in any suburban environment to the elderly? As I know from my own experience in a newsagency, the elderly enjoy shopping in those types of environments. They go to a newsagent for all sorts of social advice, and I can assure this chamber that they go to a pharmacy for a heck of a lot of medical advice and assistance and common sense. It does not cost them a penny but, of course, they do obtain their pharmaceutical requirements at the same time. This Government is proposing to pull that rug from under them and make them travel longer distances. Pharmacies do not survive just on their prescription counters; they supply a lot of other stock from the shelves. What is not being taken into account by this Government is that many of those other stock items have very slow movement but are there as part of the associated service. What about a pharmacist who outlays $70,000, $100,000 or $150,000 for his stock? What is the return on his capital, and what is the obligation that he has to meet for his borrowed finance at the rate of 21 per cent or 22 per cent that he currently has to pay because of the other economic policies of this Government?
       </para>
       <para>
        In areas like the Northern Territory, which is remote and where there are long distances to travel, there are much higher set-up costs, staffing costs and freight costs for pharmacies which have to be added to the stock, yet this Government will come in and say to them, `Here is your price control'. Here is Labor, in its usual manner, going for price control and not allowing any margin that would be described as reasonable in any way. All of these things will have an impact on groups like the elderly which the Labor Party, traditionally, has said it is helping and supporting. That is a load of codswallop. In the Northern Territory a very significant proportion of the community is Aboriginal, and they need to call on the services of pharmacies at a higher rate than the general population. Again, this Government is making a mockery of itself by saying that it has a series of policies that assist disadvantaged people like Aboriginals. It certainly does not back up those concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        If communities like Katherine, Tennant Creek, Gove or Alice Springs lose any service in this area, it will be a dramatic and drastic change for them. I believe that in Tennant Creek and Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory there is only one pharmacist in each community, and they certainly cannot afford this type of drastic financial bastardry that is being carried on. In communities like Alice Springs and Darwin, where there are a number of pharmacies, a reduction in that number will provide a greater degree of inconvenience for the customers-the people that, I thought, the Labor Party would have been pleased to stand for and support in any way. But no, the Labor Government ignores them, puts them aside and says, `We are on a definite path of perestroika-of restructuring'. With what consequence? At what price? The price, I assure this chamber, will be that this Labor Government will disappear at the next election.

         —I join in this debate to express my concern about the personal problems to be faced not only by people in the pharmacy industry but also by those receiving the care and help of pharmacists-that is, the people of Australia. I think the Government has forgotten that the chemist shop is the frontline of health care. It is the filter through which so many minor complaints are sorted out that would otherwise go into the expensive taxpayer-funded medical system, particularly the enormously expensive Medicare system. The friendly chemist is the person to whom the great bulk of Australians go when they have some minor complaint.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In other words, the chemist is not simply dispensing drugs or, as Senator Sheil said, having to run a type of mini-supermarket in order to subsidise his losses or incredibly narrow margins on pharmaceutical items that he dispenses. The chemist provides a service which is not measured by actual fees paid which the Government has to meet because there is no charge. The customary frontline of health care is delivered totally free by chemists in their small shops around Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government by this action is closing about one-third of the chemist shops in which free medical advice is given to millions of Australians and their families.

         —As Senator Tambling says, the consequence of that will be to push that type of medical health care into other government services or into the Medicare system at enormous cost to the taxpayer. On simple economic grounds, it is madness. It is absolute madness to save a few million dollars by forcing the closure of thousands of chemist shops and pushing people who would use those facilities and advice for free-at the cost of nothing to the taxpayer-into the mounting Medicare mess that this Government is presiding over.

        It is just incredible to me that this type of false economy has prompted this sort of pig-headed, incredibly aggressive governmental action. We ask: What are the motives? If it is so clearly and self-evidently a nonsense, why is the Government pursuing these small pharmacies which in their thousands will be forced to close by this Government's deliberate and determined action?

        I believe that the reason behind this enthusiastic embrace by the Labor Party of an attack on the corner chemist shop is that it is deeply within its ethos. The little capitalist, the little businessman, has always been in the firing line of this Government. As someone said earlier-I think it was Senator Knowles-the Government seems to adopt a much different approach to the big business moguls, to the people who are Hawke's mates, I think was the expression. But the people who have consistently been in the firing line and who are suffering under the massive interest rates of this Government are the small business people of Australia, the people who are self-employed, the people who are off their backsides, the people who are trying to better themselves in the tradition that built this nation. It is a tradition, by the way, that is fascinatingly being destroyed. The foundations of that destruction were set under the Whitlam Government. It set out to create a totally new ethos in Australia: a hand-out mentality rather than a `what can I do, what opportunities do I have', mentality. That is the basis on which this nation was built.

I think it is worth noting that many Opposition members from the House of Representatives and many Opposition senators went out and talked to these people, listened to their problems and are fully aware of the crisis facing pharmacy if this Government's legislation proceeds and if the amendments moved by the Opposition in the Senate, which were carried but rejected by the House of Representatives, are not sustained.

        Some mention has been made of the vital role of women because, after all, it was a totally female demonstration outside the Senate today in support of the pharmacy industry and in opposition to the Government's vicious and determined attack on that industry and its capacity to survive. I have a letter written by Donna McKinnis, Co-ordinator of the Women in Pharmacy Action Group. I believe that the Senate should be aware of the reasons why so many women are concerned about their Government's actions in attacking this industry. The letter states:

         —As the interjection from Senator Patterson quite properly notes, they are being manipulated. The facts are that this is an industry on which many thousands of women depend not only for full time employment but also for permanent part time employment. That issue must not be overlooked. The Labor Party has created such enormous burdens for families that many women qualified in pharmacy and many unqualified women-as I have noted, 98 per cent of non-qualified staff in pharmacy are women-depend on this industry to supplement their income. Pharmacy provides a massive opportunity, which is not otherwise available, for many women to supplement their family incomes in order to meet the huge interest rate bills that have been thumped on families by this incompetent Government's ludicrous economic policies.

        I hope that the Government feels the impact of those 40,000 people at the ballot box if it persists with its determination not to listen to those 40,000 people. The letter continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        This group plans to assess the problems and address the specific issues of women in pharmacy. Pharmacy is an ideal career for women and with the percentage of women graduates increasing, the Government and the public need to realise the valuable role they contribute to community pharmacy. Women are generally more approachable, empathetic, readily accessible and family oriented. These attributes make women ideal health professionals.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a shame that we now lose women from the workforce for at least 10 years (if not forever) at a time they are most able to contribute to keeping our community healthy and well informed about the medications they are using. Women in pharmacy have a lot to offer the community but must receive adequate remuneration and conditions that take account of family commitments.

        That woman, Donna McKinnis, was outside here, outside this Parliament House, keen to talk to any Labor senator or member prepared to listen but there was no-one there for her to talk to.

        hereby petition the Hawke Government to reverse its intent to proceed with the decision of the April economic statement covering the pharmaceutical benefits scheme that will result in the closure of many, if not the majority, of pharmacies in Australia. This will result in people being denied ready and convenient access to pharmaceutical medicine and customer service and advice from the neighbourhood chemist.

       <para>
        That is in line with the sort of problem that will be reflected all over Australia, particularly in those areas where aged people live. I have a letter here from Burnett and Antoinette McMicking of Narooma, which states:

        Dear Senator Baume,
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed pharmaceutical legislation is giving us cause for grave concern. We are retirees and, over a great many years, have found the service and attention that we have received from our pharmacists, at all times, has been second to none. They have always been available for advice, readily given, and we feel that this legislation will corrode the quality of service across the whole spectrum of the pharmaceutical profession.
       </para>
       <para>
        With a proposed forced cut of at least 20 per cent in their income the pharmacists, at hand seven days a week, will not be in a position to carry a full stock of vital and expensive drugs. What will happen in the case of an emergency, especially in country areas, such as our own, where in some cases, especially in holiday periods, there are no deliveries for a week? This area, for example, at Christmas and New Year is not only full of holiday makers to whom anything can happen, but many retirees who could be at risk for the lack of some vital drug.
       </para>
       <para>
        In our town of Narooma there is a very large proportion of retired people, and because of the extremely hilly terrain the town and shopping areas are spread into three distinct locations, each served by one pharmacist. Consequently, due to the lack of any local transport, the elderly citizens tend to shop at their nearest retail centre.

        That sort of letter, which was dated 21 September, is being repeated as that sort of problem is repeated throughout Australia. The Government claims that it has resolved that problem by having a special essential pharmacy allowance. That does not solve the problem at all. It fiddles at the edges of the problem. The pharmacy industry has established quite clearly that this will not prevent massive closures of essential pharmacies in areas like that throughout Australia. Another example of the sort of problem we face is evident in a letter I have from three pharmacists in Wauchope. It states:

        Why does the Hawke Government pay the wholesaler $9 to deliver insulin to a pharmacy, but will only be paying a pharmacist $3.50 to dispense it?

       <para>
        How can pharmacists pay staff wages and rent out of that? For every $100 that comes in, $20 goes to pay my wages and our rent. How can we survive if the Hawke Government only gives us $3.50 on a $100 prescription?
       </para>
       <para>
        How can staff wages and rent be paid out of that? Why does the Hawke Government pay $5 to big business Comet to deliver a box of syringes to a diabetic and refuse to pay a chemist even one cent to provide syringes?
       </para>
       <para>
        How will pharmacies find the money to pay for dispensary stock which is, according to the Hawke Government, going to double in the next two years? Average stock is now $20,000; average stock in two years, $40,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where will the extra $20,000 after tax come from to pay for this? The Hawke Government's Tribunal will result in the closure of many community pharmacies. Which ones will close? What studies have been done on the likely impact on the community? What provision has the Hawke Government made for widespread staff redundancies?

        How will closing down pharmacies reduce the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme?

        This efficient and substantial pharmacy in Wollongong sent me its financial statement. What I have seen puts, in my mind, the lie to the Government's claims about the enormous amounts of money being earned by pharmacists. If this Government's proposal succeeds, it is quite clear that there will have to be a massive reduction in stockholdings by pharmacists. What are the consequences of stockholdings being reduced in pharmacies? If pharmacists hold reduced stock or if, in fact, they are out of stock, a patient wanting a prescription filled will have to wait until that stock is acquired. The patient will not be able to go around to the nearby pharmacy because that will be closed, courtesy of the Hawke Government. So the delivery of prescribed drugs to thousands of Australians--

        If a pharmacist is going to be obliged to carry reduced stocks in order to cope with the reduced income that is going to be imposed, Australian consumers will suffer. To a massive extent, those Australian consumers are women of whom a large proportion are aged and, in many instances, infirm. Is this yet another example of this Government kicking the most defenceless sector of Australian society? It seems that it is. What possible benefit can there be to consumers in reducing the amount of access that they have to the pharmaceutical products that they require? What benefit can there be to consumers if they are forced to use a reduced number of outlets with reduced levels of stock which may not be able immediately to meet their needs?

       <para>
        It seems to me that there is nothing to commend this Government's actions in respect of pharmacies. The Government is simply aiming to save money on the massive increase in health care costs that have blown out under Medicare. I think it is reasonable to ask why these costs have blown out. Is it because the pharmacies are ripping off the system? The evidence clearly shows that that is not so. This massive increase in cost is the result of a huge increase in usage by people in the age group which is the major consumer of prescriptions.

        I stress that pharmacies are not ripping off the taxpayer. They are not inefficient. In fact, it has been acknowledged that there have been significant increases in the efficiency of the pharmacy industry. Pharmacists have achieved productivity gains in their practices. No-one doubts this. The Government has not come up with any evidence to the contrary. In fact, the increased application of computers, for example, has resulted in significant increases in productivity and efficiency in the pharmaceutical industry. Of course, pharmacists have to pay for this kind of equipment. So the reward--

        Let me remind the Government that pharmacists provide after-hours services. Generally, a few pharmacists band together and draw up a roster. The pharmacy industry is providing this service which did not exist some years ago. Pharmacists make deliveries to pensioners at home, in nursing homes or in hospitals. Often, at significant cost to themselves, they dispense and take drugs to people who desperately need them. It is important to note that pharmacists play an enormous role in counselling and giving advice to the public. They charge absolutely nothing for this service. This cost comes out of the meagre profits that they are supposed to earn from dispensing prescriptions. Many pharmacists could not survive unless they went into a mini-supermarket situation. This Government is even going to damage further their capacity to survive. It is going to remove a service which is absolutely vital in so many areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us remember that if the Government is successful and forces pharmacies into being some kind of dispensing supermarket, where the pharmacist does not have the time to give advice or do anything other than stand in a production line shuffling prescriptions and working flat out with doctors' scribbled prescriptions, we are going to have some real problems. While many people have a fair amount of faith in doctors, it is true to say that doctors sometimes make mistakes. Sometimes they prescribe the wrong thing, the wrong quantity or give the wrong advice. The pharmacist provides the safety net. He interposes himself sensibly and effectively between the doctor, who possibly could make a mistake, and the consumer who is, in so many instances, a pensioner. In other words, pharmacists do an essential and important job in checking doctors' prescriptions. If they are in some kind of almost assembly line situation, their capacity to do that will be significantly diminished.

        As I said, my concerns about this legislation relate to people-the people in pharmacy itself and the people who are the consumers of pharmacy. In particular, I am concerned about women and the aged who depend so heavily on the assistance, service, advice, help and work of the corner pharmacy-the sort of pharmacy that this Government is determined to close by way of this sort of legislation. That is why I am so strongly opposed to what this Government is doing. That is why I will be supporting the Opposition's very strong position that the amendments that were passed last time by the Senate, effectively blocking what the Government is seeking to do, should be passed once again.

         —I rise at this stage of the committee debate in order to reply to some of the nonsense and misleading statements that have been made by senators opposite. I think the last speech in many respects distilled some of the stupidity of the Opposition's position nicely. We had from Senator Michael Baume a heart tugging eulogy to the enterprise and individuality-the entrepreneurial flair, which he alluded to-of individual pharmacists. I do not deny that there is a degree of small business character about pharmacies, but it is not in the pharmacy side. I point out that the entrepreneurial flair-the bright light of free enterprise, so to speak, in pharmacies-was supported last year by $1.5 billion of taxpayers' money. We can talk about free enterprise propped up by $1.5 billion, but that has nothing to do with entrepreneurial flair.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is because this Government pays to pharmacies around Australia $1.5 billion in subsidies that we have this issue. That is the basis of this Government's interest. We have a large public expenditure, we are accountable to taxpayers as to how that money is used and we want to be sure that it is used properly. It should be used properly for pharmacists as well as for the wider community which foots the bill in the end. That is why we supported a Liberal Party Bill back in 1981 to provide independent arbitration on the level of fees. The level of fees-that is the amount of taxpayers' money that supports pharmacies-is not a blank cheque, it is arrived at by a process of proper procedure, of listening to the arguments, surveying the costs, and then making a considered decision. That is why in the 1981 legislation that members of the Liberal Party were then pleased to bring into this chamber they insisted that there be a clause that would bind the Government so that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal would be genuinely independent and free.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why we have a hands-off arrangement under the separation of powers concept vested in an independent tribunal which has the right to make a decision which fixes the level of remuneration for pharmacists and is thus a guide to how much the public purse is at stake in terms of this issue. Why do we pay that money? We pay it because this Government is concerned about ordinary Australians, more particularly about age pensioners, people in need of medication, and the poor. If we did not subsidise pharmacies in order to keep their costs contained and if the market fixed the price-Senator Michael Baume has spoken about this and Senator Knowles ran off at the mouth about it earlier-at which drugs were supplied to the community, the poor would not be able to afford medical treatment, those who are chronically ill and require medication would not be able to afford it either, and people who have problems with diabetes, for example, would not be able to afford their insulin.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason why we put the money in is to ensure equity of access for the community so that irrespective of means, of whether a person is wealthy or poor, chronically ill or healthy, he has an entitlement to the medication. That is the fundamental reason this Government is involved in this issue and that is why it is important. Because it is so important and because such a huge amount of public funds is involved there has to be a regulatory mechanism. What we are confronted with here is this: the regulatory mechanism has worked, an inquiry has been conducted, a survey was taken, argument was put, facts were adduced, and an independent inquiry came to a decision. That normally would be unexceptional and would require simply that the fact be noted and that we pass to the next subject. But because the decision was not to the liking of one of the major groups affected, pharmacists-some pharmacists but not all because there is a lot of morality and good sense among a number of pharmacists I have met-protested and it then became a question not of whether due process would prevail, not whether an adjudication, independent and untainted by political force would be made and decided, but who could generate the greatest industrial muscle, the greatest community conflict and who could bring the greatest weight to bear. These matters were not determined ethically; they were determined on who had the most horsepower in terms of pressure.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said before, this Government will not buckle to that pressure and the pharmacists who are part of this campaign will not succeed in imposing for themselves a 40 per cent wage hike, which is what they want, and nor will we allow it. Indeed, many of the pharmacists do not want to do that now either.

        We need to consider whether there is any sort of case. This Government has said that it is prepared to negotiate on matters that were not considered by the Tribunal to see whether there are ways in which some of the complaints which have been raised under that heading can be met. We are now in the process of negotiation. What does the Opposition want to do? It wants to abort the negotiation process by throwing out the Tribunal's decision and encouraging an uncontemplatable position to be prosecuted by those pharmacists who are trying by brute force to overturn rationality, commonsense and due process. That is what we have in this place.
       </para>
       <para>
        If my motion is defeated and if the Opposition's amendment is carried this legislation will go back to the House of Representatives and it will be defeated again. If it comes back here and is carried again, it will be defeated by the House of Representatives once more. This may suit the Australian Democrats who may want the Government to have a trigger for a double dissolution, but it will not deter the Government and, in any case, the Government will make those choices when the time comes. It may be one of the reasons why the Democrats are so hot to trot on this totally non-ethical issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will turn now to the merit of the case. Expenditure from 1985-86 until now on subsidies to pharmacists by this Government has increased by 66 per cent. It is the fastest growing component of our entire health bill. The Opposition wants to remove the device by which it is fairly determined so that force will decide it. Those figures are consistent with the figures produced by the Guild. The net remuneration for the top 50 per cent of pharmacists-not gross remuneration-is over $100,000 a year. That is not an unreasonable income.

         —Tonight in the adjournment debate I want to say a few words about an area that is remote from Australia-Eritrea and Ethiopia-which I have spoken about previously. Exactly 12 months ago I visited Eritrea as a guest of the Eritrean Relief Association and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. When I returned to Australia in November last year I made a speech in the Senate, so I do not need to go over my experiences and what I observed at that time.

       <para>
        At long last, after 27 years of military conflict between the Eritreans and Ethiopians, there is some small hope that a political settlement can be reached between them. In September this year an ex-President of the United States of America, Jimmy Carter, arranged a meeting in Atlanta in the State of Georgia so that both sides could come together to begin some preliminary talks. This was the first time in about 26 years that both sides agreed to talk without preconditions. Some would say that the talks were not successful because they did not reach a settlement of the dispute, but I do not think that anybody who has made any attempt to follow the intricacies of the dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia expected agreement to be reached at one sitting of talks in view of the long and intractable war that has been fought between the people of those countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the most pleasing thing about the talks was that, despite still many disagreements, they agreed to further talks in various places in Africa over the period of the next 12 months or so. Under the chairmanship of ex-President Jimmy Carter they agreed that the next round of talks would begin on 18 November, next month, in Nairobi, Kenya. A list of further venues has been announced for possible further talks. None of us who show any interest in the situation in Eritrea and Ethiopia would expect that there will be a rapid conclusion to the talks and that a settlement will be reached, but we have all encouraged these talks to take place. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the final communique and attached notes issued at the end of the talks held in Atlanta in September.

Chairman-Co-chairmen will be chosen by the negotiating parties, whose duties will be to arrange meetings and schedules, to open and close meetings, to chair the meetings, to rule on points of order, and to assure that meetings are conducted smoothly and properly. These duties will be performed without prejudice or partiality, and with the approval of the negotiating parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        9. On each agenda item, each side will present its initial views in writing to the other side. Then there will be a thorough discussion of the issue until agreement is reached. If the two sides cannot agree, then co-chairmen shall use their good offices to mediate disagreements by putting forward proposals for consideration by the negotiating parties.

Either negotiating party may propose members of the secretariat to be considered by the chairmen for service. There are remaining disagreements that will be explained later.

       <para>
        My own role in the continuation of these negotiations will depend on the selection of a suitable African chairman. I am unwilling to serve until the decision on the African leader has been made. No African leader will be willing to serve unless he is satisfied with our agreements in Atlanta and knows that he is acceptable to both sides. If either of the original choices is unable to serve, others will be chosen, by mutual consent of the negotiating parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Observers:
       </para>
       <para>
        My latest compromise proposal is as follows: Initially, there will be seven observers, and others will be invited to attend. Of the seven, each side may choose two observers without restriction and without the expression of reservations by the other side. Three others will be invited by mutual agreement. Additional countries may be represented by observers, with mutual agreement by the two sides.''
       </para>
       <para>
        The EPLF accepts with the understanding that there will be no expression or reservation regarding the unrestricted choices and that the observers may serve as mediators.

       </para>
       <para>
        The EPLF insists that the Carter Center, the OAU, and Sudan will provide members of the secretariat and that the last named members will officially represent the OAU and Sudan.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ethiopian side insists that the co-chairmen will choose the staff or secretariat and that these serve in their individual capacities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Concerning the role of observers and staff, my compromise proposal for consideration by both sides is: ``In addition to the co-chairmen, others will be needed to serve as mediators. Observers and members of the secretariat who have already been approved by both sides will be the most likely choices. Once chosen, mediators will continue to serve so long as they are mutually acceptable to both sides.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although complete agreement has not been reached on all issues in these preliminary talks in Atlanta, both sides have agreed to continue this effort. I have been authorized to set the time and place for the next talks. My preference is that these peace efforts be recessed until November 18, at which time we reconvene in Nairobi, Kenya. In the meantime, the two sides will be asked to seek agreement on the remaining issues, to propose their list of observers, and to agree on an African leader to serve with me in the main talks.

       </para>
       <para>
        1. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front proposes that Former President Jimmy Carter be the chairman of the peace process. The co-chairmen should be chosen by the chairman and should be a rotating position. The co-chairmen should be the head-of-state of the country of venue for the current round of negotiations, e.g. Sudan, Egypt, Yemen Arab Republic, Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia proposes that Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Julius Nyerere serve as permanent co-chairmen of the peace process. Should either be unable to serve, the substitute co-chairmen could be chosen from among the heads-of-state of the country of venue for the current round of negotiations, e.g. Sudan, Egypt, Yemen Arab Republic, Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. The Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia proposes that in order to expedite the proceedings and to assist in resolving disagreements, the co-chairmen shall use their good offices, when necessary, to mediate between the negotiating parties by putting forward proposals for consideration by the negotiating parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Eritrean People's Liberation Front proposes that the mediation role should be performed not only by the chairmen, but also by the observers, the secretariat and outside powers including the United States and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. These mediators could constitute a body which could undertake the mediation role. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front believes that there is a need for strong mediation and that the chairmen alone cannot play the role.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia does not object to other heads-of-state from the countries of venue performing mediation roles provided there is mutual agreement.

       </para>
       <para>
        The Eritrean People's Liberation Front proposes that the observers represent the Governments of Sudan, Egypt, Kenya, Yemen Arab Republic, Nigeria, Kuwait, Pakistan, Italy, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. Additionally, the regional organizations of the Organization of African Unity and the Arab League should also observe.
       </para>

        </talker>
        <para in-line="1">
         —I thank the Senate for the courtesy of allowing me to incorporate that communique in Hansard although it is several pages long. In view of the long conflict in Eritrea I believe it is a small concession for the Senate to allow that communique and the attached notes to be incorporated in its official record. I want to draw attention to one thing in particular in the communique. I am pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is the duty Minister at the moment. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front was asked to suggest a list of possible observer countries that could attend the talks in Nairobi and listed Australia among a dozen such countries. That is a recognition by the Eritreans of the humanitarian role that Australia has played in the region over recent years. While the Minister is present in the chamber I ask him and the Australian Government to give serious consideration, if Australia is finally asked and is able to act as an observer at the talks in Nairobi, to accepting that invitation and request to arrange for a representative to be present. We have an embassy in Nairobi and I do not think it would be too difficult to arrange for one of the officers to be present at those talks.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think the Eritreans have asked for Australia to be considered as one of the observer countries because of the role Australia has played in recent years in providing humanitarian aid to the region. I do not have the exact figures with me, but certainly since about 1983-84 several million dollars in humanitarian aid has been given to both the Eritreans and the Ethiopians during the bad droughts that have taken place. Certainly, on my visit to Eritrea last year I observed that the ordinary Eritrean people all know what the magnificent contribution of the Australian people, through their Government, meant and that many of them were able to survive the dreadful droughts of 1984-85. I think we can all be proud of the role we have played.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, I have just received information that this year the region is again facing a serious drought and that again the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea will possibly be calling on Australia to provide appropriate levels of humanitarian aid. Even though we have a tight aid budget I hope that the Australian Government, through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) and the non-government organisations, can again arrange for appropriate aid to be provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be pointed out that in Eritrea alone 600,000 to 700,000 people have been uprooted because of the ferocious fighting and are now living in very primitive refugee camp conditions. If there is a severe drought, as now appears likely, these people will be utterly dependent upon aid from countries such as Australia. I raise that matter for the Minister's comment. I have already written to him and to AIDAB requesting that consideration be given to making preparations for what could be an impending human disaster in the Horn of Africa.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I refer to the general situation in the Horn of Africa-again, an area remote from the interests of most Australians. But I think that in the Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti we have the worst area of human misery in the world at the moment-I suspect even worse than Cambodia. There are more displaced people in that area than in any other area in the world. People in southern Sudan are fleeing into Ethiopia because of the civil war being fought within the Sudan between the Arab and negro races. Refugees from Ethiopia are fleeing into Sudan. Refugees not only from Eritrea but also from the Tigre province, the Osmol province and the Ogaden area of Ethiopia are fleeing into Somalia. Conversely, all but a civil war is now being fought in areas of Somalia and refugees are fleeing from Somalia into Ethiopia and Djibouti.
       </para>
       <para>
        All in all, the ordinary people in that area are facing a dreadful prospect. Most people in the Western world are ignorant of that area because of the lack of information coming out of it. Recently I had the opportunity to be briefed by an Australian woman, Ms Valerie Browning, who has spent some time in Somalia. Her account of the horrors of Somalia at the moment are quite devastating. But it is interesting that Australia is being asked to consider assistance in those areas and also to participate in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the various military conflicts. The military conflicts in the area are partly as a result of the underlying poverty and deprivation of the people in those various countries. It is a vicious cycle: high levels of poverty lead to military conflict and people, desperate to try to find ways to overcome it, are resorting to military activity, which further compounds poverty and despair.
       </para>
       <para>
        I welcome the opportunity to put on record tonight that at least there has been one small step forward in one area of the conflict in the Horn of Africa between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Talks are taking place and we should congratulate ex-President Carter for showing the initiative in convincing both sides to come to the negotiating table and at least getting a commitment that the talks will be ongoing. I reiterate that, if Australia is asked to participate as an observer in these talks, I hope that the Foreign Minister and the Government can respond positively so that we can play a role commensurate with our interest in providing humanitarian aid over a number of years to this unhappy area of the world.

         —Tonight I want to tell the Senate the story of Margaret. This is at her request. Margaret wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 15 August 1989 and to date has had no reply. In her letter Margaret describes how she was sentenced to 18 years of child abuse because a government did not like the colour of her skin. She describes in her letter how she was born as the result of a pack rape. Her mother was raped at the age of 16 by a group of Afghan camel traders who were in the northern parts of Western Australia. Margaret was made a State ward and spent the first 18 years of her life in an orphanage where she describes herself as having been mentally, physically and sexually abused. In her letter to the Prime Minister, Margaret tells him that she has documents to prove what happened to her and says that she was in a state of shock when she found out that it was the colour of her skin that deprived her of a family. She describes in her letter how she feels that she was sentenced to 18 years for an offence that was committed by others. She says in her letter that every lawyer who has seen her papers has also been shocked.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Margaret has had access to her papers since October 1988. Although, of course, it is admirable that she finally was given access to her papers, she was not given counselling at the time and this has been responsible for a lot of the distress that she has felt since that time. She concludes her letter to the Prime Minister:

       <para>
        Where Mr Prime Minister is my Justice?
       </para>
       <para>
        I have copies here of the documents to which Margaret was given access in October 1988. At the conclusion of my speech I will seek to table these documents, but during my speech I will quote selectively from them. The first document is dated 24 April 1944, which was the year that Margaret was born. This is presumably the first report on her in the foundling orphanage to which she was taken. A report dated 1960 says of her, `No visitors. Has no ability. Does not mix over-well. Has no relatives? Is dark skinned but features not negroid'. Another report is dated 20 June 1949 and reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        I visited Margaret . . . at the . . . Foundling Home. Margaret is a dear little girl but she definitely has some coloured blood. I believe her father was a maori. Under the circumstances Margaret would not be suitable for adoption but perhaps it would be advisable if possible to place her in a private home.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report was noted by some four or five people and Margaret has written at the bottom of this document, `This document has devastated me'. The next document is dated 8 May 1958 in which an inspectress of the Welfare Branch wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        I saw Margaret . . . at . . . Orphanage.
       </para>
       <para>
        Margaret is a half caste. She is doing well at school and reported to be a very good lass.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next document is dated 14 July 1959 in which she is described, among other things, as being in the seventh standard, `tall', `pleasant looking girl', `healthy', `does not really look abo' and `never any visitors'. The last document, which is a letter to Margaret from the Child Welfare Department, is dated 2 May 1962. The then Director of the Child Welfare Department wrote to Margaret saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Dear Margaret,
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to wish you many happy returns for your eighteenth birthday, which was on the 24th April . . .

        No doubt you realise that your term as a ward expired on that date . . .

       </para>
       <para>
        We then move on to 1988 and I make known to the Senate a letter from a senior social worker at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth to the Minister for Community Services, Mrs Hallahan. The letter reads as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Dear Mrs Hallahan,
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . is a 44 year old woman who is currently an in-patient in the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Department Psychiatry and Behavioural Science. . . . was recently admitted after a disclosure from her mother identifying that her birth was the result of a pack rape when . . . 's mother was 16 years of age. . . . as a consequence of Margaret's mother's inability or refusal to contribute to her care, Margaret was made a Ward of the Department of Child Welfare in 1946, at the age of 2 1/2 years. Margaret lived for the following 18 years at the . . . Foundling Home and described the treatment that she received there as being brutal and abusive. Margaret spent a brief period fostered with a woman in Maylands and described this experience likewise, as being horrific.
       </para>
       <para>
        Margaret has recently been made aware that she was ineligible for adoption because she was considered to be coloured. She is understandably considerably angry and enraged by this information as she believes that the subsequent period spent at . . . and in foster homes to be a direct consequence of this attitude and decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Margaret is keen to establish some sense of social justice for herself and feels extremely victimised . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It then lists a number of reasons and continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        To assist Margaret to reconcile these experiences of her birth, childhood and adolescence, I wondered if you may be available to meet with Margaret and provide her with some information regarding her earlier life experiences so as to assist her to appreciate that the attitude of some of the authority figures in her life has been one of caring and compassion.
       </para>
       <para>
        That last letter is dated 28 February 1989 and is from the Assistant Director-General of the Western Australian State Department for Community Services. It is written to the senior social worker at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and states:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am writing as a follow-up to our meeting with Miss . . . on 10 February.
       </para>
       <para>
        From my perspective the discussion was an extremely valuable one and highlighted many important issues for this Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most important of these is our responsibilities to children entrusted to our care and protection. Although there have been dramatic changes since the time that Miss . . . was a child in care, the issue of abuse of children in substitute care situations is still a critical one, which requires our priority attention on an ongoing basis.

        As a result of Margaret's initiatives, the support group has now been formed. The group is anxious to alert others that it exists for people who need and want to join. The group wants every opportunity to be given to people who need that assistance. It has a standard letter which goes out to the people which says:

        I have met Margaret and have spoken to her at length. She is a delightfully articulate and vivacious woman. Margaret feels that she has now made it, but she does not want others to suffer in the way that she did. Margaret is very proud to be the initiating force behind the ICASG. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is at Margaret's instigation that I bring these matters to public notice because she feels that others can be helped and certainly need not hide any more behind the curtains of their homes, that they can go out and meet and talk with others and receive the assistance that is now available through the State Government of Western Australia. I would like finally to commend the State Government for initiating the self-help group and giving assistance to make it possible. I seek leave to table the documents from which I quoted selectively.

         —While I am on my feet-because I feel it was not understood when I spoke earlier-I would like to speak on the issue of the drug, Depromedrol, which has been used epidurally. Although it has undoubtedly helped some people-I know that two people spoke here in the Senate and said it had helped them-nonetheless, it has not been recommended by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee nor by the manufacturer for epidural use. Although it has undoubtedly helped some people, others have been devastated by receiving this drug epidurally. That is why there will now be an inquiry in Western Australia, supported by the State Minister for Health and the State Commissioner for Health, into the use of this drug.

         —Two speeches have been made in the adjournment debate tonight. We are indebted firstly to Senator Jenkins for bringing to our attention the very moving tale of Margaret. The particular problem that has been identified is a very widespread one in the community but too often a hidden one. I think the kind of service which has been done by Senator Jenkins and the lady in question in helping to bring this out into public exposure is very useful for the community as a whole.

        As far as Senator Schacht's contribution on Eritrea is concerned, the Government will certainly take carefully into account the suggestions he has made or will be making to me about the possible Australian role in trying to bring to an end the terrible conflict in that country. Australia recognises Ethiopia as a sovereign state within its internationally recognised boundaries, and as such has not been in a position to take sides, other than in a way that recognises that sovereignty. We acknowledge the awful pressures and the tragedy that has occurred within the country over the years of conflict, and in particular in the years of drought that have been so devastating. We have made a major financial contribution over recent years to try to alleviate some of the distress associated with the food shortages. It may be-although I certainly make no such commitment at this stage-that we can play some other role in helping in the context of the negotiations that are mercifully now occurring and contribute towards some resolution of the situation. I thank Senator Schacht for his contribution to the debate also.

        —The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on information provided by Australia Post:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The answer is ``Yes'' for magazines being registered after October 1989; however publications are registered annually so existing publications with a cover price exceeding $5 will not be affected until their next annual renewal occurs after 1 October 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The terms and conditions of eligibility for the registered publications service are a matter for the Board of Australia Post. This provision was contained in legislation recently passed by the Parliament. Australia Post has advised that the cover price limit is appropriate because it is an objective criterion and does not require subjective judgements by post office staff. Also cover price is a measure of a customer's capacity to pay the full postage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Publications in the 100-250 grams weight step that would otherwise enjoy subsidised postage of 37 cents will be liable for the full postage of $1.10 for interstate delivery; the figures for publications in the 250-500 grams weight step are 47 cents and $2.10 respectively. However, some publications affected by the new criterion may be eligible for Australia Post's published discounts. Australia Post's proposals to reduce losses incurred on the registered publications service (see answer to part 5) are consistent with its statutory obligation to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The exact number is not known because Australia Post has not previously required publishers to state the cover price when applying for registration. However, Australia Post estimates that the number will be less than 150, ie less than 1% of publications initially, and not all of the 150 magazines fall within the category of publications referred to in (3).
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) This measure is part of a package designed to contain the loss on the registered publications service and reduce it by half over the next 3 years. The loss in 1988-89 is estimated at $21 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) In April 1989 Australia Post submitted its proposals for registered publications to the Scrutiny of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). The proposals were considered at the PSA's public enquiry in May 1989. A wide variety of organisations took the opportunity to make submissions to the PSA.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Australia Post provided advice of the change to publishers in April 1989. This was in addition to the public evidence provided to the PSA.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) It is open to specialist publishers to negotiate postal arrangements for their publications with Australia Post. The question of special assistance for the distribution requirements of specialist publications is a matter for the appropriate Minister.

       (1) The ASTEC study referred to was titled Science, Technology and Australia's Future and was reported in LINK; a magazine produced by the Victorian Department of Industry, Technology and Resources; Vol 7 No. 8, pages 90-1. The statistical evidence used in this study to identify (a) Niche High Technology Products and (b) Regional Services as outstanding potential growth areas for Australian exports has been derived from publicly available data from sources such as Austrade and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and also from interviews with leading business decision makers. Information from business leaders in the context of this study was qualitative rather than quantitative and was not comprehensive in its coverage. ASTEC also engaged International Data Corporation as consultants to provide statistical analysis of trends in information technology demand in Australia. The ASTEC study identified market opportunities in the primary, manufacturing and service sectors of the economy. Other areas identified in the study as outstanding growth areas for Australian exports including food processing, aluminium and tourism.

       The figures for defence-related equipment exports are based on the value of applications for export of defence equipment defined under Schedule 13 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Actual exports for defence-related equipment may differ from the figures shown in this table because sales can fall through after approvals have been granted. Further, the annual figures are slightly understated as equipment values for some export applications approved were not provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       Figures for 1989 are greatly increased over previous years as a result of application of new export policy coming to the attention of exporters moving goods for repair, servicing and replacement in and out of Australia. They should not be interpreted as entirely due to an increase in manufactured exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because of the inherent difficulty in estimating exports in the defence-related equipment area, it would not be appropriate to assign annual growth rates to exports for the above years.
