       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the Senators in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.
      </para>
      <para>
       That in 1987-88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State public hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.
      </para>
      <para>
       And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

       Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;
      </para>
      <para>
       The latest decision to slash the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to ensure adequate remuneration levels for pharmacists, so that they may be able to provide a high quality health care service which is the right of every citizen of Australia.

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the Senate of their concern regarding proposed changes to the laws governing credit reporting as suggested in the Bill ``The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989''.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed reforms will:
      </para>
      <para>
       Restrict the legitimate use of credit checking by businesses who sell/supply goods and/or services to their customers on credit terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposals/reforms will prevent businesses from determining the solvency of their customers and will increase the financial risk of credit providers, leading to an increase in company liquidations and individual bankruptcies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additional costs to business from bad debts due to the lack of adequate credit checking information will result in increased prices/charges and will result in credit providers refusing credit facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate will call on the Government to refer these proposals restricting credit checking to a Senate Standing Committee for further consideration before proceeding with the matter.

       The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.

       After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.

       X-rated and Violent Video Material

       <para>
        We, the undersigned, object to the proposed amendments to the Social Security Act which will restrict the rights of the unemployed to freedom of movement. The reasons for our objections are as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. The amendments would force unemployed people who need to move to find out what changes of residence would be acceptable to the Department of Social Security. This is an unacceptable intrusion.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. The amendments do not appear to add anything to the existing work test. If they do, then it is at the administrative level where widely different approaches may be taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. The cost of administering such an unclear test would be considerable.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. The only exception to cancellation-moving to live with or near relatives-is too narrow. There are many other valid reasons for moving home. Not least of these is the pressure of increasing rents, which affect people on benefits particularly strongly. Rents are higher in areas of higher employment. People forced to move for this or other strong reasons should not be penalized by termination or suspension of benefit.
       </para>

        We, the petitioners, request that you reject the proposed amendments.

        That the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1989 No. 330 and made under the National Health Act 1953, be disallowed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In speaking very briefly to the motion, I make three points. Firstly, this regulation was introduced in what I regard as a somewhat dishonourable fashion in the way in which it was processed in the Senate. We became aware, through the good offices of my colleague Senator Kay Patterson, of the particular problems which were inherent in this regulation. On 14 December Senator Patterson purchased a copy of this regulation from the Australian Government Publishing Service and tabled it in the Senate on that day. It is perhaps instructive to look at the fact that there is a paper which sets out those papers to be tabled by the Clerk on that day. The paper indicates that statutory rules Nos. 317 to 359 were tabled on that day, with the exception of statutory rule No. 330. I put it to the Senate that it is our belief that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the health authorities to ensure the latest possible tabling of that regulation in a way which simply did not allow it to come within the scrutiny of our normal procedures. It is shameful that that sort of activity should be undertaken. It is, however, not the first time that delayed tabling of sensitive regulations which governments or departments hope to sneak through without notice has occurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point that I want to make is that this regulation was made without proper consultation with the pharmacy profession which it affects directly. Indeed, the first contact between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on this subject occurred on 14 December, the day on which Senator Patterson tabled the regulation. Pharmacists were unaware that they had not been properly notified that they were in breach of the regulations at the time these regulations were put down because the Department had not adequately informed them of the change that was being made to dispensing rules. It is quite unacceptable that a profession should be treated in this fashion, particularly when the meat in the sandwich of any such dispute is the patients and consumers of Australia-those who need their prescriptions filled and are dependent upon pharmacists to provide them with those prescriptions. I will not delay the Senate by reciting the details of correspondence between the Health Insurance Commission or the Department of Community Services and Health and various pharmacists around the place. I simply refer honourable senators to the speech of my colleague Senator Patterson on 20 December which sets out those matters in detail.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third and final issue to which I refer is the question of what is contained in the regulations and what is fundamentally defective about them. Part 8 of the regulation provides that a pharmacist is not to dispense a repeat prescription within three days of having dispensed the original or previous prescription. I simply ask honourable senators to address their minds to these examples: the person whose prescription item is lost or an item in a particular form which has been spilt, broken or destroyed; the person who needs a daily supply of a legally injectable substance; or the example which I gave the other day of people such as myself who use small asthma sprays for the control of a particular disease and who often have two or three of those sprays around the place-one carried on the person, one perhaps somewhere at home, one in the car, one in the office-and who, as a result, go to a pharmacist and seek to have five repeats filled on sequential days so that they have an adequate supply of that particular item around. The regulations do not provide adequately for emergency situations which would allow patients the maximum degree of flexibility in the management of their own health care concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also object to some of the requirements for the sex and age of applicants to be notified in a particular fashion in relation to the filling of prescriptions which are provided for in part 5 (c) of these regulations. The Opposition parties are not opposed to the introduction of appropriate technology within the pharmacy system, the proper recording of these matters and the appropriate use of modern technology. We do, however, have considerable concerns about the personal detail which needs to be given.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I simply repeat my three points. Firstly, we believe that the Government and the Department have not acted properly in terms of the way in which they have dealt with the Senate over the tabling of this particular regulation. Secondly, we believe that the Government has not acted properly in terms of the lack of consultation between the Government, the Department and the profession. Thirdly, we believe that the regulations themselves are fundamentally defective. For those three reasons I have moved that this regulation be disallowed and that the Government come back in February and re-present its case properly after it has had consultation with the pharmacy profession and after it has given additional thought to the significant change which it is going to make in the operations of pharmacies and the way in which people will manage their own health care status.

         —The Australian Democrats will support the Opposition in the disallowance of these regulations as contained in statutory rules No. 330 for the following reasons. As Senator Puplick has mentioned, one part of these regulations relates to the redispensing of a prescription within three days of the initial or some subsequent dispensing of the prescription if there are a number of repeats. I do not want to enter into an argument as to whether the new regulation is completely justified on the grounds which the Government has stated, namely, that it is designed to prevent hoarding of pharmaceutical agents towards the end of a prescription year. Equally I accept the sorts of hypothetical situations which have been posed by Senator Puplick. Without entering into that, I simply make the point that it seems to me that there are grounds for deciding either way with respect to this regulation, but the way in which the regulation has been presented has not allowed a proper debate of that matter. That is the central reason why the Democrats will support the Opposition.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The regulation was introduced, evidently, on 1 December but the pharmacists themselves were not told of that introduction, nor were they consulted before this regulation was introduced. As I understand it, it was not until 13 or 14 December that anybody became aware of it. A letter was sent to pharmacists explaining that that fact notwithstanding, had they refilled a prescription within three days during the first two weeks of December they would not be liable to a fine or penalty.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the question as to whether they would be eligible for payment under those circumstances is still very much an open legal question because the regulation as it stands says that a prescription shall not be filled within that three-day period. If that prescription had been filled it would be quite conceivable that the Government could simply refuse payment for that second prescription.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the way in which this matter has been introduced has been quite unsatisfactory. The regulation was tabled in this place only yesterday, and that was the first opportunity we had, the day before the Senate was due to rise, to formally and properly look at it. The whole way in which this matter has been dealt with seems to be yet another example of the Minister concerned, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), dealing with pharmacists in a very arrogant manner. Surely this is a matter on which, as I indicated initially, one could argue either way on a three-day rule. For that reason and because it is likely to be contentious, it would have been appropriate to enter into some sort of consultation with both pharmacists and doctors, to decide what appropriate rule should be introduced, and then to introduce it in a manner whereby both Houses of the Parliament and those affected would know about it at the time of its introduction and not several weeks later.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is for those reasons that we are supporting the Opposition's disallowance, bearing in mind that disallowing it at this time, when the Parliament is rising, gives the Government an adequate opportunity to go away, consult with those people affected and come back with a regulation in a form which is acceptable and at a time when it can be properly debated before that regulation starts to have effect. If we were to allow this regulation now, it would run right through until some time in April or May in a very unsatisfactory form with a number of legal matters unresolved. That situation is absolutely unsatisfactory and should be unacceptable to the Senate. It is principally the manner of the introduction and the handling of this whole issue which cause the Democrats to support the Opposition in its disallowance motion.

         —Senator Puplick said that, by agreement, we will be brief on this, but brevity does not in any way indicate a lack of passion or force of conviction on the Government's behalf as to the reasons why this regulation should proceed. In the beginning, let me out of hand reject the stunt by Senator Kay Patterson last week in trying to dramatise puny concerns about this matter. The Opposition's tactics in the matter of the disallowance of the amended regulations of the operation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) are a further example of its cynical and opportunistic approach to a whole range of issues in the health area. The Opposition's motion to disallow these regulations will stop the Government from protecting patients from overcharging by chemists.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Why is the Government proposing to change the regulations? The answer is simple. By getting pharmacists to place a price on the patient's record form, we can protect the patient from being overcharged. This is a responsible approach by the Government to respond to the fact that a recent Australia-wide survey of pharmacists revealed overcharging on 83.7 per cent of general patient prescriptions which were priced under $11. Worse than that, 56.5 per cent of those were recorded on the prescription record form, and this is a breach of the National Health Act. The survey was undertaken to discover how substantial and how widespread the overcharging was, following extensive coverage of the issue in the press and complaints from consumer groups and some pharmacist organisations concerned about the practice.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are well aware of arguments that, because there is no direct government subsidy for items priced at less than $11 for general patients, there is no place for government controls on prices. Some pharmacist organisations have argued strongly that these prescriptions are not part of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and that therefore there should be no controls on what pharmacists charge. The Opposition, in an attempt to appeal to pharmacists for support, has said, `Yes, we agree. We will free up the price of these drugs and let you charge what you like'. This represents about the only promise of substance that has come from the Opposition in the health area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we should look at the reality of the pricing of these items. The Commonwealth uses the pricing power of the universal pharmaceutical benefits scheme to get the best prices for taxpayers. The price negotiated with the manufacturer covers the supply to the chemist, regardless of who the patient will be. That is, the chemist pays the manufacturer the PBS price to chemists regardless of whether he or she dispenses the item to a pensioner or to a general patient. All Australians are meant to get the benefit of the price to manufacturer negotiated by the Commonwealth. It is ludicrous therefore to suggest that manufacturers should have their prices fixed to let pharmacists charge what they like. If the market were truly freed up, pharmacists would lose. For the first time the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has made a submission to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. In their submission, the manufacturers say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Tribunal should be aware that by international standards PBS prices are very low with Australian manufacturers only receiving some 55% of world average prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        They go on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        Manufacturers are concerned that the retail pharmacy share for dispensing a PBS product (47%) is virtually identical with the manufacturers share (48%) from which all research and development costs, medical and scientific support services, quality assurance and manufacturing costs, and product liability insurance costs among others, must be recovered. Recent initiatives by some pharmacists to surcharge patients receiving prescriptions costing less than the current $11.00 general user contribution are also of great concern to APMA as such actions not only distort the relative shares between pharmacists and manufacturer but can also be a further disincentive to a patient already making a disproportionate percentage of consumer contributions to PBS costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        These comments are not comments from the Government or patients concerned about pharmacists overcharging, but from the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a key body representing the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in Australia. It is clear that the Opposition and apparently the Australian Democrats do not understand how the pharmaceutical benefits scheme works.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second change to the regulations which the Opposition objects to is the amendment which prevents repeat prescriptions being filled within three days of the original prescription. Previously the regulations provided for only a one-day period between the filling of an original prescription and a repeat. The Opposition's approach to this issue is again cynical and, I have to say, opportunistic. Only a few months ago the Opposition's health spokesman, Mr Shack, said that he was concerned about people in Mercedes Benzes and Rolls Royces stopping outside chemist shops and stocking up with free prescriptions under the safety net scheme. The three-day provision in the regulation is intended to reduce a dangerous and costly stockpiling of medicine at the end of the year by extending the period between the filling of original and repeat prescriptions. This measure was announced in the Budget to tackle stockpiling of medicines for both safety and economic reasons. By disallowing this amendment the Opposition is again showing that it is prepared to support particular interest groups for short term political purposes to the detriment of sensible and rational health policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is not prepared to let patients continue to fill original and repeat prescriptions at the same time and build up stocks of potentially dangerous drugs. To continue to allow this to happen is bad health policy and bad program management. I am surprised that Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats would support people being able to fill repeats excessively and to hold dangerously high levels of drugs in their homes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Community Services and Health has received many calls from pharmacists on this change. I understand that virtually all support the three-day rule in principle. Some have raised potential problems, such as have been mentioned in this debate-for example, a patient losing or breaking a bottle-but this is no different from the situation under the existing 24-hour rule. The Government recognises that this potential problem should be addressed, and it is discussing special exemption provisions with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. It is pointless to suggest that the new regulations should be withdrawn until the exemption provisions are sorted out, as the potential problem would still exist under the old 24-hour rule.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other change to the regulation relates to information about the age and sex of applicants for entitlement cards. This information is required to verify the entitlement for eligible persons. The Government is disappointed, therefore, that the Opposition has taken the line of disallowing these regulations and has been enjoined in that folly by the Australian Democrats, but we do not wish to prolong the debate and take up the time of the Senate on this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the only helpful thing that will come from this sordid little episode is that next year the Australian electors will express, for the third time, their disappointment with the Opposition and the Democrats for interfering with attempts by this Government to save costs, and be fiscally restrained and thus impose a lesser burden on Australian taxpayers.

         —In the couple of minutes in which I spoke last night I was expressing concern about the Privacy Amendment Bill. I wish now to explain the reasons for my concern. The only winners from this legislation will be the practised delinquent debtors for whom life will be made that much easier, despite some minor modifications now proposed by the Government. We were debating a little while ago the disallowance of a pharmacy regulation. That, in itself, is amazing because the Government, after installing that regulation, decided that it would consult with pharmacy. The same thing happened with this Bill. As I was saying last night, this Bill was introduced in the dying hours of the autumn session and this debate is now being crammed into the dying hours of this session. Prior to the introduction of this legislation no consultation took place with those who were going to be affected. Limited consultation has taken place since, but the losers will be the mass of honest consumers who will be paying extra to meet the costs generated by this irresponsible minority, who will be denied credit or services because of the climate of business uncertainty that this Bill will create, or who will be encouraged into overcommitment simply because credit monitoring, in effect, will be prohibited.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is a measure of the unreality of the Government's position that a senior ministerial adviser should be reported as having stated in May that the Australian community would accept increased credit costs of an extra 1 1/2 per cent in return for the supposed benefit of increased privacy. One may well ask, `Just how would he know?'. His only defence would be that in May interest rates had not hit their current massive levels, destroying earlier assumptions. All honourable senators, especially the Australian Democrats, who profess to have a special concern as to the impact of interest rates on Australians, should reflect long and hard before they assent to a Bill which, in effect, will lead to more expensive consumer credit.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the firm belief of the Federal coalition that legislation of this kind must strike a balance between commercial reality and the safeguarding of privacy. We are certainly not opposed to privacy amendments as such, but they have to be workable; they have to protect the consumer; and they have to protect those who are providing credit. This Bill fails the test and should be rejected. At the very least, the Senate must be prepared to amend it carefully, rather than railroad it through in the dying hours of this session. I believe that sound legislation must enable commercial organisations to have access to information showing financial problems that would enable them to make accurate commercial decisions. At the same time, consumers must have the right to be given reasonable notice that such access has occurred and to obtain redress for any improper use of personal information.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be made perfectly clear that for all the mischief that this Bill does to business it does not provide any more real privacy protection for the citizen than is already given. This Hawke Labor Government cannot claim the excuse that the current practice of credit reference reporting involves actual violations of privacy; rather, the Credit Reference Association of Australia (CRAA), through which 98 per cent of credit reference reporting occurs, maintains a careful discipline over its 4,800 members. These include not only credit providers but also retailers, insurance companies, public utilities-in fact, Telecom Australia accounts for over 6 per cent of CRAA business-trading companies and real estate agents. The use of CRAA files is governed by proper security, with records kept only on financial matters and not on personal information, with prohibitions on their use for private investigation, mailing lists or pre-employment checks. I would agree that the concept of so-called positive reporting raises the undesirable possibility of greatly enlarged personal data compilation, and the coalition would support sensible proposals to remove this possibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this Bill, however, we have an effective prohibition of the negative reporting that is essential to credit providers and users. This Government may move 41 amendments that here and there lessen the severity of its initial proposals, but the fact remains that this Bill stands as a massive spoke in the wheels of credit provision and business activity, because it strikes at the viability of the Credit Reference Association of Australia. That Association has been set an all but impossible task in separating commercial credit from consumer credit in its existing files, perhaps involving millions of manual extractions. Again we see the arrogance and ignorance of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and his advisers, when they tell the CRAA that its computers will be able to achieve this. Trust the outsiders to know better than the actual business!
       </para>
       <para>
        The viability of the CRAA will be threatened by the $150,000 fines that will be levied upon breaches of the new, restrictive reporting conditions. It will be equally undermined by the removal of significant categories of current CRAA members. For no good reason of privacy protection, in effect, only the providers of personal loans will be permitted to remain with the CRAA. Utilities, real estate agents, insurance companies, collection agents and providers of trade credit will all be excluded from the CRAA, devaluing the database for its remaining users. Exclusion of utilities will make life easier for that many more delinquent debtors but ultimately, when Telecom's bad debts rise, low income Australians may find themselves paying substantial bonds that they can ill afford. Again and again, this is the end result of supposedly pro-consumer legislation that ignores commercial reality.
       </para>
       <para>
        This bundle of face-saving amendments that has been brought in much after the event, supposedly to deal with delinquent debtors, does not alter the fact that this legislation makes life for such people that much easier and, accordingly, adds to the costs of business. Prevention of reporting a bad debt until it is 60 days overdue means, in effect, that the debtor has missed eight weekly payments before any action can be taken. That is just not satisfactory. Why are we going on and on with something like this? The Government and the Australian Democrats profess to look after those in need, yet when it comes to the crunch we know how they vote. Clearly, the Minister and his advisers are not interested in the testimony of one small business in the motor trade which, prior to joining the CRAA, employed 14 people, with bad debts running at 9 per cent of sales. Access to credit reporting through the Credit Reference Association of Australia has cut the bad debt rate to 2 per cent and enabled employment of seven additional employees, and that is what the Government and the Democrats want to wipe out. By removing and restricting access to the Credit Reference Association and by threatening the viability of the Association itself, this Labor Government is putting the jobs of employees in peril. One must recognise and consider that the Government has to live up to what it says is its concern for people in this country. Unless it looks at that aspect, the Government is just completely neglecting its responsibility to provide jobs and security for people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the worst example of the mischievous unreality of this Bill is the arbitrary separation of personal loans from commercial loans that in future can only be matched through a most restrictive process, which is unsatisfactory, and the drafters of this Bill can have no idea that thousands of small business enterprises are at least partially funded through personal loans. That is just a further example of how the Government has simply not understood what it is doing with this Bill. The Government does not understand how it impacts on the business sector; it does not understand obviously how it impacts on individuals; and it does not understand how the mischievous person can in fact benefit from this type of legislation. Indeed, one Australian family in seven operates some kind of a small business that may be funded by personal loans, and this Bill will prevent the easy verification of the personal guarantees of a company director-again only assisting the reckless and the dishonest.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two industries in particular will be adversely affected by this Bill-real estate and credit unions. Neither can be described as big business, and in each case the end loser will be ordinary Australians. The Hawke-Keating Labor Government has not consulted with the real estate industry where, in the first 10 months of 1988-89, over 100,000 inquiries were made by real estate agents of the Credit Reference Association of Australia. Most real estate property in the residential area is owned by ordinary Australians, who require their assets to be safeguarded. But here we have a Bill that just throws that out the door. The Government does not care; the Australian Democrats do not care.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, I think people have a right to have their property safeguarded and, accordingly, real estate agents may need to check the creditworthiness of prospective tenants before a lease is signed. Again, we must ask whether this Government believes that no tenant ever commits fraud or misuses what is the property of another. From my own point of view, I would certainly want to know that an agent was adequately checking any tenants if they were going into my property to make sure that my property was being safeguarded. But no, the Government says that that is unimportant to this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once the real estate industry is arbitrarily excluded from credit reporting, there will be some inevitable discrimination against potential tenants who are poor. The song of the Democrats and the Government is, `We've got to protect the poor, we must protect the poor', yet this Bill actively discriminates against the poor. Tenancies may not be available when there is no means of checking previous credit commitments, and queues for public housing will get longer. If the Government is prepared to allow the queues for public housing to get longer, then that in itself is very tragic. But once again the Government does not seem to care, because taxpayers' money is just to be thrown around. We get $36m thrown to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, we get money just thrown around to plug up the gaps before an election, and yet here we have a Bill that will actively discriminate against the poorer people in our society and the Government says, `That's okay'. I do not think it is okay.
       </para>
       <para>
        When other cumbersome and possibly more intrusive checking methods must be used there will be longer delays in applications for tenancy, but once again the Government does not mind that. If we have more people thrown out into the streets, it will be because of this Bill. The greater uncertainty that will be injected into the rental market will result, of course, in higher bonds. Who does that discriminate against? People will have to request higher bonds if they cannot check the credit viability of tenants and, therefore, the poor are again going to be discriminated against.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this Labor Government succeeds through this Bill in destroying the effectiveness of the Credit Reference Association of Australia, it will deal a massive blow to Australian credit unions, even though they are not excluded from the existing databank. The 406 members of the Australian Federation of Credit Unions, with 2.7 million members and $7.5 billion worth of assets, made 631,000 inquiries to the Credit Reference Association of Australia. All the consultation it got from this Government prior to the introduction of the Bill was a 40-minute meeting on 18 April. We know now that the Government has seen the light of day, but the problem is that it did not do so until after the Bill had been introduced. The Government does not bother consulting beforehand. The Government does it after it introduces the Bill-in the say way as the Government is now going to consult the pharmacists, after it has put in punitive regulations. This Government fails to appreciate that credit unions lend money at the high risk end of the market. With only the capital of their depositors, and no actual shareholders, increased bad debts and other costs can result only in lower returns to depositors and higher loan interest.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cannot hear-and thank heavens, I might add-the interjections that are going on, although I anticipate that they would be as lunatic as this Bill, as lacking in care as this Bill and a further demonstration of exactly where the Democrats and the Government stand on these issues. This Bill will hamper people in being able to get access to credit and will discriminate against those who need it. If this Bill denies the suppliers of consumer credit necessary information in regard to the credit history of an applicant, it will prevent the directors of Western Australian credit unions from carrying out their obligations under the Western Australian Credit Union Act-to ensure that members can repay a loan before approval is given.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a bad joke for this Labor Government to claim that the Bill will have minimal cost impact on the credit industry, when the national cost to credit unions has been estimated at $62m. This includes $20m caused through new bad debts and the opportunity cost when loans are refused because creditworthiness cannot be checked. It includes $16m in bad debts that would today be detected at the monitoring stage, $14m through inability to collect existing, accumulated debts, and $12m in administrative costs. It has been estimated that an additional loans officer would be needed for every 250 credit union members, that 5 per cent of approved loan applications would be rejected, and that the recovery rate of bad debts will decline from 40 per cent to a mere 5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This further demonstrates what the Government thinks of small business. The Government is prepared to dish out, as I said before, $36m to a company like Kodak and yet when it comes to the small business people who have a right to collect money, who have a responsibility to themselves and their staff to collect the money, the Government wants to throw a handful of ballbearings under their feet to prevent them from doing so. Senator Zakharov sits on the other side of the chamber this morning and shakes her head. I have not seen her get up in this place and explain how this Bill will prevent any of the things happening that I have been talking about here today. Senator Zakharov does not understand how the Bill will impact. Of course, Senator Powell has gone on at length about her so-called concerns-although they are intangible when they relate to this Bill-and yet the Democrats nail their flag to the mast. We know where they stand.
       </para>
       <para>
        The estimates of the decline and the collection of bad debts predict a lot of heartache for a lot of Australians. With these extra costs pushing up the interest rates for honest consumers, there is even a suggestion that credit unions will have to abandon consumer loans altogether, which will be a disaster for thousands of individuals. It is interesting that Senator Zakharov and Senator Powell have been burbling on in this place today with huge doses of verbal diarrhoea. I do not know why, on the last day of this sitting, they have suddenly come to life with rot.

An advertisement in the Canberra Times on Wednesday, 20 December 1989 lists a number of groups expressing concern: the Advertising Federation of Australia Ltd, the Building Owners and Managers Association of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry South Australia Ltd, the Confederation of Australian Industry, and the Employers Federation of New South Wales. Yet Government senators in this place huff and puff and do not care about this expression of concern. The list also includes the retail traders associations, the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Inc.) Western Australia, and the Trustee Companies Association of Australia. The Government does not care. The Democrats, of course, could not care less about anything other than making promises to try to win seats: promises that they will never have to keep because, let us remember-and thank heavens for Australia-they will never be in government to deliver them.

       <para>
        1. Why have several Labor and Coalition State Governments plus over 50 national and State industry and professional bodies, as well as responsible government departments, urged that this Bill be withdrawn?
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Why in June did Senator Bolkus advise the Senate that the cost to the community of this legislation would be `minimal', when in May his own proponents of the Bill told him consumers would pay higher charges and higher interest rates because of it?
       </para>
       <para>
        3. Why does Senator Bolkus continue to disparage the only economic impact study of the Bill, when even after his many changes, the independent consultants have confirmed that a conservative estimate of its cost to the community is in the order of $1.3 billion to $2.4 billion per year?
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Why was the original Bill rushed into the Senate in the last days of the Autumn Session and why is debate on the latest version, with its already 40 plus amendments, being rushed in the last days of the Budget Session?
       </para>
       <para>

        Those seven questions have not been answered, and it will be interesting to see whether Senator Bolkus-whenever he turns up-answers those questions. I guarantee he will not. This is not a pro-privacy Bill; it is an anti-business and anti-consumer Bill. It should be returned for a thorough redrafting in accordance with commercial reality and the real world generally. I hope that the Government will have a better look at this Bill because it will be putting the noose around many necks in the provision of credit.

         —I wish to add some remarks to the second reading debate on the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989. In doing so, I support Senator Hill's amendment to the motion for the second reading. In particular, I support his statement that the Opposition will oppose the second reading of this Bill, and what it stands for, tooth and nail.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One or two speakers-particularly the Australian Democrats, in their usual light-fingered way-have had the impertinence to question the Opposition's bona fides in opposing this Bill by asserting that the Opposition has no regard for privacy. I remind the chamber-and I would remind the Democrats, if I saw any point in doing so, that their forgettery, as my grandmother would have said, is working overtime as it always does-that it was the Opposition which, during the debate on the tax file number legislation last year, forcibly reminded the Government that despite repeated promises from the Government, including the Minister now in the chamber, the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, to introduce privacy legislation, no such legislation had been forthcoming. We made it clear that we would not pass the tax file number legislation without accompanying privacy legislation and finally forced the Privacy Act out of a reluctant government. I have to say-because we, at least, tell the truth in this place, unlike some others-that we received the support of the Australian Democrats in pursuing the enactment of privacy legislation at that time. It is disgraceful that last night Senator Powell attempted to suggest that the coalition parties have had no regard for privacy. Without the coalition parties there would be no principal Act to be amended by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pick up a comment made by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray, yesterday in a somewhat different context, when the Democrats were off on one of their usual rampages over the political landscape. Senator Ray rather sapiently observed that conservation is becoming the last refuge of the scoundrel in political debate in this country. That was a very apt comment on Senator Ray's part, and one with which I totally agree. All I say is that if this Bill is carried, with the support of the Australian Democrats, privacy will have become the last refuge of the scoundrel because the chief beneficiaries of this Bill will be scoundrels. I suppose it is not surprising that the Bill's chief proponents in this place are also scoundrels.
       </para>
       <para>
        The history of the Bill is that it was introduced during the dying days of the last session of the Senate, on 16 June this year, by the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus. It had been the subject of no prior consultation with any industry-least of all the credit reference reporting industry, or any of the other industries likely to be affected by the Bill-yet it is a major piece of legislation which will undoubtedly seriously damage the livelihoods of all those industries. There was a suggestion at the time that the Bill had been drafted in the Minister's private office, firstly, because it was so badly drafted and, secondly because it was such an obviously ideologically motivated Bill that it was hard to believe that it could have been exposed to the legislative processes of the Cabinet committees.
       </para>
       <para>
        I leave that suggestion aside and go on to consider the further history of the Bill. The objections began to emerge and Senator Bolkus had, or was forced to have, some second thoughts. Senator Bolkus's second thoughts are rarely any better than his first thoughts; nevertheless he was forced to have some. Now we have a Bill which contains 41 amendments to the original piece of legislation. What could more eloquently testify the shoddiness of the administrative and ministerial processes leading to the introduction of this legislation in the first place? Senator Bolkus, as a Minister of the Crown, ought to be ashamed of himself for bringing forward a piece of legislation so fundamentally flawed in the first place which required 41 amendments within a month or so of it having been presented.

         —I will come back to that point. The fact is that if we reach the committee stage of this Bill the Opposition will have no fewer than 35 amendments to the Bill as it now stands. I have to say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this Bill is one element in a mosaic or pattern of behaviour from this Government to which we have appallingly become only too used. We have had a pattern of behaviour from this Government of being anti-small business and also, I should say, totally prepared to introduce the most repressive legislation. The Government talks all the time about civil liberties, human rights, freedom of the individual and privacy. Yet everything it does, whether designed to do so or not, has the effect of reducing and harming all those highly desirable principles or objectives.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Taking first of all a general matter, before I come to more particular ones, we have the Government's unidirectional economic policy, based wholly increasingly, and indeed now crushingly, on high interest rates. That, of course, is affecting all business, not merely small business. It is not hard to understand that small business is much more adversely affected by this than the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltds of this world or the other major companies with whose chief executives the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was wont to spend so much time before they became a bit sick of the sight of him in recent months. Our economic environment is crushing small business. We will hear a lot more about that as we enter 1990 and as people start to go belly up around this economy and bankruptcies start to soar.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to some particulars, we have the Government's absolutely unpardonable attack on the pharmacists led, I should say, by a factional colleague of Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, who is from the same stable. That Minister has put out the most offensive material to Australian Labor Party electorate officers, advising them how to talk to their constituents about the pharmacists. They are advised-we know this because we have had papers tabled both in the Senate and in the other place-to describe pharmacists as greedy and stupid, and other epithets of that kind. We know what Minister Staples and this Government think of pharmacists-a fairly significant element in the small business community. There is not the slightest shadow of doubt about it; it is on the record.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not have time to go through the totality of the pharmacists dispute, but that is a saga in itself as far as small business in this country is concerned. I might add that it is a saga in itself as to the manner in which this Government goes about its shoddy dealings with the business community. Most recently we had the Prime Minister's rather more venal attempt than usual to buy off the pharmacists by having the Remuneration Tribunal back off its original position and offer to bring down a new award if only the pharmacists would stop politically campaigning against the Government. That is a subject in itself. If we had more time to debate these matters in this place it would be worthy of significant investigation by the Senate. I am referring to the behaviour of this so-called independent tribunal, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, but again I will not pause long on that point.
       </para>
       <para>
        Next we have the tourism industry. It is a quintessential small business industry if ever there was one which has been hit to leg all over the country, but particularly in States such as Tasmania and Queensland, and to a lesser extent perhaps Western Australia, by the effects of the pilots dispute. This is a dispute which has been prolonged, and is being prolonged to this day, as a result of the initially inflammatory actions and statements by that once great conciliator, the Prime Minister, Mr Robert James Lee Hawke. Again, we have had that same man attempting to back off the consequences of his own actions a week or two ago by saying that the last thing he as an ex-trade unionist would have wanted to do would be to set out to crush a trade union. I am afraid that, as is so often the case with the Prime Minister, actions speak, and will continue to speak, much louder than words. The point of relevance is that here again some parts of the tourism industry have been crushed and otherwise financially damaged by effects directly induced by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently in this place we saw the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 5) which, as you will recall Mr Acting Deputy President, originally, when it was announced on 15 August in the Budget, set out to bring forward the payment of all company taxes payable by companies with tax liabilities of more than $1,000-that is even tiny shelf companies basically; in other words no real company. Every what I call `real' company was being forced to bring forward its tax payment to not more than 15 days after the end of its financial year, or at least as to 85 per cent of its tax liability within that time. The Government had a succession of back-offs from that under the pressure brought to bear upon it by a combination of the business community and the Opposition. We now have a situation where for the forthcoming transitional year the Government has significantly amended that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, I make the point in passing that once again the chief elements adversely affected by that Bill in the community would have been-and indeed in the year beyond the transitional year-and will continue to be the small business community. As you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am pursuing the theme that this Government's actions consistently and persistently are directed to smashing small business. Of course, that is not surprising because small business is made of individuals. If there is one thing the Labor Party hates, it is individuals. Notwithstanding all the tripe it goes on talking about-civil liberties and respect for human rights and freedoms and individuals-by its actions it continues to repress individualism. That is a theme again in itself which one has not time for this morning.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now we have this piece of legislation. Honourable senators should look at the effect on the real estate industry particularly, if I may say so, those involved in lettings and management of residential property. I happen to reside in an area on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland which is a significant tourism and holiday area. A lot of properties are let in that area to people, not merely at this time of year, although particularly now, who are itinerants. They come there for a few weeks and they go away again. Sometimes they go there for more than a few weeks. I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that certainly real estate agents who have that kind of business in my area regard themselves as being potentially very much affected by this legislation. They are bitterly hostile towards it.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have had from this Minister in relation to this Bill is a pattern of arrogance on the one hand and ignorance on the other-arrogance in the sense of total lack of prior consultation before the Bill was introduced, which I have already referred to. Now it has some amendments, amendments which leave the Bill still fundamentally unsatisfactory. We have had reasoned arguments so far as I can judge them being presented to the Minister by bodies such as the Credit Reporting Forum and its constituents. Last night Senator Powell had the impertinence, the absolute gall, to claim that the Credit Reporting Forum had provided no alternatives. She actually quoted from a full-page advertisement in yesterday's newspapers in which the Credit Reporting Forum had asked, as one of the questions which I think were referred to earlier by Senator Knowles, what is wrong with the industry-sponsored alternatives to the Bill. I should make it clear in passing, in case it is not clear to some members of the Senate, that the Credit Reporting Forum and its affiliated bodies are not in the least objecting to due consideration being paid to people's privacy. On the contrary, they would support that, as the coalition and I certainly would. They are saying that this Bill, as drawn, is totally inappropriate to achieve its purpose while maintaining a balance with the proper commercial interests of those whose businesses it will affect. But, as I say, Senator Powell got up here in the Senate last night, quoted that passage from the advertisement and had the impertinence to claim `We've had discussions with these people, and at no time have we ever seen an alternative. There are no alternatives. We had no alternative put to us'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I happen to know something about the facts of that matter. I have in front of me a Credit Reporting Forum document on the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989. It concerns policy appraisal and alternative legislative models and is dated August 1989. I am assured-and I have no reason whatsoever to doubt the assurance-that this document was presented to Senator Powell and the Democrats in either late August or early September of this year. Senator Powell came in here last night and said there are no alternatives. This document sets out two quite specific alternatives. She may not think the alternatives are worthwhile or that they are good as the Government's Bill. If so, then she is perfectly entitled to that view and entitled to express it. But she has come in here and misled the Senate, I presume inadvertently, by in effect questioning the integrity and the bona fides of the Credit Reporting Forum by saying that the question is not based upon any fact-in other words, that there are no alternatives and therefore the Credit Reporting Forum is effectively acting as a dishonest body by including that question in its advertisement. That action on the part of Senator Powell itself verges upon a lack of integrity. I hope that Senator Powell will have the personal integrity to come back into the Senate later-if she has an opportunity-and withdraw or at least seek leave of the Senate to withdraw that comment. I would be very interested to see whether she has the backbone to do so. I would not like to bet on it, but I hope she will.
       </para>
       <para>
        The document I have just referred to from the Credit Reporting Forum is a very interesting and very balanced document. For example, the second paragraph of the document starts with a statement about the rationale for what are basically credit reference facilities. It says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The community in general benefits when certain commercial decisions are able to be based in whole or in part on objective-
       </para>
       <para>
        note that word `objective'-
       </para>
       <para>
        personal financial information that is relevant-
       </para>
       <para>
        again, that is an important word-
       </para>
       <para>
        to those decisions. Reasonable access by commercial organisations to personal financial information is important in the following areas . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Those areas included financial and insurance fraud; the control of overcommitment and bad debts; reducing costs to the community that would flow from inappropriate and preventable commercial decisions; ensuring that commercial decisions affecting individuals are as far as possible fair and objective; and so on. At a later point the document moves on to the question of an alternative approach and sets out what I think is an admirable statement of aim or of principle. Paragraph 5.2 of the document states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Drawing on the information privacy principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is the Act I referred to in my earlier remarks when I was rebutting or rejecting the infamous allegation by Senator Powell here last night that the Opposition has no regard for privacy-
       </para>
       <para>
        and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the foundation for legislation in this area should be directed to dealing with `arbitrary or unlawful interference'-
       </para>
       <para>
        because those are the terms of the International Covenant-
       </para>
       <para>
        with an individual's privacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The privacy rights in the Covenant are not absolute.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course they are not absolute because privacy cannot be an absolute requirement; if it were we would not be able to investigate the murder of somebody because we would be violating the murderer's privacy. There has to be a balance in these things, as always. The Forum goes on to say in this document:
       </para>
       <para>
        The very terms and expressions used in the Covenant themselves point to the necessity for a given context and for measured and reasonable control by the individual.
       </para>
       <para>
        In paragraph 5.3 the Forum says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore we believe that the principles upon which legislation should be drawn are (1) to prevent arbitrary and unlawful interference with individuals' privacy by enhancing the opportunity for greater control and awareness by them of both personal information held in their name and access to that information-
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have thought that was a totally undeniable principle, but here is the balancing point-
       </para>
       <para>
        and (2) to balance this imperative-
       </para>
       <para>
        I think `imperative' is a very good word in that context-
       </para>
       <para>
        with commercial interests consistent with fair trading and trade practices principles by ensuring that credit referencing is not misleading or inaccurate and that legislation does not have unintended anti-competitive consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it might almost have said unintended anti-competitive and other consequences but I leave that point aside. What really are the gripes in this area? What is supposed to have led to the appearance of this Bill in the first place? I found it very difficult indeed to ascertain what the gripes are or are supposed to have been. I have had some discussion on the matter particularly with real estate agents in my own area and they tell me that there is a very close correlation between past non-payment for items purchased on credit and non-payment of rent. They have drawn my attention to a survey of five real estate agencies which was presented to the New South Wales Privacy Committee in 1986 and which showed that 56 per cent of defaulting tenants with those agencies had a prior history of credit default.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Real Estate Institute of Australia-again people have drawn my attention to this-has estimated that since the late 1960s over 1 1/2 million inquiries have been made to credit referencing agencies by estate agents on behalf of property owners. Senator Bolkus has found it difficult to point to one single example of abuse of this information by a real estate agent. I do not say he cannot point to one or two-he probably can; there will always be some. But the idea that we should therefore go and shoot every fish in the barrel is nonsense. It is a typical example of this Government's approach to the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        But as I said in quoting from that document a moment ago, there will undoubtedly be a number of unintended consequences-at least I take them to be unintended-from this legislation should it come into law. Senator Michael Baume, in his remarks here last night, drew attention to some representations he had received from the Illawarra Credit Union Ltd, which, as he said, is not a gilt-edged, high-flying, financial, money market dealing body but a credit union-the poor man's bank, as he quite rightly referred to it-from an area which is not notable as being at the top end of town. The clear view of the credit union was that this legislation, if passed into law, would have serious adverse effects on what it called the lower socioeconomic groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the Democrats do not care about that but they have never had any concern for lower socioeconomic groups. They are always chasing after their middle class trendy vote-people who have no contact with what the sociologists call the lower socioeconomic groups-and their new class supporters. I have to say that the Labor Party does not care about those people. We have seen that demonstrated again and again in by-elections in this country during this year, with a revolt against the Labor Party in electorates like Oxley, Adelaide, Port Adelaide and so on-a demonstration that the Labor Party is out of touch with its own roots and that it, too, has been to a large degree captured by the new class of supporters: the Public Service trade union organisers, the lawyers for Labor and other such luminaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are going to find as one of the unintended consequences of the passage of this Bill that the incidence of fraud will certainly increase-which other honourable senators from this side have spoken about-when dishonest tenants learn that they can move from one property to another without details of their non-payment of rent and/or damage to property being recorded and accessible to new and unsuspecting people renting property to them. Of course, one consequence of that will inevitably be that persons renting property will be much less willing to do so to tenants who cannot produce impeccable references. Again, what the Illawarra Credit Union calls the lower socioeconomic groups, because they will not be able to produce those impeccable references, will simply find themselves either unable or much less able to get tenancies than they can today. No doubt more people will go on to the public housing rolls. This will be an unintended consequence on the part of this Government and will add to the list of the new poor which the Labor Party has created. Alternatively, persons renting property will simply load rentals generally as a form of insurance against default.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that like most such politically motivated do-gooding exercises-if they can even be called by that dignified phrase-this legislation, if passed, will have major unintended consequences. Small business-real estate agents in particular-will be disrupted and disadvantaged in the access to and extension of credit on which its operations are based. Consumers, especially in the lower income group, will be significantly disadvantaged while costs to the services provided will be increased because of the extra risks involved in providing them. Senator Bolkus and his colleagues believe they are the only ones in step. I am glad to see the Minister has finally come in to the chamber.

         —Senator Bolkus and the Australian Democrats-as one would expect for the reasons I have already given-are in step on this Bill, yet there is a list of organisations opposing this Bill. A full-page advertisement on 20 December lists 45 bodies. They have already been referred to at some length by other honourable senators and I do not have time in any case to list them. But let me look at some of them: the Insurance Agents Association of Australia, the Media Council of Australia, the Small Business People's Movement and the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies. These are respectable bodies and are not to be held in contempt by the Government, but the fact is that Senator Bolkus believes he is the only one in step. I suspect that even his Cabinet colleagues do not understand what he is doing and if they did they would not let him. In conclusion, nothing will do the Labor Party more damage than this Bill being passed. In that case, perhaps I should not be opposing the Bill. Nevertheless, I do oppose the Bill, and I conclude my remarks on that note.

Suffice it to say that, when the big decisions were made in Australia over the last seven years when Senator Stone was in a position of responsibility-when the dollar was floated, for instance-he slept through them. Australia has had to progress despite the attitudes and vitriol of people like Senator Stone, and I for one am glad that he is in the Senate because it keeps him out of the Department of Treasury.

        I am sorry to say that this has been one of the most disappointing second reading debates that this Parliament has seen. It has been disappointing because of the degree of misinformation that has been relayed to the Senate by the Opposition. It is disappointing that all the Opposition has chosen to do is repeat unfounded misinformation fielded by one sector of the credit industry, and I say one sector because major parts of industry have had direct, continuing and fruitful discussions with government which the Opposition has chosen to ignore. I think that is a symptom of the problem that Australia faces today. The Opposition will forever be the sideshow if it continues to play with the sideshow operators.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, it has been a campaign of misinformation, harassment and, in some cases, direct political blackmail. It has been a hypocritical campaign based, on the one hand, on mouthing platitudes in support of privacy and, on the other hand, on running very hard on a secret agenda. These angels of privacy, the Credit Reference Association of Australia (CRAA), as Senator Stone in his new-found wisdom in the area refers to them, for instance, have said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Privacy is a genuine concern for the community. Government and Opposition parties will not be easily persuaded to reject privacy oriented legislation. Accordingly, they will only respond to a massive and insistent demonstration from all elements of industry affected that, in the community interests, the Bolkus legislation is totally unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a stark demonstration of the mouthing of platitudes but with a distinctly secret agenda. Angels they are not, I point out to Senator Stone; evil angels they may very well be.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned blackmail-and I do not mention that word all that lightly, either. For instance, there was the move by CRAA, the Opposition's sponsors in this debate, on 22 November 1989 to switch off access to its database to motor vehicle dealers because, as it claimed, of the effect of the Privacy Bill-a Bill that at that stage had not even been debated here. The CRAA conceded to the Motor Traders Association of Australia (MTAA) that the CRAA had deliberately taken such precipitate action in order to influence the outcome of a meeting between the CRAA and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The CRAA found the MTAA's satisfaction with the Government's assurances as to its members' interests unacceptable to its political cause. It turned off access, which consequently had a financial impact on its members. Is it any wonder that the Motor Traders Association has called this `the most outrageously blatant piece of political blackmail by a self-interested group against Government policy of which we have heard'? Is it any wonder that MTAA members are contemplating legal proceedings? Yet the Opposition has taken the position, the side, of this organisation hook, line and sinker.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned misinformation, and we have seen some great examples over the last three days. Two days ago we found this often quoted advertisement-one that has been presented by the Opposition which, once again, has been sucked in-claiming that a member of the Australian Privacy Foundation had stated that the Bill would force interest rates up. He said no such thing. The statement was a statement of principle, made as a member of another organisation before the Bill was even introduced or considered. The statement has no relevance to the Bill and does not reflect on the Bill at all, but it is quoted consistently by those suckers on the other side of the chambers as a judgment on the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The misinformation continued yesterday on the issue of the cost of the legislation. I was asked in a full page advertisement why I continued to disparage the only economic impact study of the Bill when, even after many changes, the independent consultants have confirmed that a conservative estimate of its cost to the community is in the order of $1.36 billion to $2.4 billion per year. The answer is very simple. The study has no relevance, nor does it have any credibility. For instance, the Chairman of the Credit Reporting Forum, Mr Graham Laughlin, said on 22 August:
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing criticisms of the Bill had become purely hypothetical in view of the proposed amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday we had a continuation of the big lie. We were told that, in essence, there has been another study since the amendments. What is the truth about this economic assessment, this other study? What is the truth about the first study as well? The author, the consultant, has told us the following about the study: firstly, he had not reconsidered his economic assessment after the amendments, nor had he studied the amendments. Secondly, originally he had been given 2 1/2 weeks to prepare his report but it took just a little longer. Thirdly, he said that his figures `came together on the last day'. So that is why I disparage a report like that and that is why I would expect other people in this Parliament to do the same. There has not been, as claimed, a reassessment. The initial assessment is hypothetical crap. It is irrelevant; it is shoddy; and even the initial figures in it are superficial. That is why I will continue to disparage it and that is why economic progress in this country would be better off if Opposition senators made a closer analysis of documents such as that.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, members of the Opposition have fallen behind this irresponsible campaign of misinformation to the extent that all the amendments that they had circulated up to yesterday, word for word and line for line, but for two minor exceptions, were the amendments of the CRAA. In the interests of honest information in this place I will table those amendments so that honourable senators opposite can match them word for word with their amendments. The pretence of defenders of privacy on the other side is well and truly just a pretence. They come in here with--

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, I apologise unreservedly. However, I make the comment that, in the interests of fair and open public debate, one should go through those amendments and see where they come from. We have been told for weeks now that the Opposition has been in a closed room working out its amendments to this Bill. Mr N. A. Brown, the Opposition spokesman, is supposed to be closed up somewhere in his private room working out the amendments. We went through them the other night and we discovered that, word for word, they were amendments that had been presented to the Government before. So let us put an end to the pretence that the Opposition has any interest in a fair and balanced approach to this debate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have been told that there has been a lack of consultation; I think Senator Hill made that point at the start of his speech. On the day the first Bill was issued-in fact even before that-I met with Mr Brown and on the day amendments were issued I met and consulted with him. There has been continuing consultation with Mr Brown on this issue as he is the relevant person in this area. For instance, I do not think Senator Hill even looked at the amendments until some time yesterday. Mr Brown, as the appropriate spokesperson, had been consulted.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been told there have not been consultations with industry. Consultations have been going on in this area for about seven months before and after the introduction of the Bill, about the principles of the Bill and the sorts of things that we are going to do. But I must say that we have been misled. Take, for instance, one of the important issues that has been raised by the Opposition concerning who should have access to credit files. There is some claim that anyone in the commercial sector should have access to credit files. On 19 April in a public meeting I asked Mr Bargon of the CRAA what we should do with insurance companies, government departments, real estate agents and rental companies. He said, `I am happy to see legislation stamp them out, even in circumstances where a finance company is related to the real estate function'. We have had consultations in this area, but sometimes it is like dancing on quicksand and that is why the consultations have gone on for quite some time. In fact, we have consulted widely. We have consulted with the Australian Bankers Association, credit unions, mortgage insurers, the Australian Finance Conference Ltd, and the list goes on. In fact I can quote from one of quite a number of letters that we have received. Mr Richard Thomas, Director of Corporate Affairs, Coles Myer Ltd, in a letter dated 5 September states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . on behalf of Coles Myer Ltd and its associate company, Australian Retail Financial Network Ltd, I wish to thank you for the obvious efforts you have made to accommodate industry concerns with the legislation. It is evident in the amendments you have put forward that you have genuinely sought to overcome some of the major problems identified by the credit industry . . . and to satisfy the interest of both credit providers and their customers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us not have this continual claptrap that we get from the other side. I keep saying that, if Opposition senators keep playing on the sideshow, they will stay there.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have come forward with 41 amendments which relate to six major areas. Let us just go to two of those areas since we are talking about consultations. At the start of this debate we were presented with a proposed code of operation from the CRAA. Under that code it was suggested that there be a 90-day period before defaults could be logged. I accepted that and adopted it in good faith. In the normal way in which this game has been played by the Opposition's sponsors they then came out and criticised us. A lot of the amendments go very much to that point. Amendments have been put up and accepted by the Government, but the quicksand has changed. Not only did we reduce the 90-day period to 60 days but also we have accommodated earlier registration of serious credit infringements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The commercial consumer distinction was made very clear to us. In fact, when I put it to Opposition senators that Neil Brown, the shadow Attorney-General, was thinking of bringing commercial files under the ambit of the Act, they said, `No'. What do we get from the other side now? The amendments cover four other major areas. We should not be blinded by the number of amendments; we should just look at the number of pivotal areas that have been mentioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has adopted a serious consultative process in this area which I think has led to some quite productive outcomes. Not only have we had to dance on quicksand with industry in this area but also the history of politics and privacy in this country indicates that we have had the same sort of problem when dealing with members of the Opposition. Nowhere has this become more difficult in recent years than in negotiating with the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two major underlying themes have been raised by the Opposition. The first is who has access and the second is what information should be made available. In the normal way that the Opposition handles business these days we had to contend with different spokespeople. Mr Brown had charge of the shadow portfolio and lost it, Mr Moore took it over and lost it and Mr Brown then got in back. So there has been difficulty in getting a coherent line from the Opposition in this area, not only between spokespeople but also from each one. Mr Brown, in his first press statement to do with this area, said that there need to be clear rules about who should have access to this information. He then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Many Australians are . . . doubly worried about who will have access to it and what guarantees there will be that it remains confidential.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not the only thing he said. He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        There must be clear rules laid down on-what may be recorded; by whom; who will have access to it; and the individual's right to have access to his or her own records and to correct mistakes.
       </para>
       <para>
        He said that the information should be available only to those who are involved in granting credit.

Mr Moore also put out a press statement in respect of the information that should go on file. One cannot stop John Moore issuing press statements. In his press statement he said; `Only credit information'. What do we have now? Open slather and dancing on quicksand by the Opposition.

        The Government's position is quite clear. It has been adopted in the main Act and in the Bill. Information will be used for the purpose for which it is collected. In this case we talking about the credit industry. There has been a litany of evidence over the years of the necessity both domestically and internationally within Australia to ensure that that principle is maintained. That is not where the errors end. Senator Hill told us that insurance companies will no longer have access to insurance claim files. I can understand why he would believe that; the insurance sector was told that. Anyone who reads the Bill would know that that is not true. Insurance companies can continue to have access to the separate insurance claims file which is pivotal in seeking out fraud. They continue to have access to that. We will debate the matter of the credit files later on.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to what Senator Hill has said, there is evidence from a major company in Australia that when it does its fraud assessment in its bigger than Costigan computer system and gets its tally sheets up, credit reference records do not rate a mention. The most important part of its operation is claims files. Yet the efficacy of the current system has been mouthed by the Opposition. Let us see what other people say about the evil angels, the Opposition's sponsors. I will not mention every commentator in the country, particularly over the last five months, who has praised the Government for taking this position. In 1983 the senior research officer for the New South Wales Privacy Committee stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        From the standpoint of providing adequate protection to consumers without undue hindrance to the process of credit reporting, the Voluntary Agreement must be judged a failure. The kinds of credit reporting problems encountered by consumers are serious and persistent. The protection afforded by the Agreement is piecemeal and unreliable. Most notably the Agreement has failed as an example of self-regulation. Whether through ignorance, conscious determination, or lack of awareness of the Agreement's importance, credit grantors in large numbers are failing to comply with its terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us acknowledge that the people sponsoring those opposite may not be playing the game properly. I mentioned earlier the instance of default and the business and commercial distinction. Many on the other side have made the point that we will not be allowed to use personal files for assessing business cheques and vice versa. The amendments accommodate that. A better reading of the Bill might have brought that to the attention of members of the Opposition. We have also been told that the penalties are too high. Once again, in an earlier press statement, Mr Moore did not think so; he thought they were appropriate. Those on the other side are inconsistent and that is why we have consulted more widely than just talking to them and their sponsors.

         —Someone asked me last night whether I had owned a house or rented one. I have done both. This legislation goes very much to the heart of fixing a problem. We have been given misinformation by the other side. As I say, there has been a campaign of lies and, as quoted by industry sources, political blackmail. Quite a number of groups have been misled. For a number of months we have had letters from credit unions and building societies telling us that they would be denied access to credit files. In reality, even the initial Bill made specific reference to those two organisations maintaining a reference.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have already instanced quite a number of areas on which we have had misinformation. I will briefly refer to real estate agents. In reality, the Government's position is that it is talking about rental information, not credit information. There have been major disadvantages when rental information has been used on credit files, and credit information has been used for assessing rental. As I keep saying-I think Senator Powell made this point the other night-if the information is so good, why are only 655 out of 9,000 registered real estate agents in Australia using it? I have consulted very widely with a number of them, and I do not agree with the organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In closing this second reading debate, let me say I have had disappointed. I think the public should be disappointed. Very early in the piece I found that in order to get good legislation we would have to consult very widely, and that is what we have done. We have been quite accommodating. Some people have had an ideological fixation against legislation and regulation in this area. A hell of a lot of people want this area cleaned up once and for all. They realise that the only way it can be done is by enacting effective national legislation. They recognise the importance of this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        To go back to the point on which I started, the way in which members of the Opposition have been sucked in in this area has been disappointing. They should go out and consult widely. As I have demonstrated this afternoon, one benchmark of the campaign against us in this area is the so-called consultant's report. By his own words, the consultant has blown that out of the water, and he has exposed some of the players in this campaign of lies, misinformation and blackmail as the real culprits. The Government recognises that the way things are going we will not get this legislation through today. We also acknowledge that the getting of this legislation so far, against the wishes of members of the Opposition, in this last week of filibustering, has been vitally important. They can be sure that we will see them in February.

        </para>

       <para>
        That the Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to us that this is now the only sensible way to deal with this Bill and the many amendments concerning it that are before the chamber. I remind the Senate that the history of the matter is that the Government introduced the Bill, without consultation with the industry, and then found it to be unworkable. It then came back to this chamber with 41 amendments which substantially altered the Bill so that on any reasonable consideration of it one would have to say that it was a new Bill. Instead of taking our advice and withdrawing its first Bill, consolidating it with its afterthoughts and presenting to this chamber a workable document, the Government determined to go ahead with its 41 extra amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter is complex-there is no doubt about that-and so much so that in order to do our job properly it will be necessary for us to move another 42 amendments in the committee stage. That puts the number of amendments up over 80. In addition, we learn that the Government itself will bring before us another batch of amendments. When the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) refers to amendments circulated yesterday, the chances are that he is referring to his latest amendments. When one adds to that the amendments of the Australian Democrats one finds a shambles, and an inappropriate way in which to deal with a complex Bill of this nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen the alternatives adopted in this chamber: firstly, the occasions when Bills of this nature have gone to a committee, been dealt with properly and have come back here in an orderly way and, secondly, the occasions when the Government-through stubbornness or for some other reason-has determined not to do that and has made the process in this place a long and difficult debate, the ultimate result of which is legislation of not the same quality as if the Government had used the committee process. We have just had a debate in this chamber about the importance of using the Senate standing committee process to improve the quality of legislation where Bills are complex and where there are a considerable number of amendments. I doubt whether in the history of this place there have been many Bills before this chamber to which there have been nearly 100 amendments to be debated. I remind the chamber-I probably do not need to-that this is the last working day, at least for civilised people, before Christmas.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not as though there is a great difference in principle. In this instance the industry concerned, which was denigrated by the Minister this morning, supports legislation in relation to credit reports because it has had to carry on its business in areas of uncertainty. It wants its position and obligations with regard to privacy clarified. That is fair enough. The Government has said that it wants legislation to govern privacy in relation to credit reports; the Australian Democrats have said that they want similar legislation; and the Opposition has said that it supports legislation to govern credit reports. The differences are in the detail, and there are enormous differences in the detail. That is the debate that the Minister would have us go into now.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no critical urgency in relation to this matter. Obviously it is in everyone's best interests that it be dealt with expeditiously, but there is no critical urgency. The Government sold the furphy-the Minister sold the furphy in the beginning-that there was an urgency because the industry was about to introduce positive reporting. That was simply not the case. That is not the question that we have before us. All the parties agree that positive reporting is not in the best interests of sound legislative practice in this area, so what we are talking about is a negative reporting regime. Therefore, there is no urgency. The industry has been in operation for a long time. The day-to-day operations of an enormous number of Australian businesses are involved. The records are there. As much as a regulatory regime is necessary, it needs to be imposed in an orderly and sensible way, with adequate consultation with industry and commerce that are so vitally dependent upon it.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no critical urgency. What better process could be adopted by this chamber than in the first part of next year its Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs being given the task-I do not know whether it will embrace it with great enthusiasm-of working through the 100 amendments that are about to be debated in this chamber, putting them in order, finding ways in which they might be consolidated, settling the differences of argument, listening to business and commerce which wish to put points of view and ensuring that their views are, in fact, properly brought to the chamber, because there is great disparity of view as to what business is saying.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will refer to two matters that the Minister raised this morning. He said that the costs of his regulatory regime have been estimated at between $1.5 billion and $2.3 billion which, I remind honourable senators, will ultimately be borne by the consumer although in the first instance it will be borne by business. The Minister says that should not be taken into account and, in fact, those who prepared the estimates have withdrawn from their position. I quote from a letter dated 24 November 1989 from the Business Planning Group which says:
       </para>
       <para>
        I produce the newsletter `Business Insight' and report on progress of this legislation in issues of the 8th September and the 19th October, copies of which are attached. It is clear and on the public record that I was monitoring this legislation and that I had not changed my overall assessment of the effects on industry which it would have.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there has been no withdrawal from those who estimated the cost. The only figures that we have in this debate, that are on the record, are estimates of somewhere between $1.5 and $2.3 billion in terms of extra financial burden to business.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister, in his quite ungracious second reading closing speech, sought largely to use the occasion to bucket the Opposition to justify his legislation. He said that there was no doubt that insurers do not rely upon credit reports in helping to avoid fraud. I bring to the attention of honourable senators a letter from the Insurance Council of Australia dated 6 November 1989-in actual fact, it is addressed to Senator Janine Haines, so presumably the Democrats will not dispute this-which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        One of Australia's largest general insurers sampled several hundred claims suspected of being fraudulent and determined that the CRAA had provided relevant information enabling the appropriate defensive strategies to be developed in an alarming 17 per cent of cases.
       </para>
       <para>
        In another test of the worth of CRAA the insurance companies examined 600 successfully denied fraud claims over a one-year period. The insurer calculated the CRAA contributed relevant information to the extent of about 40 per cent in these cases which overall prevented some $3.5m being paid on fraud claims.
       </para>
       <para>
        So in actual fact if the true advice of the industry is put before the chamber-which, of course, would be the case if there was a proper committee examination of this matter-much of what the Minister said in his second reading speech today would be found to be untrue.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that those views are put on the record. I also draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that nearly 4,000 individual Australians-this might be of some relevance to the Democrats although they bucketed the individual Australians who had been lobbying them in recent days-have petitioned that this matter be referred to a Senate committee for consideration and report because of the state of the Bill which the Minister intends to progress and because of the cost to the Australian community of that Bill. We suggest to the chamber that the views of the 4,000-odd petitioners be respected and that the Bill be referred to the Committee as they have duly petitioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been said in the second reading debate, many outstanding issues can be progressed at the committee stage. In presenting this argument for reference of the Bill to the Committee, it is not my intention to go through the major debate again, but I remind honourable senators very briefly of some of the technical and operational difficulties that have come out of the debate; some of the inconsistencies, contradictions and omissions that could be overcome through proper committee consideration; and also some of the legitimate businesses which have been excluded.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me start with that last category. I remind honourable senators that the Bill effectively excludes debt collection agencies which have used the credit reference system effectively in the past; and effectively excludes property management agents and general insurance companies from accessing credit information. All that collection agents will be able to get under this Bill is a name and address. This limited disclosure is, of course, inadequate as the collection agent also needs access to the credit information contained in the report to establish what course of collection action would be appropriate. Collection agents, of course, act for small businesses, and so ultimately the small businesses who use the collection agent resources will suffer. As I have said, the cost to small business will no doubt be passed to the consumer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then there is the concern of real estate agents who deal with property management. As Senator Panizza interjected during the Minister's speech, the important thing is that approximately 90 per cent, perhaps more, of those who deal in the area of property management utilise this service. It is not relevant to look simply at the percentage of all real estate agents who use the service because not all real estate agents conduct the business of property management. Those who do have for some 20 years used the facilities of the Credit Reference Association of Australia (CRAA) to check the financial backgrounds of prospective tenants, and will not be able to do so if the legislation is passed in this form. Why should they not have the opportunity to bring their views to the Parliament through the committee system?
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to general insurance companies, general insurers have had access to credit information for nearly six years. As I said, they use that information to pre-screen an insurance claim, and it is of great advantage in reducing the extent to which fraudulent claims are successful. I would have thought that that would be something that even the Government would applaud and that would respect and properly take into account the views of these general insurance companies. If the matter is referred to a committee the general insurance industry will have the opportunity to present its case to this Parliament and will not have to rely upon the Minister's assertions to the chamber which, as I said, in the form that they were put today, were quite misleading.
       </para>
       <para>
        One can touch upon some of the technical and operational difficulties. CRAA will be required under the terms of this Bill to delete commercial credit information from the records of individuals. It will be impossible in many cases for it to do so, yet the Minister and the Government have not been prepared to address that question. Apart from that, and apart from the possible fines and prosecutions that could follow as a result of a breach of the provisions, no logical or sound reason has been put as to why commercial credit and consumer credit should be separated. In the case of small businesses, as those on this side of the chamber who have been experienced in small business will know, it is often very difficult to distinguish, in areas of revolving credit, whether the borrowings are used for purposes of the business or the individual who runs the business. The Minister and the Government have not been prepared properly to address these technical difficulties and a committee of the Parliament should therefore be given the responsibility of doing so. I, for one, have confidence that it would do a better job.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from this commercial information which has to be exercised there is also other non-permitted information that CRAA will have to remove-for example, information that has been provided by those who are no longer permitted access, such as government departments. Again, regrettably, it will not be possible in all circumstances properly to identify that information. Another example is in relation to splitting the files of married couples. We do not object to that but the machinery of doing so, the computer power to do so, is simply not currently within the system; yet this Government is prepared to impose something that is currently unworkable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to inconsistencies, contradictions and omissions, the Bill does not permit a credit provider to inquire about an individual who has offered to guarantee the account of another person. The Government brought that amendment, one of its latest, to our notice yesterday, but we think there are still difficulties in its terminology. We have just received that amendment. Would not the best course of action be that it go to the Committee for consideration? The Bill exempts from any regulation publicly available information, writs, debts, summonses and judgments. Our concern about that is that in the future there will not be regulation to deal with that information. If people are not given credit because of an error on a summons that they had received in the past, they do not have a right of recourse under this legislation. They cannot require it to be corrected and cannot acquire copies of the information that is being distributed. We do not understand the reason for excluding the protection that would be offered. Perhaps the Government can justify it to a bipartisan committee of this Parliament. The Committee's advice would be of great use in the committee stage of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill bans a credit provider from monitoring its customers. It seems to us common sense that in some circumstances monitoring of a doubtful credit case is only common sense. Senator Boswell has had a great deal of small business experience and I am sure that he would endorse what I say because I am sure he has lost money through bad debts and appreciated the opportunity to monitor those who are in doubt. The Bill does not permit a trader to inquire about an individual for the purpose of assisting in the collection of dishonoured cheques. We cannot understand that. Why should not the Government justify that to a committee which would have the opportunity to examine the arguments on both sides of that issue?
       </para>
       <para>
        We have moved this motion because we sincerely believe that it is the best way in which to further process this Bill so that a credit reference protection regime can be in a form that is commercially workable, which this one is not at the moment; can be effective; can protect those whom it is designed to protect; and so there can be an orderly debate on the subject in this chamber and, in the end, the whole chamber can be happy that what has come out of it is a satisfactory and effective piece of legislation. All parties in this chamber now say that there should be protection; there should be credit reference legislation. We are talking about the detail of that legislation. There are now some 100-odd amendments to be debated. The best and sensible way of dealing with that is through a Senate standing committee, and I commend that course of action to the Senate.

         —I want to speak very briefly, not on the particular merits of the case as put by Senator Hill, but on a more general point. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember that a committee, of which you were chairman, recommended-and the recommendation was unanimously accepted by the Senate-that more Bills should be referred to legislative and general purposes committees and that the machinery was set up, including putting aside next year special sitting days, for consideration of legislation by those committees.

        The Privacy Amendment Bill seems to be a Bill-and I do not want to repeat the arguments of Senator Hill-on which there is genuine divergence of views. Many people in the community feel worried about the Bill and wish to make an input into it. For that reason, it seems to me highly proper that the Bill should go to a legislative and general purposes committee-and the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee is the obvious one because of the Bill's complexity-and, since the view of the Senate is that we should send more Bills to committees, it could be properly examined in public with the community being able to make an input into its content. The Committee of which you were chairman, Mr Acting Deputy President, comprised honourable senators from the Opposition, the Government and the Australian Democrats. It was the unanimous view of the Committee that we should send more Bills to committees. It seems to me that if the Senate means what it says we should send this Bill off to a committee.

         —I will be very brief. This matter of referring Bills to a committee again highlights the difficulties that references such as this make for committees. The Senate will be well aware of the extreme problems the Select Committee on Migration Regulations has experienced in the recent few weeks when the Committee was formed and given the task of examining in great detail the regulations attached to the new migration Act. We had a reporting date which meant a very tight schedule. In order to meet that schedule, we had to meet whilst the Senate was sitting, but the Senate itself, despite setting the Committee deadlines, was unwilling to allow the Committee to meet while the Senate was in session. I am not arguing the merits against that decision but I argue that, if we are to use the committee system, we have somehow to accommodate how a committee can follow through with its work, meet its obligations to the chamber and to the Parliament, while at the same time taking account of the workload of the members of the various committees.

        Today is the fifth day of the fifth consecutive week of sitting, and the Migration Regulations Committee-the one that I particularly referred to, although it is not the only committee that I am a member of-had to meet at extreme hours of the day in order to fulfil the obligations imposed upon us in the Senate. Next year we are moving into a new committee system, with which I recognise the previous speaker, Senator Hamer, had a great deal to do. I hope the experiment will work, because I think there are many advantages, with different Bills that come before us, in requiring the detailed scrutiny that a committee can give to a Bill. I think it is something that we all can look forward to, but at the end of a session, as we are at the moment, we all too often get matters referred to a committee as a way of hiving things off.

         —I rise to oppose Senator Hill's proposition. In doing so I do not want to go through my speech again, as Senator Hill went partly through his, but there have been consultations which have been constructive. I think that has been a very healthy process, particularly with those organisations that have wanted to play it constructively. I think Senator McKiernan makes quite a valid point. On the one hand, we have been having consultations and, on the other hand, I remind Senator Hill that he may not have been having consultations with the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to which he wants to send this matter. But having spoken to three members of that Committee in the last 15 minutes, they do not share his enthusiasm to take this process on. In other words, the Committee does not want it. The Government gives highest priority to the Privacy Amendment Bill and it will be the first Bill on the agenda when we return in February. As a consequence, having given it that priority and asserting that we have had wide and constructive consultations, we oppose the referral of this Bill to a committee.

         —I rise to say that the Australian Democrats will also not be supporting this reference to a committee. I just make a point about Senator Hill's argument that the number of amendments is relevant to any decision on whether or not a Bill should go to a committee. In my short time in this place I have dealt with many pieces of legislation with voluminous amendments. One such piece of legislation was debated at the beginning of this week. If there is goodwill on all sides it is quite within the capacity of people responsible for legislation, and the people with whom they are consulting outside this chamber, to address that practical issue of numbers of amendments and to come to resolution. It is not always necessary to send legislation to a committee. I endorse the remarks of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) about the level of consultation in this process. The Democrats believe that the legislation has reached the stage where it is workable and ought to be able to be handled by this chamber and, indeed, would have been able to have been handled by this chamber. Therefore, I do not believe there are any arguments on that basis for the Bill to be referred to a committee.

I listened to Opposition speeches in the second reading debate, many of which included a declaration that legislation in this area was desirable. Having an agreement in principle from members of the Opposition, and obviously an agreement in principle by the Government, that legislation in this area is desirable, we are faced with innumerable amendments. One benefit of the Bill going to a committee that I can see is that a committee would be unanimous in the view that, in principle, legislation in this area should be adopted; therefore, the committee would be able to narrow down the differences and, in a report back to the Senate, indicate where the essential differences are. It appears to me that only three or four areas of absolute difference exist, and under those circumstances in this case-and I will not argue about the general issue-it seems desirable to have the Bill referred to a committee. I support the motion that the matter be referred to a committee, but I do so only on the understanding that the committee would get on to its business quickly, advertise in January and get the report prepared preferably by early February, so that it would be available for us in time for the first sitting day next year.

As Senator Harradine pointed out, some members of the Opposition, including myself, supported the Privacy Amendment Bill because of some of the measures contained within it. I am one of the most outspoken ones against the vexatious clauses of the Bill. Last evening I supported the idea that some of this Bill is required to protect the honest user of credit. But 90 per cent of it has been made in haste by this Government and will be supported by the Australian Democrats because of the oncoming election. After all, this Bill was brought into this House at least seven weeks ago. Immediately, the Government had 42-odd amendments. If it is so pressing and if there are so many problems with credit reporting the Government has had plenty of time in the last seven weeks to bring it on and deal with it.

         —in reply-In closing the debate I want to reiterate the point that I am disappointed that the Australian Democrats and the Government are not prepared to adopt this process which will not only result in improved legislation but also improve debate at the committee stage in this chamber. I remind the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that he was involved in the debate on the Corporations Bill. As a result of a committee of the Parliament having the opportunity to deal with that Bill, the debate in this chamber was reduced to a sensible number of hours, literally a few hours, whereas otherwise it would have taken up days, if not weeks. That is what we are putting to both the Democrats and the Government in this instance. Why not reduce the complexity by making the committee system work?

        The Parliament does not sit again, if it is to sit again before the election, until 20 February. That would mean that advertisements and other matters that need to be attended to in the meantime could take place early in January. The Committee could have three weeks to consider this Bill and to put it in shape before, as Senator Bolkus says, it is treated as the first item on the agenda when we return here on 20 February. If the Government and the Democrats were prepared to adopt that procedure we would all be better off. What is more important, we would end up producing a better piece of legislation. So in no way can this mechanism be said to be a delaying mechanism; rather it is a mechanism to improve the processes of the Parliament and the consideration of this Bill, and ultimately result in a better piece of legislation. I plead with both the Democrats and the Government to take that into account. There can be no argument with the logic of what I have just put. There can be no argument that it will not facilitate or improve debate in this place. I therefore ask them to reconsider their objection and support the motion which is now to be voted upon.

         —Last night Senator Haines moved that we adjourn this matter until today because there was some confusion as to exactly what had happened in the House of Representatives. I point out that there has been a change in the order and the numbering in the Bill. The Bill now refers to subsection 1, and there was no subsection 1 in the original Bill, which is what rather confused me at the time. Effectively, the House of Representatives has accepted the principle which we wish to see incorporated into this legislation, but has done it in a slightly different way. Therefore, we have no objection to accepting this amendment.

         —Firstly, I would like to thank the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) for delaying the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs Amendment) Bill until this morning. When it was introduced last night it was obvious that it did not completely cover the anomaly that was detected by the Opposition. In the meantime, we have had the opportunity of examining this issue a little more closely. Some time ago the Government attempted to impose tax on software, but ran into some problems. Software which was purchased goods could easily be classified, but there was a difficult where a person had been engaged to render personal services to produce a program. Honourable senators will recall that the Opposition parties, with the support of the Australian Democrats, succeeded in having passed an amendment to correct an anomaly-or, perhaps, an unintended consequence-that while the discs and tapes were exempted under this Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill, the modern technology as represented in a cartridge which was plugged into a port at the back of a computer was not. The Opposition sought to correct that position. In so doing we were very conscious of the need-because of the problem of the distinction between the application of equipment for educational purposes and that used for toys-not to open up a Pandora's box in seeking to close an anomaly. To that end, we sought discussions with the Government, firstly through Senator Walsh's office and then through the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Australian Taxation Office. A high level of satisfaction was achieved. If we were able to have more such conferences to resolve matters of mutual interest-to take politics out of these issues, look for the substance and follow the precedents that have been set in relation to these sales tax laws-we would get much more constructive legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At the same time, I have to point out that while the revised amendments which are now before the Senate cover about 90 per cent of the anomaly that we sought to overcome, the new words present difficulties for certain firms operating in this area. We have to acknowledge that some firms will be substantially disadvantaged in relation to their competitors in the market, particularly those who use an external computer monitor or television screen. The Government's amendments have had the effect of encouraging manufacturers to produce two separate products: a home electronic device and a separate monitor and/or a television screen. In fact, the technology is really working in the opposite direction to encompass everything in an inbuilt light-emitting diode crystal display screen. However, we have to acknowledge that there has been a lot of difficulty in the short time available in being able to frame appropriate amendments tight enough to distinguish between the educational use and the toy concept. Because of that difficulty we are not prepared to open up an unintended consequence by admitting such things as toys. Therefore, under the circumstances we are quite happy, given the limited time available and the need to get this Bill through, to accede to the request that came from the other House.

        On 9 March 1989 the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges: whether there was any adverse treatment of Mr Michael Pope by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) or its officers in consequence of evidence given by him to the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and whether any contempt of the Senate was involved. The Committee, after a substantial number of meetings to discuss the matter, including a public hearing held on 29 November, has found that on balance and in all the circumstances, firstly, there was adverse treatment, although to a minor degree, of Michael Pope-firstly, by Cedric Wyatt, in that he instructed that Mr Pope should make formal request in writing before visiting the head office of the Aboriginal Development Commission and, secondly, by Michael Stewart, in that he extended the instruction to apply to all ADC offices and sent a minute to that effect to all such offices; secondly, the adverse treatment in each case was partially in consequence of Mr Pope having given evidence to a Senate committee; thirdly, therefore, a contempt of the Senate was committed in each case, although not constituting a serious contempt and, fourthly, in the light of Mr Wyatt's and Mr Stewart's apology to the Committee and the Senate, no further action should be taken. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks.

        The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the parlous state of uncertainty faced by the Chinese students in Australia in the wake of the bloody repression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing and other cities and regions of China; the certain reprisals faced by such students if they were to return to China and the failure till now of the Australian Government and the Department of Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs to accept or seriously consider applications from such students for permanent residence.

         —This year approximately 60,000 people will benefit from the Government's Skillshare program. That number is expected to rise somewhat next year. The Government has no intention of adopting the Opposition policy and abolishing this program. The target group of the program is the long term unemployed, particularly disabled workers and older workers in that long term unemployed group. Community contributions make up about 20 per cent of total Skillshare funding. That significant proportion of community contributions is a fairly good vote of confidence in the program by the people who are actually paying the money, other than governments. It is also cost-efficient compared with other training programs such as Jobtrain, costing about $750 per trainee as against about $1,400 for the Jobtrain program.

        The Opposition, in its so-called Economic Action Plan, claims that it will save $61m from the abolition of Skillshare. At the local level its members and senators go around claiming that local Skillshare projects will be maintained. The Opposition's dishonesty is amazing. My colleague Mr Dawkins has told me that many Opposition senators and members have been lobbying him-both before and after the Opposition adopted its policy-for increased funding. Those Opposition members include, would you believe, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, and the honourable member for Deakin, Mr Beale. I also table the list of members of parliament who are on Skillshare management committees. I am not sure whether the list, which was supplied to me by Mr Duncan's office, is exhaustive but it lists 16 Labor Party members and 11 National Party members who are members of the committees which give advice on this program which the Opposition says it is going to abolish.

I concede that, now that we have seasonally adjusted balance of payments figures each month, the Minister's statement at that time should presumably be read in that context. Against that background, I remind the Minister that for the five months from June to October this year the seasonally adjusted balance of payments deficits recorded have been, respectively, $1.9 billion; $1.6 billion, which falls just outside the Minister's $1.7 billion; $2.2 billion; $1.9 billion; and $1.7 billion. Noting that one of those figures is marginally outside his $1.7 billion a month criterion, now that the November balance of payments deficit of $1.8 billion, seasonally adjusted, has been recorded, does the Minister agree that the current balance of payments situation now constitutes a real crisis?

Senator Stone has rounded off the seasonally adjusted figure for November. He called it $1.8 billion; that is a rounding of the figure of $1.757 billion. I am not suggesting that anybody should be complacent about that. As a proportion of gross domestic product the Budget forecast-I do not remember the precise figures-predicted a fall from 5.2 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent of GDP. We would all like to see it come in significantly lower than 5 per cent of GDP. However, I do believe that the figures to date, even though they have been high in the early months of this year, are not inconsistent with the Budget forecast outcome which requires an average current account deficit for the next seven months of this financial year of around $1.3 billion. I believe that the outcome to date and the likely figures for the rest of the year are consistent with the Budget estimate but of course it is too high and it cannot be sustained at that level indefinitely.

         —I have seen the article in which Mr Geoff Sherrington, the President of the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines, was quoted in the Northern Territory News on 4 December as making the statement that Senator Childs has asked me about. The article was under the by-line of Territory journalist Frank Alcorta. Although the words were not in quotation marks, it commenced by saying that Mr Geoff Sherrington has predicted gloomy times for the Territory's mining industry. The question is, essentially, whether this allegation is true. I am not going to engage, as Mr Sherrington so obviously has, in windy rhetoric about this; I will actually go to the figures and, with facts and statistics, demonstrate that his allegation is not true. For example, the latest report of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics shows that in 1988-89, Northern Territory gold production rose by 51 per cent, lead production rose by 54.5 per cent, silver production rose by 39.3 per cent, uranium production fell by 14.2 per cent, and zinc production rose by 35 per cent. The fall in uranium production is due to the slackness in demand in the world uranium market and the low prices that are being paid for uranium.

The Northern Territory is second behind Tasmania as having the greatest growth in mineral exploration other than petroleum. The ABS statistics also show that in 1987-88, the year for which the latest statistics are available, the value of turnover in the Northern Territory for mining establishments rose by 28.7 per cent to $1,063.9m, the highest increase in any State or Territory.

       <para>
        It appears from Mr Sherrington's remarks that his objection is essentially to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which he claims prevents mining development. It goes to the question, I suppose, of whether Mr Sherrington believes that Aboriginals should have land rights and that they should be prescribed in this way. I, and the vast majority of Australians, believe they should, but I do not accept the presumption upon which Mr Sherrington seems to be acting-namely, that the granting of land rights excludes mining. It palpably does not, and anyone who attended the last national conference of the Australian Labor Party will remember that Aboriginal groups lobbied us to extend mining operations in the Northern Territory.

My question to the Minister representing the Treasurer relates to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1989 and, in particular, to subclause 23 (3), which relates essentially to a capital gains tax anti-avoidance measure introduced in the last Budget. For the benefit of the Minister I point out that the apparent effect of the amendment is that, where a group company-namely, the loss company-transfers a capital loss to another group company and the other group company either holds shares in or has made a loan to the loss company, the cost base of the shares or the loans held by the other group company will be proportionately reduced to the extent that the particular shares or loans bear to the total shares of or loans to the loss company multiplied by the transferred capital loss.

Is this interpretation correct? If it is not, why is it not correct? If it is correct, why has the Government introduced such an element into the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) at a time when I would have thought it would be encouraging all Australian businesses to reduce their level of debt?

         —I am aware of the fact contained in the honourable senator's question. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, commonly referred to as CEDAW, is the most important international human rights instrument for women. It was adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 1979 and was sent for signature on 1 March 1980. Australia signed it on 17 July 1980 and ratified it on 28 July 1983. Obviously, many important tenth anniversaries have been related to this convention over the years. For the anniversary this December I am aware that the National Women's Consultative Council has organised Justice Evatt, Australia's independent expert on the committee, to give talks on the convention in several States.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has taken its obligations under the convention very seriously. We actually ensured that it was ratified soon after we came to office in 1983. We provided the resources to service our obligations under the convention. Australia's initial report to the committee presented in 1988 was commended by the committee as a model report for other countries. In accordance with provisions contained in the convention, this Government has passed major pieces of legislation, including the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Act 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's national agenda for women provides a strategy for continued Government action aimed at raising the status of women in the context of the convention. The Government is proud of the fact that Justice Evatt is the current chairperson of the committee and some assistance will be provided to her in fulfilling this role, but that is constrained by the need to guarantee her independence. Australia also plans to co-sponsor an information seminar on the convention for South Pacific island states in late 1990.

This has been compounded by the Government's reduced funding of CSIRO. What does the Minister intend to do about ANSTO's ultimatum to CSIRO to pay all claimed money or face the withdrawal of essential site services, such as health and safety, medical, telephone maintenance and mail deliveries from 24 December 1989, having already withdrawn some minor services? As this means that in the case of accident or incident within the nuclear reactor complex CSIRO staff will be refused medical or safety services and denied telephone facilities to call for help, will the Minister give an assurance that these services will not be withdrawn and will he take urgent action to correct the situation?

         —I do not have any prepared answer on this but I am quite familiar with the situation, certainly in respect of the withdrawal of services by ANSTO. I understand that that matter has been resolved and the services will be supplied. An unresolved dispute has been going on between ANSTO and CSIRO over the presence of CSIRO laboratories on the site; it was suggested at some stage that they be transferred to North Ryde. I sought to have the parties resolve these issues amongst themselves. They were unable to do so and yesterday, as a matter of fact, I determined the manner in which this dispute should be resolved. In essence, I have decided that the CSIRO laboratories should be consolidated on the ANSTO site. I wrote yesterday to the Chairman of ANSTO advising him of that decision and I have also written to the Chairman of CSIRO advising him that, if any moneys owed by CSIRO to ANSTO are still outstanding, they are to be paid. This morning I had a discussion with the Chief Executive of CSIRO and he told me that matter will be attended to quickly. I think there is now an opportunity for CSIRO and ANSTO to collaborate on the site and I think they ought to take that opportunity.

         —As I said in my original answer, my understanding is that the services are now being supplied. If they are not, ANSTO will hear about it. No diversion of funds is involved in this matter. The parties sought to negotiate an arrangement at one stage whereby the CSIRO personnel at ANSTO, Lucas Heights, would be moved to Ryde which would involve the building of very expensive laboratories. The estimate was in the order of $20m. That suggestion would have involved the incurring of large sums of money. In so far as the provision of services and charges for those services are concerned, no diversion of funds is involved. That is an ongoing expenditure.

The report was addressed to me as the Minister for Resources, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to the Hon. Ian Causley, MP, Minister for Natural Resources in the State of New South Wales. I propose to table the report, and that is consistent with my approach of making available to the public domain all the key documents in the south-east forests argument over the conflict of environment and development.

        The study team was criticised when it was first formed on the basis that it was perhaps biased too far one way and/or that it may have preconceived attitudes as to how it would approach the study. At the time I expressed full confidence in the study team. The product of its investigations thus far demonstrates its scientific objectivity and qualifications in undertaking the task that has been set.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report essentially does three things: First of all, it interprets the terms of reference of the joint governments-New South Wales and the Commonwealth-at great length. Secondly, it sets down the methodology that the team of scientists proposes to follow in assessing the information available on the south-eastern forests, and which it will discover. Thirdly, it sets down the work program of the study team to the end of June 1990 and the manner in which it is proposed to finalise the recommendations. I think that was an unanticipated by-product of having an interim report. I now invite any organisation, community group or individual to criticise the interpretation of the terms of reference, the methodology, or the work program, as to whether it will assemble the critical mass of information necessary to make these judgments, and to make their criticisms available to the study team, because it would like to know whether there is any scientifically-based argument about its approach, so that when we come to the final outcome we will not debate whether the methodology was appropriate, but the merits of the outcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two principal recommendations of the report are, firstly, that as the study team has been unable to complete and preserve its own scientific integrity of its report it seeks an extension to 30 June and, secondly, that there be no logging in the National Estate forests in the south-east of New South Wales-except the 9 per cent that I have excised for logging-between now and the completion of the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I inform the Senate that I understand Minister Ian Causley has agreed to the extension date and has agreed that there be no further logging in the National Estate areas under study until 30 June next year. He has expressed the belief, which I share, that there is sufficient wood resource to maintain the viability of industry at current levels in the south-eastern forests during this period. There are two outstanding matters for me to conclude, which I will do in the first couple of weeks of next year; that is, to settle with New South Wales the cutting cycle for 1990 in the south-eastern forests, and to announce my decision on the application of Harris-Daishowa (Aust) Ltd for an export woodchip licence for 1990. On 29 December last year I announced that I was providing a 17-year export facility which is subject to the environmental considerations. At the beginning of next year I will announce the outcome of that study. I table the document.

But Senator McGauran asked me a serious question about the CSIRO. The advice given to Mr Jones was incorrect. Following the publication of details of the CSIRO report in several newspapers, Mr Bremmer contacted the general manager of the CSIRO's Corporate Resources Division to inquire whether the figures cited in the report took into account the substantial increase in funding for environmental research which was made available in the Prime Minister's statement on science and technology and on the environment earlier this year. Mr Bremmer was informed that this additional funding had not been taken into account by the officers who compiled the report, and he advised me of this fact. Honourable senators will recall that I gave an answer to the Senate on this matter on 21 November. I forget who asked the question, but an Opposition senator asked me about funds for environmental research and I gave a detailed answer on that day.

        I make one other point: in regard to submissions prepared by bodies such as the CSIRO to the Australian Science and Technology Council, I think it is important that Ministers see those submissions before they are submitted. I think it is also important that Ministers exercise no influence in attempting to change them. But I think they should be made available to Ministers as a matter of information. Ministers should not seek to have any influence over the contents of reports of independent or statutory authorities of that kind. I would certainly not do that, and nor would my staff.

         —I thank Senator Cooney for his question, as it is acknowledged he left his sickbed in order to perform his duties in the chamber. He has raised a most important matter. Protection of witnesses in all the Australian jurisdictions is an extremely essential part of the fight against criminal activity in our society, particularly against drug trafficking. It would be well known that between the street dealers and the entrepreneurs and financiers of crime there are often interlaid many different persons and activities in order to obscure who are the real financiers and entrepreneurs of organised crime in our society. It then becomes very important to rely on those from the criminal milieu to act as informers and eventually as witnesses in the trials of these people. It is essential that they be protected against intimidation, harassment and threats of violence and actual violence that might be made against their persons and, of course, those of their families.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Not only are the criminal informants in need of protection quite often, but quite commonly there are decent, law-abiding citizens who are prepared to undertake the peril to themselves and even create jeopardy for their families in order to provide information that will be useful in a prosecution. In this situation it is important that, as the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority pointed out, we have a nationwide approach which does secure the protection of these people.
       </para>
       <para>
        A steering committee was set up in response to the Joint Committee report that Senator Cooney has alluded to. It has been having discussions to ensure that all jurisdictions-Federal, State and the Northern Territory-have in place by the end of 1990 uniform legislation, for example, providing very severe penalties against those who disclose information as to the whereabouts of protected witnesses and also to put in place procedures which will facilitate the operation of a national complementary scheme. Obviously, there needs to be provision for a change of identity. This will require very complex document issuing. One thinks of marriage certificates, obviously, as one area that would need to be tackled. Major difficulties also concern social security payments and how one relates to the child support program. The relocation of witnesses and their re-establishment in a different part of Australia is also a matter of quite complex logistics.
       </para>
       <para>
        The joint Commonwealth-State steering committee has been meeting during 1989 and has reached consensus that there be a cooperative witness protection scheme. Under this cooperative model, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) will offer full witness protection arrangements on a national basis for its own witnesses and to all Commonwealth, State and Territory law enforcement agencies based on formal agreements and on a user pays basis. States not wishing to use AFP witness protection services will continue to provide their own. Agreement was also reached between all jurisdictions on the legislative provisions which will be required, and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel will commence work on drafting the legislation, other priorities permitting. It is then proposed to pass Federal and complementary State legislation contemporaneously.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have outlined important steps being taken along the way in the battle against criminal activity in our society. We must ensure that there be no intimidation of witnesses so as to frustrate the bringing to justice of those criminals in our society who, in addition to their criminal activity, would, as I say, harass, intimidate and do violence not only to those witnesses and informers I speak of, but even to their families. It is important that we as a society protect these people and I am very pleased that the national Government, the States and the Northern Territory have reached agreement to do just that.

         —I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to reports from the Cooke inquiry which have appeared in the media during the week in which a union solicitor stated that the red light district in Brisbane does a roaring trade every time there is a committee of management meeting of any trade union in Brisbane. A trade union leader confirmed to the inquiry that these services were paid for from union slush funds. Mr Ken Goodhew, a union leader and Vice-President of the squeaky clean Labor Party in Queensland, who participated in the abuse of trade union funds, also admitted he borrowed $52,000 from slush funds-presumably interest free-to buy a Gold Coast unit more than two years ago. As union dues are tax deductable and income from union funds is tax free, what, if any, are the tax implications for the unions concerned and for the individuals, particularly the Vice-President of the State Labor Party, who have received any benefits in cash or kind? Are such benefits subject to fringe benefits tax in the hands of the union or income tax in the hands of the recipient? Will the Minister request the Australian Taxation Office to investigate the informal claims made that union delegates are paid out of slush funds for attendance at union meetings the cash equivalent of pay forgone, thus avoiding tax?

         —Earlier this week I mentioned that Mr Spender had applied on public interest grounds for the charges appropriate to his freedom of information (FOI) request to be waived. The big spender was seeking a bit of expenditure relief for himself. I also said that the Department of Finance had recommended that I waive charges and that under those circumstances I believed I had no realistic option. Mr Spender will be supplied with the documents in question today-there are about 70 of them in total. With the exception of those that are addressed to me, I have not seen any of them before, and that tells us something about the Opposition's assertions that there has been political interference in the preparation of these documents.

        As Mr Spender's request for waiving the charges on public interest grounds was accepted, I believe that, also on public interest grounds, these should now become completely public documents and not just Mr Spender's documents. Therefore, I table the documents. Attached to them is a brief explanatory memorandum from the Department of Finance which explains the background to the preparation of some of the costings. I also table documents from the public record relating to the period 1980 to 1983 which establish quite conclusively that it has been common practice for governments to cost Opposition policies.

        I mentioned to the Senate earlier this week that I had applied under the FOI Act for other documents from the Department of Finance which were relevant to the costing of the then Opposition Labor Party's policies in 1980 and 1983. I said that I will pay the appropriate charge, and I intend to do so. I again invite Mr Spender to follow my excellent example if he feels inclined to do so. When I get those documents I will also make them publicly available, even though I will, of course, be paying for them. The costings for 1988-89 and 1980 to 83 in the documents that I have tabled are-and I certainly have no reason to believe otherwise-as accurate as the Public Service could provide at the time.

Does the Minister also agree that because the Government is moving so slowly to introduce urgent reforms into the waterfront that companies are beginning to take matters into their own hands? I will give one example: I remind the Minister that the Australian Wheat Board recently loaded a grain ship with two Wheat Board employees rather than four Waterside Workers Federation of Australia labourers, a foreman and supervisor. That was two doing the work that six would otherwise have done-a 300 per cent productivity improvement, the sort of improvement we urgently need on the waterfront to be internationally competitive. How long will the Government delay the thorough reform of shipping and the waterfront while the whole economy suffers and more and more lives are lost on the roads because semitrailers are hauling goods which should go cheaply and safely by sea?

         —Mr President, I withdraw what I have accused Senator Hamer of in a jocular way about 20 times before. I agree that the events of this morning are a major tragedy. The second question is: Is it a fact that our road system is put under undue pressure because we do not move goods by coastal shipping? I would have to say yes to that. It has always been my long term view that a lot of the goods that are carried by interstate transport could either by carried by train or coastal shipping. Part of the reason why they are not is cowardice on the part of government in lifting all sorts of road taxes. The first time there was a blockade and a strike of trucks, the Fraser Government went crawling and negotiated all sorts of agreements. There is not an even playing field at the moment. It is not simply a question of road versus shipping, it is also road versus rail, as the honourable senator would be aware. This Government has been determined, for a long while, to even out that position.

        Senator Hamer has again raised waterfront and shipping reform. It is not a question of whether this Government is committed to that-it is. The Opposition says it is committed to it-not that it ever did anything about it, but that is the old story. The Opposition members are great Rambos in Opposition and wimps in government, and that is well recorded throughout their history. The real question Senator Hamer is asking is: Is the pace sufficient? This Government believes the long term plans it has are sufficient and are the logical way to go. The Opposition might take a different view and want to provoke a shipping strike for six months. We have always believed in deregulation and structural reform, phased in in such a way that it does not have dramatic dislocation; and that, I guess, is the difference between us and the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition always talks about these things. On many occasions Senator Button has mentioned how often the Opposition talks about tariff reform. The Opposition talks and talks about tariff reform but never does it and leaves it to us to do. The Opposition talks about shipping or waterfront reform. It never did anything about it; we have got to do it. The Opposition talks about a range of issues, but when we have tried to do the hard things, it has opposed us. It opposed us in the fringe benefits tax, the assets tax and lump sum superannuation. We have done all the hard work on the things now incorporated in the Opposition policy. The Opposition apparently wants to try to win government and say, `Thanks for all the money, fellows; all that carping criticism is now forgotten and we will take the pot of gold'. The Opposition has only bolted on one issue that it has opposed over the years-and that is not gold tax, it has accepted that too-and that is capital gains tax, and for the most spurious reasons.
       </para>
       <para>
        Coming back to the thrust of Senator Hamer's question, this Government is and has been committed to reform of the waterfront and shipping. But it is not going in with all guns blazing, getting no results-as an Opposition government would-by trampling right across the top. That is the Opposition's policy at the moment. The reality is, if the Opposition ever wins government, the old Rambos will suddenly become wimps, it will do nothing about it and it will dither like the Fraser Government and Liberal governments before did. It will be all talk, and no action.

Does the Minister agree with the OECD forecast and with the distinction it makes between `good' and `bad' deficits?

         —I glanced rather perfunctorily, I suppose, at the newspaper report of that OECD report this morning. I have not seen the report itself, but I did pick up from the newspaper the flavour of that report, which Senator Beahan has referred to in his question. I think the OECD has made a very good point that the governments of some countries with chronic or very large current account deficits do not really do very much about them. I believe that the United States of America (US) is a case in point. I see Senator Stone shaking his head. Of course, it is true that the US current account deficit, as a proportion of gross domestic product, is not as high as Australia's current account deficit by quite a large margin. However, it is also true that, over the period of the Reagan Administration and still, the US has recorded enormous absolute current account deficits in contrast to its history. For the whole period from, I believe, 1914 to Ronald Reagan the US was a creditor nation. The Reagan Administration also-and this is not entirely unrelated to the US current account deficit-ran up huge budgetary deficits. The United States still has very large budget deficits. I believe that the expected deficit for the coming year is about $US114 billion.

       <para>
        I will not go into this in great length, but there are a huge number of constitutional and political constraints on the United States Administration even if it were serious about addressing its Budget deficit problems; not the least of which is the lack of party discipline in both the United States House of Representatives and the Senate. It is not like that in Australia. This Federal Government has massively tightened fiscal policy. For the first time since statistics have been kept, the Commonwealth Government has become a major saver instead of a borrower. I am sure that that sort of fiscal discipline would not have gone unnoticed by the OECD examiners. It is the sort of fiscal discipline that four years ago I would not have believed that any Australian government would have pursued or held to, and I doubt whether anybody else would have believed that.

Does he agree that, despite a possible fall in interest rates, interest rates will remain high in real terms after that increased inflation is taken into account? Does he agree that in 1990 the balance of payments deficit will still be running at the very high level of $16 billion or about 4 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)?

Consequent upon the slowing down of the economy, there is certainly likely to be some absolute increase in unemployment, unless the participation rate changes.

        The Australian Customs Service (ACS) aims to process claims which have not been selected for audit within 14 days of receipt. There is a further 7 days for payments to be credited through the Department of Finance General Payment System to claimant accounts. However, in the majority of cases, claimants receive rebate payment within 14 days of receipt of their claim by the ACS.
       </para>
       <para>
        The processing time for claims selected for audit is generally a further 2 weeks but no greater than 4 to 6 weeks in exceptional cases. All regions are achieving these targets with the exception of New South Wales where delays of up to 6 weeks are being experienced in processing claims not selected of audit. Staff shortages caused by a slow staff selection and recruitment process are the main reasons for this delay. Remedial action has been taken to improve the situation.

        The approved establishment for the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is 102 positions in all regions. This level of staffing has been reviewed in July 1988 by ACS Management and the unions and is considered appropriate. Currently, the actual staffing occupancy is 90, or 88 per cent.

        The statement read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's concern for the environment ought to be global in scope. We have an obligation to ensure that all people have access to as unspoilt a world as possible. This concern also has benefits for us. It is not only environments within Australia that determine our capacity for ecological enjoyment. A number of threats to the environment can have world-wide consequences: ecological damage abroad can have deleterious effects on Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts has been considering such threats to the global environment and the possible role played in these threats by the provision of aid to developing countries. The report tabled today is the product of that consideration. The reference was first passed to the Standing Committee on Science, Technology and the Environment in February 1987. In September 1987 the inquiry was referred to the Committee of which I am Chairman. Specifically, the Committees were asked to examine the capacity of the Australian International Development Aid Bureau (AIDAB) to:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) assess the environmental impact of proposed projects; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) ensure the environmentally sound management of such projects.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reference also required an examination of the adequacy and effectiveness of Australia's participation in the decision-making process of international banks and multilateral aid agencies of which it is a member in relation to the environmental aspects of development projects.
       </para>
       <para>
        The inquiry was conceived and pursued in the acknowledgment that it can be a particularly difficult task to provide development assistance that is environmentally sound. The level of this difficulty is appreciated through an understanding of the ways in which environmental damage often accompanies economic growth, the tendency of developed countries to cause damage to the environment in the developing world and the kinds of analytical difficulties that confront the formulation of development projects that deliver humanitarian aid benign to the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision of development assistance also runs the risk of deteriorating the culture, and therefore the essential well-being, of recipients. Should this occur in connection with the provision of Australian aid, it would be counterproductive to the humanitarian objective and focus that we have adopted for our international assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        In accepting the need to review the provision of Australia's development aid from this perspective, the Committee considered that while Australian aid has valid objectives, it runs the risk of damaging the well-being of the recipients and causing significant environmental damage. In so doing it runs a risk of failing to contribute to the ideal of sustainable global development that was so well articulated in the Brundtland Report.
       </para>
       <para>
        Somewhat reassuringly the inquiry revealed that Australia has obligated itself to a considerable number of sound commitments concerning aid and the environment. Much less pleasing, however, is the fact that no Australian Government has ever formally set out these obligations comprehensively in a published document. The Committee considers that this should be merely one step along a path towards openness concerning the ways in which Australian development assistance is applied in countries that could suffer significant environmental damage unless adequate care is exercised. The formal acknowledgment of our obligations will assist both Australians and aid recipient countries to assess whether our actions comply with our intentions. This acknowledgment will apply both to Australia's role in the multilateral development agencies and to the range of development activities pursued through AIDAB.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to AIDAB, the Committee was most concerned that AIDAB's environmental responsibilities have not been formalised by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT) under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. The Committee considers this regrettable given that the former Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment advised in his second reading speech on amendments to the legislation in April 1986, that such an MOU would be negotiated with AIDAB. The Committee considers that, since the Impact of Proposals Act applies to Australian decision-making, AIDAB's activities are within its scope. The benefit of the MOU is that it will confirm the intentions of AIDAB to comply with the principles of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having AIDAB's activities subject to the Impact of Proposals Act entails requirements of environmental assessment and, where appropriate, the preparation of impact statements. While the Committee acknowledges that AIDAB has prepared a guideline booklet for staff use in assessing the environmental aspects of proposed aid projects, there is a clear need for all AIDAB staff to be environmentally sensitive and informed. Further, AIDAB needs to organise an environmental review section, appropriately staffed, within its Appraisals, Evaluation and Sectoral Studies Branch. And the environmental guidelines need to be comprehensively applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        In part the Committee reached these conclusions about the need for AIDAB to substantially improve its environmental analysis on the basis of a review carried out by AIDAB on 400 bilateral projects current in 1987. The Committee found AIDAB's review to be self-condemning. Of 121 projects having potential environmental significance, AIDAB's figures show that more than forty-five per cent passed through the planning/design phase without the consideration of environmental effects. Those projects amounted to more than $211 million in value. Not surprisingly, of those projects more than thirty per cent in number (and fifty per cent in value), had a `major negative' or `minor negative' environmental impact.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Committee has concluded that AIDAB needs to improve its environmental assessment activities very substantially, and has recommended a broad program for such improvement. If AIDAB adopts the program, it is most unlikely that its sorry record on environmental matters will persist. It includes elements that I have already noted such as the formalising of the MOU with DASETT, the appointment of adequate staff to conduct environmental assessments and the adherence by AIDAB to policy already announced on aid and the environment. However, the program also includes an annual comprehensive audit of Australian aid activities for their environmental effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to the multilateral development agencies, three of these institutions are supported by Australia. They are the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. The Committee found that IFAD uses small amounts of money to help the poorest people in developing countries: it does so by promoting self-sufficiency and through education in agriculture and health. Importantly, IFAD makes loans directly to third world villages rather than to their governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the World Bank's endorsement of IFAD. the Australian Government's record in allocating funds to IFAD has been patchy at best. In November 1987 the Government announced that it would honour its commitment of (only) $8.48 million for the second triennium. It indicated, however, that it would not participate in the 1988 replenishment negotiations. Following widespread criticism of this announcement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, announced last September that Australia would contribute approximately $10 million to the third replenishment of IFAD.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, the Committee considers that the Government should give immediate consideration to increasing Australia's current funding for IFAD. The Committee has also recommended that AIDAB monitor IFAD's activities more closely and report annually to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the multilateral development banks, Australian contributions in 1988/89 amounted to $180.3 million-$52.5 million to the Asian Development and $126.8 million to the World Bank. (The balance of $1 million was allocated to IFAD).
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee concluded that the programs of the World Bank require careful monitoring by Australian representatives. Effective membership necessitates greater awareness of the Bank's handling of environmental issues and the making known of Australian environmental concerns at working levels in the Bank. This will require that Australian representatives to the World Bank draw on the environmental advice available from DASETT. And, given that the World Bank is more a development agency than a bank, the Committee has recommended that Australian representation on the World Bank Board should pass from Treasury to Foreign Affairs and Trade. Further, Australian nominees for Executive Directors should be AIDAB officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was useful for the Committee's task to have had a recent review of AIDAB tabled by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. That report, tabled in February 1989, was critical of the Asian Development Bank's standards of project appraisal. That Committee concluded that strong representations be made to the management of the Asian Development Bank that Australia requires the highest standards of accountability and disclosure. My Committee has endorsed that recommendation. And, as with the World Bank, we advocate that Australian representation on the Board of the Asian Development Bank should pass from Treasury to Foreign Affairs and Trade and that Australian nominees for Executive Directors should be AIDAB officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two other matters are crucial. The first concerns consultation and liaison between Australian authorities. If Australian concerns about the environmental soundness of development projects in assisted countries are to be satisfied, there must be adequate co-ordination between AIDAB, Treasury and DASETT. The Committee has accordingly recommended that these authorities establish a regular and systematic process of consultation to produce the advice necessary for Executive Directors to effectively represent Australia's position on environment policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, Australian involvement in the multilateral development agencies must be an accountable involvement. The Committee has thus recommended that the current responsible Department, the Treasury, should include in its annual report to Parliament an outline of Australia's involvement with multilateral development banks including:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's current representation;
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's official position on major projects and any formal votes taken;
       </para>
       <para>
        the projects for which AIDAB, Treasury and DASETT have provided assessments;
       </para>
       <para>
        any environment-related policy initiatives which have occurred; and
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's input to such policy developments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the adoption of the Committee's recommendation that Australian representation on the development banks be passed to Foreign Affairs and Trade, this reporting function would reside with AIDAB through the annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

         —In just 10 days time one of two things will happen: either no Australian child will be living in poverty or Bob Hawke's promise will be exposed as one of the greatest frauds and one of the greatest lies ever to have been perpetuated against the people of Australia. If the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is not to be proven a liar and a fraud, every single day for the next 10 days at least 3,000 children under the age of 15 in Sydney alone, and up to 44,000 young Australians around the whole of this nation, will have been lifted out of poverty. Christmas 1989 will be a miserable one for increasing thousands of ordinary Australians and their families. The clear, direct and personal responsibility for this will lie at the feet of the Prime Minister. They will not be luxuriating at taxpayers' expense at Kirribilli House, waited upon and pampered, watching the yachts of their rich mates sail by and ordering the Royal Australian Navy out of Sydney Harbour because it spoils the Christmas view.

       <para>
        This matter or public importance draws attention to the plight of increasing thousands of Australians who are suffering as a result of the policies of the Hawke-Keating Government. It draws attention to the fact that in 1990 there is real hope for them only in the election of a Liberal-National Party government and the implementation of our Economic Action Plan. This Christmas will be miserable for families in poverty. Let me draw the attention of honourable senators to the Sydney Morning Herald of a week ago in which this statement was made:
       </para>
       <para>
        On Monday there were 65 beds left in refuges for homeless children in Sydney. By yesterday afternoon the pressure was on and there were only 35 left. By nightfall there were even fewer. The women's refuges are all full. The crisis centres are groaning.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the promising rhetoric from the Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke . . . poverty in NSW is definitely on the menu this Christmas.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to welfare agencies, this year has seen the emergence of ``the new destitute''-those who for the first time are having to accept charity to get through the yuletide season.

        The general manager (communications) of the Sydney City Mission, Ken Harrison, said: ``The number we're helping has doubled this year. We are currently helping over 3,000 families . . . with food and clothing.''
       </para>
       <para>
        ``High interest rates and the high cost of accommodation are breaking people in the middle range. It's creating a new poor who are stretched to breaking point.

       <para>
        The Federal Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, said yesterday he was concerned that an inquiry which he reconvened in Canberra last week had shown there had been little improvement in the number of beds for homeless youth in NSW since his report . . . was released in February.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of social deprivation among those young people the record that the Hawke-Keating Government brings to this country shows that 34 per cent of young homeless girls have tried to kill themselves and that 67 per cent of these children have major drug or alcohol abuse problems. That is the ongoing legacy of the Hawke-Keating Government. Its degree of interest in this matter is shown by the fact that not one Government Minister is prepared to attend the chamber during this debate. We know from the figures that have been produced just what a scandal it is. In his 1984 policy speech the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government sets the welfare of the Australian family as its top priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having devalued and demoted the priority from the top, it is no wonder that the Government has nothing else left. The only hope of those families, those young people, lies in the coalition's action plan; in the real hope of interest rate relief; in the real prospect of assistance for child care; in the real prospect of help for sole parent families; in the real prospect of real jobs created through reform of the industrial relations and wages system; through the promotion of real educational opportunities; and through real reform of the crushing burden of taxation imposed by the highest taxing government known in the peacetime history of Australia-none of which have been delivered to the people of Australia, despite the fact that, again, in 1984 the Prime Minister stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        We pledge ourselves to bring home ownership once again within the reach of ordinary Australian families.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the promises about relief for real home ownership. In April 1985, the interest rate was 12 per cent, and the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . through the period of this year . . . there will be, I would expect, a lowering of the level of interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        In July 1985, the rate was 12.5 per cent, and the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . pressures imposed by the discharge of tax obligations and one would hope as those are met, the pressures on interest rates would reduce.
       </para>
       <para>
        In September 1985, the interest rate was 13 per cent, and Mr Kerin said:
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget will bring interest rates down.
       </para>
       <para>
        In November 1985, it was 13 1/2 per cent, and Senator Button said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Government is optimistic that there will be a steady decline in interest rate . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In March 1986, it was 15 1/2 per cent, and Mr Hawke said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, what we are about is to secure a situation in which we will be able to enjoy permanently lower interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        In March 1989, it was 16 per cent, and Mr Hawke said in Perth, in response to a question as to whether interest rates would fall this year:
       </para>
       <para>
        They'll go down this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Asked whether there was any chance that they would rise before they fell, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No, I don't believe so.
       </para>
       <para>
        In June 1989, the interest rate was 17 per cent, and Mr Hawke said:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no reason why interest rates should rise.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, once again, on issues such as interest rates consistently this Government and the Australian Labor Party have misled, lied and deceived the people of Australia. It is likely that short term interest rates will fall because the Government is running down the economy. Yet under Labor interest rates have been and will remain far too high. Home owners and small businesses are now faced with the prospect of being run over by an eight-tonne truck instead of a 10-tonne truck. Under Labor, any fall in interest rates for home mortgages and small business cannot be significant and sustainable. A significant or sustainable fall in interest rates is not possible under Labor, because it has no policies to fix the fundamental weakness in the economy. Our huge foreign debt continues to mount, and inflation continues to be stuck between 7 and 8 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer will be a new Liberal-National Party administration whose Economic Action Plan will bring down our huge foreign debt and have it under control, and bring down the underlying rate of inflation. From day one in office we will start putting our policies in place so that they bring about a significant and sustainable drop in interest rates during our first term in government. It is not just families and individuals that suffer; small businesses and the individuals that make up the small business sector in this country also suffer. Labor, having pledged after the last war that it was not going to create a class of small capitalists, has certainly gone out of its way to destroy those few small capitalists who have managed to get themselves established.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is absolutely no wonder that the Labor Party has been so intent on attacking the coalition's plans for the introduction of the speculative gains tax to reduce and replace Labor Party's capital gains tax, because on 14 December the Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating) admitted that the Opposition's sliding scale tax arrangements would be of benefit to small businesses and farmers. He said that the removal of the capital gains tax would provide a break to small businesses, including farmers. Of course, the Treasurer is and always has been opposed to, and a great opponent of, small business. Under the Keating Treasury, the only small business to do well are eastern suburbs' antique shops and dealers and vendors in empire clocks. Let me remind Mr Keating that, like the other famous collector of clocks in history, Louis XVI, the tumbrels are waiting and the blade of the electoral guillotine is sharp. All we want now is the date on which we send the tumbrels round and an address from Mr Keating so we know where to pick him up, depending on which part of his travelling allowance rort he is into that particular week.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, small business, including retailers, will be particular beneficiaries of the Economic Action Plan which the coalition will put in place. Let us look at retail sales this year. Coles Myer Ltd reports that its retail sales are 4 per cent lower in real terms than they were last year, and the retail sales of David Jones (Aust.) Pty Ltd are down between 5 and 6 per cent in real terms. The Retail Traders Association of Victoria says that, statewide, a 3 per cent decline is likely in the real value of the sales of its members. Labor's capital gains tax places imposts on superannuation policy holders, small shareholders and small businesses around Australia and is a substitute death duty. It has the potential to hit the value of the family home. All those things will be eliminated after the election of a coalition government and the putting in place of our Economic Action Plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another area in which small businesses have been particularly hurt and damaged is the Australian tourist industry. It is suffering as a result of the Prime Minister's declaration of war on the pilots, because what started as a dispute between the pilots and their employers has become very much the Prime Minister's own personalised dispute-his dispute, his exacerbation of the dispute, his decision to prevent the companies getting together with their employees to sort it out, his decision to bale out only his mates, his friends, his cronies.

         —And to respond, as my colleagues are reminding me, to the dispute that is not, the dispute which has been terminated, the dispute which is no longer with us, because we all know how easily anybody can fly to anywhere they want to go at any time because the dispute has been settled. The coalition parties have never supported the pilots' outrageous demands in this dispute. We have consistently supported the position of the small businessman, the tourist industry, the tourist operators, particularly those who are disadvantaged in places such as the Northern Territory, north Queensland and Tasmania.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As I said, in terms of the particularities of families, it will not just be that they have to curtail their Christmas arrangements, that their food is costing them more, that their accommodation is costing them more, that they are unable to afford the sorts of goods which they have been able to afford in the past. Many will have made the decision to buy goods on credit, and their day of reckoning will come some time in January or February-and their day of reckoning has a great deal to do with the policies this Government has put in place. For example, for those who might have shopped using their credit cards, the interest rate on the Commonwealth bankcard is about to go up to 24.6. In 1984 it was 18 per cent. On the Commonwealth Mastercard, the rate was 18 per cent in 1984 and it is now 23 per cent. On the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd Visacard, the rate was 18 per cent, and it is now 23.5 per cent. On housing mortgages, the rate was 12.5 per cent and it is now 17 per cent and more. On the small overdrafts, the rate was 13 3/4 to 14 per cent and it is now 20 3/4 to 22.75 per cent. That is the legacy of this Government. Once again, it is all very well for no Minister to attend and for Senator Schacht to come in here and grin all over his face. He is not particularly affected by these sort of things; he is well secured and has a secure existence. He is not the sort of person who bothers to go around the streets in cities like Sydney to observe what is going on in terms of the homelessness, drug abuse, and the fact that kids are left on the streets in Sydney with nothing to sell but their bodies. He is not concerned about that sort of thing, because nobody on his side has demonstrated the slightest degree of interest or the slightest degree of concern in these particular areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke-Keating Christmas presents to Australians and their families for 1989 are as follows: for increasing numbers of families, the prospect of no home and no hope; for increasing numbers of young Australians, no presents, no prospects; for increasing numbers of small businesses, no sales and no sympathy; and for the forgotten people around Australia, no recognition and no relief. Only with the adoption of the policies which have been put forward in the coalition parties' Economic Action Plan will there be any hope, any prospect for families, individuals, young people, small businesses, those seeking reward through their own effort, or people seeking a decent standard of living in this country, to prosper and to be looked after. The Hawke Labor Government is out of ideas. It writes around to its Ministers asking for ideas to be put in the Prime Minister's suggestion box. The suggestions that we have seen so far-we have been supplied with a fair number of copies of those letters to the Prime Minister-demonstrate just how far this Government is out of ideas, out of vision, out of initiative, out of steam, out of energy, out of hope and out of time.

        The 1990s are Australia's decade of opportunity. They give us the opportunity to improve and to free up our economy by meaningful reforms in the industrial relations and wages systems. They give us the opportunity to safeguard our environment in a fashion which is genuine and committed, not in the fashion which is a cynical vote buying exercise, the only coin which is actually understood by members of the Australian Labor Party-and, by gee, they are pretty good at understanding coin in a fair number of ways. The 1990s give us the opportunity to develop our talents and our education system. They can be a decade of opportunity to really attack the issues of poverty, homelessness, drug abuse and social deprivation. They can provide an opportunity to do something about restoring our real international position-not sending our foreign Minister off on a publicly paid Christmas holiday in Europe at a very pleasant time of the year, attempting presumably to straighten out the east Europeans and then give everybody else the benefit of his advice on the way home.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in order to take advantage of that decade of opportunity which is now available to us-the opportunity of economic reform, of environment protection, of educational progress, of a real assault upon the deprivation that exists in our society, of a restoration of our international position, of a restoration of the position of families, individuals and small businesses in Australia-it will require the election of a coalition government. It is the promise of 1990 and the decades ahead that there will be a coalition government to steer the destiny and opportunities of this country through the last decade of the twentieth century on the basis of our Economic Action Plan, that real leadership will be provided and a determination to tackle the fundamental problems and to get on with the job in the interest of all of the people of Australia, and not simply our sectional mates. We look forward to taking advantage of that decade of opportunity and providing the leadership which will ensure that in the twenty-first century the Australian nation is once again a decent nation which can be proud of its position in the world, and which can be proud of the building blocks of the individuals and families so sadly and so badly neglected by the tawdry administration of this Labor Hawke-Keating Government, now in its last dying and decaying days.

        Senator Puplick really made no contribution whatsoever; he was entirely negative. The saddest thing was that he was pretending to offer hope. Pretending to offer hope when in fact he offers none is a very cruel hoax. But I do not think Senator Puplick or most of his colleagues are cruel people. I think they just do not understand the implications of the things they are saying because they do not know anything about the lives of ordinary Australians, because they have never seen one except through a very long telescope.

The problem is that Senator Puplick and the others who will be speaking on behalf of the Opposition, if the debate lasts that long, find it very hard to understand that ordinary Australian families will not be offered hope if they lose their jobs. Members of the Opposition do not understand the significance of employment because it is not an issue that operates on their horizon. It was very clear during the last time the Opposition was in government that it did not understand the importance of employment, because it created enormous levels of unemployment. We could talk about the economic consequences of it in terms of the blow-out in the deficit, the loss of tax revenue and the significant increase in expenditure, but I am not interested in talking about it in those terms today. I have done that before. It is still important but the fact is that the policies which the Opposition prescribes are heartless in the extreme and will create loss of jobs and Australian families will suffer.

        The Opposition continually fails to understand this matter. It cites figures that indicate that average weekly earnings for people in employment may not have risen as much as inflation, but household disposable income has increased because people have been in jobs. The most important transformation has been of those households that have gone from no job to one or those that have gone from one to two or to one and a half. It has made a fundamental transformation of those households. It has changed their lives significantly and substantially. We on this side of the House have dealt with large numbers of individual constituents-in my previous occupation I dealt with people who came in for assistance-who have been able to get jobs which have been created because of the successful economic policy of the Government.

       <para>
        The Opposition also does not understand the consequences for ordinary Australians of its industrial relations policy. It tries to follow the Thatcher strategy which has led to the division of Britain into two countries-the north and the south. Members of the Opposition would not understand because none of them who ever went there would travel north of London. They travel to the nice, comfortable parts, not where the real people live and where the consequences of the policies that Dr Hewson espouses, which have been put into practice by Mrs Thatcher, can be seen.

The decline in compassion by the Government of that country would be reflected here and is shown in the Opposition's attitude towards the long-term unemployed. To say that people who are unemployed for nine months should lose the benefit, even if it is no fault of theirs, if they happen to live in a town where a government's economic policy has destroyed the industry in which they have lived-55-year-old people who have been living for 35 years in places like Wollongong which the previous Government, the Fraser Government, destroyed--

         —I appreciate your support, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I did not mind the interjections. They were a very useful indication of the attitude of the Opposition and I hope they are all faithfully recorded. Its attitude to the long-term unemployed is also reflected in its view about Jobstart and Skillshare. Every Skillshare program in Australia is under threat. I know that Senator Watson tries to pretend otherwise but we all know it is true. We can read the policies. Maybe we should not believe those policies any more than the promises made in the Whips meeting this morning.

        There is also the question of up-front tertiary fees. The Opposition does not understand that that is a barrier to entry by ordinary Australians. It is true that university education has been a question of the poor subsidising the rich and we had to do something about it, but to introduce up-front tertiary fees, as proposed by the Opposition, provides a barrier to entry by ordinary Australians. Ordinary Australian families will not believe they are better off if their children cannot go on to tertiary education.

       <para>
        The Opposition does not understand the consequence of the proposed $100m cut in expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. Some parts of the proposal can be argued. I do not agree with any of what the Opposition is proposing, but I understand why it can say that it will abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission because, on the face of it, that is an administrative change. I do not agree with it, but we can say it is a legitimate difference of opinion about administrative policy. We can even say that about the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I do not agree with what the Opposition is proposing, but we can say that it is a legitimate, different view about administration. If we accept its figures, $20m would be saved, but the other $80m cut will have significant adverse consequences for Australians in greatest need. It is a credit to the Senate, to the Parliament and to the Government that we have just passed legislation that will allow assistance to be provided to Australians in greatest need in the Northern Territory through excisions that have been made possible by the recent amendments to the land rights legislation. But if we cut $100m from the funding to that Department, assistance to those people cannot possibly be forthcoming.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition also does not understand the consequences of its proposal to cut $100m from the overseas aid budget. Much could be said about that, but I just want to say one thing: it fails to understand in its phoney concern about the environment-a concern that Senator Puplick pretends to have everywhere but here in the Senate where he never speaks about it-that if one cuts the aid budget one reinforces that inevitable link between poverty and environmental degradation that is evident to every informed observer of the international scene. The desertification in Africa and the destruction of rainforests in other countries are an inevitable and inexorable outcome of poverty in those countries. The proposal to cut $100m from overseas aid-if one pretends that it is not an act of social and international cruelty-shows that the Opposition does not understand the consequences of what it is doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that the Opposition does understand the consequences of what it is doing in one area but it hopes the voters will not understand. That relates to the changes to the capital gains tax. We had an interesting debate about that recently. Senator Chaney got upset because I said that it was a reflection of the priorities of the Liberal Party and the National Party that they proposed to give back $450m to the wealthiest in our community and take it away from the poorest in our community. It remains exactly the same today. It is a statement of the Opposition's priorities, and there are many other elements of that indication of priorities that can be outlined.

        The Opposition understands the consequences of its policy with regard to wages policy. It would abolish the wages policy that has brought fair wage increases across the board in Australia and which still enables changes that facilitate improved efficiency and shop floor reform, in favour of what is called the free market system, otherwise called the pilot system of industrial relations. It would have led to an enormous blow-out in wages for the few and the powerful and no wage increases for those in the weakest positions. Plentiful opportunities for the strong and devil take the hindmost is the wages policy of the Opposition. It would lead to further division in our society, a blow-out of wages in areas where we cannot afford it--

        The Opposition is deliberately trying to mislead the Australian people about micro-economic reform. Every independent commentator says that Australia is leading the world in micro-economic reform and that the micro-economic reform program in Australia is greater than it has ever been. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade made that clear. The book from which I quoted the last time we had this debate, by Keating and Dixon, makes it clear. It was made very clear in an article yesterday in the Age by Kenneth Davidson who very effectively criticised the phoney micro-economic reform exhortations of the Opposition as those which will not lead to effective change. It is quite evident that all those informed analysts will make it clear to the voters what the Liberals know but do not wish to understand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said previously that the capital gains tax versus cuts argument that we had before said something interesting about the priorities of the Opposition. I will quote from a very interesting advertisement about the Thatcher Government that appeared in newspapers during the last British election:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Conservative manifesto does not say anything about reducing unemployment; it does not say anything about improving the health service; it does not say anything about investing in education; it does not say anything about building more houses . . .

        That could apply equally to the Economic Action Plan, and so could the conclusion. It says:

       </para>
       <para>
        That is absolutely right. The Opposition says nothing about the issues that affect the lives of Australians in greatest need. It wants to give $450m to people who are already generating significant income through capital gain and who ought to pay tax on that gain, just as everybody who generates income in any other way does. It wants to give back that money to those people and take it away from the people in greatest need.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the remaining minutes of my contribution I have to say that the saddest thing about the Opposition contribution is that it ignored all the positives. I regret to say that about Senator Puplick because it may be his last chance to speak in the Senate, which is a great pity because he makes a greater contribution than the person who ousted him from No. 1 on the ticket. The Liberal Party organisation is incapable of coping with that situation, so we have to put up with that unfortunate outcome. The opposition pretends that nothing good is happening in Australia. It is a propensity that people have when they have not been in opposition quite long enough but have been in Parliament for a long time. They need a bit more experience in opposition, and the people of Australia will give it to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has failed to mention the benefits to ordinary Australian families of Medicare. The Government is not surprised because the Opposition does not want to talk about health policy. A wonderful exposition of the failure to outline the nature of the Opposition health policy has been a recurrent feature of the last 12 months of public debate in Australia-it is always just around the corner. It is just like the recovery in the fortunes of the Bond Corporation-it is just coming around the corner, if we only wait a little longer. I think the Opposition health policy is about as viable as the Bond Corporation at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has failed to say anything about school retention rates because when it was in power the rates used to be in the low 30s and now they are rising through the 50s to the 60s, and continuing to rise. Ordinary Australian families know that their kids have a better chance of a career if they stay at school and go on to tertiary education. The Opposition has also failed to mention the family assistance supplement which builds on a useful initiative of Senator Chaney when he was Minister. I do not criticise that initiative-it only went half way, but it was a good start. I acknowledge that. It has been substantially improved by Mr Howe and is the best family assistance package that Australia has ever had. It has been indexed for the first time, as are family allowances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition failed to mention anything about jobs. It tried to pretend that the jobs that have been created were not real jobs. Senator Puplick probably does not know, because he is an economic illiterate, but most members on the Liberal Party front bench would know, because at least they have probably read something about economics, that 90 per cent of the jobs created during the term of the Hawke Government have been in the private sector, whereas in the Fraser period it was 45 per cent-twice the percentage. We want none of that phoney rubbish about real jobs. This Government has created more jobs at a higher rate then any other member country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and they have been real jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition failed to mention the home and community care scheme that is saying to old people, `You don't have to go into institutionalised care. That which we've all known you've always wanted is now possible: you can receive quality assistance in your own home.' That is in the interests of society because it is cheaper, it is what the people want and it lends them dignity. The Opposition failed to say anything about retirement incomes at all. We used to hear a lot about the concern the Opposition had for old people when it thought it had a vote winner on the assets test. The Opposition now wants to keep the assets test because it is fair, just and directs the income to the people in need. It has given up the decision to get rid of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have heard nothing more about the aged because, for the first time ever, the pension is 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and we have had a doubling of the superannuation coverage. We have had one of the great equity distributions in Australian history. In the past only the very wealthy and people in government employment had superannuation. It has now been fundamentally transformed. Australian families know that their welfare is substantially enhanced because the breadwinner or breadwinners in that family have one or two superannuation schemes. This means that in retirement their income will be substantially enhanced and they will have that dignity to which they are entitled. The Opposition also failed to mention the question of the implications to ordinary Australian families of the proposed changes in the taxation scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not pretend that there has been no pain to ordinary Australian people with higher interest rates. The Australian people demand that that pain should be for some reason, that there should be an outcome in terms of improved economic performance and restructuring of the Australian economy. The statistics increasingly show, as Mr Elliott and the Australian Chamber of Commerce have correctly said, that the preconditions for economic growth, a sustained fall in interest rates, and a reformed economy into the 1990s have been established.

         —The honourable senator says that he thinks he knows the scene I mean. The film to which I wish to refer after five weeks in this place is not When Harry meets Sally but rather the film called, Sex, Lies and Videotape. There is very little of the first in this place, and Senator Collins managed to get a bit of the last, but probably the middle bit is overwhelming after five weeks in this place. The debate this afternoon is probably as good as any to illustrate that particular exercise. I think politicians are very happy to wander around and blame the community for its cynicism in politics, when most of it is engendered by politicians themselves. What they do is what has been done here this afternoon; that is, they claim-this is in an election context-that if elected to office the sun will shine brighter, everybody will be happy, all our problems will disappear and we will all live happily ever after. Nobody in the real world believes that and everybody in this place knows that that cannot happen. However, in the true spirit of the film Sex, Lies and Videotape, we are quite happy to pursue that particular course, but we should not then blame the public for being cynical about politicians.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The theme of the debate this afternoon is that the Government does not care at all about families. If anybody in the Opposition was asked outside this chamber whether he believed that, he would say no. Nobody in his right mind would believe that any elected government would not care about families. The Government says that the Opposition does not care about families. If any Government member were asked that question outside this chamber he would say no, he did not believe that either. Those lies are able to pass as truth in this chamber. That is part of the passing facade, as it were, of politics in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts of the matter are that any government of any political persuasion in this country attempts to introduce policies that it believes will benefit families. Whether it does or not is then a matter of fact. Whether another set of policies would actually improve the matter is theoretical and will always remain so, because at any one time only one set of policies can be applied to the economy and, hence, we know what happens. We suggest that with other policies in place things will get better or deteriorate. After five weeks here why do we insist-I would like to characterise it as lies, but I suppose we are not allowed to-on making gross overstatements of what is going on?
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Labor Administration many families have had it very hard. The Government has broken many of the promises it has made to the electorate time and again, election after election. Quite frankly, that is no different from what the Fraser Government did, and it will be absolutely no different from what a Peacock Government would do if it were elected to office at the next election. In office the Government will suggest that in the light of current events some of those policies are no longer applicable and something else will have to happen. Those are the circumstances with which we are faced.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was given hope by the fact that in my home State of Queensland at the last election the Liberal Party and the National Party ran a mud-slinging campaign, a sloganeering campaign, and a campaign of lies. It was an old-style campaign. For once, the Labor Party ran a campaign-I say for once as this is the first time I have ever seen it run such a campaign-which actually stuck to policies and discussed nothing other than policies. In fact, the present Premier of Queensland insisted that every one of his candidates should not even respond to the mud that was being thrown. As I travelled around the electorate during that election period I heard more and more people saying, `At last somebody is actually talking about what we want to hear. We are sick to death of the mud-slinging in this political operation', and they voted accordingly. This has not been commented on in the press but I believe that it is an indication of what went on during that Queensland election.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was very proud of the people of Queensland. For the first time they said very clearly and very definitely to politicians, `Stop making the types of promises you know you cannot keep. Stop suggesting that the world will look better and the sun will shine when you get into government, because it will not. Let us hear the truth. We are quite able to take the truth. We want to know what it is and we want to know whether your policies will make it marginally better'. If any people in politics actually suggest that they will ever do anything more, in terms of one set of policies rather than another, they are lying. On most occasions, any government in office has only one decision to make; it does not have a choice. It would like to have a choice. I am quite sure that, when Senator Chaney was in government, he would have loved on many occasions to have had a choice rather than do what he was compelled to do. But in government those choices are not there. I am not talking about legislation, as this chamber always has a couple of choices on legislation. I am talking about the day-to-day administration where there are not too many choices.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, if one looks at what the Government has done to date, one sees a whole host of areas where major improvements could have been made which would have significantly benefited ordinary families. Probably one of those areas which would have had the most beneficial effect would have been for the Government to avoid deregulating the banks. There is absolutely no reason why we could not have run, as we have done in the past, separate housing interest rates and commercial interest rates if that is what we wanted. There are benefits and there are disadvantages in running two rates. If we had wanted to do that and if those benefits and those disadvantages had been explained to the community, we could have made a choice. We did not have that choice and families have suffered significantly since then.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to the Opposition's policies, it is interesting that it wants to look essentially at families. I certainly applaud that. That is a nice change. The fundamental structure of our society should be given far more support than has been given by the policies of all administrations. When I look through a whole range of policies I have to ask: What will happen to the families of Aboriginals if we take away $100m? What will happen to the families of unemployed people after nine months if we take away $1,500m? On that latter point I wish to quote from an article by Greg Sheridan. I think most people would agree that he has never been classified as being any further to the left than Ghengis Khan. In this article he says:
       </para>
       <para>
        After nine months your dole will be stopped unless you qualify for a special benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        To qualify for the special benefit you will be interviewed by welfare bureaucrats.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet to qualify for the dole now you need regular interviews with bureaucrats.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where is the change?
       </para>
       <para>
        Many of the long-term unemployed are in bad shape.
       </para>
       <para>
        If these interviews are to involve intensive counselling, much less any rehabilitation or retraining, they will involve still more bureaucrats, an increase in the welfare state, and will save no money.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the policy does not involve such extensive counselling I would say it would survive about three or four weeks of implementation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is a fair summary. I think that is precisely what would happen, because the policy is unworkable unless we change a lot of other expectations within our society. That can be done. There are plenty of models of societies that we could emulate; the United States is one. We could be quite happy to have beggars on our streets. We could expend vast sums of money turning our houses into fortresses and even larger sums of money on building prisons-the growth industry in the United States. We could do all those things. They are choices that are open to us as a society. Quite frankly, my view is that most people believe that the type of society we have is the one which they prefer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unemployment must always be acknowledged as a cost to the community. We cannot choose that it not be a cost-it will always be a cost-but we can choose how we deal with that cost. We can pay for it by having an increased prison population, an increase in crime and a lack of security or we can pay for it by giving people a small amount of money to be able to feed themselves, clothe themselves and house themselves. I suggest that the latter option benefits not only those people but also us. A society which cares for people in need is a much more attractive society for everybody. We might not have as high a standard of living, but we would certainly have a better quality of life.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the interesting facts about many religions is that they often managed to get right-even if they did not manage to get a lot of other things right-that it is preferable to help others in need, not to dump on them when they are in need. Translating that into an Australianism, one does not kick somebody when he is down. That is illustrative of who we are as a society. I worry that the promotion of so many policies which depend on greed as their motivation will undermine who we are as a community and will change us into a mini-United States, a mini-Britain, or a mini something else. We will not be an Australian society.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wonder about the families of recently arrived migrants and the proposed cuts in that area. I wonder about the families of students and the cuts that are being proposed that will affect them. I wonder about the families of the sick and the disabled because of the projected cuts in those areas. They are all families more in need than others, yet the proposal is that those cuts will somehow or other benefit others. How will that be translated? How will the money move across? It will move across in a number of interesting ways but, most definitely, if we look at the policies which have been identified in a National Party document, those families which benefit will exclusively be in the upper income bracket. I do not think that gives us a better society. So let us lower the expectations of what politicians can do. Let us be a little more truthful. But I think we should also say that, at the end of the day, a society which is caring is a far better society in which to live than a society based on greed and avarice.

        We brought this forward because we think that there is a great deal of concern in the community about the pressures that people are under. We believe that most Australians think it appropriate that the Senate spend some little time considering the issues of the pressures on Australian families.

        I was quite taken by a couple of Senator Macklin's comments. Senator McMullan's speech-he was the first Labor senator to speak-struck me as typical of Labor's contribution to these debates during this session. Senator McMullan did not once acknowledge that there are Australian families in difficulty. At no point in his speech did he advert to the real pressures on Australian families and to the fact that there is massive disaffection in Labor's heartland. I agree with Senator Macklin that there is a lot of disaffection with politicians generally. I do not deny that. But I would have thought that an honourable senator with the experience of Senator McMullan, who has great experience in the Labor Party organisation and in campaigning, would be familiar with the fact that it is in Labor's own heartland that there is the most disaffection. That disaffection relates to the genuine hardship which many people are suffering under the Labor Government. It is not hard to explain that hardship.

        Often enough in debate in this place I have quoted the fact that whilst it is true that there has been an expansion in the number of jobs under the accord, average earnings have declined and award wages have declined in real terms. When one combines the wage situation, the tax situation and the interest rate situation it is not surprising that a substantial number of Australian families are desperate. Senator Macklin said that we all exaggerate. He was trying to avoid the Standing Orders provision which precludes one saying that another honourable senator has lied. Let me put what I want to put in this debate in the flattest--

         —Senator McMullan is an experienced enough honourable senator to know that that was a specious point of order. The simple fact is that there is a close relationship between the plight of Australian families and the problems of poverty which are causing such concern to the welfare agencies.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The welfare authorities have been reporting to the people of Australia that we have problems in Australia of the new poor. After nearly seven years of the Labor Government the Reverend John Livingstone, of the Anglican Church's welfare division, was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 December as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . there are many more families in need of welfare that the charities will never see.
       </para>
       <para>
        ``A lot of them find it hard to approach welfare agencies,'' he said. ``There is a lot of pride involved.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding that, Mr Livingstone goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . about half Careforce's Christmas clients this year have never received welfare before.

        ``Even people on what used to be reasonable wages are having to choose between paying their gas or their electricity bill this Christmas.''
       </para>
       <para>
        That is part of the reality of Australia. Some attention from Senator McMullan to what the Government thinks is the cause of that hardship and what could be done about it might have been welcomed by his constituency. The Opposition is saying that the explanation for what is going on is clear. It relates to the fundamental economic matters which were raised by Senator McMullan in the debate. It relates to our economic failure to be a sufficiently competitive country, to be a sufficiently productive country. In a recent study the Sydney City Mission, another welfare agency, estimated that up to 30,000 Australian children, including 9,000 aged from 12 to 15, remain homeless and that the number of children in poverty is double that of 10 years ago. As I said before, that is a simple function of declining real wages under Labor, hugely expanded interest rates and, of course, a tax burden which is still very heavy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think Senator Puplick in his contribution talked about some comparative interest rates. Let me do the same. The interest rate on Commonwealth Bankcard in 1984 was 18 per cent; it is now 23 per cent. It is to be 24.6 per cent next year. Interest on Mastercard from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia has risen from 18 per cent to 23 per cent. Housing mortgages have risen from 12.5 per cent to 17 per cent and small overdrafts from 14 per cent up to 22.75 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy President, I am sure you have a lot of contact in your electorate of Queensland. I am sure that you would be familiar with the reality that there are very many Australian families in very real financial difficulty, notwithstanding the expansion of employment, notwithstanding the statistics about household disposable income, which is what Senator Button chooses to talk about. But when one looks at what the University of New South Wales has analysed and found within the last few weeks, one finds that there is no escaping the simple reality that families with children have been hardest hit during the period of the Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The study by the University of New South Wales estimates that on average the increases in house prices and interest rates have led to families with post-1986 mortgages-that is 70 per cent of those with mortgages-paying out an additional $48 per week in repayments. Mr Acting Deputy President, a succession of statistics of that sort can be produced to explain the reality which, if you have ever been in your electorate, you would have personally experienced as I have personally experienced. I refer to the fact that many families are finding themselves the new poor, and many families which find themselves directed to the attention of welfare agencies, who, in the past, would have been proud to proclaim their permanent independence. The relationship between the caring for the independent middle-income earners of Australia and the relief of poverty is very clear. It has become far clearer under Labor because of the toppling of many of those middle-income people into poverty and into having to beg.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is in that context that what the Opposition is saying becomes significant. Senator Macklin suggested that any politician who comes in and promises that we can completely revolutionise things is lying. In a broad sense I would accept that. There is no way of suddenly clicking one's fingers, passing a law and suddenly solving all of the nation's problems. Let me remind the Senate that what the Opposition has done-and I do not believe that any Opposition in history has ever done this-is identify not merely the winners under its programs but also its losers. It identified the truth and accepted the truth that if one is to provide instantly additional benefits to large sectors of society, then there has to be a transfer from one area to another. The Opposition makes no secret of that. It has set out in the Economic Action Plan the fact that it is prepared to reduce government expenditure by $2.7 billion because it wishes to deliver $2 billion of that as tax relief to the families which have borne the brunt of Labor's economic mismanagement and something under half a billion dollars in the reduction of capital gains tax and its substitution with a speculative gains tax, which, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating)--Senator Cook-You're giving it to the rich.

        <para in-line="1">
         —I pick up the half-interjection from Senator Cook, who has come into the chamber. In fact, in recent weeks his own Treasurer has admitted that the repeal of the capital gains tax and its substitution with a speculative gains tax will benefit the small business and the farming community, which accounts for 700,000 people in Australia. Let me add to that: there are 4 million people in superannuation funds and a million Australians who own shares who will benefit by the repeal of the tax. It is absolutely absurd to suggest that this is a benefit for the rich.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let me turn to the main body of relief which is being offered. Under Labor-and the Institute of Family Studies bears this out, as the other welfare reports bear it out and as the University of New South Wales bears it out-the burden has unfairly been focused on families with children. For that reason we are offering direct, immediate tax relief for middle income Australians to the tune of $2 billion. That tax relief comes in the form of tax rebates for all children; an entirely novel-for Australia-tax rebate for people with child-care expenses, that is, the vast majority of families which now require two incomes to survive and, therefore, incur child-care expenses in the process; and additional liberalisation of the dependent spouse rebate. That amounts to $2 billion directly into the pockets of Australians with children.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the priority? The point made by Senator McMullan is that we are demonstrating our priorities. The truth is that to get that $2 billion we have to reduce the generosity and scope of some other government programs, and we make no apology for being honest about that. We can save close to over $1 billion on social security in ways which are not harsh and which are socially positive. The bulk of that money comes from reducing the unemployment benefit from one which can be taken by Australians on a permanent basis without limitation of time to one which is in line with other countries which provide unemployment insurance or benefit on a time limited basis. I think there is widespread public acceptance that it is socially and economically sensible to make that change.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator McMullan raised the question of Aboriginal affairs. I simply say to Senator McMullan that, whether or not he believes it, I believe there would be very few people who have direct experience of Aboriginal advancement programs who would not admit that there has been considerable waste and maladministration. A reduction of about 10 per cent is proposed in this area, which equals the increase in expenditure this year. The Opposition believes that that can be done in a way which will still enable the effective delivery of services to the Aboriginals for whom Senator McMullan expressed concern-and I express my own concern for them. We believe that this is an area in which there could be greater efficacy and efficiency of administration. We have reduced payments to the States and make no apology for that because the States have enormous capacities to reduce their costs in ways such as contracting out.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this debate we have identified two simple propositions. The first is that the group in Australia which has been most put upon by this Government-that is, the group which is most disadvantaged-is families with children. That is not a politician's statement. The work which has been done by the University of New South Wales following that done by the Institute of Family Studies shows that that is clearly so. If Government senators do not have enough contact with their electorates to know that it is true they are not doing their jobs. The second simple proposition that we put forward is that it is a matter of social justice to give relief to those people. That relief must cost and we have identified where the cost will come from.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the minute that remains for me to contribute to this debate, I will focus on what Senator McMullan referred to as the major economic underlying matters. The truth of the matter is that we can increase the welfare of the Australian people only if we make Australia a more productive country. Again, the Economic Action Plan sets out in detail proposals which will make Australia a more productive society. Whether it is in accelerating the rate of labour market reform; whether it is in accelerating the rate of reform of the waterfront and coastal shipping; whether it is in contracting out government services to get efficiency for the taxpayers' dollar and a better deal for consumers, there is no shortage of detail in the Opposition's proposals for that more productive character to be put into Australia. The national Parliament should focus on the fact that this country needs to be both fairer and more productive, and the Opposition has a detailed program to ensure that it is both. I welcome the brief opportunity this afternoon to address some of those issues. I hope that we will hear from the remaining Labour speaker in this debate an admission of the causes of the disaffection with his party which is so obvious-including in the State of New South Wales-and which was so accurately summed up by the Labor Council of New South Wales which said that this Government certainly has not brought home the bacon.

        I feel that I should begin this contribution by congratulating Senator Puplick for proposing this matter of public importance. It seemed to be some form of a self-valedictory; probably Senator Puplick believes that his speech on this matter of public importance may well be his last contribution in the Senate as an influential Liberal frontbencher. He knows there is every chance that in the forthcoming election he will lose his seat as he is number three on the coalition Senate ticket in New South Wales, and he knows there is every chance that an election will be called before the Senate sits again on 20 February. I can understand why Senator Puplick is so worried about his impending defeat-crashing to defeat along with Mr Peacock and the rest of the Liberals-so I forgive him for this last-ditch stand on the final day of sitting of the Senate for this year. Other Government senators should also forgive Senator Puplick because--

         —Thank you. After all, most of us at this time of year are imbued with the Christmas spirit. We have been sitting for five weeks and it is understandable if, after five weeks, Senator Puplick's judgment has been a little affected by the fact that he has been away from home for so long.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am surprised that he and the Opposition want any examination of the so-called Economic Action Plan of the Liberal Party of Australia. We have heard a little about what is supposed to be the impact on families of the Economic Action Plan and Government policies. I had not intended to talk about that at great length but, as Senator Chaney has challenged me to do so, it is only appropriate that I oblige. We should recognise that the Economic Action Plan has a very simple economic prescription: take as much as possible from the needy groups in the community to provide what is, in effect, a substantial tax cut to the wealthy through the abolition of the capital gains tax. The Economic Action Plan purports to strengthen the family in Australia-it claims that the family is the cornerstone of the plan-and that is the big lie of Australian politics, because the Liberal Party's definition of family is unbelievably narrow.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am happy to associate myself with the remarks that Senator Macklin made about the definition of the family, because the Liberal Party defines the family by political expediency alone. The Liberal Party's definition of the family arises from political research in marginal seats; the only families that it cares about are those that reside in marginal seats. There is not a skerrick of concern in the Liberal Party for disadvantaged families-for Aboriginal families, sole parents, families on low incomes, the unemployed or ethnic and aged Australians. The Opposition defines families as those groups whose votes it needs to win the election.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Economic Action Plan is nothing more than a cynical vote-buying exercise as some sort of answer to the Opposition's own problems. The Economic Action Plan is not designed to deal with the fundamental challenges of modern Australia and the crucial direction of government economic policy. The Liberals have fallen into the trap of mindless negativism, an example of which was Senator Puplick's speech-simplistic criticism of the Government. The Economic Action Plan is nothing more than a blatant and straightforward attempt to bribe the Australian electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Opposition cannot get its propaganda right. Take interest rates, for example. The Liberals' so-called best chance to fluke an election win is on the issue of interest rates. They have been effectively bombed, sabotaged, on that by their own Federal Party President, John Elliott. He has blown interest rates right out of the water as an election issue. I was very pleased to pick up the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday of this week and read an article entitled `Libs upset as Elliott speaks out of turn again'. The article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal president of the Liberal Party, Mr John Elliott, angered his federal parliamentary colleagues yet again yesterday, this time by predicting interest rates would fall by as much as 5 per cent next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Elliott also said he would like to see the Australian dollar fall to as low as 68 US cents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently there have been many conflicting statements on interest rates by Liberal-National Party spokesmen. I will mention a few examples. On 27 November Mr Peacock said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We've said it'll take us through the first term of government to lower interest rates. I mean, I'd love to say to people we can get them down in the first week or two we come in, but you can't.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the same day Senator Stone said:
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has put us in a situation where undoubtedly interest rates will stay high for some time.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 7 December John Howard, the deposed Liberal Leader, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I don't think that anyone in the Opposition is running around saying that we can ever go back to the halcyon days of very low interest rates until we get on top of our trade and debt problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Peacock, this time on 14 December, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        When the market sees that we are putting [our] policies in place, inflation and interest rates will come down . . . Over the three-year period there will be massive reductions.
       </para>
       <para>
        And then on Tuesday of this week, when he was asked when interest rates will fall, John Elliott said:
       </para>
       <para>
        About five weeks before an election  . . . They'll probably come down 1, 2, 3-in my view they could come down as much as 4 or 5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there is very little consistency in what the Liberal Party is saying. In the Christmas spirit I would like to ask Senator Puplick and Senator Chaney to table their Christmas message to John Elliott. I would imagine it would be something like `We want your money for the election campaign, but we certainly don't want your opinions'.
       </para>
       <para>
        But in this debate, given that it is Christmas and we are about to wind up and have a holiday period, I think we ought to place on record what a disastrous and pathetic year the Federal Opposition has had. What about the contemptible tactics that the Liberal Party used to get rid of John Howard-the Howard sacking? Of course, John Howard was a very unpopular leader-though not as unpopular as Mr Peacock-but he was a decent enough and intelligent man. What about the machiavellian and slimy tactics of the Liberal Party? Senator Puplick was one of the gang of Four Corners that was responsible for the demise of John Howard. Senator Chaney was in it up to his neck as were Mr Wilson Tuckey and Mr John Moore. We all know what they were on about. What has been the ultimate result for the Liberal Party of that change of leadership? The result has been that it has elected as leader the most unpopular political leader of a major Australian political party in our history. That has been its achievement this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already mentioned the daily contradictions between Senator Stone, Mr Elliott and Mr Peacock in their remarks on interest rates. What about their failure in elections held this year? We receive a wry smile from Senator Chaney whose Party lost the Western Australian election. It was a failure. This year his Party lost the Tasmanian election-another failure. This year his Party lost the South Australian election-another failure. In Queensland his Party came third. The National Party lost the Queensland election. I say to Senator Chaney that there is only one thing better than the Liberal Party coming second in an election, and that is when it comes third as it did in Queensland. The Liberal Party has failed miserably in all its electoral tests in 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about Andrew Peacock's complete lack of understanding of his own Party's industrial and wages policies? What about his complete lack of capacity and courage to face the Australian press? He will not even have a news conference. Finally, of course, as the good news to end the year for the Liberal Party, a news poll shows that it is even further behind at the end of 1989 than it was at the beginning of the year. It has not had much of a year. It is hardly surprising that it comes in and wastes the last few hours of this sitting of the Senate to whinge about its own performance and Australian politics over the previous 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we look at the Liberal Party's disastrous year we should not forget environment policy. Senator Puplick, the proposer of this matter of public importance, has, I believe, the worst job of any politician in the Western world. That job is, of course, to be the Liberal and National Party spokesperson on the environment. He is the person who has to sell the Opposition's neanderthal environment policies to the Australian people. The Australian people form a sophisticated and very aware electorate. Senator Puplick is the person who has to justify why the Liberals would have dammed the Franklin River. He is the person who has to justify its policy of logging rainforests, mining in Kakadu, protecting only some national parks in Australia from mining, and so on. Because it is Christmas, I am sensitive to Senator Puplick's difficult task. In the Australian newspaper, when he spoke about the monumental difficulties he faced in convincing the Opposition that it needed a better environment policy, he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I accept that it's my neck that's on the line if the whole thing falls in a heap. If I can't convince my colleagues to go in a particular direction or to embrace some different policies, that would be a mark of substantial personal failure as a politician. I don't think I'd be of much use to the Liberal Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite so. Frankly, I think that Senator Puplick has failed to convince his own colleagues and his own Party, and he should seriously consider resigning his position as shadow Minister for the environment. A proposal of a matter of public importance about broken promises is the greatest hypocrisy imaginable from Senator Puplick, a New South Wales Liberal senator. Nick Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales, has broken 150 promises since he came into Government, which is an absolutely outrageous sell-out of the New South Wales electorate. A statement by George Bernard Shaw sums it up. He said that we are all liars to people we do not care for. This is certainly the Liberal Party's attitude, Mr Greiner's attitude, to broken promises.

        It is customary to say a few words at the end of a session. I just want to make a few points. This year the Senate has sat later or closer to Christmas than it has ever sat in its history. We sat for 25 weeks, which is the greatest number of weeks that the Senate has sat in recent years, and almost half as long again as the House of Representatives this year. In 1989 we sat for 500 hours, of which approximately 170 hours were devoted to debating Government legislation, and we considered 200 Bills. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation took 40 hours for consideration; my colleague Senator Tate, and probably Senator Peter Baume largely on the other side, should be congratulated for their patience and receive commiserations in respect of the handling of that Bill. We will be utilising new procedures next year to facilitate the consideration of legislation. I hope all senators will give these procedures every chance to succeed. Anything which improves the effectiveness of the chamber is worthy of support.

        I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your success in continuing to manage smoothly the operations and proceedings of the Senate this year, and I would like to thank the Deputy President and the temporary chairmen of committees for their control, humour and tact, all of which qualities you, Mr President, displayed as well, in the face of sometimes quite unruly debate. I also thank the Whips and Deputy Whips of all parties without whose behind-the-scenes negotiations-and, in Senator McKiernan's case, sometimes in-front-of-the-scenes negotiations-this chamber probably would be quite unworkable. I also thank you, Mr Clerk, and the other Clerks and officials of the Senate for the long hours you devote to the smooth functioning of the Senate. It is nice to see Senator Haines taking a vigorous interest in the proceedings of the chamber, perhaps, as she said this morning, for the last time. I would like to thank all other officers of the Parliament, including Hansard staff, the staff of the Parliamentary Library and the Joint House Department, who have maintained their usual high standards of service to senators and members of the House of Representatives. I would personally like to thank the Manager of Government Business, Senator Robert Ray, for the smooth way in which he has run the business of the Senate. Sometimes he has been fired up a little, particularly by minor parties--

I also thank you, Mr President. The task of the President is not an easy one. We have asked you to be the President of all the Senate, and I think you have done a great deal of work towards that end. I particularly congratulate you on your efforts with respect to the Senate budget, which I think is of long term significance to this place, and I thank you for your efforts in that. I thank the Clerks who, I think, without fear or favour give us their advice, and I acknowledge it and its high quality.

        I thank everybody from Hansard through to the Library, the catering staff, the attendants-the chamber attendants in particular, who come rushing about in their endlessly courteous way-the security people who keep us safe, not in our beds but in our offices, and the car drivers who drive most honourable senators around. I would like to make mention of the gardeners who are starting to add their touches to this building in a way which is proving to be very attractive. We will have not been able to get a goatherd to look after the goats that Senator Button would like to have wandering about on his garden, but I am sure he will find the offices of the Opposition a perfectly satisfactory place, although it is a rather stony courtyard on which to graze sheep or goats.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the Senate itself is concerned, I just acknowledge the work which has been done by a number of people, including Senator Robert Ray and, on our side, Senator Hamer, concerning Senate procedures. As regards the long term operation of this Parliament, the work that has been done this year has been most significant, and I express the hope that the procedures which we have put in place for next year will prove as successful as I believe they could be. I do not think there is any doubt that but for the indefatigable efforts of Senator Hamer on our side we would not have seen the formation of a corporate view on a matter which involved essentially a free vote, and I very sincerely thank him for devoting so much time and attention to consulting so closely with all of his colleagues. I think that Senator Robert Ray's similar interest in seeing some progress has meant that we have actually got the potential for another substantial leap in the Senate's activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite a long time since the Senate made a quantum lift in the way it operated. The period of the early 1970s was a very constructive and imaginative time. Again, there were notable contributions from both sides of politics, with the late Senator Murphy on the Labor side and a series of people on our side who were party to the standing committee and Estimates committee procedures being established. I personally express the hope that the procedures that we have put in place for the more careful consideration of legislation will prove to be very valuable for good government in Australia and for reducing transgressions on individual liberty. The only point that I make-and I raise it for long term consideration, because I think it is foolish to pretend that we can function as a completely objective house of review in what is a party political chamber-is whether we might adopt in government a rather more sensible view towards changes to legislation than we have in the past. Governments of all political persuasions have regarded the letter of the legislation that they bring into the Parliament as something that should not be interfered with by Parliament.

        Another thing mentioned by Senator Button was the long periods of sittings, and again I express the view it is inevitable that, if the Senate is to live up to the changes that it is testing next year, longer sittings for the Senate will occur. Compared to the sittings of parliaments in other countries, our length of sitting is not great. If senators continue to wish to add functions then I would simply suggest that the Senate will continue to add to the period of sitting under which it operates.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to express my great personal gratitude to Senator Peter Baume. I formally represent the Opposition in Aboriginal affairs in this chamber. I was aware of the enormous task of dealing with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation. Having a previous Minister with the ongoing interest in Aboriginal affairs that Senator Baume has was, I think, a splendid thing not just for the Opposition but for the Aboriginal community. The Government accepted over 100 amendments after 40 hours of debate. I believe that whilst we opposed the ATSIC legislation it certainly left this chamber in a much better form than it entered the chamber. I simply thank Senator Peter Baume and the whole group of senators-I will not name them all because the last time I did I left one or two out-who gave a lot of attention to that matter. They gave Senator Baume their support and demonstrated an enormous interest in that area of policy over the last 12 months.

        Everybody is sick to death of being here. I think they are all desperate for Christmas and I wish everybody a very happy and restful Christmas. For 1990, I wish us success and I hope that Senator Button will enjoy his fresh period in Opposition rather more than I have enjoyed the one I am just concluding.

I am sure those three or four listeners around Australia who are trying to put the baby to sleep or drown out the noise of the tractor find that most useful.

When we arrived here in 1981 holding the balance of power in the Senate for the first time, and frightening the living daylights out of the rest of the political parties represented here, we got an enormous amount of help and advice from people such as Harry Evans who, on more than one occasion, helped us to foil the odd bit of skulduggery that was going on.

        Obviously, I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly my deputy leader, Michael Macklin, and the Whip, Paul McLean. I think it is not known-or perhaps if it is known it is not appreciated-just what sort of load my Democrat colleagues carry. We make a habit of dealing with every piece of legislation. When there are only seven of us, or in the past when there were only five or six, that is not an insignificant load.

        The journalists who periodically and in very small numbers cover the Senate from the press gallery also deserve our thanks, inasmuch as they are ever able to follow anything that ever happens in this place. A journalist described the Senate to me a week or so ago as the `B-grade chamber'. I suspect sometimes it turns into a horror movie but more often than not it does a far better job than most journalists and most members of the public are aware. The contribution on the part of all senators to the democratic process is a considerable achievement. Senator Chaney said that one has to take into account party politics. Certainly one does. One has to discount a certain amount of rhetoric and vicious comment from time to time. Nonetheless, the Senate does operate to put a brake on any sort of dictatorship that could occur if both Houses were held by the same political party-it would simply be a two-House version of Queensland and I do not think anybody ever wants to see that happen. I wish everybody here a joyous Christmas and a very happy New Year. Should an election befall us before we meet again, could I say that I hope everybody gets what they deserve.

I take this opportunity of wishing every good wish to everyone for Christmas and the New Year. I noted that Senator Button said that the Manager of Government Business had been fired up by minor parties. Apparently he said that did not refer to the Australian Democrats. I do not know to whom it did refer; I do not think that I have given him much trouble. If I wanted to I suppose I could. As to the new procedures, all I can say is that time will tell. Nobody can tell just at the moment but only time will tell whether they will save time or add to the time of the Senate.

       (c) (i) The National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC) food standards which form the basis for State and Territory food regulations do not allow for the use of such drugs. Consequently, their presence in fish for human consumption could be regarded as adulteration, with the drug residues being seen as non-permitted additives; (ii) The presence of such drugs has not been approved by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service under the provisions of the Export Control (Fish) Orders.

      </para>
      <para>
       Health Department, Victoria: These drugs have not been approved for use within the fish industry by the Health Department, Victoria. Victoria has adopted the Commonwealth Food Standards Code 1987, and would require an appropriate amendment of the Code to permit such practice.

      <para>
       Department of Health Services, Tasmania: None of the drugs are registered, but a veterinary officer could use one on his/her own initiative. Benzocaine is used in trout hatcheries prior to stripping brood stock or taking blood samples at least 12 months before the fish is consumed. It is not used for transport.
      </para>
      <para>
       Queensland Department of Health: The standards included in the NH&amp;MRC Food Standards Code 1987 are law in Queensland and any residues not provided for in that Code would be illegal if the product is offered for sale.

      <para>
       South Australian Health Commission: South Australia has adopted the NH&amp;MRC Food Standards Code. Food for human consumption may only contain residues from substances used in food production up to the limit set by Standard A 14 for Maximum Residue Limits (MRL). Where no MRL has been set for a substance its presence is not permitted.

       The Department of Community Services and Health (DCSH) administers a number of programs which fund a variety of community and other organisations providing services relevant to the objectives of the program. In four of these programs, local government authorities are among the organisations funded. The four programs involved are-Disability Programs; Aged and Community Care; Child Care, and Housing Services. DCSH also provides funding to States under the Home and Community Care (HACC) Program, some of which is subsequently paid to local government authorities as service providers under HACC.

       (1) Army does not employ ambulance crew in the way that the civilian ambulance services operate. Drivers are members of the Royal Australian Army Corps of Transport and they are not qualified as medical assistants. Medical assistants are allocated to the vehicle for patient handling. There are no intensive care units. In the field, various levels of ambulance support are provided in the casualty collection and evacuation chain. This includes the use of Army battlefield helicopters and RAAF aeromedical evacuation aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Army medical assistant employment category is an Other Rank position. Although an applicant with civilian ambulance officer qualifications may well meet the trade requirement for the Army's medical assistant, there is no requirement for such qualifications for direct entry as an Officer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The determination for appointment of registered nurses as Direct Entry Officers in the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps (RAANC) is Australian Military Regulation 72 (2) (f) which is amplified in the Manual of Personnel Administration, Volume 1, Chapter 51, Annex G, paragraph 15.

      <para>
       By way of preamble, I point out that in March 1987 the public health committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) recommended that `studies of human exposure arising from such uses'-termite control by organochlorine pesticides giving rise to air concentrations inside homes-`should be undertaken for further assessment'. Has the Department of Community Services and Health appointed officers to collect and collate information becoming available on this matter? If so, when will monitoring and collating of information be completed? Does the Government intend to set exposure standards for organochlorine pesticides for air inside homes? Is the NHMRC requiring further studies from registrants of chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin and dieldrin? Specifically, is it requiring inhalation toxicity data? Finally, is there any interim report and, if so, will the Minister make it available?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       At its 104th Session in November 1987, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) issued a statement on chlorinated organic pesticides, the relevant portion of which is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``The Council recommended that the use of these pesticides in the indoor living areas of domestic dwellings and habitable buildings, outdoor living areas (such as children's play areas, verandahs or patios), and in home gardens where food is produced, should be prohibited by State and Territory registration authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Council also recommended that the continued use of these pesticides in the subfloor space and other uses in and around habitable buildings be restricted to application by licensed pest control operators in accordance with State/Territory legislation. Studies of human exposure arising from such uses should be undertaken for further assessment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Council recognised that misuse of these materials by pest control personnel could present a potential hazard to themselves and to occupiers of treated dwellings, and further recommended that a code of practice be developed and an appropriate training program be implemented uniformly by the States and Territories.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Council directed that these recommendations be drawn to the attention of State and Territory departments of health and agriculture.''
      </para>
      <para>
       The NHMRC reference did recommend that studies of human exposure (not solely air concentrations) arising from permitted controlled use of these chemicals as termiticides be carried out.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Community Services and Health has not appointed officers to collect and collate information on this matter. When information becomes available, it will be collated for evaluation by the NHMRC in the usual manner.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matter of possible exposure standards is for the NHMRC to consider in the light of the outcome of the studies now in progress and of any other relevant information.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some further studies have been requested from the registrants. Additional inhalational toxicity data are not being required.
      </para>
      <para>
       An interim report on one study has been provided to the Council. As the interim report was provided on a confidential basis, I am unable to make it available to the honourable senator.

       (1) Is the Minister aware of a recent ruling by the Australian Taxation Office in Queensland and indeed in other States, where income earned by the funds of pre-paid funeral businesses will be taxed at 49 cents in the dollar, plus Medicare benefit levy, plus provisional tax with the 12 per cent inflationary factor, thereby making the funds inadequate to meet the costs of the funeral.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Will Section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 be amended to specifically include a funeral benefit business registered under Part III and Part IV of the Funeral Benefit Business Act 1982 (Queensland) and other similar acts in other States to obtain exemption for such funds.

        —The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that there has not been any recent change in the taxation treatment of funeral benefit businesses. The income derived from a funeral benefit investment is generally taxable. The exception to this is the funeral benefit business of registered friendly societies, non-profit medical benefit funds, trade union and employer associations and religious institutions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner has further advised that it is not correct to assume that recent advice provided to one funeral benefit business in Queensland as to the taxation status of its investment income implies that all funeral benefit businesses are treated in the same way.
      </para>
      <para>
       To a large extent the conditions in the funeral benefit contract as agreed between the parties determine the taxation consequences. One possible outcome may be that each funeral benefit business client is taxable on his or her share of fund income. Another result may be that all the income of the trust is subject to the highest individual marginal rate of tax plus the Medicare levy. There is no State or Commonwealth legislation which specifically precludes contracts under which contributors would be taxed at their normal marginal tax rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       The structure of the funeral benefit business fund and the amount of investment income it derives will determine whether provisional tax is payable. In any case, liability to provisional tax does not increase the total amount of tax to which a taxpayer is subjected. A provisional taxpayer's final tax liability in respect of any year is based on his or her actual income for that year (as with all other taxpayers) and the provisional tax paid during the year is offset against this tax liability.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No; funeral benefit businesses are operated with the intent of making a profit and therefore, in terms of both policy and taxation principle, should be subject to taxation accordingly. Moreover, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised that provision of a tax exemption would create tax avoidance opportunities.

       4,732
      </para>
      <para>
       The bulk of the returns in respect of the 1988-89 year of income are not expected to be received until later in the 1989-90 financial year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The requirements under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act and Regulations regarding lodgment of returns to the ISC apply only in respect of those superannuation funds and approved deposit funds seeking the relevant superannuation tax concessions. Funds not seeking those concessions are not required to lodge a return under the Act and the ISC does not have ready access to information on such funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The 1988-89 ISC annual returns are required to be lodged by superannuation funds within the same time frame as is allowed for funds to lodge their taxation return forms with the Australian Taxation Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       Late lodgment of an ISC return does not necessarily cause a superannuation fund to be treated as a non-complying fund and taxed at the highest marginal rate. For example, the Commissioner of Taxation may treat a superannuation fund as a complying fund, notwithstanding that it has not obtained an ISC notice of compliance, if the Commissioner of Taxation considers it likely that a notice will be received at a later time.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The bulk of superannuation fund tax returns in respect of the 1988-89 year of income are yet to be received. For this reason, and because of the limited information available on funds not lodging ISC returns (see (2) above) or on the number of funds likely to be treated as non-complying (see (3) above), it is not yet possible to accurately assess the amount of revenue involved.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) and (2) Prior to 1987-88 the ABC followed an accounting policy whereby co-production income was netted off against expenses, and thus was not disclosed separately in the Corporation's records. Since 1987-88, accounting policies have changed and details are kept. These are set out in the following tables. To isolate the records prior to 1987-88 according to the new policy would be an extremely onerous process, if it could be successfully done at all.
      </para>
      <para>
       Detail of co-productions for 1987-88, 1988-89 are included on the tables.
      </para>
      <para>
       Question 2 refers to a ``nominal'' and ``average cost'' cash basis, It is not clear what this distinction means. For details of costs, refer to the following tables. The following tables show total production cost-co-producers contributions and ABC contribution. The figures are calculated on an accrual expenditure basis during the year indicated.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the reasons indicated in the tables, it should be noted that year on year comparison of figures should be treated with care.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) For similar reasons as set out in (1), details of revenue from the sales of co-produced programs are not readily available prior to 1986-87.

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The ABC at all times looks to the cost-effectiveness of co-production and takes into account on an individual progran basis the decision whether to pay for a program and own it outright or enter into co-production and sell off some equity in the project. An evaluation is then made whether the investment by a co-producer is more cost-effective than looking to sales of a program once it is made.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to Drama and Documentaries-due to the prohibitive costs, co-productions are the only viable way to ensure a reasonable level of output and therefore employment and development of Australian talent and skills.

       (1) Arising out of the Government's decision to extend SBS services to 9 new areas (La Trobe Valley, Bendigo, Ballarat, Darling Downs, Darwin, Spencer Gulf, Launceston, Cairns and Townsville) by 1994, can the Minister explain why the Government chose to extend the service to Bendigo and Ballarat and not Shepparton, covering the Goulburn/Southern Riverina area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Is the Government aware of claims that a service in the Shepparton area would reach 50% more people of non-English speaking background than either Ballarat or Bendigo, and how does the Minister respond to these claims.

       (4) Following amalgamation of the former Departments of Transport, Aviation and Communications during 1987 new management requirements led to level 5 of the Drakeford Building being refurbished early in 1988 to accommodate the Department's Secretary, two Associate Secretaries, and the First Assistant Secretary and Principal Adviser (Corporate Management) and to provide an office for use by Ministers or senior visiting officials. The total cost of this refit was $177,832.

       The subsequent appointment of a Deputy Secretary necessitated further adjustments to the accommodation on level 5. The total cost for this work, completed on 3 November 1989, was $40,162.

       (1) Does the Government consider the availability of technologically-oriented management training as highly desirable, if not essential, to the revitalisation of the Australian manufacturing export industry; if so, does the new innovative engineering course now being offered by the ANU fit into this category.

       (2) There is no formal agreement between the Australian National University and the Department of Employment, Education and Training on this matter. There have been negotiations between the Australian National University, the Canberra College of Advanced Education, the Australian Defence Force Academy, the ACT Institute of TAFE, and the Institution of Engineers, Australia, concerning the formation of a single School of Engineering for the ACT aimed at ensuring cooperation in the provision of engineering education in the ACT. The negotiations have addressed issues concerning respective institutional roles, access to programs and the nature and size of programs. I understand from press reports that the School was launched on 13 December 1989. In these circumstances the ANU and CCAE would include proposals for student enrolments into the single engineering school in their educational profiles and the usual procedures for negotiating funding would apply.

       Total costs under the charter for hire, crewing and science instrumentation system for the 1990-91 financial year are estimated to be $11,058,662. A breakdown of this amount and information on the variables on which it is based are as follows:

       Vessel hire fee is escalated at a rate of 4% per annum under the charter, providing the average increase in the CPI for the six capital cities does not exceed 7 1/2% for the twelve months ending 30 June immediately preceding the Antarctic season: 4% has been used for this calculation ...

       If the vessel is not chartered for some other purpose during the off-season, then a lay up cost will also be incurred. The Commonwealth is not, however, liable for any lay up costs until the vessel has been chartered for a full Antarctic season.
      </para>
      <para>
       Assuming that no alternative use is found for the vessel in the off-season the cost is calculated to be $164,151, which represents that part of the year between the completion of the 1990-91 season and 30 June 1991.

      <para>
       In addition to the above costs there are a number of items and contingencies which cannot be accurately calculated at this time, eg victualling (which depends on the numbers of expeditioners carried each day), radio telephone and satellite telephone calls, ice pilots (if required) and bounty on scientific equipment (if less than estimated).

      <para>
       (1) In view of the fact that the advice of the Army Reserve Appointment and Promotion Advisory Committee is normally taken into account by the CGS in relation to the appointment and promotion of Senior Army Reserve Officers, in what circumstances in relation to such appointments and promotions would the taking of that committee's advice into account not be applicable.
      </para>

       (3) In view of the fact that Colonel Tait (ARA) was told in mid-September 1988 by Major General Keldie, Commander, 2 Div, that he was to be appointed Commander, 5 Brigade in succession to Brigadier Bryce Fraser (ARes) and Brigadier Fraser was formally advised by Major General Keldie of this on 2 December 1989, and informally on 2 previous occasions, was this change of command discussed at the A&amp;P Committee meeting held on 27 September 1988; if so, what advice was tendered to the CGS; if not, why not, and in particular, what circumstances, if any existed which made it inappropriate or undesirable to consider and tender advice to the CGS on such an important and unusual change of command.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) In relation to the similar replacement of an ARes Brigadier with an ARA Colonel in the command of 4 Brigade in Victoria, was this very important change of command considered at the A&amp;P meeting of 27 September 1988; if not, why not.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) If, as has been advised by the Minister previously, the A&amp;P Committee did as a matter of course deliberate on these changes of command in the 4th and 5th Brigades, why were these deliberations on these very important and unusual changes not recorded in the minutes of that Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) In view of the fact that the A&amp;P Committee has considered that probability of Reserve formations and units being commanded by Regular Officers when on a case-by-case basis a pool of suitable Reserve Officers is not available, would an ARes Officer below retiring age who was available and who had proved himself previously in a similar command be precluded from appointment to such a command.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Since Colonel Tait (ARA) was advised by Commander 2 Division, Major General Keldie, in mid-September 1988 that he was to assume command of 5 Brigade, when was that decision taken by the CGS and how and by whom was it communicated to Major General Keldie, and with what instructions as to its further communication to Colonel Tait and Brigadier Fraser.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) If the CGS made the decision to replace Brigadier Bryce Fraser (ARes) as Commander of 5 Brigade after advice from Land Commander Major General Smethurst, Assistance Chief of the General Staff for the Army Reserve, Major General Fay; and Commander of 2nd Division Major General Keldie and Command of 3rd Division Major General Nunn, did the advice of all 4 of these officers favour the decision made by the CGS, if not, which Officer advised against the decision.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) In view of the fact that the policy of the Government and the Army is to give preference to qualified, suitable and available ARes Officers over Regular Officers for Senior Reserve Appointments, why does an ARes Officer's age (presuming the relevant Officer to be below retiring age) or the fact that he has previously commanded, render him not suitable for senior command or appointment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Is age and previous command to be taken as overriding the clear policy of preference of Reserve Officers for ARes Command and Appointments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Is it policy that ARes Brigade Commanders command for only two-and-a-half years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) What is the basis of this policy, and is it considered sufficiently important to justify the over-riding of the policy that ARes Commands should be held by ARes officers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) Is there a similar two-and-a-half year term policy in relation to the Command of 2nd and 3rd Divisions, or the position of Assistant Chief of the General Staff (ARes), if not, why not.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) Were there any reasons other than that he had commanded for two-and-a-half years why Brigadier Bryce Fraser (ARes) was replaced in December 1988 by Colonel Tait (ARA) in the command of 5th Brigade.

        —The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Advice may be given out of session or informally. There is, of course, no legal requirement for the Chief of the General Staff to follow such advice as he is a duly authorized delegate of the Governor-General.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Chief of General Staff has acted without formal advice from the Army Reserve Appointment and Promotion Advisory Committee on several occasions in the last two years. Such action has been necessary because of the specialist nature of an appointment or because the Committee could not be formally convened in time for a decision. When the latter occurs, advice is sought from relevant commanders.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The proposed change of command of 4 and 5 Brigades was approved by the Chief of the General Staff on 16 August 1988. His decision was supported by out of session advice from the six members of the Army Reserve Appointment and Promotion Advisory Committee directly concerned with the appointments. Out of session advice was sought because the Army Reserve Appointment and Promotion Advisory Committee scheduled to consider such appointments was delayed until 27 September 1988 when these appointments were noted.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) As for (3)
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The command of 4 and 5 Brigades did not form part of a specific agenda item. Comments related either to the performance of officers then in command or as part of the overview presented by the Commanders 2 and 3 Division in relation to the manning in their regions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The decision to appoint ARA officers to command 4 and 5 Brigades was made by the Chief of the General Staff on 16 August 1988 and formally promulgated by the Military Secretary on 15 September 1988. In accordance with normal procedure it was communicated to Major General Keldie through the chain of command by telephone in the first instance and Major General Keldie was requested to advise both officers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Yes. As detailed in (3) above, the decision by Chief of the General Staff was supported by the advice tendered.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Officers who had previously commanded brigades were considered. Given that they were not considered suitable for further advancement, however, it was considered to be in the best interests of the Army to appoint other officers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) No
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) No. It is however, by practice about the maximum as only one officer in NSW in the past 15 years has commanded a brigade or similar formation for more than two-and-a-half years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) It is not policy that an Army Reserve Brigade Commander should serve for only two-and-a-half years. Each case, is reviewed annually, and a decision taken of the relative merits of the situation. Factors considered include the overall performance of the brigade, the brigade commander's potential for further advancement and the need for him to serve in another appointment for either his own development or to meet the needs of the Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) It is usual for Reserve Divisional Commanders and the Assistant Chief of the General Staff Army Reserve to complete a minimum of two and a maximum of four years in the appointments. Although, in law, the appointments, as with brigade commander, are for an unspecified period, initial appointments are made for two years and reviewed annually by the Chief of the General Staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) It was considered that a change in command would benefit the brigade and Brigadier Fraser was made aware of this by the Commander 2 Division in December 1988.

        —The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) An invitation to register interest in the commercial operation of the Woomera Instrumented Range was released on 18 March 1989. By the closing date for Registration of Interest (12 May 1989), thirteen organisations had responded. Details are provided at Table 1 shown below.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The country of origin of non-Australian companies is also shown on Table 1.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The purpose of the industry briefing on the project held at Technology Park, Adelaide on 25 July 1989 was to issue a Request for Proposals to those organisations which had Registered Interest. These companies attended the briefing accompanied by a number of advisors and associates. A list of those who attended is provided at Table 2 shown below.
      </para>
      <para>
       By the closing date for the Request for Proposals (29 September 1989), two responses were received. These came from Australian Flight Test Services Pty Ltd, an Australian company which had originally Registered Interest, and the Woomera Range Development Group Pty Ltd. This latter group is composed of Aero Space Technologies of Australia 45%, Ansett Technologies 40%, and the Government of South Australia 15%; the first two companies having originally Registered Interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both responses are tentative in nature and dependent on the outcome of feasibility studies. These are required both to establish the range of activities which might be undertaken and the commercial viability of the proposals.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) It is envisaged that activities undertaken by a commercial company acting as Range Operator for the Woomera Range will be subject to an agreement negotiated with the operator by the Commonwealth. Details of facilities and services which the Department of Defence requires or may need, constraints on the operators activities, and Commonwealth control of the Range Operator, are set out in the document `REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE WOOMERA INSTRUMENTED RANGE AND ASSOCIATED FACILITIES AS A COMMERCIAL UNDERTAKING-25 July 1989'. Because of the size of the document it is impracticable to reproduce it in this answer. Consequently, I have forwarded a copy of the document direct to Senator Vallentine.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) It is not envisaged that any of the proposed activities involving firings or tests will take place outside the Woomera Prohibited Area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The position of the Government on the use of the Woomera Prohibited Area has been conveyed to the Aboriginal community at Oak Valley, the Maralinga Tjarutja, by the Minister of Defence, Mr Beazley, on 24 August 1987 and confirmed by the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, on 14 September 1987. The area has been gazetted as a place for the testing of war material in the interests of the safety and defence of Australia. As such, it constitutes part of an important Defence asset. Its very considerable area is an essential feature for the provision of both adequate safety and adequate security.
      </para>
      <para>
       Relations between the Department of Defence and the Woomera Prohibited Area community of pastoralists, landholders and aboriginal peoples have been conducted over the past 40 years on a ``good neighbour'' basis. The Maralinga Tjarutja have been offered a Memorandum of Understanding to formalise the means by which their justified concerns can be expressed and taken into account in the planning process.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consultations are continuing with the aboriginal communities impacted by this commercialisation initiative.

       (3) The repeal of the guarantee arrangements is part of the Government's reform package for Telecom which was announced by the Minister for Transport and Communications in May 1988. It was one of a number of changes designed to place Telecom's operations on a basis more comparable with those of private sector businesses.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I do understand and have some sympathy for the position of pensioners for whom the payment of the citizenship processing fee may cause some hardship. The citizenship fee received some attention from Members and Senators during the Year of Citizenship campaign. Some concessions in respect of the citizenship fee were introduced during the campaign. While I do not favour abolition of the fee for age pensioners, I am examining the possibility of a reduced fee. I have asked my Department to examine this matter in the context of the 1990-91 round of new policy proposals.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) My Department does not have a figure for the number of people applying for Australian citizenship who are in receipt of an Australian age pension. However, an estimated 4.4% of applicants for the grant of Australian citizenship are of pensionable age and meet the residential requirement of an Australian age pension. Using this figure, I estimate the revenue foregone, if waiver for age pensioners were to be introduced, would amount to approximately $132,000 in the financial year 1990-91. This estimate is based on an expected 86,000 applications being received during the financial year.

       (3) The proposal for a national screening program is one in which the Government, in co-operation with State and Territory Governments, is already actively interested. It was vital to the interests of Australian women that overseas approaches to mammography screening be evaluated and pilot testing be undertaken in Australia before a national screening program is introduced. Women must be able to be confident that any such program would be relevant to their needs and capable of producing high quality results with minimum levels of interpretation error.

       (3) The Vocational Register for General Practitioners does not discriminate against women. Allegations that it does were investigated by the all party Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance which examined the proposals for vocational registration for general practitioners. In its unanimous report the Committee pointed out that the vocational training program for general practice, the Family Medicine Program, has extremely flexible arrangements to accommodate the needs of part-time trainees and women doctors returning to the workforce. Further, the provision in the eligibility criteria for vocational registration, that two sessions per week in general practice for the five year qualifying period is acceptable, ensures that doctors working in part-time practice are not disadvantaged.

       The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce (Doherty Report), to which the question refers, recognises that vocational training for general practitioners is highly desirable and that continuing medical education is essential to high quality medical care.

       (1) No. A recent economic research study conducted by my Department, based on expenditure data from the 1984 Household Expenditure Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, estimated that in that year, between 15.8 and 18.9 per cent of household expenditure was spent on sport and recreation related goods and services. The study adopted a broad definition of sport and recreation and identified a proportion of expenditure on a range of items, including clothing and footwear, transport, etc. as related to the sport and recreation sector. This allocation, however, was not exclusive and expenditure on these terms could, therefore, be counted in other categories of expenditure as well.

       (1) Australia has entered into comprehensive income tax agreements with the majority of our trading partners. These income tax agreements are based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments (OECD) 1977 Model Double Taxation convention. Australia's comprehensive agreements have as their primary objectives the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion.

      <para>
       The arrangement reported in the Australian of 12 December 1989 is a working arrangement between The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for the conduct of simultaneous examinations. The conduct of simultaneous examinations is authorised under Article 25 of the present Australia/United States Income Tax Convention which entered into force on 31 October 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       Simultaneous examinations were also permitted under the previous income tax convention with the United States of America, which the 1983 convention replaced, although none had been undertaken.
      </para>
      <para>
       The working arrangement merely formalises the ground rules for the two administrations when conducting simultaneous examinations. A simultaneous examination is an audit of a taxpayer conducted by each country and occurring at the same time. It is not a joint audit in that there is no interchange of personnel. Discussions are held to plan the strategy of the audit and the relevant functions to be undertaken by the respective parties.
      </para>
      <para>
       To achieve more efficiency in the exchange of information and to deal more effectively with cases of tax avoidance or tax evasion, the competent authorities of each convention partner decided to establish a working arrangement to conduct simultaneous examinations of selected taxpayers, or groups of taxpayers, carrying on activities in both the United States and Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The simultaneous examination of selected taxpayers is conducted under the exchange of information article of the Australia/United States Income Tax Convention and in accordance with the provisions of the arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The disclosure of information exchanged under the simultaneous examination arrangement is subject to the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Convention and, in Australia's case, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.
      </para>
      <para>
       The working arrangement with the IRS is the only formal agreement of this nature that the ATO has made. It is not considered necessary to conclude such an agreement in order to conduct a simultaneous examination.
      </para>
      <para>
       Indeed, a simultaneous examination is currently being conducted with the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department under Article 20 of the Australia/New Zealand Double Tax Agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The provisions of all of Australia's double tax treaties were made public through the legislative process at the time each agreement was incorporated into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953. The formalised working arrangement with the IRS does not affect taxpayers' rights as the arrangement does not extend the obligations and rights in relation to exchange information beyond those provided for in the Convention.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) When information is exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the various agreements there can be no breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. All exchanges of information are made by the competent authority, who is a very senior officer in the National Office of the ATO, or by officers authorised to act on his behalf.
      </para>
      <para>
       All exchange of information articles in Australia's agreements contain a secrecy provision which requires any information exchanged to be treated as secret and not to be disclosed to any persons other than those concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which the agreement applies.

       II CASE SELECTION AND EXAMINATION
      </para>
      <para>
       PROCEDURES
      </para>
      <para>
       The following selection procedures will apply in the following sequence:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Taxpayers will be independently identified for simultaneous examination by tax administration officials of each country.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Each country will inform the other of its choice of potential cases using the selection criteria described below.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Each country will determine whether it wishes to participate in a particular simultaneous examination. Neither country, however, is obliged to cooperate in all examinations proposed by the other country.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) If a competent authority accepts a counterpart's proposal to conduct a simultaneous examination, that competent authority will confirm, in writing, the selection of the case and will indicate a designated representative who will have functional responsibility for directing the examination. After receiving the confirmation, the proposing competent authority also will indicate, in writing, a designated representative. In those cases where there is agreement to conduct a simultaneous examination, the competent authority of each country will formally request the competent authority to exchange specific information and, if appropriate will spontaneously provide information to the competent authority pursuant to the Income Tax Convention.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The designated representatives of the competent authorities will designate areas and periods to be examined in the particular case selected, the timetable for the examination and approaches to be taken. They will initiate formal written requests for exchange of specific information and, where appropriate, spontaneous exchanges of information through the competent authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The information which may be requested and provided under this arrangement must be obtainable under the Income Tax Convention and the respective taxation laws of the two countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       III CRITERIA FOR CASE SELECTION
      </para>
      <para>
       Any case selected for simultaneous examination will involve a taxpayer(s) with activities in both countries. The factors considered in determining whether a case is selected will primarily be, but will not be limited to:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Indication of substantial noncompliance of tax laws in both countries;
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Compatible tax years; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Activities involving tax haven (for this purpose, a tax haven is a country or jurisdiction that has a zero or low tax rate, or that allows an escape from taxes on economic gains which should be taxed in Australia or the United States).
      </para>
      <para>
       IV PERSONNEL
      </para>
      <para>
       Examinations will be conducted separately within the framework of national law and practice solely by tax administration officials of each country in a way which maximizes the advantages obtainable for treaty exchanges of information. No interchange of personnel will be made between the countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       V PLANNING THE EXAMINATION
      </para>
      <para>
       Before the start of the examination, the tax administration personnel in charge of the case will consider with their counterparts from the other country, the audit plans of each country, possible issues to be developed, and target dates. Designated representatives may, if they consider it appropriate, initiate the exchange of formal examination plans through the competent authorities.

       VI CONDUCTING AN EXAMINATION
      </para>
      <para>
       This procedure requires cooperation of personnel located in each country who will simultaneously but independently examine the taxpayer(s) within its jurisdiction. The primary responsibility for coordinating the examination and exchanges of information on a selected taxpayer will rest with the country where the level of noncompliance with the tax laws and tax haven activity appears to be greater. All exchanges of information must be made within the terms of the Income Tax Convention.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) The 64 grants listed were included in a paper prepared for the honourable senator by the Australian Bicentennial Authority, which showed that at 3 October 1989, of the thousands of grants made by the Authority, some 67 remained to be fully audited and/or acquitted. Follow up action has established that all the projects were completed or nearing completion to the Authority's satisfaction in line with the grant intention and there was no evidence of improper use of funds. No recovery action was necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Authority has received acquittals or set in train a mechanism for the future acquittal of all grants outstanding. The arrangements have been discussed with, and agreed by, the Australian Audit Office. The acquittal action can be summarised in 4 categories
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Full Audit/Acquittal Received In this category the grant has been satisfactorily acquitted in writing per ABA contract requirements. Full and final acquittal of all monies has now been received.

       (2) Final Audit Responsibility Transferred to Other Agencies Recipients of grants in this category are associated with local Councils, State Government or Commonwealth Government departments/instrumentalities, which have confirmed that unacquitted grant funds will be fully audited within their routine auditing procedures.

       (3) Statutory Declaration For grants in this category the ABA has received statutory declarations from the grantees that the conditions of the grant have been complied with, that the funds will be audited in accordance with the purpose and conditions of the original agreement, and that any audit qualifications will be advised to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Other Acquittals For the two grants in this category the ABA took steps to investigate payments by the grantee and satisfy itself that conditions of the grant had been complied with. In one case the ABA checked directly with payees that contracted amounts had been fully received. The other case entailed an examination of the grantee's financial records by the Authority's staff.

      <para>
       (b) Radar was used on all of the days referred to. The KR10 and KR11 units are mounted on all traffic sedans and are standard equipment for these vehicles. Members of the A.F.P. who drive traffic vehicles in the course of their daily duty therefore use these radar units each day at various times according to prevailing traffic conditions. KR10 and KR11 radar units cannot operate in heavy traffic as a requirement for their use is that there be a minimum gap of 100 metres between each vehicle being checked.

      <para>
       Slant radar units were used on 60 days during the period 1 July to 1 December 1989. These units are most suited to heavy traffic situations and require a team of at least 5 police to operate efficiently.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I am aware that Australian missions overseas are extremely busy and have many competing calls on the time of their staff. My Department informs me that overseas missions are generally efficient in responding promptly to cabled enquiries from Australian offices. It does happen, though, that in isolated incidents responses to routine progress enquiries on individual cases can be delayed by pressure of work. Follow up requests deflect staff away from the more productive work of finalising cases. The time taken to respond to a cable seeking the present position of a case, can take longer than to action the matter to finality. Where this occurs, I understand that a busy post might not always be able to despatch a prompt answer to each request for information on the progress of a case through the processing cycle. The main avenue for conveying such information is between the post and the applicant.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes, in line with the Government's expectations outlined in (3) below.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Government expects overseas missions to provide a substantive answer to Departmental requests for information on the status of an individual visa application by an appropriate channel of communication and within an appropriate time-frame, depending upon the circumstances of the case in question and the caseload and workload pressures on the mission concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) I can assure the honourable senator that all overseas missions will be reminded of the Government's expectations in (3) above. I would also ask Senators and Members interested in immigration cases from their constituencies to exercise restraint in making routine progress enquiries of my Department's offices in Australia and overseas; the time and cable traffic generated by such enquiries consume resources best devoted to finalising visa applications.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) There have been no agreements reached in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to amend Australian laws to give recognition to the change of status of transsexuals. This issue was on the agenda of the Standing Committee between 1979 and December 1985. The item was removed from the agenda when members of the Standing Committee agreed that uniform legislation could not be achieved and that those States and Territories which were interested in changing their laws should take action unilaterally. The Commonwealth made it clear that there would be no amendment of the Marriage Act 1961 to allow transsexuals to marry in their adopted sex.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) There were no agreements to implement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) There is no item in relation to this matter on the agenda of the Standing Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The only State which has taken legislative action in relation to this matter is South Australia, which has enacted the Sexual Reassignment Act 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some administrative action has been taken by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to address some of the problems of transsexuals.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth has been able to assist transsexuals in a practical way since 1985 when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade commenced issuing passports which show the adopted name and sex of a transsexual. That action is taken to avoid unnecessary embarrassment and possible harassment when travelling.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am unaware of the full range of steps taken by the States and Territories. However, in relation to the issue of documents related to birth I am advised that some States and Territories have taken action to assist transsexuals to avoid inconvenience. There is, however, no consistent practice.
      </para>
      <para>
       All States and Territories, with the exception of South Australia, show the sex of birth on a birth certificate. In the case of South Australia, a person whose sexual reassignment has been recognised can obtain a birth certificate which indicates his or her original name and sex together with a notation of the adopted name and sex or, alternatively, obtain a birth certificate indicating the person's adopted name and sex without reference to the details originally registered.
      </para>
      <para>
       With extracts of entry of birth the practices are more varied. I am advised that the position is as follows. Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland each issue an extract which shows the adopted name and the biological sex, rather than the adopted sex, of a person. South Australia will, in line with the provisions of its Sexual Reassignment Act, issue an extract of entry indicating the adopted name and sex. I am advised that in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia, the sex of a person is not shown on an extract of entry.

      <para>
       With a view to assisting in analyses of the composition of Australian imports, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in its published monthly balance of payments statistics, itemises, among other principal commodity groupings, the value of imports of machinery. Published quarterly figures provide details of most imports in terms of three broad categories: consumption goods, capital goods, and other goods. Consideration is being given to providing a similar dissection in the monthly publication.
      </para>
      <para>
       With few exceptions, importers would not be sufficiently aware of the end use to which particular commodities would be applied to enable them to provide information which would permit the Bureau to itemise the value of imports to be used for the purpose of restructuring Australian industry.

       (1) Full account was taken of strategic considerations during evaluation of tenders. There is a close common purpose in defence industry matters between Australia and New Zealand which has been strengthened by the ANZAC Ship Project. Notwithstanding that the scenario which you describe is extremely unlikely, about one third of Hercules major servicings will continue to be performed by the RAAF in Australia thereby providing a capacity for surge should the need arise.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Hercules major servicings have previously been carried out in Australian industry and given the level of technology and infrastructure requirements for servicing, it would not be difficult to transfer this work from Air New Zealand to any one of a number of Australian companies should the need arise.
      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       Contracts with consultants outline the terms and conditions of the agreement. Where the agreement is simple and straightforward general conditions of contract are used with documents such as purchase orders. With complex consultancies covering major projects, a specific agreement including all the terms of the consultancy is drawn up.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Concerning part (e) of the question, for short term consultancies the charges and fees on which a contract is based are taken as firm for the period of the contract. For longer term engagements (over 12 months) the inclusion of a price variation clause may be justified but would reimburse the consultant only for verifiable cost increases, approved salary movements, increases in air fares, etc during the period of the engagement. Other reasons for varying fees include an approved change in scope of a consultancy or an extension of time. Additional fees would not be paid to a consultant because of failure on the part of the consultant to cost the proposal accurately or for additional work claimed to have been undertaken for which proper authorisation was not obtained in advance. Given these conditions, fees in excess of the accepted quote would be unlikely to be incurred. In view of the large number of contracts entered into during the time span nominated, I am not prepared to undertake a detailed examination of each individual agreement to determine if there are cases of payment of fees in excess of the consultants quote.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Australian Protective Service (APS) is to progressively take over the counter terrorist first response function performed by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) at airports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) State police already have the power to enforce Commonwealth laws at airports under the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970, and most States have already agreed to do so. It is expected that all States will enter into similar arrangements in the near future. The AFP will continue to provide the `Portswatch' function at airports as part of its role in Federal criminal investigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) As indicated earlier in my reply, the APS will take over counter-terrorist first response functions at airports. The APS is an appropriately trained force which is already experienced in security guarding at Parliament House and selected embassies, consulates and Defence establishments. The use of the APS represents an upgrading of security at airports. It will result in increased personnel at existing airports and an extension of counter-terrorist security protection to cover a further 14 designated airports around Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The new arrangements will result in upgraded counter-terrorist services. The Commonwealth is providing more staff at more airports to achieve this aim.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The cost of the counter terrorist first response function will continue to be met from the Budget. $2.2m in 1989-90 and $14.8m per annum have been provided to take account of the transfer of the counter terrorist first response function from the AFP to the APS at 23 designated airports. Appropriate offsets will be identified as a result of the transfer.
      </para>
      <para>
       An allocation of $5.1m has been made to the APS for establishment costs and working capital.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) The Australian Protective Services Act 1987 has been amended to provide necessary additional powers for the APS to carry out counter terrorist first response functions at designated security airports from 1 January 1990.

       Accordingly we personally paid such costs, including those for food, liquor and the wages of casual staff. Costs incurred as part of the normal day to day running of The Lodge as the Prime Minister's residence, such as the wages of full-time domestic staff, or which could not be identified as relating to the particular function, such as electricity, were charged against normal heads of expenditure. As I am sure the honourable senator would know, it has never been the practice to try and distinguish a ``private'' component of the costs of the official residences.

      <para>
       The major advantage claimed for the proposal of the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies' (AAPBS) to introduce an interest withholding tax on interest income (in lieu of subjecting that income to normal personal taxation arrangements) is that it would bring to tax interest income not declared by taxpayers in their tax returns. The Government believes a more appropriate and equitable way of achieving this objective is through the Tax File Number System. Under the Tax File Number System, from 1 July 1991, a taxpayer may choose to quote his or her Tax File Number in relation to his or her:
      </para>
      <para>
       interest-bearing accounts or deposits with a bank, building society or credit union;
      </para>
      <para>
       loans to bodies corporate or government bodies such as investments with finance companies and bonds; and
      </para>
      <para>
       shares in public companies, units in unit trusts or investments through solicitors' trust accounts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tax file numbers will be included in income reports provided by investment bodies to the ATO. Tax file numbers will facilitate more efficient and accurate matching between these income reports and details in taxpayers' income tax returns.
      </para>
      <para>
       From 1 July 1991, if an investor chooses not to quote his or her tax file number, tax will be deducted from interest or investment income at the highest marginal rate of personal taxation plus the Medicare levy. The investor will still be required to include the total amount of interest and other investment income payments in his or her tax return. On assessment, the investor will be allowed a credit for any tax deducted by an investment body at source.
      </para>
      <para>
       An interest withholding tax along the lines suggested would have significant disadvantages:
      </para>
      <para>
       it would provide a substantial tax break for persons on high marginal tax rates, whilst pena-lising those low income earners whose incomes fall below the tax threshold. The latter group would include many age pensioners whose total income would be less than their effective tax threshold;

       relative to the Tax File Number System, a 15 per cent withholding tax would have a substantial cost to revenue. Tax collected from income earners below the tax free threshold would not compensate for the loss in tax revenue from income earners with marginal tax rates above 15 per cent; and

       contrary to a claimed advantage, it would be unlikely to produce any net increase in national savings, its main effect probably being to encou-rage a switch in private savings from non-concessionally taxed vehicles into savings accounts and to bring about a decline in public sector saving represented by the revenue cost of the proposal.

       I would also like to expand on one aspect of Senator Button's initial comments in reply to the honourable senator's question. It was stated that partnerships were included in the National Accounts figure of $17 billion but not in the income tax statistics figure of $8 billion. The Australian Tax Office has advised that the National Accounts 1986-87 Household Income sector interest income item of $17.3 billion includes all interest, royalties and land rent income other than interest, royalties and land rent income earned by the corporate sector. The National Accounts measure is derived from income flows and survey results whereas the $8.7 billion estimate published in the Taxation Statistics represents approximately 97% of interest income returned by individuals who lodge tax returns (approximately 3% of returns, late returns etc., are processed outside the period covered by the Taxation Statistics).
      </para>
      <para>
       To obtain a comparable figure to that presented in the National Accounts, it is necessary to adjust the Taxation Statistics as follows:

       Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an article on page 3 of the Australian of 20 November headed `Cancer test ``unreliable'' '. Does this refer to a statement by Dr Graham Giles of the Victorian Anti-Cancer Council claiming that lifestyle-related `do-it-yourself' cancer test kits currently sold in pharmacies might produce unnecessary anxiety or undue optimism? Will the Government investigate the validity of Dr Giles's claim, and if it is justified, take action to prevent pharmacists from offering the kits for sale.

       The Minister for Housing and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       On 24 November 1989, Senator Jones asked a question concerning do-it-yourself cancer test kits. It referred to concerns expressed by Dr Graham Giles of the Victorian Anti-Cancer Council that the use of such kits might produce unnecessary anxiety or undue optimism. Senator Jones concluded his question by asking `will the Government investigate the validity of Dr Giles's claim and, if it is justified, take action to prevent pharmacists from offering the kits for sale'. I agreed to further investigate this aspect.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am now able to advise that the validity of Dr Giles's claim has been readily accepted. However, concerns about these tests relate to the way in which people might interpret the results rather than any inherent fault in the test kits themselves. It is not considered that the circumstances warrant a complete prohibition on the sale of these products by pharmacists, although as indicated in my earlier response, action has been taken to limit their being advertised to the public.

       Can the Minister please confirm that tenders for the supply of electronic equipment to be used in association with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme closed on 20 November, exactly the same date as the deadline for comments by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which clearly indicates the farcical nature of the so-called consultation process. Is it true, as reported in the Canberra Times of 23 November, that the equipment being sought will include a magnetic card reader? Accordingly, can we assume that this plan by the Health Insurance Commission, supported by this Government, will result in personal medical information relating to members of the community being stored in a central computer in the Commission's office?

      <para>
       The Commission has put out a request for tenders for equipment that might be used in the processing strategy proposal that it has put to the Pharmacy Guild. The tender document makes it clear that acceptance of any tender is subject to ministerial approval of the proposal. The Commission's strategy proposal makes no provision for changes to the requirements for patient identification beyond that already required to be included on the prescription form. It does, however, recognise as a long-term objective the need to rationalise the seven different cards which currently operate under the program. The request for tender seeks information as to the extent to which the equipment may be able to be adapted to accommodate a magnetic card reader. This is simply a matter of keeping options open for the future. As there has been some delay in the Guild considering the Commission's proposals, the Commission has decided to discontinue consideration of the tenders.

        —On 6 December 1989 (Hansard, page 3994), Senator Messner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security a question without notice concerning superannuation. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) Yes, for employees who receive some employer support for superannuation. Employees who receive no employer support (including no award superannuation) will be able to claim a tax deduction for the first $3000 of contributions plus 75 per cent of the excess over $3000 in the year, provided the total deduction funds benefits within the reasonable benefit limits for the individual concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Yes. However, it should be noted that, in the 1989-90 Budget Speech, the Treasurer only raised the possibility of the gradual introduction of a further 3 per cent award for occupational superannuation forming part of the wage system for next financial year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Were there to be any further increases in award superannuation or coverage of award superannuation, the tapering of the deduction for the personal superannuation contributions of supported employees will not make these employees worse off in tax terms as regards superannuation contributions. Employer contributions, paid directly to the superannuation fund, are part of an employee's remuneration on which no personal income tax is paid by the employee. In this light, they are equivalent to deductible contributions made by the employee. Therefore, any reduction in the size of the deduction allowed for the employee's personal superannuation contributions, occurring as a result of an increase in employer contributions in excess of 4 per cent of wage or salary, must be precisely equal to the increase in employer contributions in excess of 4 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should not be overlooked that the existing 3 per cent award for occupational superannuation has, for the first time, provided the average worker with greatly increased access to superannuation-traditionally the preserve of highly paid professionals and public sector employees. The average worker can now more readily benefit from the tax concessions provided to superannuation to provide a better and more secure income in retirement.
