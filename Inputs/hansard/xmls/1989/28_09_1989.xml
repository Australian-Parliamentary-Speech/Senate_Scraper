       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament.

We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.

       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.

        </talker>
        <para in-line="1">
         —Luckily I have an answer from the Minister for Social Security in response to Senator Colston's question. It is true that the Child Support Agency can generally only enforce liabilities to pay maintenance that occur after the date on which an order or agreement is lodged with the Agency. There are two reasons for this. First, when a person fails to pay maintenance due under an order or agreement made under the Family Law Act the arrears of maintenance are enforceable by the courts as a matter of discretion; that is, the amount of the arrears is not automatically a debt due to the person entitled to the maintenance, rather, the person needs to persuade a court under the Family Law Act to make a particular order to enforce the arrears. The Child Support Agency system is very different; one could say it is much tougher. Once a liability is registered with the Agency, any amount not paid on time is automatically a debt due to the Child Support Agency. No question of a court's discretion arises. The Child Support Agency can sue for that debt in any appropriate civil court.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That means that if arrears that accrued before registration of the liability with the CSA could be registered with the Agency, the child support legislation would retrospectively alter the legal rights and duties of parents. The Minister has presented an example to show the effect. If a non-custodial parent was ordered 10 years ago to pay $30 a week maintenance but has paid nothing in that time, under the Family Law Act the custodial parent could take proceedings to enforce the arrears of about $15,000 but it would be a matter of discretion for the courts whether that amount would be enforced and how it is enforced. In many cases the court might enforce only about $1,500 of the arrears. If, on the other hand, that $15,000 were a liability to the Child Support Agency there would be no discretion; it would be a firm debt beyond the review of the courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second reason relates to the very practical problem of establishing the amount of any arrears. Before the child support scheme was introduced, one of the most common disputes between separated parents concerned whether maintenance had been paid and whether money that had been paid was for maintenance. For example, when a non-custodial parent paid a phone bill for a custodial parent was the amount paid instead of or additional to a liability to pay weekly maintenance? The only acceptable forum to resolve these sorts of issues is the courts. For these reasons there has been no change at all to the rights of people entitled to arrears that accrue before registration with the Child Support Agency. They can still enforce orders through the courts but must go to the courts to enforce them. Of course, if custodians are in hardship they are free to apply to a court for a variation of their maintenance order which can then be collected by the Child Support Agency.

I have not seen the entire speech, and I have not been able, therefore, to do a comprehensive or entirely accurate costing of the figures in the speech. It is a pity that Question Time was not on at 2 o'clock. However, it is clear from the reports that have been published that what Senator Haines is advocating would cost about $10 billion. Senator Haines wants to present herself to the electors of Kingston as Santa Claus handing out goodies-$10 billion worth of Christmas sweets. That is the way Senator Haines wants to be seen by the electors of Kingston, and she hopes she can con them with that.

       <para>
        I have another message for the electors of Kingston. To pay for Senator Haines's $10 billion worth of Christmas sweets would require a 20 per cent increase in personal income tax. So let the electors of Kingston remember that if they want Senator Haines's bundle of Christmas goodies, their income tax is going to go up by 20 per cent. They would be paying 20 per cent more tax if Senator Haines's program were to be implemented. To be fair, there is one alternative to that. Senator Haines is purported to have said:

        There is one way in which the 20 per cent increase in personal income tax implicit in her speech can be avoided, and that is by the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax or a value added tax which adds $10 billion to present indirect tax collections. I look forward to Senator Haines clarifying whether she intends to break with 12 years, I think, of alleged Democrat tradition in opposing not only broad-based consumption taxes but any increase in indirect taxes at all, or whether she proposes to put up personal income tax by 20 per cent and make every elector in Kingston pay 20 per cent more income tax than is the case now.

        We have a worrying current account deficit. `Ipso facto', the superficial argument goes, `let us restrict imports, as this is a painless way of dealing with the problem'. There are many flaws in that superficially appealing argument. The first one, of course, is that imports are a component of consumption; therefore, if imports are cut off, consumption falls, other things remaining equal. So it is not painless on that front. There are other technical and political problems. The political problem, of course, is that if barriers to imports are raised there is the possibility, the danger, that there will be retaliatory action by other countries against Australian exports. On the technical problems, if quantitative barriers to imports were to be introduced there would be a lead time for their introduction of, I understand, about six months. In that six-month period the message would go out to everybody that if they want to import particular goods they should make sure that they do so within the next six months because quantitative restrictions will come in. Everybody would know that six months hence they would not be able to buy French brandy, to take Senator Coulter's example. What do honourable senators think the response to that would be?

        One other alternative-I do not want to spend much more time on this-is that we could impose higher duties. That could be done more quickly-indeed, it could be done almost overnight. That would have the same effect as a change in the exchange rate. We had a major depreciation of the Australian dollar in 1986. Depending on whether one measures it against the United States dollar or the trade weighted index, within a period of 12 months there was a depreciation of the order of 30 per cent. It may even have been a little higher. While presumably that had some impact on imports, it did not have the dramatic impact on imports that many people would have expected.

Frankly, I do not know whether Senator Richardson drinks French brandy. However, some French brandy is very expensive. I think it is called cognac-I do not know much about it either. There is also some French brandy which, I understand, is very cheap and which could probably be more accurately described as rotgut. So French brandy is not necessarily expensive. I am trying to think what the supplementary question was. Like you, Mr President, I am having difficulty. The question seems to be based on an assumption that imports are more than proportionately consumed by high income groups. While commonsense tells one that that is true for, say, Mercedes Benz, BMW or Rolls Royce cars, I am aware of absolutely no evidence which demonstrates that imports in total are consumed or bought more than proportionately by high income groups.

Certainly, we take the view that Senator Gore's very public intervention in this matter will give a significant fillip to the Australian initiative. That initiative commenced in May this year with the Prime Minister's announcement that Australia would not sign the Antarctic minerals convention, but instead would pursue the urgent negotiation of a comprehensive environmental protection convention within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty system. The objectives in doing that, and also at the same time seeking to strengthen and extend the present moratorium on minerals activity in Antarctica, were taken up by the Prime Minister and me with the Antarctic Treaty countries that we both visited in June and in the course of subsequent international meetings that we have attended. The governments of India, France and Belgium publicly supported the Australian initiative and sympathetic responses have been received from Sweden, Italy, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Federal Republic of Germany, Poland and a number of non-consultative parties to the Antarctic Treaty.

Now the joint initiative will be considered at the next meeting of Antarctic Treaty consultative parties in Paris, which is to take place in October, just next month. At that meeting we will seek support for a special consultative meeting next year committed to develop urgently a comprehensive environmental protection regime.

Does the Minister agree that his Government's economic policies are making it harder for families to exercise true freedom of choice by, first, trying to exist on one income and, secondly, commencing and raising a family? I and, I am sure, many hundreds of thousands of Australian families would like to know whether it is now an unannounced Government policy that Australian families should be persuaded into adopting a two-income situation where the mother is forced into the paid work force despite her desire to be a full time home-maker, particularly whilst her children are still young? Is it also a hidden policy of the Government that not just newly married couples but even perhaps those who have been married for several years should be forced by economic circumstances to choose between adequate housing and the commencement of a family?

There is no such unannounced policy and it is not the intention of the Government that that should happen. It is clearly the intention of the Government-and it has been from the beginning-that we in this country should be in a situation of as near full employment as is possible and in a situation which provides opportunities and choices for women and others either in or potentially in the work force. That has resulted in high participation rates in employment during this Government's period of office. Indeed, the trend towards higher participation rates in the work force increased over a number of years before this Government came to office as well as under this Government. All that means is that there are changing social patterns and changing opportunities.

As far as the Government is concerned, these sorts of transactions should be treated as transactions and not cash advances, and accordingly, consumers should be billed as such. Because of its capacity to mislead, and the fact that consumers will be disadvantaged by this practice, I am glad to take this opportunity to warn consumers about it. I also indicate that I will be writing to both banking institutions, as well as to the Telecom consumers council, to ask them to rectify the situation in order to remove this inconsistent practice and give consumers clear information so that they are not misled and are not worse off in the way in which they now are.

        The Government does not want to see interest rates remain high, particularly mortgage interest rates, any longer than is required to reduce the current level of imports. Current demand and consumption have been very high. Senator Bjelke-Petersen full well knows that. The alternatives to the current policies, which may produce a better result for new home owners, are policies which will see a dramatic rise in unemployment in this country. The Government does not want to see that. Senator Bjelke-Petersen, I hope, would not want to see that either. We do not wish to keep interest rates high any longer than is necessary to achieve that purpose.

        I know that the housing industry has done an affordability survey and it is not inconsistent with the current high level of mortgage interest rates. The Government expected that. The housing industry has been in a situation of very high demand and very high production. It is essential that that high level of demand be reduced in order to try to deal with those problems. I am not able to comment on the details of the affordability survey, but as soon as possible we will revert to a situation where housing is more affordable than it is now.

         —But Senator Button is not in the very embarrassing commercial position Mr Elliott finds himself in, in which the Australian foreign exchange rate plays an important part. It relates to the bid by Harlin Holdings for Elders IXL shares, Harlin being a company controlled and owned by Mr Elliott and a number of other Elders executives and directors. Although Mr Elliott tried hard to avoid making a full bid for the other Elders shares, Harlin finally did the right thing and offered $3 for all the Elders IXL shares held by other people and then kept his fingers crossed and hoped that not too many people would accept. But that is not what happened. He misjudged and, according to this morning's Australian Financial Review, Harlin has had to outlay more than $2 billion to pay for the acceptances. Most of the $2 billion-odd appears to have come from overseas and to have the essential features of debt. Therefore, Mr Elliott has had to bring a large volume of money across the foreign exchanges. It follows that, the higher the Australian dollar, the greater the foreign denominated debt required for any given Australian dollar payment, which in this case is a bit over $2 billion. The quantity that Mr Elliott has been required to bring in is so large that in itself it has probably pushed up the rate somewhat. So no wonder he is complaining. But that is his problem.

        Mr Elliott seems to be saying that the Government ought to intervene in the forex market so that he can carry out transactions at prices that suit his personal purposes. We all know that when he got control of the lever of the Elders IXL till, he pulled it frequently-seven bonus issues in six years. It is like ringing up the jackpot every time. If he ever gets remote control of the levers of government I would hate to think what might happen to Australia.

I draw your attention to the fact that the Minister is drawing an extremely long bow in making the point about gains to Mr Elliott if the Australian dollar were lower now, completely omitting any reference to the fact that if the value of the Australian dollar drops, Mr Elliott's liabilities-on the facts that have been put forward by Senator Walsh-will, in fact, be higher and not lower so that it would be to Mr Elliott's personal disadvantage. I simply make that point because the fact that this man is the President of the Liberal Party of Australia means that he is continually subjected to abuse in this chamber with no protection from Standing Orders.

Does the Minister agree that a consequence of the Government's superannuation policy is to increase the power of union leaders? Will the Minister support the use of superannuation funds by unions, or anyone, to achieve economic, political or industrial objectives as opposed to providing for retirement? Will the Minister confirm that the sole aim of trustees of funds must be to maximise the return on investment of those funds so as to maximise the retirement benefits of the individual participants in the funds? Will he also confirm that this statement by the Treasurer vindicates the concern by many Australians, including members of the Opposition, that occupational superannuation was introduced not for the benefit of wage earners but to enhance the muscle and power of trade union leaders over their own members and the Australian community at large?

         —As Question Time is taking place so early I have had a very superficial look at this morning's newspapers. But I have not seen even a report of the Treasurer's remarks yesterday. I can say that the assertion in Senator Parer's last question, when he asked, `Is it true that the Government introduced occupational superannuation not for the benefit of employees but for other reasons?' is wrong. The answer to that, of course, is that the Government did not pursue occupational superannuation for other reasons. The Government has encouraged occupational superannuation for two reasons: firstly, for a contribution to the required higher level of total savings in this country; and, secondly, as a contribution to higher retirement income for the individuals to whom it accrues.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This is in marked contrast, if I may say, to the days when superannuation was abused by crooks like the Kelly brothers and all the other operators of cherry picker schemes who made sure that none of their employees ever qualified for superannuation because the trust deed was drawn up in such a way that those employees did not qualify until they were 60 or 65 years of age. The Kelly brothers made certain that none of their employees remained employed with their organisation when they were 60 or 65 years of age. That was just a massive fraud perpetrated against the taxpayers of Australia. That is the sort of fraudulent superannuation policy that Senator Parer's party-Senator Parer was not personally responsible because he was not here-presided over for years and for which Senator Parer and all his fellow Liberal Party of Australia senators, Senator Harradine, and most of the Australian Democrat senators, used their votes in this place. They ensured that crooks like the Kelly brothers got away with that ill-gotten money, the millions that they had stolen from the taxpayers of Australia. Senator Parer should look at his own conscience about that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been asked whether superannuation policy increases the power of union leaders. Frankly, I do not know whether there is any individual case where that may be so, but if there is, it depends on the way in which the superannuation fund is drawn up and the balance of the trustees. The common thing in most funds-I will check this out for Senator Parer if he wishes-is that there is an employee representative on the trust, an employer representative, and one other. On the question of the duties of trustees-again I will check this out-as I understand it, the trustees do have a legal obligation to manage the fund in the interests of the contributors. What is in the interests of the contributors at some point I suppose is likely to become subjective, but the clear intention of the law and the duty of the trustee is to manage the fund in the way that maximises the returns to the contributors.

        The very active campaign for the fluoridation of Australia's water supply which is being led by dentists in this country, and in particular the Australian Dental Association, has been one of the major factors in earning Australia the envious reputation of one of the most dentally healthy nations in the world. Indeed, Australia has become a world leader in this area with some 70 per cent of the population using fluoridated water. Without doubt this has proven to be the most effective and economical preventative procedure for the control of dental caries or tooth decay that has yet been discovered. It not only enhances general dental health throughout the community, but also reduces the necessity for dental treatment and, therefore, the associated costs that go along with that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The difference between generations of Australians in the quality of Australian teeth represents one of the great preventative health achievements in this country in the twentieth century. Indeed, in terms of a measure of community health it means that lower income earners, who in the past faced a high dental bill, have had that cost removed from their shoulders, which is a saving in terms of their disposable income. In that sense it is a major community health reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the last dozen years there has been a massive 60 per cent decline in the incidence of dental caries or tooth decay among children aged between six and 13 years. So great and so rapid has been the progress that Australia's child dental health status now exceeds the World Health Organisation's goal for the year 2000. This represents a massive improvement in child dental health. I am not suggesting that fluoridation is the only factor which has led to these improvements. However, it has been shown to be a major factor. Australian dentists deserve the highest praise for their courageous and unselfish support of the fluoridation campaign. The decision made by the Australian Capital Territory has to be seen as an extraordinarily regressive one in the face of this evidence. As Australia heads towards the 1990s the Australian Capital Territory is going backwards towards the 1950s. It also has to be said that it is an unfair infliction on the people of Queanbeyan, who get their water from the ACT and are now caught by this decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no evidence whatsoever available in Australia to support claims that fluoride causes medical problems. Indeed, Australia's most prestigious medical and scientific body, the National Health and Medical Research Council, issued a report in 1985 which supported the expansion of the fluoridation program. In its summary, the National Health and Medical Research Council stated:

        Examination of scientific literature confirms previous recommendations by Council concerning the safety and effectiveness of fluoridation of water.

        It went on to state that the allegations that had been made from time to time about fluoride causing particular medical problems were `not supported by scientific evidence'. It recommended:

        The Council noted that while fluoridation of drinking water is widely practised in Australia and other countries, and has been the subject of extensive investigation, there is a significant number of people in Australia who are still being denied the benefits of this well proven public health measure.

        In answer to Senator Schacht, there is overwhelming medical evidence that it has not only saved the community health bill but also improved the condition of people's health. On that basis the ACT Assembly's decision has to be seen as simply bizarre.

I must say that it is highly selective and rather misleading as an account of the findings of the Australian Science and Technology Council's recent report on the current state of basic science in Australia which was tabled in the Senate yesterday. In some ways it is a shame that it should be such a selective account because one might have hoped that the report would help to take some of the empty rhetoric out of the so-called science debate. The report entitled Profile of Australian Science, which was prepared by an independent body, endorses the general thrust and direction of the Government's science policies.

        Unlike most recent surveys which focused on the attitudes of small sample groups, the Profile of Australian Science report is based on two years solid empirical research across the entire spectrum of Australian science. It was commissioned by the Government for that purpose. The report debunks the argument often touted by commentators and sometimes members of the Opposition that funding for basic science in Australia is insufficient. Of course, in a sense, it is always insufficient, but there is a question of relativity. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        ASTEC found that overall, the quality of scientific research is adequate for a country with our research population . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The financial input to basic research appears to be at about the right level. Its allocation and what it is used for represent difficult problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report goes on to note that spending on basic research over the past six years has grown by 24 per cent in real terms with an annual real growth of 3.65 per cent. It also agrees with the Government's moves to improve the efficiency of the Australian research effort in the method of allocation of funds and so on. The report concludes that a greater proportion of funds should be directed towards Australia's best researchers-I suppose that is a subjective judgment of the Council-who, the report says, are small in number and spread across the country. A number of other issues were raised in the report, but the tone of it and the conclusions which it draws are much more realistic and optimistic than those suggested in the article in this morning's Age.

Has the Minister noted that those ubiquitous creatures, `official sources', have been at it again; this time telling the Sydney Morning Herald that they did not believe the Minister was `fully behind giving help to Kodak' and that they believed Mr Hawke was the initiator because the plant was in his electorate? Are these helpful sources, who seem very considerate of the Minister's personal standing in this sorry matter, correct in asserting that the memorandum which the Minister confirmed yesterday he had taken to Cabinet was lodged in the Minister's name and prepared by his Department simply for reasons of `propriety'? Will the Minister confirm the `official sources' version that he raised the matter in Cabinet on behalf of, and at the instigation of, the Prime Minister?

         —Oh, just a minute. As I said in answer to questions here yesterday from Senator Patterson, the approach was made by Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd to me. I responded to that approach. No Minister in this Government would have considered the issues any differently if the company had been in John Howard's electorate or anybody else's. I would have taken exactly the same attitude to this issue if the company had been in Darwin or anywhere else. It is nice of honourable senators to make these shonky political suggestions about this issue. I understand that because it is the sort of tradition with which those opposite grew up, if they did grow up. The first question asked by my predecessor in the Liberal Government when people came into his office seeking industry assistance was, `Which electorate is it in?'. Those opposite understand all about that. Industry leaders throughout Australia will tell them that. They will admit that the first question one always asked when seeking industry assistance or tailor-made tariffs, which they got from the Liberal Party during the seven years of the Fraser Government, was, `Which electorate is it in?'. Those opposite understand all that; we do not.

         —I am sorry to have to delay the Senate when it is about to adjourn for Estimates committees, but I have no choice in view of a newspaper which I have just received a copy of this morning entitled Government Computer News. We have heard Senator Button again in the Senate displaying his ability to be articulate and to use words with special meanings. The situation is that back in May this year his Department advised him to cover up the failure of the partnerships for development program. That advice, given to Senator Button in May, advised him-just note this-that Digital Equipment Corporation Australia Pty Ltd, Bull HN Information Systems and Hewlett-Packard Australia Ltd had failed to reach targets for exports when their efforts were reviewed for the first time and that DEC also failed to reach its research and development expenditure target, whereas six other partners did reach target. The Department gave Senator Button a draft news statement in which it advised him to say:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The nine-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the group of them together-
       </para>
       <para>
        have significantly improved their export performances since entering the program.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was true in the aggregate but it avoided the fact that three had not improved as much as promised. Let us look at the press release which Senator Button released on 5 July 1989 under the heading `Partnership Companies Exceed Export and R&amp;D Targets'. The first paragraph of this press release stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The first nine firms reviewed under the Government's Partnership for Development Program exceeded their combined first year's export targets by four per cent and their combined R&amp;D expenditure estimates by 36 per cent, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator John Button, said today.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then listed the firms:
       </para>
       <para>
        The firms are Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, Wang, Cincom Systems, Bull HN, Apollo Domain, Apple, IBM and Unisys.
       </para>
       <para>
        The truth is that three of those firms did not exceed their first year export targets. Apparently this journalist, Mr Colin Brammall, has got on to this story and discovered that three of those firms did not exceed their targets, but that if they were aggregated the Parliament and the journalists could be misled. I keep warning the Parliament and the journalists: people have to read very carefully between the lines when they read anything that Senator Button has said or written. This is a perfect example. Clearly, he has been caught out in relation to the bribe to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd of $60m over a period of five years. It is unlawful. It is contrary to the Industries Assistance Commission legislation. It is contrary to everything that Senator Button stands for. Indeed, it is contrary to what the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said when he introduced the Industries Assistance Commission Bill in 1973, when he talked about public disclosure of the reasons why we give assistance to industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has not been public in its disclosure of assistance to industry under the partnerships for development program; in fact, it has been very secretive about that. Only as a result of the combined pressure of the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats last year did we manage to force Senator Button to make a statement about that in the Parliament. On 5 July this year-I again go back to his press release-he announced:
       </para>
       <para>
        The achievement-
       </para>
       <para>
        honourable senators will note the singular in `the achievement'; not `the achievements'-
       </para>
       <para>
        by this group of Partners, together accounting for over 85 per cent of this Program, is an early sign that the Partnership for Development Program is working.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Button claims that his program is working when the truth is that one-third of those people have not achieved their requirements. I say once again that Senator Button has been caught out. According to Mr Colin Brammall there was another matter. The article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The department also advised Button to make public a mistake by Ditac in negotiating a partnership agreement with Cincom, because it would be embarrassing for the Government if it leaked out. It suggested calling it a `misunderstanding' discovered by the verification process.
       </para>
       <para>
        The advice was given-
       </para>
       <para>
        to the Minister-
       </para>
       <para>
        at the end of May in a confidential minute, with commercial-in-confidence attachments and a draft news statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already read part of that statement. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The confidential advice included that Cincom's partnership targets and performance had had to be downgraded.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apparently, according to Mr Brammall, this was because of a mistake by the Department. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The advice to Button said it was discovered when a local `beneficiary', Software Developments, did not benefit as much as expected.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister's Department advised Senator Button. I now wish to quote from Mr Brammall's article in which he is quoting from these confidential papers:
       </para>
       <para>
        `The issue is whether to make this adjustment public or not. The downgrading/mistake `could be hidden away in the aggregate figures for the nine reviews, but there would be severe embarrassment, particularly for the Government, if this matter was `discovered' at some later date.
       </para>
       <para>
        `An alternative would be to name Cincom and put it in terms of an example of the verification process at work. But as Cincom are not at fault and this could reflect adversely on them, I do not favour either approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rather, I believe we should, without naming Cincom, report that the latest export figures include a downward adjustment to take account of the results of the verification activities which revealed a misunderstanding of the basis on which reporting exports should be undertaken. Whilst this may attract media comment, it will be more manageable than a revelation at a late date.'
       </para>
       <para>
        What an unbelievable indictment of this Minister who is so proud of his credibility. I have repeatedly pointed out that one has to be very cautious when listening to and reading the words of Senator Button because he is very articulate. He is clever in manipulating the English language. This is a perfect example of how it is possible for him to mislead this Parliament, journalists and the whole of the nation by cleverly making statements which on the surface appear to mean one thing yet, in truth, mean practically the opposite of what he is talking about. Senator Button has repeatedly claimed success for his industry policies. I have repeatedly pointed out that all Senator Button is doing in this country at present is propping up industry wherever he possibly can because the macro-economy and the micro-economy of this nation are poor. The economy is terrible; it is woeful. The only way that industry, especially industry dealing with what are called elaborately transformed manufacturers, can succeed in the current economic climate of Australia is by getting government hand-outs, by dipping its snout into the taxpayers' trough. Once again I ask Senator Button: How deep are the pockets of the taxpayers of Australia? How much more money is the Government going to take from the taxpayers of Australia in order to cling to government, which is what this is all about? This Government is desperately trying to cling to government in the face of an election to be held very soon at which the people of Australia will turn on this Government and savage it. The Government is prepared to spend as much of the taxpayers' money as it possibly can in an attempt to cling to government.

         —I want to respond briefly to some of the remarks made by Senator Lewis. Anybody listening to what he had to say would have to conclude that he is saying only one thing: he has a problem because, as he put it, I am clever and he is not. I agree with that. I think he has a problem about that. I am not making an estimate of my own abilities; after hearing what he had to say, I am certainly making one of his.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the course of his remarks he accused me of a number of things. In doing so, he has walked into the political kitchen where the heat is. Senator Lewis accused me of a number of things which I want to deal with. Firstly, without prior warning that he was going to do so, he quoted from a journal, a copy of which he gave me one minute before he got to his feet. He referred to a journalist named Colin Brammall. The best that I can say about Colin Brammall is that he has a lot of problems; he is a very sad man. Senator Lewis cites Colin Brammell's report of alleged advice from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce about certain documents which were put to me. I have not seen that advice to which Senator Lewis refers. Senator Lewis always picks up scuttlebutt in the less reputable press and uses it as matters of fact in debate in this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to remind Senator Lewis that when he talks about me propping up industry in Australia he should bear in mind that in the manufacturing industry in this country under this Government production levels have been higher than ever before. Profitability has been higher than ever before. Employment has been higher than ever before. If Senator Lewis wants to debate some of those fundamental facts, let him come in here and do it. As distinct from the Liberal Party period of government, we have reduced tariffs in this country since 1970 by 65 per cent. Not one percentage point of those reductions took place under Liberal governments; it all took place under Labor governments. He goes around attacking my personal credibility saying that it is based on my capacity to use words; nothing else.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because it suited him, Senator Lewis said a little while ago that the Government was handing out $2.5 billion to industry. I suggest that he take that issue up with his friends in the National Party of Australia. What he was intending to imply in that statement was that that money was being handed out to manufacturing industry in this country; it is not. If Senator Lewis is saying that, it is a lie. He should look at the rural support schemes which are included in that $2.5 billion, the hand-outs to agriculture, and take them up with his friends in the National Party. It imposed massive burdens for years on the Australian taxpayer by prop-ups to rural industries. Some of those are still there.

The next thing Senator Lewis went on to say in the course of this debate after accusing me of propping up industry, which is not supported by the facts at all in terms of production, in terms of employment and in terms of what has happened in manufacturing in this country, was that the Government offered a bribe to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, which is unlawful.

Senator Lewis characterises the action as unlawful, but Senator Lewis himself announced publicly a week or two ago, `We will oppose the legislation when it is introduced' and then he comes in here and says that the Government is acting unlawfully.

        Senator Lewis says that the Government has not been public about many of these issues. The Government has been more public about industry assistance issues than any other government in the history of this country, and particularly governments of the opposite political persuasion. To come in here and base one's argument on a headline which is picked out of a not too credible computer journal is reprehensible in the extreme. The article on the next page by the same journalist has the headline `DITAC shake-up likely over partners'. Is that right? Does Mr Brammall know that? I do not know that. How does Mr Brammall know that? He knows it because it is a figment of his imagination, as many of the other things which he writes are.

The chamber, when it granted leave to Senator Vallentine on the basis that she was unable to find a way to Canberra, should have understood that each State is represented by 12 senators and that 11 of these senators from Western Australia were able to find their way to the national capital to represent their constituents in the chamber to which they were elected; Senator Vallentine could not. Unless I am wrong, there is a Royal Australian Air Force VIP aircraft leaving Perth this morning flying directly to Canberra. Yet we have an application from Senator Vallentine for leave of absence because she is unable to find her way here. Whilst at the end of the day the record will show her as being absent, because she was granted leave of absence when she comes under attack, as no doubt she will, for her lack of performance, her lack of attendance, the lack of occasions on which she voted on divisions, her constituents will be misled into believing that the Senate has understood her reason for not being here and has granted her leave of absence. Let it be understood that this morning the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia both voted on the voices against the granting of leave. Senator Vallentine is not here now; she was not here yesterday; she was not here the day before.

        There ought to be a general rule of thumb. If leave is granted it ought to be on the basis of compassionate grounds so that the Senate can make a proper determination, parliamentary or electorate responsibilities, or perhaps private business-three simple and easily definable and understood reasons for being absent. But it should not be put in general terms. Is it not an irony that it was an Australian Democrat who applied for her leave of absence? It is lucky that one of them is here to seek leave.

The honourable senator is not here for this week of sittings because of business-some obscure reason! When her leave of absence expired, her excuse for not being here was that she could not get here.

Mr Hall was elected as a Board Member of the Foundation at an Annual General Meeting on 10 February 1976. Mr Hall attended an extraordinary General Meeting of the Foundation on 3 April 1976 which elected a Caretaker Committee to be responsible for the wind up of the Foundation. He was not, however, elected to that Committee. The records of attendance indicate that Mr Perkins did not attend that meeting. I restate that Mr Hall was not engaged by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs when dispensing the assets of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs.

       (c) It is understood that the New England Aboriginal Corporation decided against pursuing the matter. It would appear that, as no breach of Commonwealth law was involved, no formal records were kept by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs subsequent to the return of the documents.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I presume that the Question is largely related to the 1988 calendar year in which the nominal value of the Australian dollar (as measured by the Trade-weighted index) increased by about 25 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       This increase was from an historically quite low level and, even at the end of 1988, the nominal value of the dollar was still considerably less than during the first half of the 1980s.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, since February this year, the $A has depreciated against most major world currencies. The trade-weighted index (the most relevant measure of the value of $A) declined by 8 per cent over this period.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is true that the rate of growth of exports slowed in 1988/89.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although part of this slowdown could reflect a decline in the international competitiveness of Australian exporters due to the increased value of the $A, the more likely major factor restricting exports has been the recent surge in domestic demand which has reduced industries' capacity to service export markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       But, despite the slowdown in export activity, exports still recorded a healthy growth in this year (about 5 per cent in real terms).
      </para>
      <para>
       Of particular note has been the continued strong growth of manufactured exports, which picked up in the second half of 1988/89. For the June Quarter 1989, manufactured exports, in real terms, were 7 per cent greater than the corresponding period in the previous year.
      </para>
      <para>
       As to the second part of the question, investment does not appear to have been significantly inhibited by the increase in the value of the $A that took place in 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that the increased value of the $A has stimulated investment by reducing the price of imported capital items.
      </para>
      <para>
       The level of private investment increased strongly in both 1987/88 and 1988/89.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1988/89, total private investment increased by as much as 15 per cent in real terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       This strong investment growth considerably exceeds the 7-8 per cent real growth in investment that occurred in the mid 1980s.

       Whether an increase in the value of the $A has had a different effect on investment to expand capacity and investment for replacement purposes is not clear.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is often claimed that a large part of recent investment activity has been to replace and update old equipment rather than for capacity expansion.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, these results can be misleading as replacement investment can significantly increase our capacity to compete on world markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       Investment to update old equipment is important in bringing Australia's existing products up to world standard, in removing bottlenecks in production (thereby augmenting existing production) and for installing more flexibility in the production process.

       1. I have made only one specific direction, on 4 November 1987, under sub-section 64 (7) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (the Act). However, in approving estimates of expenditure for Land Councils' administrative costs, where the estimated amount available under sub-section 64 (1) of the Act is less than that required to meet those administrative costs for a given financial year, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs approves that the shortfall be met from sub-section 64 (7) payments. Releases of sub-section 64 (7) moneys are made periodically at the approval of the NT State Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, who is the Minister's delegate in relation to sub-section 64 (7) of the Act. Such payments made since I became Minister, and before the end of June 1989, occurred on:

      </para>
      <para>
       Given the seriousness of the allegations I have decided that the most appropriate course of action is for me to exercise my authority pursuant to s. 38 (1) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (the Act). In accordance with the provisions of s. 38 I formally engage you, being a person having the prescribed qualifications, to inspect and audit the accounts and records caused to be kept by the Northern Land Council pursuant to s. 37 of the Act and to furnish to me a report of the results of that inspection and audit drawing attention to any irregularity in the financial affairs of the Northern Land Council disclosed by your inspection and audit.

       I have, by notice in writing served on the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, informed Mr Yunupingu that the inspection and audit will be carried out and naming you as the person whom I have engaged for the purpose. I would suggest it is appropriate that your first contact at the commencement of your review be with Mr Yunupingu.

      <para>
       While I would expect your inspection and audit to detail and investigate the specific allegations I would also envisage your review having a much wider scope within the parameters established by the Act. To assist you in this regard I am enclosing a schedule summarising those sections of the Act which impact upon the financial operations of the Northern Land Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       In particular I request that you report on the extent to which expenditure by the Northern Land Council meets its statutory functions. Your report on this aspect of the Council's financial operations should attempt to identify the source and amounts of all moneys received by the Council and examine the payments of those moneys out of the Northern Land Council.

       In my letter of 2 February 1981 I informed you that I intended to invoke my powers under Section 38 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and engage a person to conduct an inspection and audit of your Council's financial records.

       I am required under sub-section 38 (2) to inform you of the name of the person engaged for this purpose. Consequently, I now advise you that Mr Shane Brady of the Auditor-General's Office has been engaged to conduct the audit. Mr Brady expects to commence work in your office on 4 May.

       In line with sub-section 38 (3) of the Act you should now inform the Land Council that you have received this notice.

I would appreciate it if you could bring this to the attention of the Council.

       Dear Mr Hill,
      </para>
      <para>
       I am writing to you to ask that you carry out, under provisions of section 63P of the Audit Act 1901, an inspection and audit of the accounts and records of the Central Land Council in Alice Springs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 38 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may at any time cause a person having the prescribed qualifications to inspect and audit the accounts and records of a Land Council. A copy of Section 38 and of the regulation setting out the prescribed qualifications of such an auditor is attached.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Central Land Council is one of three established under the Land Rights Act. Land Councils are provided with funds for their administrative expenses from the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) established by the Act. Because royalty equivalent payments into the ABTA are insufficient, supplementation of Council funds has been made by way of advances from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. These advances are required to be repaid when ABTA income makes this practicable.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Central Land Council is reported to be in a serious financial position, being in overdraft to its banker for over $80,000, of which it appears some $70,000 or more represents moneys apparently misappropriated by an employee (or employees). The situation of the Council's finances were drawn to the attention of the Council by their auditors, Messrs Wallace McMullin and Smail, who have been conducting a special audit at the Council's request. As a result of their findings, the police have been called in to investigate and it is expected that charges will be laid in the very near future.
      </para>
      <para>
       A brief review of the Council's financial operations and methods by several officers of my Department, and discussions held by them with the Council's auditors and Council staff members, have disclosed a number of disturbing features, such as a lack of separation of responsibilities for administrative staff who authorise and make payments on behalf of the Council, the practice of cheques being signed by one person only, and a significant lack of control over the ordering of goods and services and the control of assets.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am taking other immediate measures to remedy the situation. I have written to the Land Council suggesting that the accounting and payments function of the Council be returned to a firm of public accountants and that a Management Consultant will be engaged to examine all aspects of the Council's functions and operations and advise on appropriate changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would envisage the audit I am now requesting, as including a report on the Council's compliance with the requirements of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and on any operational deficiencies which may be found. It is for this reason that I believe an independent audit of the Council would be useful.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would appreciate it if you would agree to your office carrying out this audit and if the matter would be given some urgency. You will note that I am required to inform the Chairman of the Council of the name of the auditor appointed.

       Dear Mr Scrutton
      </para>
      <para>
       Your telex to me on December 23, 1980, sought approval to overdraft facilities being provided for your Council. Subsequent discussions between officers of my Department and Mr Ormrod disclosed the fact that Council was in overdraft to the extent of $68,000, with the prospect of that amount increasing until further funds become available to the Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       With your agreement and Mr Ormrod's two of my officers visited the Council and held discussions on the financial difficulties being experienced.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the same time, Council auditors, Wallace McMullin and Smail, were conducting an audit at Mr Ormrod's request because of his concern that there may have been irregularity with Council accounts.
      </para>
      <para>
       The results of both those inquiries have been disturbing. Mr Ormrod informed me that as a result the audit police have been brought in to investigate an apparent misappropriation of some $70,000-$80,000 and that charges will probably be laid.
      </para>
      <para>
       The inquiries made by my officers, which had co-operation of your Council staff and of your auditors, have indicated some serious problems in the control of Council finances, some of which would have created the opportunity for funds to be misappropriated or misused.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not wish in this letter to go into detail, but the following are matters of serious concern:
      </para>
      <para>
       the practice of one signature only being required on Council cheques
      </para>
      <para>
       the lack of separation of responsibilities of certain administrative staff who are able to authorise payments as well as make them by way of cheque or cash

       the ordering of services or goods without recourse to the proper procedures of formal purchase orders and checking as to funds availability and reasonableness of purchase of the service or goods
      </para>
      <para>
       the payment by Council in the past of personal debts of employees and subsequent recoupment from their salaries
      </para>
      <para>
       inadequate control over purchase of vehicle spares, tyres, toolkits and so on with the result that many of these are unable to be accounted for
      </para>
      <para>
       the creation of new staff positions by Council without prior approval by the Public Service Board of terms and conditions, or of myself for additions to Council estimates of expenditure to fund those positions
      </para>
      <para>
       the retention on staff of persons who appear to lack the ability or willingness to perform their work at the level expected of them.
      </para>
      <para>
       Money used by Land Councils derive from the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account under sub-section 64 (1) of the Land Rights Act. Until royalty income into the ABTA is sufficiently high to enable the total of Land Council approved budgets to be met from that source, supplementation is required from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or the general funds of the ABTA, under sub-section 64 (7) of the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Money advanced to Land Council from the Consolidated Revenue Fund will need to be repaid from the ABTA; they are not a grant to Councils. Moneys in the ABTA apart from the essential expenses of the Councils provided for under sub-section 64 (1) are for the benefit of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. Excessive expenditure by Councils reduces the availability of funds for these people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 34 of the Act provides for me to approve Land Council estimates of expenditure, and it is my duty to ensure that the budgets are responsible ones. Section 37 requires that a Council exercise proper controls over its moneys and assets. Taking all of these things into account, I would be failing in my responsibilities if I did not take immediate and effective action to rectify the situation in which the Central Land Council is now placed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 38 (2) of the Act empowers me to order an inspection and audit of the accounts and records of Council. I intend to invoke this power and will shortly inform you of the name of the auditor appointed.
      </para>
      <para>
       I consider that other urgent corrective actions should be immediately instituted along the lines of the following:
      </para>
      <para>
       Council Finances-for the time being, the financial operations of the Council should be placed in the hands of a public accountant, as was the previous practice
      </para>
      <para>
       CLC Structure and Organisation-a Management Consultant should be engaged to examine all aspects of Council functions and operations and to advise on appropriate changes of staffing structure and organisation and the securing of appropriate staff as well as appropriate methods of control of finances and assets. I would hope that the effect of these moves will be the setting up of a strong and appropriate Land Council staff able to cope with the heavy workload with which the Council will be faced in the next few years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Concerning the loss of moneys and any over-expenditure of items within the budget, I must advise you that I expect the Council to adjust its budget to live within the overall amount approved for 1980-81 without any carry-forward into 1981-1982 of excessive financial commitments. It will also be necessary for the Council to eliminate its overdraft at the earliest opportunity. I cannot give any commitment that additional finance will be available to meet deficits resulting from the Council's mismanagement of its affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that Mr Bill Gay is to meet with you in the week commencing February 2 and I have asked him to discuss with you and your officers the implementation of these and any other urgent corrective measures which might be appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is unfortunate that these problems should have come to a head at the beginning of your term as Chairman but I hope you will agree with my own view that it is an opportunity for the Council to make a fresh start and hopefully to emerge as a stronger organisation able to cope successfully with the very demanding role expected of it.

       Dear Mr Yunupingu
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to your letter of 24 June 1986 concerning the proposed inspection and audit of the accounts and records of the Northern Land Council (NLC) pursuant to s. 38 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (the Act).
      </para>
      <para>
       You wrote two other letters of the same date requesting access to certain documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and a Statement of Reasons pursuant to s. 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The former request has been transferred to my Department for action and my Senior Private Secretary has replied to you in respect of the latter correspondence.
      </para>
      <para>
       Complaints concerning the operations of the NLC have not only been made to me but also the Northern Territory Ombudsman. Given the nature of the allegations made I have decided that the most appropriate course of action is for me to exercise my authority pursuant to s. 38 (1) of the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Pursuant to s. 38 (2) I now inform you that I have engaged Mr Des Linehan, being a person having the prescribed qualifications, to inspect and audit the accounts and records caused to be kept by the NLC pursuant to s. 37 of the Act and to furnish to me a report of the results of that inspection and audit drawing attention to any irregularity in the financial affairs of the NLC disclosed by the inspection and audit.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Linehan will commence his review with an initial trip to Darwin on the 28th of July. I have suggested to Mr Linehan that it is appropriate that his first contact at the commencement of the review be with yourself. To this end I would appreciate you making yourself available to meet with Mr Linehan on the morning of 29 July.

       I believe that with your assistance and with the co-operation of your staff the review can proceed in an orderly and expeditious manner.

        —The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No trust funds have been established under section 35 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (the Act) by any of the Aboriginal Land Councils since the Act was amended in 1987 by the addition of subsection 35 (8) which requires Land Councils to hold in trust certain moneys paid under section 35 of the Act. Before this time, the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council each established one royalty trust account to receive payments under section 35 of the Act. These trust accounts now fulfil the purposes of subsection 35 (8). The Central Land Council had also before this time established the Iwupataka Aboriginal Land Trust Account which receives and disburses moneys in connection with the lease of the Standley Chasm tourist operation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Tiwi Land Council has established no trust funds, as it makes section 35 payments directly to incorporated Aboriginal communities or groups at the time those moneys become available for distribution.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The accounts and records of the Aboriginal Land Councils, including the Royalty Trust Accounts, are audited annually by auditors appointed by the Land Councils under sub-section 37a (2) of the Act. In 1986 my predecessor, the Hon. Clyde Holding engaged Mr Des Linehan under section 38 of the Act to undertake an audit of the Northern Land Council's accounts and records. The Northern Land Council's Royalty Trust Account was audited at that time. In 1981, Senator the Hon. Peter Baume, then Minister, engaged the Auditor-General under section 38 to undertake an audit of the accounts and records of the Central Land Council. The Central Land Council's Royalty Trust Account was not established at that time.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The feasibility study is scheduled for completion on 31 March 1990 when a report from the MFP Joint Steering Committee will be submitted to the Australian and Japanese Governments. The consultancy study currently being undertaken by the Arthur Andersen/Kinhill Group will be completed on 22 December 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) An `MFP concept' has been developed which encapsulates a number of themes and business areas consistent with the objectives of Australia and Japan. In brief, the concept involves a modern, high quality, urban environment incorporating state-of-the-art infrastructure. This would be linked to a number of core industries where Australia is likely to be internationally competitive in the latter 1990s and the 21st century. The sectors which are likely to form the core of an MFP include education, information and telecommunications, health, environment and agriculture, construction and design, and advanced transport services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The concept is being further refined through a program of market testing, an examination of spatial and site considerations, and by studies of the commercial viability of identified industry opportunities. Potential investors will be canvassed on the factors considered essential to make the MFP an attractive investment proposition.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The MFP Joint Secretariat is currently considering draft proposals from interested State and Territory Governments which relate the likely locational requirements of an MFP to specific regions throughout Australia. At present, the spatial form of the MFP has not been limited beyond the following possibilities:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) a single `core' site within a major metropolitan region complemented by one or more specialised, satellite centres located elsewhere in Australia;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) multiple sites in a single major metropolitan region; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) single sites spread either across two or three separate major metropolitan regions or, alternatively, within one medium-sized, urban region (eg. Adelaide, Perth/Fremantle, Canberra/Goulburn, or Brisbane/Gold Coast).
      </para>
      <para>
       By 31 October 1989, specific physical configurations and potential sites for the MFP will have been identified, considered and ranked.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) A site (or sites) for the MFP cannot be named before the feasibility study is completed and the Governments of Australia and Japan receive the Joint Steering Committee's report. In that report, site proposals will be ranked according to their specific spatial and site characteristics.
      </para>
      <para>
       The MFP feasibility study is a joint project between Australia and Japan, and has been funded by the private and public sectors in both countries. All parties involved in the project have agreed to the work program which is currently being pursued and fully support its completion by 31 March 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The environmental theme contained in the draft MFP concept is one of a number of areas of potential commercial opportunity identified by the feasibility study consultant. This is supported by analysis undertaken by a series of `think-tanks' convened by MFP Australia Research Ltd, the company through which the Australian business community is contributing to the MFP feasibility study. More generally, the Australian and Japanese Domestic Committees agreed in May this year that environmental management should be a central aspect of the MFP project. If pursued, the MFP's environmental focus could demonstrate the type of environmental safeguards appropriate to forms of urban development in the 21st century.

This undertaking required each of the six (6) to institute a claim for compensation under the Workers' Compensation Ordinance 1951 (as amended) against Hans Schmidt. In the event of the satisfaction of such claims and the successful recovery of compensation, the undertaking obliges each of the six to reimburse PHCA the full amount paid by way of compensation.
