       Interest Rates
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.
      </para>
      <para>
       And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

      </para>

       3. They know the flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.

      <para>
       4. they recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism.

       Importation of Tropical Timber

       <para>
        This Bill proposes to amend the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act 1986 and the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act 1985, to give effect to Government decisions announced in the economic statement of 12 April 1989. The intent of the proposed amendments is both to terminate subsidy schemes as from 12 April 1989 and to broaden the eligibility for assistance under the Grain Harvesters and Equipment Act to include harvesters and harvester equipment held in stock as at 12 April 1989, similar to provisions which apply to the cultivation machines and equipment scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        As outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the April economic statement, the Government is determined to ensure that fiscal policy is kept tight in order to maintain downward pressure on Australia's trade deficit. To that end, the Government has decided to implement a number of savings measures which will be incorporated in the August 1989 Budget. These savings are intended to offset the cost of the measures announced in the economic statement which will assist families and pensioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of these strong budgetary pressures, the Government considers it would be inappropriate to exempt outlays associated with industry assistance and development. In the Government's view, the most appropriate means of effecting the necessary savings in this area is to terminate the grain harvesting and cultivation equipment assistance schemes. Neither of these schemes has made a contribution commensurate with its cost towards achievement of the Government's policy goal of creating internationally competitive and export oriented Australian industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has put in place a range of positive assistance measures aimed at improving the efficiency and international competitiveness of our manufacturing sector which have been available to the grain harvester and cultivation equipment manufacturing sectors. These include the heavy engineering program, the 150 per cent research and development tax incentives, grants for industrial research and development and a range of extension services through the national industry extension service.

        On Thursday, 9 March 1989, Senator Crichton-Browne addressed the Senate on the Special Audit Report on the Aboriginal Development Commission and Department of Aboriginal Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senator said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the [Aboriginal Affairs] Department did not have in place a program, policy or system which allowed it to assess whether or not the funds were being used for the purpose for which they were intended. It is not without significance to note that in Western Australia, when we had this absolute imbroglio, confusion, chaos, incompetence and, in some cases, corruption, the departmental head was Cedric Wyatt, who for his sins was promoted by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, to the position of General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). At a time of apparent crisis in the ADC, when new, competent and efficient management was needed, it got a personally hand-picked appointment who had reigned over the Department in Western Australia, which the Auditor-General referred to in the report in a most scathing way. I put it down as nothing higher than gross inefficiency and incompetence. (Hansard pp. 788-89)
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senator used the words `incompetence' and `corruption' and I do most vehemently object to my name and reputation being abused in that context. I take great pride in having served the Government of Australia faithfully and enthusiastically in the Public and Armed Services for over 25 years. My present field of employment as a private consultant in government and Aboriginal Affairs depends very much on a sound administrative reputation and moral integrity beyond reproach. I totally reject criticisms of incompetence and, as to allegations of corruption, I am most distressed that an ordinary citizen as myself, and I do unequivocally reject such accusation, should be slandered in this way in such an honourable institution as the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Aboriginal leaders, myself included, cannot be expected to right the wrongs of colonial maladministration of Aboriginal people in a short period of time. Aboriginal communities, some of them still very tribal, cannot be expected to become proficient in commercial operations overnight. As a senior public servant I could see and clearly understand these difficulties, and exercises in liberality on my part should not be slandered as `incompetence' and `corruption' in the Senate.

         —The Senate now has before it the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. This is essentially a machinery Bill and makes a number of minor amendments to quite a variety of Acts which fall within the portfolio of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and which relate to legislation as it affects external territories of Australia, about which my colleague, Senator Boswell, will speak, and the Australian Capital Territory.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The purposes of the legislation may be summarised as follows: First, to allow the Australian Film Commission, the National Museum of Australian and the Australian Heritage Commission to conduct formal meetings by telephone or video conference; secondly, to permit the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum to invest moneys, although only in those areas currently provided for in their respective pieces of legislation, without having to seek approval of the Minister for each specified investment; thirdly, to reduce membership of the Council of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School from 15 persons to nine; fourthly, to clarify aspects of the operation of the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 to remove duplications arising from the current need to obtain both the Federal and the State permit for dumping, so that approved State permit systems will be sufficient within State coastal waters, and to make substantial increases-in some cases of up to $250,000-for unauthorised dumping of wastes, especially hazardous wastes, at sea; and, finally, in the arts and environment area, to amend the Sea Installations Act 1987 to improve its operation in a number of technical aspects regarding permits and environmental impact statement procedures and to provide for representation of Norfolk Island in appropriate meetings.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, the Bill also has some relevance to the portfolio area of external Territories and the Australian Capital Territory where it provides a mechanism for dealing with the collection of fines from people who failed to vote at ACT elections-a new system which might be regarded as on the spot fines for non-voting in the Australian Capital Territory. The Opposition has no objection to any of the provisions of this Bill, although I want to make a few brief comments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is pleased to see that bodies such as the Australian Film Commission, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission are catching up with the modern technology which is available to allow conference meetings to be held by use of telephone or video. That is a very useful amendment to the legislation because it will ensure that, where these bodies have representation drawn from around Australia, they will be able to participate in necessary meetings without the requirement for all parties to be physically in the same place at the same time, which presumably means a cost saving may be effected. Secondly, we are glad to see the increased financial flexibility extended to the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum of Australia to invest moneys in approved areas without having to seek the approval of the Minister for each specified investment. It is interesting that the upper limit of the investment varies quite considerably between these institutions. For example, the upper limit for the Australia Council's investment without ministerial approval is $50,000; for the Australian Film Commission, it is $250,000; for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the sum is $50,000; for the Australian National Gallery, the amount is $100,000; and, for the National Museum of Australia, it is $100,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is certainly very supportive of the amendments made to increase the penalties provided under the Environmental Protection (Sea Dumping) Act to ensure that people who are responsible for the dumping of wastes at sea in an improper and unauthorised manner are now faced with potential fines of up to $250,000. There is a worldwide concern manifest equally in Australia that the protection of the sea is becoming a more important item on the environmental agenda. Fines should be realistic and should sufficiently deter individuals and companies from undertaking such irresponsible activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments to the Sea Installations Act will improve its operations in a number of technical aspects, particularly regarding the issue of permits and EIS procedures, and will provide representation for Norfolk Island in appropriate circumstances.
       </para>

        I turn to the matter of the reduction of the membership of the Council of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School from 15 to nine. We have no objection to that action but this is an opportunity to put on record one of the more extraordinary incidents revealed by Estimates Committee investigation into the financial priorities of the Government and the question of cost efficiency of Government operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a meeting of Estimates Committee D on 13 April 1989, I had the chance to examine the accounts and the forward estimates of the Film, Television and Radio School and to ask questions of its Director, Mr O'Hara. In effect, the Film, Television and Radio School came to the Parliament and asked for an additional $16,000 for a staff position. When one examined what that $16,000 was for, it was found to be for the collection of fees under the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act. In the Estimates Committee hearing, I asked Mr O'Hara the following question:
       </para>
       <para>
        You are requesting $16,000 to meet costs associated with the collection of fees, under the Higher Education Funding Act. Would you explain that to me. Is that $16,000 which you are requiring in order to collect fees?
       </para>
       <para>
        The transcript continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr O'Hara-I think it is $12,000 that we are requesting for the collection of HECS, and $4,000 which is an adjustment to expense allowances for the chairman and the director. The $12,000 for the collection of fees is basically to provide for some administrative assistance and some PC support to enable us to collect the fees for our 40 students who are subjected to those fees. I understand that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has made some $1.5m available to tertiary institutions but, of course, we are not in a position to benefit from that.

       <para>
        That is, in fact, the correct assessment of the position. The Film Television and Radio School has come to the Parliament and asked it to appropriate $12,000 to pay an officer to collect $3,000 per year. If the Government were to run the whole of its operations on the basis that, in order to collect $3,000 one spends $12,000, the sort of economic management that it is indulging in at the moment would appear actually to be sophisticated by comparison. It is absolutely ludicrous to have an area within the arts portfolio, as pressed for money as that portfolio is at the moment, asking for an appropriation from the Parliament of $12,000 in order to collect $3,000 per year from two students. But that is what the Parliament has been asked to provide. It is ludicrous in the extreme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only is there the question of whether organisations such as the Film, Television and Radio School and the various other bodies within the arts portfolio, such as the National Institute of Dramatic Art and similar institutions, should be required to enforce the payment of this levy by their students; there is also the question of why they do not have access to some of the $1.5m that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has made available to other tertiary institutions. I put it to the Minister, who, I am sure, will recognise the ludicrous nature of this proposition in having to fund an institution, that the provision of an extra $12,000-money which that institution could well use in any number of genuinely productive areas of its undertaking-in order to collect $1,800-a-year fees from two of its students, yielding the Commonwealth a net loss on the transaction of $9,000, really does seem to be unbelievably stupid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, as I said in opening, this is a machinery piece of legislation. The Opposition certainly has no difficulty with any of the specific provisions. As I have said, my colleague Senator Boswell will be making some comments about the external territories aspect of the legislation. I conclude, therefore, on behalf of my other colleague Senator Hill, who has responsibility as shadow Minister for the Australian Capital Territory, by saying simply that we believe that there is some merit in the provision for the collection of on the spot fines from people who fail to vote under the required legislation in the Australian Capital Territory. We have no difficulties with the amendments which are being made to Territory legislation in that regard. I do not believe that it is necessary to detain the Senate any further on this piece of legislation.

I would like to address my attention to the amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 which, as Senator Puplick has said, will make it easier for those who have not voted to pay a penalty-in this case $20-directly to the Electoral Commissioner without having to go through the courts. I can see why, in the last ACT election, some people might not have wanted to vote. It was certainly run under a very strange voting system which really did not please anybody.

        I would like to see, as an amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act, a change in the voting system itself. If we purport to have a democracy in Australia, I think it behoves us to use electoral systems which will reflect the will of the people. The d'Hondt electoral system simply does not. Everybody agrees that the d'Hondt system is a disaster. What should we have in place of it?

         —As my colleague from Tasmania has said, the Hare-Clark system-the Tasmanian system which is also used in Ireland. The Government Whip, Senator McKiernan, who does not have his green tie on today, is acknowledging the fact that it is used in Ireland. That system is also used in other well advanced civilisations around the world. That system ensures that everybody has a voice. Under the present system of first past the post, single member electorates, at any one time half the electorate is disenfranchised because one party will get its member in and the other party or parties will not. Therefore, only about 50 per cent of the people are represented. In the Hare-Clark system, which, as I said, is used in Tasmania, each electorate has seven seats which means that there is a good chance that all shades of political persuasions will be represented, as is the case in the Senate. The Hare-Clark system, in a modified form, works in the Senate. It allows for the independents, the Democrats, the National Party of Australia, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party to have a voice. I think that is a healthy situation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is another variation in Tasmania, that most progressive of States, which I think is very valuable and should be examined-that is, the Robson amendment brought in by Neil Robson, a Liberal member of the legislature. Under this system, the names on the ballot are rotated. The Australian Electoral Commission has no difficulty with this. The ballot papers are printed in such a way that everyone on a party list has the opportunity of being at the top of the ballot paper one-seventh of the time. This eliminates, to a great extent, the donkey vote; it also eliminates party factions stacking the ballot. In fact, it gives people a better chance of electing the representatives they wish.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I urge the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, who is seated in the chamber-I am sure that he is taking all this in with great attention, and he is nodding his head in agreement-to take all this on board because I am sure that he is a man who wants the people of Australia to have the best possible representation. The implementation in the Australian Capital Territory of the Hare-Clark system which is employed in Tasmania, with the Robson amendment, would ensure that more people would be pleased to vote. They would not have to be driven to the polls by the threat of fines.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it would be a very good thing for the Government if it allowed the people of the ACT to vote upon this very system. The Government should allow the people of the ACT to have a referendum to see whether they favour the proportional representation system which is used in Tasmania. If the Government were fair dinkum about democracy it would have a referendum and perhaps give the people of the ACT the choice of the single-member electorate system as used in New South Wales or the multi-member electorate system as used in Tasmania. Let the people choose. I think that the people of the ACT, being an intelligent group of voters, would choose the Tasmanian system. I challenge the Government to give the people of the ACT the chance to choose their own form of electoral system and not have to suffer, like camels, the d'Hondt system which nobody wants. I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to these thoughts. I am sure that they will be thoughtful. Having said that, I indicate that the Australian Democrats will support the Bill.

         —I rise to support the comments of my colleague Senator Puplick and also to support the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. I would like to make some comments on the parts of the Bill that refer to the territories.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill firstly amends the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 and the Supreme Court Ordinance 1955 of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to restore criminal trials by jury in the courts of this Territory. The Bill provides for a court to move the venue of a criminal trial on indictment from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to another State or Territory where necessary and for jurors to be summoned at the new venue using the States' jury lists. These provisions are essentially the same as those introduced into the Christmas Islands Act 1958 by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1987 following a farcical attempt to conduct a murder trial on Christmas Island.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Cocos (Keeling) Islanders, with whom we have made contact, have no disagreement with the Bill. But they did go to the trouble to point out that the population of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is very small and that they had some concerns. If a trial were held there it would make things very difficult because everyone is related and everyone knows each other. Whilst they had no objection to the Bill, they requested, if ever there was an occasion on which a trial was needed, that the trial be held in another State. This is because of the problem that they would have in arranging a jury with no connections to any of the people there. While this Bill allows for that, I wanted to have their concerns put on record. It is interesting to note that there has never been a criminal trial on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, so I have been informed. Let us hope that the people there can maintain such a good record.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation also amends the Sea Installation Act 1987 to provide that a representative of the Norfolk Island Government is included in discussions concerning the granting of permission and exemptions under the Act in the waters off Norfolk Island. This is very important. The Norfolk Islanders, of course, appreciate that they will now have a voice on that board. They have no objections to the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other areas that I want to touch on refer to the Government's administration of Christmas Island-I know that Senator McKiernan is very interested in this-and particularly the decision-making process it initiated to select a successor to the mining operation. The recent Federal Court judgment on the bid to have the Government's decision on a successor phosphate operator reviewed provided an independent comment. Although this challenge failed on legal grounds, the court's judgment was damning on the Territory's bureaucracy, the former Minister, Mr Punch, and the whole decision-making process. In short, Mr Justice French found that successive Ministers and their advisers were not above criticism. He found that the decision making process on the successor operator had been essentially political and the assessment's characterisation very similar to the fictitious Sir Humphrey Appleby on the program Yes, Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Might I say that the new Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding) seems to be at least trying to halt the malaise which infected the administration of Christmas Island during the period in office of his predecessors, Mr John Brown and Mr Punch. During this time the Territory's bureaucracy pursued its own agenda for Christmas Island. I believe that Mr Brown, as Minister, was more interested in tourism and other parts of his portfolio than the Territories.
       </para>
       <para>
        What makes the Federal Court's criticism of Mr Punch even more damning is that throughout his period as responsible Minister the Opposition constantly advised him about what he should be doing and where his Department was misinforming him. The prime example of this was the so-called independent assessment of mining proposals by the liquidator of the Government's phosphate mining corporation, Mr Robert Yeomans. At the time of Mr Yeomans's appointment, the Opposition advised Mr Punch that the assessment should have been conducted by private consultants. Mr Braithwaite warned that there may be problems with Mr Yeomans's suitability and that should any such problems emerge Mr Punch could not say that he had not been warned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now wish to detail certain facts which should convince the new Minister and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), the Ministers responsible, that they have to keep an eye on the happenings on Christmas Island. In May 1988 the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories received advice from the Attorney-General's Department that Mr Yeomans could determine which of several proposals would provide the highest return on the assets of the Phosphate Mining Christmas Island Corporation but could not undertake a broad assessment to determine its commercial viability, except in so far as such matters may affect the capacity of a potential purchaser to pay or otherwise affect the winding up of the Corporation. In fact, Mr Yeomans's duties as assessor were not dissimilar to his duties as liquidator, that is, to achieve the highest return on the Corporation's assets.
       </para>
       <para>
        After noting the proposal from the Booth Consortium and Elders Resources Ltd, both offered net payments of $500,000. Mr Yeomans stated that the Booth proposal offered slightly higher royalty payments. It follows that Mr Yeomans failed to follow the advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). He then proceeded to justify his recommendation of Elders by saying that its proposal was superior in a range of areas, all of which went to issues broader than the price and, therefore, deviated from the parameters set out in the advice of the Attorney-General. This is not a case of just a slight difference in royalty returns. I have been supplied with figures which show that under the worst case royalty payments from the Booth Consortium would amount to $11.74m, whereas under Elders' best case the Commonwealth would receive between $6.93m and $11.52m, depending on which option is used. This was because Elders' royalty proposal was a flat $1.70 per tonne for 10 years, whereas the Booth Consortium offer was a 5 per cent rate based on its selling price per tonne shipped.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the Estimates Committee hearings I asked the Department if Mr Yeomans ever tried to get Elders to change its flat rate royalty proposal in an effort to negotiate a selling price figure and, if so, when. In other words, I asked: Did Mr Yeomans ever try to get Elders to change its offer to make it more like the Booth offer? The answer I received was, `Yes, departmental officers had been present at a number of meetings called by the liquidator and attended by Elders at which the flat rate royalty was discussed with a view to negotiating a system of indexed royalties'. All in all there were seven meetings, the first following hard on the heels of the announcement of Mr Yeomans's recommendation that the Government commence negotiation with Elders.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter I wish to examine is the answer to a question I placed on notice about this matter. On 7 April 1989 I asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and Territories the following question:
       </para>
       <para>
        Did the liquidator: (a) recommend that proposal which would best maximise returns to the Commonwealth through both net payment and royalties; if not, why not; and (b) take into account matters extraneous to the parameters set out in the Attorney-General Department's advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson supplied the following answer:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Liquidator recommended that proposal which would best maximise returns to the Commonwealth through both net payments and royalties, but was not concerned with such matters as the economic or social development of the Territory, . . . except in terms of Mr Punch's request to the liquidator with respect to consideration of various matters, and in so far as such matters may have affected the capacity of a potential purchaser to pay the Liquidator under the proposed arrangements for the sale of the Corporation's assets. This is regarded as being in accord with the advice given by A-G's on 12 May 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, contrary to the Attorney-General's advice, Mr Yeomans did not accept the proposal which would maximise returns to the Commonwealth.

        I would also like to touch on another matter affecting the territories, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands floating hotel. The proposed $37.5m hotel could generate up to $20m a year for the local community including $14m in wages and $6m in purchases from the local cooperative. As many as 90 Cocos (Keeling) Islanders could be employed. The 20,000-tonne floating hotel would accommodate 200 people and would comprise a restaurant and food outlets, a conference room and entertainment areas. It seems to me that tourism offers the best prospect for underpinning the Cocos economy. This proposal offers really the only meaningful employment on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands; yet it has taken the Minister up to nine months to reply to a detailed notice of intention which was requested from the proponent of the Cocos Island resorts. The proponent was then told that the environmental assessment branch of the Department considered it should recommend to the Minister that it conduct a full environmental impact study. Yet another commercial hotel has been allowed to be established on Direction Island, part of the Cocos (Keeling) group. I suggest to the Minister that if he really wants to help the Cocos Island economy he should look at ways of developing tourism. Procrastination and stalling will not get any hotels or those types of developments on those islands. It is costing the developers many hundreds of thousands of dollars to put up these proposals. Senator Richardson, as the responsible Minister, and his junior Minister are not helping the situation at all by procrastinating and not giving firm guidelines for these developments to go ahead.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are now talking about the future of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. For example-I take these figures off the top of my head-I believe that the population has now been reduced from 2,000 to around 500 or 600 people. As an Opposition, we have a responsibility to point these things out to the Government. These territories have been given to us under world forums and we are responsible for ensuring that the living standards of these people are maintained. We are also responsible for providing jobs for the people. The continual procrastination in not letting these developments go ahead is causing a great deal of concern.

       <para>
        While I am on the subject of external territories, I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to members of the Norfolk Island Administration for their hospitality during my recent visit to Norfolk Island over Easter. Norfolk Island is an absolute utopia; it is a subtropical paradise. I certainly enjoyed my stay but, more to the point, I went there to listen to the people's concerns. I put on record that they are proud to be a Territory of Australia, but they see themselves as Norfolk Islanders and they want the responsibility of running that island. They are concerned that there is an ever-increasing intrusion by Commonwealth Government departments inflicting on these people laws and orders that are appropriate to Australia. Norfolk Island has a very small community. Only about 3,000 permanent residents live on the island. They pay no income tax and there are no telephone charges or rates and taxes. It is an absolute utopia. There is no unemployment on Norfolk Island. People are brought in from Australia to fill the jobs. The Norfolk Islanders are certainly concerned about the intrusion of the legislation that is being passed by both Houses of the Australian Parliament and inflicted on their territory.

        The Minister should take note of the concerns of the Norfolk Island people. They do look after their own. There is no unemployment benefit as there is no unemployment. If there is likely to be unemployment the numbers of people who are brought in to do the jobs are reduced. An extended family looks after all personal problems and any contingencies. Most of the islanders are descendants of the Pitcairn Island people, predominantly the Christians, the Adams, the McCoys and the Nobbs. Once again I express my thanks to the Norfolk Island people. I believe that they are coming up to an election, possibly even this Saturday. I urge the Minister at the table to take note of their concerns about the ever increasing intrusion of the Australian Government on their Territory.

         —in reply-In looking at the contributions this morning, it is pleasing to note that Opposition and Australian Democrat senators support the Bill. I would like to answer a number of the points made, in particular those made by Senator Boswell.

        Senator Sanders referred to the Australian Capital Territory election, to the d'Hondt system and to his faith in the Hare-Clark system. It has always been my experience in politics to expect people to support systems which have elected them. The Hare-Clark system has not been unkind to Senator Sanders in the past. I can understand why he would wish to see that system spread, particularly now that he is seeking new directions in his career in territories very close to this Parliament. We have seen a reference to a parliamentary committee on the Australian Capital Territory election. Like other senators I anxiously await the results of that committee's deliberations.

       <para>
        I turn now to Senator Boswell and his reference to the Christmas Island mining proposal. In a question in the Senate only a few days ago I was asked by Senator Boswell whether or not an unsuccessful tenderer offered 30 per cent more, I think, in royalties than did the successful tenderer so that returns to the Commonwealth were not being maximised. I forget the words of the honourable senator's question, but it was along those lines. Today the honourable senator has said something similar. Let me go into some detail of these matters and what has been supplied to me. I will not comment on the court case, on who did what to whom. Given that there will be an appeal shortly, those matters are sub judice and I do not wish to canvass them now. I will do so at a later time if the honourable senator wishes me to. Given his interest in the matter, I think it would be appropriate if I went through the details.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal accepted by the Commonwealth maximises returns to the Commonwealth, both through net payments for assets and for royalties. Tenders for the privatisation of the Phosphate Mining Corporation of Christmas Island were assessed by the liquidator of the Corporation, Mr Yeomans, a chartered accountant and professional liquidator with the Duesburys organisation. Mr Yeomans recommended that the Minister give him approval in principle to negotiate with Elders Resources Ltd for the recommencement of mining. He also recommended that if, for any reason, negotiations were not satisfactorily concluded with Elders, they could be instituted with Mr John Booth, who submitted a tender on behalf of a consortium. There was also a third tenderer, Century Metals and Mining, again a consortium with some other interests.

         —And Islanders, yes. The liquidator noted in his conclusions that the Elders proposal was superior both to Century and Booth in respect of financial resources, production and technical expertise, mainland support bases, research and development and quality of submission. In effect, he concluded that Elders was a major Australian public resources company and that it had the expertise and the back-up to deliver on its tender. That conclusion was consistent with the advice of the Attorney-General's Department to which Senator Boswell referred.

         —I do not think we are necessarily disputing that. I suppose it is a question of looking at who could best deliver. In the end, one always has to decide on a tender. The advice of the Attorney-General's Department of 12 May 1988, to which Senator Boswell referred, was that the liquidator should not be concerned with viability of proposals except in so far as such matters may have affected the capacity of a potential purchaser to pay the liquidator under proposed arrangements for the sale of the Corporation's assets.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The liquidator in the conclusions to his report also noted that both the Elders and Booth proposals provided for the same net payment to the liquidator for the assets of the Corporation. On the issue of royalties, he concluded the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        Payment by Elders of royalties of $1.70 per tonne shipped, exceeds the offer contained in the Century proposal and compares favourably with the Booth proposal which, however, does offer slightly higher royalty payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        But as well as the $1.70 per tonne Elders provided, as spelt out in its tender, there was $1 per tonne to be used for rehabilitation of previously mined areas. That makes the payment of the Commonwealth for future mining equivalent to $2.70 per tonne with some 37 per cent of that being spent on the island's environment. The remainder would be available for capital works and other infrastructure upgrading on the island. The $2.70 per tonne is equivalent to about 6.5 per cent of the current phosphate price. That compares more than favourably with the 5 per cent, which was included in the Booth offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        In negotiations with Elders it has also been agreed that the $2.70 will be indexed. The liquidator, my Department and the Attorney-General's Department have been negotiating leases and a contract of sale with Elders. Elders, in turn, have been negotiating with the union of Christmas Island workers on the workers' equity participation in the mine as well as on award conditions. I understand that negotiations between the Christmas Island workers and Elders have been proceeding well. Our information is that those negotiations will very shortly be satisfactorily concluded.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for the Arts and Territories, Mr Holding, will be visiting the island to finalise some of these arrangements and to talk with Christmas Island workers. I think that process will occur within the next couple of weeks. When one takes into account not just the $1.70 per tonne but the extra dollar, then I think one would have to conclude that returns to the Commonwealth have been maximised. As I said in the Senate the other day in my answer to Senator Boswell's question, we saw no reason to regret the decision that Mr Yeomans had made some time ago. I have not changed my mind since I answered Senator Boswell's question a couple of days ago. I hope what I have just revealed does something to allay the honourable senator's fears in that respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable senator also mentioned the Cocos (Keeling) Islands floating hotel proposal. I agree with the honourable senator that the future of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands will no doubt rest on tourism. We need to ensure that we do all we can to bring about more tourist activity there. Naturally enough, given the environment of the area and its relatively untouched state, we do need to be careful. I do not have a briefing on that issue with me at the moment. I have checked on this matter in the last couple of weeks, and my recollection was that the Commonwealth has asked for some information of the developer of that floating hotel quite some months ago. Up until the last time I checked, we had not received a reply. We are still awaiting information from the developer before we proceed. From memory-I will check and get back to the honourable senator-I believe it is a matter of my making a decision on the environmental impact statement process and how far we want to go along that track. As I said, the Department has asked for more information from the developer before we make a final decision. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         —I want to make some comments about penalties as they relate to the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981. It is a good move to increase the penalties for sea dumping. However, I urge the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, to take a good look at an issue in my home State of Tasmania. As I understand it, the dumping of jarosite wastes off the edge of the Continental Shelf by the zinc works in Hobart is in violation of an international treaty. This has been going on for years. When I was a TDT television reporter in the mid-1970s, I did a number of stories on the dumping of this waste.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Vast quantities of jarosite, which contains cadmium, lead, zinc and mercury, is dumped south of Tasmania, ironically in the waters where the Japanese come to fish for tuna which they feel are free of pollution. In fact, these waters are presently being polluted with the very same types of minerals-for example, mercury-which caused so much danger in Minimata Bay, Japan. Yet this goes on day after day, year after year.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I was in the State Parliament, a number of people came to me with statements that this material was not even being dumped as far off-shore as the Continental Shelf. It was being dumped closer in to Tasmanian waters. We were never able to prove this although a number of very expert people maintained that this was so. But the fact remains that the Anson is still dumping this jarosite waste off the coast. This is a very sensitive political problem in Tasmania because the zinc works is a major employer of people in the Hobart area. As we all know, Tasmania, until recently at least, has not paid much attention to any environmental pollution control laws. It has recently moved to clean up the Derwent River, but it has done nothing about the jarosite waste being dumped off the Tasmanian coast.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fishermen and environmentalists are concerned. Greenpeace is so concerned that it may be forced to take direct action. I urge the Minister to take a good look at this matter because I am sure that, since it is in violation of an international treaty, the Federal Government could and should have an involvement. I draw this to the Minister's attention and urge him to take action, as I know he is interested in the well-being of the environment, to protect the Tasmanian fisheries and the Tasmanian environment generally by examining the operations of the jarosite dumping vessel, the Anson.

         —It is my pleasure to lead the debate for the Opposition on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. In doing so, I would like to explain some of the amendments that the Opposition intends to move. This omnibus Bill seeks to amend the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952, the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988, the Broadcasting Act 1942, the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and the Telecommunications Act 1975.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Air Navigation (Charges) Act provides for the payment of charges in respect of the use of aircraft at Commonwealth aerodromes or aerodromes for which financial assistance is provided by the Commonwealth. Most importantly, the Act also provides for the payment of penalties if charges are not paid within 28 days. The legislation seeks to repeal certain provisions in the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Centennial Roads Development Act provides for the funding for a program of financial assistance for land transport, in succession to earlier statutory schemes. My colleague Senator Lewis will speak on the changes to the Broadcasting Act 1942. It is proposed to amend section 89d of the Broadcasting Act, to remedy an oversight in the preparation of provisions in the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988. The Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 provides for the operation of the Federal interstate registration scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is proposed to amend the Telecommunications Act 1975 to allow Telecom to validate a number of routine zonal and telex charges which have been inadvertently implemented without by-law authorisation. These charges will be implemented retrospectively. It really is a hotchpotch of a Bill. The Government has brought forward the legislation in this format obviously with a view to saving precious time. But I intend to take my full time in bringing forward to the Senate one or two matters. I want to refer particularly to road funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is certainly our intention to bring forward a number of key amendments which we believe correct anomalies in the Bill. Essentially, these amendments relate to the provision of more than the current 4.95c per litre excise duty on fuel that is put towards road funding. They seek to make changes in respect of aviation because we quite rightly believe that the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority should be required to operate with the same standard of efficiency and cost minimisation that they expect of the public. They also address the hypocrisy of this Government in bringing forward retrospective legislation to cover up for a bureaucratic error.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is appropriate for us to consider the deplorable situation which exists within the Australian road network. On only Monday of this week I heard one of the most astonishing statements I have ever heard in my short time here. The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that anyone who is reasonably familiar with roads around Australia would know that the condition of the roads has never been better than it is now.
       </para>
       <para>
        This statement will surely go down as one of the most ridiculous statements ever made by a Minister in this place. I place on record a challenge to Senator Walsh to get in his chauffeur-driven limousine and drive around some of the rural areas of Australia. If he does, he will hear a resounding cry from those who are sick and tired of putting up with substandard roads. He will hear, as I have heard on my travels around Australia from time to time, particularly from local governments, that they are sick and tired of these roads.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Municipal Association of Victoria recently spent quite considerable amounts of money on finding out what the situation of its road system is. It is shocking to have to report that some of the councils in the north-east of Victoria are considering pulling up their sealed roads because they cannot afford to maintain them. The condition of our road network is a national disgrace and any government which allows matters to deteriorate to the present level should hang its head in shame. I have no doubt that, during the debate on this Bill, we will be hearing a lot of huffing and puffing from Government senators on the merits of their road policy.

         —He is obviously still getting over yesterday's problems. There is one fact which cannot be denied: today, under this Labor Government, road funding stands at $1.215 billion and, when the Labor Government came to office in 1983, the figure stood at $1.250 billion. The reality is evident. In real dollar terms, the level of road funding has been deteriorating to the tune of 30 to 40 per cent and, in actual dollar terms, has dropped by approximately $450m in six years.

        Before I came to this place I was involved in local government in Tasmania, as some honourable senators will know. I am fortunate to have contacts in local government around Australia. As I said previously, from talking to those bodies, particularly the Australian local government associations, it has become very clear to me that there is intense dissatisfaction with the present situation. The fact is-and a lot of people do not realise this-that local governments are now spending at least $100m a year more than State governments and $300m more than the Federal Government on their road systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        If anyone wants further evidence of the feeling in the community about roads, one only has to hear what the nation's motoring organisations are saying. The New South Wales motoring body, the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA), recently completed a report on road safety statistics. The results are alarming, to say the least. The NRMA's research through its Traffic and Safety Department has produced statistics which show that Australia has 2.1 fatalities per 100 million vehicle kilometres travelled compared with 1.5 in the United States of America, 1.7 in Sweden and 1.9 in Great Britain. These results prove that Australian roads are perhaps the most dangerous in the world to travel on; the correlation between road safety and road condition is self-evident.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other resounding message that has been coming through from the motoring organisations is that road funding cut-backs are likely to cost 7,000 lives by the year 2000. This represents 600 people a year between now and the year 2000, and does not even take into account the massive social cost to the community of such unnecessary suffering. I heard Senator Collins say yesterday that in all his time as a member of the St John's Ambulance, waiting on accidents in the Northern Territory, he did not see any evidence of bad roads causing accidents. That may be the case. I do not disbelieve him, but I do not feel that Senator Collins would be getting underneath cars and finding out whether they had broken shock absorbers or tie rod ends.

The theme of the campaign is: `Where are the roads that our petrol taxes pay for?'. That is a very apt question in this debate. It speaks for itself. It suggests that the people of Australia, particularly the motorists, are fed up with the situation, particularly over the last six years. This was highlighted by Mr Fred Watt who recently handed over the reins of the Automobile Association of Australia following three years of very distinguished service as its president. He had this to say in his annual address for 1988:
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly motorists deserve a far better road system in return for the enormous revenue collected from them by the Federal Government through the petrol pump. There is much more at stake, however, than obtaining a fairer deal for motorists.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sub-standard roads are a prominent factor in many crashes. Hazards such as narrow lanes, slippery and broken surfaces, roadside trees and poles, sharp curves, blind corners, soft shoulders and poor signposting contribute to an estimated 30 per cent of all crashes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Badly designed and inadequately maintained roads add considerably to vehicle operating costs. Rough surfaces, for example, can increase repair costs by up to 36 per cent and fuel consumption by up to 20 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Traffic congestion in our major cities is so bad that most motorists spend as much as a third of their time during peak periods standing still. As well as being extremely frustrating, this type of stop/start driving wastes more petrol, imposes extra wear and tear on vehicles and adds to pollution in our cities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Watt had further comments to make regarding the overall effect of the Automobile Association's campaign. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it is not only motorists who stand to gain from improving our roads. This would provide substantial benefits to the entire community as a result of fewer crashes, lower transport costs and greater employment opportunities just to name a few.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, over the years in which the Hawke Labor Government has been in power, most motorists have wasted two weeks of their lives sitting in traffic jams. It is obvious to all concerned that road usage is increasing. By the year 2000, we can expect the number of cars on our roads to go up by approximately 30 per cent and road freight by approximately 60 per cent. One cannot help but wonder what these motorists will face unless there is a drastic turn-round in the present situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        An Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey conducted in 1985 predicted there would be continuing growth in road transport. It found that road transport contributed about $5.4 billion per year of Australia's gross domestic product. Between 1982 and 1985, the cargo hauled on Australia's roads increased by 25 per cent and it is expected that road freight will double by the year 2000. A very significant point in this debate is that the generally accepted life span of roads is around 20 years. More than half of our roads in Australia have now reached that age. One can only ask the question: Who will maintain them and how can the problems be alleviated?

        I return to Senator Walsh's comment on Monday when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that anyone who is reasonably familiar with roads around Australia would know that the condition of the roads has never been better than it is now.
       </para>
       <para>
        All I can say is that Senator Walsh certainly is not familiar with the roads around Australia and obviously a few of his colleagues are not either.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one wanted further evidence of the significance of the conditions of the roads on lives, one only has to listen to what Government Ministers themselves have been saying. One Minister stated that one life a year was saved for each $4m spent on the road building effort. Since this Government came to power, it has cut road funding by approximately $450m. Taking that analysis further, the lack of funding could be said to have cost 110 lives since this Government came to power.

One letter I received was from four very knowledgeable signatories-Professor Peter Scott, the President of the AAA, Mr John Burton, the president of the Australian Bus and Coach Association, Mr Bruce McIver, President of the Australian Livestock Transporters Association, and Mr Peter Rocke, President of the Australian Road Transport Federation. I quote from that letter:

       <para>
        The issue of road funding is becoming increasingly critical to Australia as the consequences of the current Government's cutbacks are becoming more and more apparent. These consequences do not show up in the short term but rather accrue progressively as a result of lower maintenance standards and an inability to increase the capacity of the road system to meet increasing demand. They ultimately produce higher vehicle operating costs, less efficient industries and more road deaths and injuries.
       </para>
       <para>
        So those people, too, believe the claims that are being made by the automobile associations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is in this climate that we are bringing forward an amendment to the Bill on behalf of the coalition, which seeks to ensure that the Government reverses its current trend of cutting road funding, recognises the significance of the problem and returns to the Australian people a better deal than the lousy 4.95c per litre which is presently being spent on roads. Even in 1988 the Government returned 5.66c per litre. So, 22.39c per litre is being thieved from motorists at the petrol pumps, and of the 4.95c being returned, local government, which spends the most on roads, is receiving only one cent per litre.
       </para>
       <para>
        It might also be of interest to honourable senators that it is not only the road users who are being forced to pay these crippling taxes. The projected income from petroleum products excise in 1988-89 is $5.05 billion. In addition to that, the projected income from crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) excise for the same year is something like $1.383 billion-giving a total projected petroleum excise figure for 1988-89 of $6.4 billion. Currently, each one cent excise on motor spirit and non-exempt diesel fuel combined is worth about $230m to the Hawke Government in a full year. I am sure it will be agreed that this situation is motivated simply by greed. Certainly it is causing disquiet in several other sectors of industry, particularly in maritime circles. Why the hell should people who are in fishing or shipping, or are involved in the manufacture of pleasure boats, have to contribute heaps of money? They do not use our roads.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can give a good example. Just recently I made representations on behalf of the Tasmanian Ferry Company, which is going to introduce a very innovative shipping service across Bass Strait, using a wave-piercing catamaran manufactured by Bob Clifford down in Hobart. It has applied to the Government to waive the excise on diesel fuel because it would add $26 to the price of a return trip. The company is paying navigation and wharfage charges; why should it have to pay the excise on diesel fuel? It is not using our roads. The same principle applies to airlines. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, took the excise off aviation fuel because the airlines were not using the roads. The same principle applies to those who are using our waterways. I know that when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was in Hobart he visited Mr Clifford's new yard and made some overtures, but I am not aware of any government commitment in that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another factor which is often overlooked in the road funding rip-off, when considering the value of road funding, is the important multiplier effect. It is estimated that for every $1m spent on roads, about 60 jobs are created. With every $100m spent on roads, unemployment benefits could drop by $38m. The Federal and State governments could also expect to collect something like $16m in extra taxes. This means that for every $100m spent on roads, the net cost to the Government is only $46m. This, of course, does not take into account the advantages that flow to all road users from having improved road networks.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot get away from the situation that one of the principal problems which we have with the taxing arrangements for road funding is that the Hawke Labor Government has chosen to index the excise on petroleum for the first time. This means that the tax is now increasing every six months in line with inflation. With inflation running at a rampant rate, the excise on diesel and petrol, as well as the excise on avgas, has gone up by about one cent in the past six months. At a time when more and more Australians are using our road system, and when the amount of goods being transported is increasing, the proportion of the amount of revenue collected from road users which is being returned to them is less and less. As a result, the amount of money now being spent on roads is decreasing. The money simply goes into Consolidated Revenue, and a fixed rate proportion is taken out. There is no doubt that a better roads system would allow us more adequately to supply the exports that we so badly need to get our balance of trade back into line. This is not just my view. I cite the Government's own Economic Planning Advisory Council, which recently reported that the industry reforms had the potential to take $2 billion a year from Australia's transport bill, boosting gross domestic product by 1.6 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other important factor that we need to consider is the effect of road funding on the efficiency of industry. By that I refer particularly to our primary manufacturing and resource industries. These resource industries are subject to massive costs in the transportation area. We know that much of the transport is by rail, but when we look at our rural areas-the country centres which are the lifeblood of our nation, particularly in recent times-we see that any hope of decentralisation will remain slim until Government is prepared to provide industry with a means of transporting these goods quickly and efficiently between centres.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past six years, the road users have witnessed this Government treating them with contempt. For too long it has been clear that local councils, State governments and users alike are ready to revolt. I know that that is a strong word, but one has only to look at the reactions of all road users throughout the community to realise that the old saying that there are no votes in roads will be reversed at the next Federal election. Some honourable senators may remember the fateful words of the present Treasurer who in opposition proudly proclaimed that every petrol pump was an office for the Australian Taxation Office. By God, is that not true? The Treasurer has really used the petrol pumps to bleed as much as he can out of every motorist in Australia. He has mastered the art of exploitation so far as the Australian road users are concerned. In the simplest possible terms, he has slashed the relativity that used to exist between what was spent and what was collected from road users-from the 66 per cent of excise that was spent on roads in 1983-84 to a measly 23 per cent today. In 1988, the Labor Government spent 5.66c per litre on roads. In 1989, despite the latest jump in the tax rate, we find that it is spending only 4.95c per litre-a cut of $33m. For most of us petrol is not a luxury-it is a necessity. Yet petrol, which is regarded by many industries as a lifeblood, is effectively taxed at a rate of 120 per cent, while luxuries, such as gold, jewellery and diamonds, are taxed at only 30 per cent. Federal Government fuel taxes currently represent about $6.5 billion a year. In contrast, under the Australian centennial roads development (ACRD) legislation expenditure will be only $1.215 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has used a particular formula to bring down the amount that is being paid to governments. The ACRD payments are now indexed by the implicit price deflator, fuel being a non-farm product. It would not come as any surprise to honourable senators present to learn that over the last three years the amount indexed by the implicit price deflator formula has increased by only 8 per cent compared to the (CPI) increase. So it is obvious how we have arrived at this situation on road funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill has, if nothing else, clearly placed on the record the Government's commitment to our roads. How can road users be expected to have any confidence in a government which gives the Minister and the Treasurer such scope to manipulate the level of road funding to suit its own ends?
       </para>
       <para>
        In the brief time remaining to me I draw attention to the first part of the Bill, which deals with the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority. I think it is fair to say that there is considerable concern around Australia about the operation of the Federal Airports Corporation-so much so that, after 18 months of operation, an inquiry is being held into the FAC and the Civil Aviation Authority. The Bill that we are debating is really only stating that charges should be paid to the Government within 28 days, whereas previously it was 45 days. The Government is practising double standards. Some of our pharmacists, who are supposedly receiving their payments from the Government within 30 days, are having trouble getting money out of the Government mostly within 50 or 60 days. The delays are sending a lot of them to the wall. Yet here the Government is penalising those airfield people after 28 days. We will be moving an amendment which we hope will close off that anomaly and revert to the old 45 days, which is only right and fair. The Government does not have the right to impose a standard such as this when it cannot adhere to those sorts of standards itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        In closing, I refer briefly to comments made by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, Mr Bob Brown, in which he sought to cast doubts on our statements about road funding. We said that the Federal Government allocates just 20 per cent of the fuel tax it collects from motorists to roads. Mr Brown and the Government would have us believe that a much greater share is returned to State and local governments for roads. Mr Brown has claimed that these fuel taxes also help the Federal Government to provide untied grants to States and local councils to assist their road programs. Mr Brown has failed to point out-and I am sure that he is acutely aware of this-that that is true only to the extent that the amount of fuel tax that is not allocated to roads is paid into Consolidated Revenue, from which those grants are provided. These grants are untied and may be used for any purpose. The Minister's claim that those grants are spent on roads is a further attempt to dupe the public. They are not necessarily spent on roads at all. We have only to look at the urban transport situation in Sydney, and there are plenty of other examples around Australia of where that is not happening.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, in touting its claims of massive road funding, has conveniently forgotten that it was a previous coalition government that established the Australian bicentennial road development program and that was funded purely by motorists through a levy of 2c a litre on fuel. That money was all returned to roads. Recently we have witnessed a phenomenon which I believe is indicative of the way in which the road debate is heading. In a massive show of dissatisfaction, local councils in the western suburbs of Sydney intend to block the release of home sites until the Federal Government contributes more funding to roads. I suggest that, by doing this, those people in the western suburbs, like the rest of us, are suggesting that they have had enough.

         —The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 which is before us is quite a comprehensive Bill. Most of the items contained in it have been before us previously in one form or another and I will not elaborate on them. I simply say that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the Bill, and I would like to make some basic observations about transport.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Democrats' position is that we ought to take a good hard look at our transportation system and its impact upon our way of life, our environment and our financial situation. Logic would dictate that since most of the population of Australia is concentrated in coastal cities, most goods should be moved by sea between these coastal cities, as was the case when the country was established. The use of ships is environmentally sound. There is no problem with road beds or the maintenance of right of way. Ships can carry large loads with relatively low fuel costs. The waterfront is being reformed. The crewing problems are being resolved. Ships are a viable form of transport which should be encouraged at all times. If, for some reason or another, bulk goods cannot be shipped by sea, the next preferable option should be rail.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the last few decades rail has come into some disfavour. Of course, it was once hailed as the great breakthrough in land transport. Railroads sprang up all over the world and served well to carry goods and passengers between areas. But now roads have captured the political imagination and roads get the funding. But rail is still a very logical way to carry goods and passengers. In fact, it is so logical that we see a resurgence in rail with the very fast train projects and the development of new road beds around the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The highways themselves are being misused mightily by the transport companies that move goods around the country. The trucks, which are increasingly taking over our highways, do not pay their own way; they are subsidised heavily by the taxpayer. They are a double disadvantage for the taxpayer. Firstly, they are a hazard on the roads as there are numerous and increasing accidents between trucks and cars; and secondly, they break the roads down; they actually degrade the roads. In my home state of Tasmania the woodchip trucks are continually being mentioned as the chief hazard to the roads. Unfortunately, the councils which are forced to maintain the roads simply do not get enough in revenue to make up for the damage the trucks cause.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an ironical situation. While the trucks do not pay their way-and the taxpayers of the country are expected to support and subsidise them; in fact, they subsidise all of the transportation system in one way or another-we find that there is full cost recovery in aviation. I have always been interested in finding out-perhaps Senator Gareth Evans can explain this to me when he gets to his feet-why aviation has been singled out as the one service performed in this country which must have full cost recovery. We do not ask the police to have full cost recovery, and our sewerage system does not have full cost recovery. Why should an essential transportation system such as aviation be subject to full cost recovery? I do not see why. Perhaps there is some latent image in the minds of some politicians that only the wealthy can fly or only the wealthy will benefit from aviation, and therefore it should be taxed heavily and made to pay its own way. But in fact, in our modern society, everyone in this country benefits from aviation. Goods are moved by air and passengers travel. It is not something for the wealthy; it is very much part of our basic transportation structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are specifically talking about air navigation charges and landing charges. The previous speaker, Senator Calvert, referred to a Senate examination of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Yes, we are looking at the FAC and the CAA. We received hundreds of submissions about the lack of equity in the system of charging. We heard from a flight operator at Coolangatta airport who takes people for sightseeing tours around the area. Every time he lands and takes off his aeroplane he is forced to pay. A viable commercial operation has been turned into a nightmare. He is up for thousands and thousands of dollars per year simply because he operates a service that takes people up in the air and lands them every 10 minutes or so. He has to pay through the nose. He is not causing any particular damage to the runway. It is just that the Government says, `Here is a guy who we can get some dough off; let's go for it'. This goes on throughout the system. There is a basic attitude, `These are wealthy people; they can pay'. They are not wealthy.
       </para>
       <para>
        With these high charges for aviation, the Government is actually jeopardising the future not only of general aviation but also of the airline industry. Who will train the pilots when the instructors can no longer afford to operate at our airports? Who will train the pilots for the airliners of the future? It is not just rich doctors and lawyers who own their own aeroplanes who will be suffering; the whole country will suffer. I am a former flight instructor and I know that the margins are very slim in a commercial venture such as this. There is not a lot of money to be made. At least 50 per cent of the people in general aviation and in the flight instructing area are there because they love aviation. They want to make it succeed. They love flying. But this Government is making it more and more difficult for them to stay in business.
       </para>
       <para>
        I notice that the Opposition proposes to move an amendment. Opposition senators did not talk to me about their amendment. I have had no contact at all from them. I see that they wish to extend the 28-day payment period to 45 days. Government senators did seek me out to explain their position. They have stated that to extend this time payment period would raise costs and cause bureaucratic difficulties between the FAC, the CAA and the Department of Transport and Communications in the collection of the fees. I certainly do not want to increase the number of bureaucratic person-hours involved in collecting charges because that will increase the cost to aviation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, I have not had any contact with the Opposition. I do not know its reasoning. General aviation will not be involved with this. As I understand it, this is not for avgas-it has nothing to do with flight training and that sort of thing; it is for avtur. If it has any impact at all it will impact on Sir Peter Abeles and Australian Airlines. Frankly, I think they can take care of themselves. I have taken the Government's information on board and it sounds logical. Because this will not affect general aviation, which I feel needs to be protected, the Australian Democrats will not be voting for the amendment to be moved by the Opposition in the Committee of the Whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will conclude my remarks. I restate that the Australian Democrats will be supporting these Bills but we wish that the Government would spend some time on advance planning and the development of a philosophy that will put all forms of transport-ships, rail, road and aircraft-on an equal basis and endeavour to put in place a transportation system that is environmentally sound and also serves the people of this country far better than the present systems are doing.

        The amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 purport to correct an oversight in the scheme for limited licences, which was introduced by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988. It is claimed that the provisions will enable the grant of limited broadcasting licences which involve transmissions from transponders on an Aussat satellite. Limited licences allow streamlined licensing of a range of broadcasting services which, because of restrictions on duration, purpose, content or other aspects, do not raise the same public interest concerns as conventional broadcasting licences. For example, teletext services will be authorised under limited licences. The provisions in this Bill will allow existing remote commercial television service licensees to seek limited licences to broadcast teletext services to remote area homesteads which have satellite receivers. It will also allow licensing, if and when appropriate, of other limited broadcasting services by satellite to remote homesteads. The coalition parties will not be opposing this part of the Bill.

        I wish to raise with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans)-I will be doing so in detail during the committee stage of the Bill-what I believe to be a drafting error. I wonder whether anyone in the Department of Transport and Communications or in the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) ever reads the legislation to see what it actually says. The Government, Ministers and departmental officers ought to realise that the legislation means what it says; not what the Ministers or the departmental officers want it to mean.

        This Bill amends the Broadcasting Act 1942. We last dealt with that in Bill No. 146 of 1988-the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. I do not know whether the Government meant it but it has not been corrected. The Government has remained silent on the matter. At the time, I pointed out that that legislation, by a back door method, allowed the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to have sponsorship broadcast-in other words, advertisements by way of sponsorship-on its channels. There was also a means by which the amendments to the legislation could have enabled, and can still enable, the ABC to have advertisements on its programs. At the time the Government had not told the ABC that as a result of the legislation that would be the case. Clearly, the Government did not realise that that was the purpose of some of the amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now draw attention to what is being proposed in this legislation. In Bill No. 146 of 1988 we had two schedules of amendments. In schedule 3 we dealt with paragraph 89d (3) (a). That amendment to the Bill inserted `limited licence' after `public licence'. It is almost unbelievable, but in schedule 4 of the same Bill there was another reference to the same paragraph. It said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Omit `, limited licence or re-transmission', substitute `or limited'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That complex arrangement meant that the words `limited licence' were inserted by schedule 3 and the words `limited licence or re-transmission' were deleted by schedule 4. That seems to me to be an extremely clever piece of legislation for the Parliament to have passed. What was then substituted in schedule 4 were the words `or limited'. It is my view that the consequence of those proposals is that the Act will now read, in paragraph 89d (3) (a), `in the case of a licence other than a remote licence, public licence or limited licence-authorises the operation, in accordance with the warrant and by a person or persons specified in the warrant'. By that complex set of amendments in schedule 3 and schedule 4 of Act No. 146 of 1988, the words `limited licence' were inserted. When we look at this Bill before us today we see that subclause 12 (a) inserts in paragraph (3) (a) of section 89d `a limited licence' after the words `a public licence'. I say to the Minister that in my view-and I would appreciate some advice as to whether it is right-that amendment is totally unnecessary because the words proposed to be inserted were in fact inserted when we dealt with this legislation, I think, in December of last year. I will raise that again in due course during the committee stage of the Bill. I mention it now to enable the Minister's officers to apply their minds to whether or not that is correct.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1975, which is part 7 of this Bill. The amendments in this part propose to validate retrospectively charging arrangements undertaken by Telecom Australia for which currently it does not have by-law coverage. In other words, Telecom is making charging arrangements which it has no legal right to make. The Minister in his second reading speech acknowledged the errors which `generally reflect inadequate administrative controls and inappropriate reporting procedures within Telecom's organisation'. In other words, the Minister is slating Telecom for its inadequate administrative controls and inadequate reporting procedures within its organisation. As at September of last year there were 1,997 telephone charging zones and 5,227 telephone exchanges in the Commonwealth. In some cases as new exchanges have been opened network changes have been made in advance of by-law operation. In other words, Telecom changed the network, changed the charging arrangements, but did not have any legal right to make the changes. The network changes affected charging. Some were increased; some were reduced. But these altered charges were not authorised in advance by the by-laws and have still not been authorised-and will not be until the passage of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom claims that it is impossible to determine the net effect of the errors on individual customers. The effect would depend on the individual customer's calling pattern. The existing arrangements for which validation is proposed to be provided would have resulted in higher charges for calls in particular directions and lower charges for calls in other directions. The point is that when a network is relocated, if people have a normal pattern of calling some of their calls result in higher charges and some result in lower charges. However, it may very well be that there are people out there in the community who perhaps make calls in the one direction all the time. I could imagine some elderly people who perhaps never ring anyone other than their daughters or sons, daughters-in-law, or some member of their family. If those people were able to establish that, in my mind they would be able to establish satisfactorily that Telecom has increased, or maybe reduced, their charges as a result of its change to the network. It is possible that there are people out there who, as a result of the passage of this legislation, will retrospectively lose their right to claim from Telecom a refund of charges which Telecom was not authorised to make.
       </para>
       <para>
        I appreciate it is unlikely that Telecom or individual customers possess the detailed records or information to enable accounts to be recalculated retrospectively if the amendments are not passed but it may very well be that there are people who are able to do it. It is proposed in this legislation to give Telecom protection from attempts by customers to challenge prior accounts on the basis of the legality of the zonal and other charging arrangements. Once again Telecom's actions are being given legislative protection. Telecom is the largest business operating in Australia. It is larger than the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, larger than the Coles-Myer group. Its revenues and expenditure are larger than the amount of money the Government of this country spends on the defence budget. Yet this poor body desperately needs the protection of Parliament to cover up for the mistakes it has made.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me assure the Senate that the Liberal and National parties will not be authorising Telecom to make retrospective charges or to correct retrospectively its charging arrangements by passing part 7 of this Bill. We will be voting against it during the committee stage. Under the existing charging arrangements if someone is able to establish a claim against Telecom, Telecom may have to suffer that and may have to refund moneys to customers. Telecom's ineptitude in this regard totally ignores the legislation. Telecom does not worry about its responsibility to the Parliament or to the people. It says, `Let's get the networks running and worry about the legality of our charging arrangements afterwards'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even now, as I understand, when Telecom became aware of this it could have immediately made by-laws which prospectively would have rectified the problems as they exist at the present moment. I gather that Telecom has chosen not to do that but to say, `Oh, well, we'll let the Parliament fix that up. We'll wait until the Parliament has passed this piece of legislation and then that will validate both retrospectively and prospectively our charging arrangements'. As far as the coalition parties are concerned, Telecom is just going to have to wear the fact that the legislation will not be passed by us and that it may have to make refunds to some of its customers.

         —I will be referring, in the debate on this portfolio Bill, the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, to just three of the Acts which are being amended. The first one which I refer to is the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988. The amendment which is being made in part 4 of the Bill is to the effect that a determination which is to be made with regard to funding under this Bill is to be treated as a regulation for the purposes of tabling and disallowance in this place. This is as a result of debate and discussions which took place when this Act was passed very late in the session last year-almost by way of a Christmas Eve exercise, on 21 December. It was a matter of great concern to the Australian Democrats and also to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that these determinations were to be made but were not to come before the Parliament for possible disallowance.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In his second reading speech the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) referred to the fact that this amendment comes before us by way of honouring an undertaking given by Senator Gareth Evans on 21 December. That undertaking was given to the Democrats when we expressed concern that the rate being set by the Minister should come under parliamentary scrutiny and be subject to disallowance. We welcome this amendment. I reiterate the comments made by my colleague Senator Sanders in this debate. He expressed some criticism of the Government's transport policy in general. I urge that a broader policy serving the community better, across a range of transport facilities and options, be implemented by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the time of the passage of the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill we moved a second reading amendment in which we expressed our concern-a concern which has already been expressed by Senator Calvert-about the level of funding for roads specifically and urged that the Government take action in that area. We also called for a direct allocation-at the time we suggested one per cent of fuel excise-to fund the development of alternative renewable liquid fuels, especially ethanol, in order to reduce the adverse environmental impact of the use of non-renewable oil based fuels. This is another way in which we believe we can address the environmental and social impacts of the development of transport, in particular road transport, in this country. It is a challenging issue and one which certainly must be taken on board. I think public pressure will increase the need for alternatives in this area as the public becomes aware of the increasing damage to our environment by the use of non-renewable liquid fuels. That is not to say that we do not need roads and that we do not need road transport; it is simply to say that we do not believe there is a balance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am very interested that Senator Calvert has once again made impassioned pleas. I find it interesting that the Opposition seems to be very concerned about the state of the roads in this country. I am sure it is a genuine concern, but it is a very blinkered concern, coming from a political party which last night enabled legislation to be passed in the other place-and will enable it to be passed in this place-which will deregulate the wheat industry and the transport component of that industry and throw more traffic onto our roads, to the detriment of the rail system in our country. It will work against the very points which have been constantly made by Senator Calvert and others on that side of the House. It strikes the Democrats as extraordinary that we do not have support from the Opposition for the pressure which we wish to put on the development, for instance, of rail transport in this country, particularly to rural communities, which would give such communities more of a choice. I think Opposition members need to reflect on their policies of privatisation which lead to some of these almost unbelievable conflicts between what they say on one piece of legislation and what they do on another piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942, the Opposition needs to look closely at its ideological position on privatisation and the impact this will have on people in isolated areas. Clearly, people in isolated areas will be the ones who suffer through the privatisation of services. I have mentioned transport. The amendment to the Broadcasting Act, as Senator Lewis said, does allow for extension of the provision of services by satellite in those areas where satellite dishes are available. I am very pleased that the Opposition is supporting this amendment, but I think it needs to reflect on some of its other policies which, if implemented-and we are given to understand that privatisation will be its big thrust in the coming election-will mean that many of these services will be privatised. I was interested that, when its spokesperson announced its privatisation policy, that person said, `We are not privatising Telecom just yet because it is a difficult one'. Clearly, some of the difficulty relates to the relationship with members of the National Party, some of whom understand the impact of this kind of policy on people in isolated areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Teletext and satellite facilities to outlying areas are crucial. Access to facilities that promote farm planning, management and so on, such as whole farm planning systems, which are supported by the Democrats, the National Farmers Federation and enlightened people across the spectrum, is important to all primary producers, however remote their properties may be. This amendment contains this important provision. I have mentioned the privatisation policies of the Opposition. The deregulationist policies of the Government also have the potential to damage the provision of facilities to people in remote areas. Whilst this amendment is supported across the chamber I think we ought to reflect on the possible consequences of many of the other things that we do that affect people who live in the outback and in isolated areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only controversial area in the amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1975 has been mentioned by Senator Lewis. I am rather fascinated by the vehemence of the Opposition's concern about the amendment in relation to Telecom Australia zoning arrangements. Mr Blunt, speaking in the debate on this Bill in the House of Representatives, said at the end of his speech:
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom had the opportunity to fix this particular mistake earlier than at present, yet it chose to go down the course of requiring the Government to bring in here a retrospective amendment. It is not acceptable to the Opposition and we will oppose that part of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Lewis reiterated that last point. A little earlier in his speech Mr Blunt reminded us that this amendment is designed to compensate for a complete bungle in Telecom that goes back to 1980. As I recall, we had a coalition government from 1980 to 1983. It seems to me that it is a little holier than thou for the Opposition at this point, having been in government and having not provided a proper legislative base during its term of office for Telecom to be able to organise adequate changes to zoning arrangements, to say when this Government-certainly after a time-lag-is attempting to do something about it, that it will oppose it. Clearly, this legislative base is necessary. The Democrats will not oppose the amendment to this part of the Bill, the reason being that not only the Labor Government but also the coalition Government before it have been tardy in this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats support the Bill in general and again exhort the Government to develop both telecommunications and transport legislation which serves the best interests of all Australians, not just those people who happen to live in capital cities and happen to have the financial backing to have access, particularly in the telecommunications area, to all the technology which is very quickly becoming available. I particularly stress that those people in isolated areas must be given access-we must not legislate in any way which reduces their access-to telecommunications developments as they come on stream in this country.

       </para>
       <para>
        I do so because if there is one area where the Government's promises have been dramatically broken, where the word of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been shown to be incapable of being trusted and where the Government has blustered and deceived the people, it is in the area of roads. Unfortunately, we have a Minister now who enjoys juggling figures, trying to prove that no government has done as well as his in this area, when the simple reality is that road funding under this Government, particularly in terms of direct contribution, has been significantly slashed in real terms. While there is evidence of a continuation of the great projects commenced under the Fraser Government's bicentennial road program, particularly in the 1983-84 year, which was the first year after the Fraser Government had been beaten, the level of funding by this Government has, in real terms, declined since then. The decline has brought with it the breaking of promises-I suppose we should never be surprised by that-by this Prime Minister, not simply 1983 election promises but 1984 election promises and continued broken promises from Ministers. In fact, this reckless disregard for the meaning of words and for the integrity of their own promises has been a distinguishing feature of this Government, particularly in the area of roads.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me remind the Senate of what the situation was which this dishonourable Government, in terms of its inability to keep its promises, faced. When the Fraser Government started the Australian bicentennial road development program the commitment was as follows: There would be major national highway projects completed by 1988 with Commonwealth road funds. The commitment that particularly affects my former electorate in the House of Representatives and certainly all those who travel between Sydney and Melbourne on the massively used Hume Highway, the road that is the most used of any road in Australia, was that a second carriageway `will be completed'-and I read from the document at the time-throughout the highway. Upgrading will include bypasses of Mittagong, Berrima, Goulburn, Yass and Albury and commencement of the Murray River crossing. The program was: `will be completed'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us see what Mr Hawke said in his 1984 policy speech: `The Hume Highway will be completed as a four-lane and mostly dual carriageway from Sydney to Melbourne'. It was not `may be' or `we hope' but `will be'. The Fraser Government created the proposal and the Fraser Government provided the funding, and that is why in 1983-84 that funding continued. It was only after this Government got control of the purse strings and was able to change programs that that funding was not proceeded with. This solemn declaration by the Prime Minister, who always calls on people to recognise and admire his integrity, that the Hume Highway will be completed as a four-lane and mostly dual carriageway from Sydney to Melbourne was not worth the paper it was printed on, like all his solemn undertakings.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, I will continue, and I will continue to make the remarks that I was making. I refer to the following statement on page 1047 of the House of Representatives Hansard made by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support about the Berrima bypass:
        </para>

       <para>
        . . . a bypass of that kind can bring about a reduction in road fatalities on that very stretch of road of up to 88 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Senate that at the time the Prime Minister went to the election he promised that that kind of bypass, which would reduce fatalities by 88 per cent, would be provided around all the towns along the Hume Highway in New South Wales. This was specifically stated by the Prime Minister and specifically listed in the bicentennial roads development program. Magically, that money was diverted away; magically, the money was reduced and significantly diverted. How can we tell that it was significantly diverted? Very simply. Mr Brereton, a former Labor Transport Minister in New South Wales, who is seeking to become a member of this Parliament, made an attack in 1986 on his then Federal counterpart, Mr Peter Morris, and accused him of diverting $181m intended to improve the Hume Highway to special work on the Sydney-Newcastle F3 freeway. Strangely enough, that just happens to be a bit of local pork-barrelling. The road to Newcastle has a fraction of the traffic and the accidents that that pious Minister over there, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), knows take place on the Hume Highway. I say, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this Government has a specific responsibility for the consequences of that action, and I have just established that. That is why I resent any attempt by any Minister in this place to cower me into not saying that people who make that kind of decision have a special responsibility for the consequences of it. Here we have a former Labor Minister from New South Wales, who is trying to become a member of this Parliament, accusing, on very sound ground, the previous Minister for Transport in this Government of diverting money away from what was the No. 1 priority. An undertaking had been given by the Prime Minister, for what that is worth. It is worthless. The continual undertakings of this Prime Minister have been wiped aside. That is why I say that the responsibility for the continuing accidents and deaths on the Hume Highway are a result of a failure to do this work. They are a result of the diversion of the money and reductions in total funding in real terms. They are the responsibility of the people who make those decisions, and there is no escaping from it.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is simply indefensible that that decision was taken. I have seen where that money has been diverted to on the Newcastle Freeway. It is a very nice road which goes to the western side of Lake Macquarie. I think work on this freeway should have proceeded, but not ahead of the No. 1 priority. There was no justification for reducing the funding on the most accident prone, most dangerous and most heavily trafficked road in Australia. That is why I say with some vehemence that I am disgusted at the Government's decision. I am disgusted that, for example, the Berrima-Mittagong--

        In my own area-this is why I am particularly angry about what has happened-we have seen a plan, which I have already said the Prime Minister has endorsed, to bypass both Mittagong and Berrima with one bypass. It is absolutely vital that this be done. Let us recognise that the freeway from Sydney to Melbourne is now a dual carriageway basically from the crossroads at Liverpool to Mittagong and then from Mittagong to Goulburn. I mention that the great bulk of that work was done while I was the member for Macarthur. I do not know whether that is meaningful or not. I just mention it because the person who succeeded me in that seat, a most incompetent Labor member, claimed the other day in the other place that nothing had been done in respect of national roads through his electorate in the seven years when I was the member. That was totally, nonsensically false. I mention in passing that I happened to be the member when the great bulk of the work was done.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because this money was diverted-and we have Mr Brereton as the evidence that it was-we have now only half of the Mittagong-Berrima bypass. Only Berrima has been bypassed. There is a freeway from Sydney to Mittagong which suddenly stops and the traffic has to go through the middle of the town where children are trying to cross the road. At the other end of the town there is another freeway to Mittagong from Goulburn, 100 kilometres away. That freeway also stops and the traffic goes through the town. It seems to me to be inviting disaster to have huge stretches of freeway interrupted by one town. That is why it was so vital, for safety reasons apart from anything else, for the two adjoining towns of Mittagong and Berrima to be bypassed. That is why the plan was there. That is why Mr Hunt, when he was the Minister responsible for transport in the Fraser Government, agreed to my strong plea that when that bypass was constructed it would be one project-the Mittagong-Berrima bypass. My successor, Mr Hollis, undertook to have his Government complete that project. It was called the Mittagong-Berrima bypass then. Now, magically, it has become just the Berrima bypass. Mittagong will not be bypassed until 1993 under the new arrangements announced by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support this week. There will be five years of risk, of danger, of threat, of injury, and of death because this Government has chosen to divert the money for a bit of pork-barrelling in the Newcastle area. It chose to cut the bicentennial road funding in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister wonders why I directly blame this Government for putting the people in my area at risk in this reckless, ridiculous way. I have a great deal of concern at the way the people in my area have been grievously misled by those who have bought votes from them on empty promises of saving lives and creating safer conditions.

        The article quotes Mr John Jamieson, the senior traffic engineer with the National Roads and Motorists Association, as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        Multi-lane highways are almost miracle cures.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article further states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Fraser Government, as part of its Bicentennial road program, promised that the entire length of the Hume would be a multi-lane highway by the end of 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        What justification does this Government have for moving away not only from the Fraser Government's program but also from its own? What excuse does it have to present to this chamber for diverting the money to that nice strip of concrete on the western side of Lake Macquarie? Of course there were dangerous sections of the Newcastle freeway. That is why it was vital that the major bridge at Mooney Mooney be built. But the section on which so much money has been spent in recent years goes far past the turn-off which veers right to Newcastle. The improved road veers left around Lake Macquarie and leads towards Cessnock. Is anyone in this Government trying to pretend that that road carries anything like the traffic that the Hume Highway carries? What is even more disgusting about this is that this Government is praising itself, patting itself on the back, for announcing that we will get these bypasses, the dual carriageways, the four lanes by 1993.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apparently, we are supposed to beat drums and cheer because this Government will delay for five years doing what it promised to do by 1988. It is incredible hide for yet another Newcastle-based Minister to tell the people who use the Hume Highway that at last Goulburn, Yass and Mittagong will be bypassed and the Cullerin Range deviation will be constructed by the end of 1993-94. In fact, I overstated the completion date. It is not 1993, it is the 1993-94 financial year. Work is expected to have finished on the Mittagong, Goulburn and Yass bypasses and on the Cullerin Range deviation by that time. At the moment this is an incredibly dangerous highway. I was giving the Government the benefit of the doubt when I said that it would be finished by 1993. It will not be completed by then, yet somehow this Minister and the propaganda machine that this Government runs have been trying to create an impression that this is a great, wonderful leap forward. The Government is announcing yet again projects that were announced in 1982, projects which were supposed to have been completed by 1988. The Minister and the Government are announcing them again as some dramatic and magnificent step forward. What incredible hide, what gall, what a bunch of phonies, what total lack of integrity to try this kind of stunt on people who are seeing the consequences of this Government's diverting road funds for its own pork-barrelling and also reducing the funds. No government can stand more condemned on the question of integrity than this Government on this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the honourable member for Richmond, Mr Blunt, said in the other place, the recent announcement of a five-year strategy for national highways and arterials is the third time that this same roads program has been announced. Mentioning it a third time does not mean that there is any increase in the funding being made available. On the contrary, it means that as sure as time goes by, it becomes more expensive to do the same amount of work. The dollar figures might look a bit bigger but, had the work been done when it was supposed to have been done, the dollar figures would have been smaller because inflation, which continues under this Government at a faster rate than in other countries, eats into the money available and adds to the cost of each project. I repeat the statement that I made in a press release to the newspapers in my area at the time the Berrima bypass was completed. I said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Severe Hawke Government cuts and improper diversions of Federal road funding means Mittagong now faces at least another three years of accidents and noise from heavy trucks and other Hume Highway traffic speeding through its centre.
       </para>
       <para>
        I described the opening of only the Berrima section of the Mittagong-Berrima bypass as a tragedy, particularly for the children and senior citizens who have to negotiate speeding highway traffic until at least mid-1992. As I said earlier in my speech, it is evident from the Minister's latest statement that it will not be completed until 1993 or 1994. Mittagong is now an island besieged on both sides by a high speed freeway. There can be no greater traffic risk imposed on a town than that. That is why when I was the local member in 1982 the Fraser Government's Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, agreed to have the total bypass of both Mittagong and Berrima completed by the 1988 Bicentennial.
       </para>
       <para>
        Giving this number one priority to the Hume Highway, which also covered the Cullerin Range and Jugiong deviations, was considered essential at the time because of the huge traffic flow and the accident rate. This was reinforced to the Minister when he got caught in a two-hour traffic jam south of Mittagong with me one day. But the Hawke Government cut total funding in real terms and diverted the existing cash away from the Hume Highway. That, of course, underlines the ineffective nature of the Labor member for that region who replaced me in the Lower House. He could not prevent that money being taken away. He has been unable to stop this Government's marauding financial incursions on the Hume Highway, which has led to a massive increase in risks.

         —I enter this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 to refer to clauses 9 and 10, which will bring in regulations so that the Parliament can disallow rates set by the Minister. This was done after the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill 1988 was passed in December last and we put pressure onto the Minister representing the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, Senator Gareth Evans. The Minister had the sole power to set that rate. The Opposition was afraid not of what the Minister might do if the rate was rising but rather where the rate was fixed and not enough money was returned to roads. I remind honourable senators that in that Bill 4.95c per litre was set out of the fuel levy to go back to roads, without being subject to a regulation review by this Parliament. I am happy that the Government has decided to amend this Bill to give the Senate the power to disallow regulations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have said in this forum and many others over the past 18 months that there has been no increase in the amount of road funding. It has virtually been fixed at $1.25 billion for the last four years. When Malcolm Fraser, the previous Prime Minister, commenced the Australian bicentennial road development program in about 1982 we had a 2c levy on fuel and that revenue was to go back onto roads. Roads immediately started improving right throughout Australia. When this Government came to power, unfortunately, there was no indexation of that 2c levy. The fuel levy galloped away. It is now about 22.39c. Yet spending back onto roads has remained at what it was before, set by that 4.95c levy of some time ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        By having only one fuel levy indexed and the other not indexed, the percentage that goes back to roads is declining all the time. I believe that only about 20 per cent goes back to roads. The tragedy is that the cost of road maintenance and making new roads has greatly increased. The levy is indexed, but the fact is that costs are going up all the time. The cost of plant and equipment for road building has certainly increased. I know that the price of a popular brand of road grader imported from the United States of America has increased by 400 per cent since 1984. One can see from that point of view that the cost of roads has certainly increased. Unfortunately, we do not have enough money going in for roads. If under the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill the levy of that 4.95c per litre going back to road funding were increased by 1.05c, this would bring the total to a round figure of 6c per litre. The Road Association of Australia is seeking about 7c per litre levy in the near future. I suggest that if the Government gave it that 6c a litre levy and indexed it, there would be a greater movement forward. If, however, the Government just put 1.05c over the 4.95c per litre levy it would be an increase of roughly 21 per cent. We would not be able to achieve everything with that 21 per cent increase but a lot could be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my own State of Western Australia one can see that the road system is going backwards, especially in the country where I live and which I represent. This is especially so around the mining areas, where we have a lot of new roads. Of course, money is not forthcoming in sufficient quantity to maintain the standard that is required. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is at the table, should be well aware of the poor road standards around Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie, Leonora, Laverton and the Pilbara, and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        As this seems to be the morning to discuss bypasses, I indicate that the shortage of money is preventing the Northam bypass, 100 kilometres from Perth, whereas an almost dual highway will get one there. The road puts all the traffic through that town and one must negotiate three or four zigzags before one gets out. At the other end, one enters the town after travelling hundreds of miles on straight flat roads. There have been petitions signed to get the bypass and it is certainly needed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to part 4 of the Bill, which refers to payment by instalment of registration fees. Mr President, as you probably know, $3,800 is the amount payable to register an inter-state truck, as a result of the transport legislation that went through last year. It applies to any truck that carries about 22 to 24 tonnes. Honourable senators may remember the Yass blockade last year. I remember the blockade in Greenmount in Western Australia. Senator Evans, who represented the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), visited those blockades and he promised those drivers payment by instalment. I welcomed the move. I am involved in transport myself, so I declare an interest in the matter. But I welcomed the move to monthly payments, or whatever, to help the cash flows of drivers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I welcome the uniform loading and truck speeds throughout Australia. From information I have received from the transport industry, that move is welcomed. The one area I would like the Government to look at is the question of uniform driving hours throughout Australia, because I am sure there is a lack of uniformity. I know that over in the east there is a log-book system, even though it may be abused. The only reason a truck driver over here does not have two log books is because he has three. But I believe the system is working to a certain extent. I would like to see the system extended throughout Australia in order to prevent those accidents which are causing deaths and which, quite rightly, we have heard about this morning. All Australians must be concerned about this. I would like the Government to look at this area, to extend those uniform driving hours so that there is a uniform safety standard. I shall be supporting the Opposition amendments.

In view of the partisanship, maladministration and patent conflicts of interest of acting commissioners such as Messrs Dodson, Yu and O'Shane, only too plainly documented in evidence before this Senate, will the Minister assure the Senate that the reappointment of the present hand-picked commissioners is not even contemplated by the Government?

         —On 12 April this year my colleague Mr Dawkins and I announced a package of training reforms that will significantly improve the opportunities for migrants to have their skills recognised and provide fairer access to the labour market, education and training. They address the deficiencies in current arrangements which are fragmented and rely excessively on paper qualifications rather than assessment of competencies and skills causing, of course, personal stress and hardship and substantial economic loss to the economy. The major objectives of the reforms are to develop a fair and open system, to promote occupational deregulation, rationalise and simplify administrative process and provide better information, advice and personal support services. Key elements of the reform program are the establishing of a national office of overseas skills recognition in the employment, education and training portfolio; promoting consistent, national standards and competency based assessment; encouraging State initiatives, including State overseas qualifications units and better Commonwealth-State cooperative arrangements; developing a program that builds on unused and unrecognised skills by providing personal support services, such as better access to education and training for remedial and bridging courses; and administrative reforms to the machinery of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act are due to be announced shortly.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The national office of overseas skills recognition will provide a focus for the reform program. It subsumes and extends the role of the Council on Overseas Professional Qualifications, which had previously been in my portfolio. As a first step, funding for Jobtrain will increase from $55.4m in 1987-88 to $86.7m in 1988-89 providing opportunities for all Australians, including migrants, to receive vocational training. Additional funding has been set aside to provide places for bridging courses. The number of these bridging courses will rise to 180 in 1989-90 and to 200 in 1990-91.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, our goal is to provide the opportunity for all Australians, whether trained in this country or overseas, to use their skills to full potential. There is no quick or easy solution. It requires cooperation from all governments, employers, unions, professional groups and individuals if we are to achieve genuine reform. I am confident that this package will create the framework for progressive changes to offer great benefits to migrants facing difficulties in getting their skills recognised, as well as making a major contribution to the structural adjustment in the economy.

         —As to the first question, the answer is yes. I am advised that there are about 1,300 transport aircraft in worldwide service which have exceeded the manufacturer's design life goal. However those goals were determined when the aircraft were designed as the desired life span. They do not indicate that the aircraft is unsafe after that period. Fatigue damage is progressive throughout the life of aircraft and a fail-safe structure such as used on these airliners can, if properly inspected, remain in service until economic factors determine replacement. As to the second question, whether any commercial jetliners in these 15-year-plus categories are operated by the Australian domestic airlines or by Qantas, the answer is yes. Qantas operates several Boeing 747 aircraft and Australian Airlines operates DC9 aircraft and a Boeing 727, all of which are in the region of the manufacturer's design goal. The Boeing 747 economic design life objective is 20,000 flights or 60,000 hours. World wide there are five and 68 aircraft respectively which have exceeded these aims. The greatest amount of work which Qantas aircraft have achieved, as at 20 April 1989, is 19,331 landings and 57,043 hours. It should be realised, however, that the economic design life is based on a judgment that beyond that life it would become less and less economically viable to maintain the aircraft concerned to ensure its continued safety and service. I emphasise that it does not mean that the aircraft would suddenly become unsafe. Rather, it would become more costly to make sure that it remained safe.

        As to the third question about the information we have on whether international airlines operating into Australia have aircraft in these categories, the short answer is we do not have details of how many international airlines operating into Australia have aircraft in the ageing category. However, there is nothing to prevent such operations, as the aircraft have a valid certificate of airworthiness from their country of registration. On the final question, relating to the intentions of the CAA in this respect, the CAA is taking part in discussions with world airworthiness authorities and manufacturers. Appropriate action will be taken as recommendations are made. This action will take the form of airworthiness directives requiring inspections or modifications for fatigue and corrosion damage. The CAA is satisfied that Australian airline aircraft are not in any immediate danger through exceeding their design goal, but the position is being kept under close review. No checks are done on overseas aircraft. This is the responsibility of the country of registration and the associated airworthiness authority. The CAA is confident, nonetheless, that those countries operating aircraft into Australia are upholding their international commitments with respect to safety considerations.

When control over the three-mile zone of the territorial sea was handed back to the States by the former coalition Government did the Commonwealth and States agree that the States would legislate to protect the sea from pollution? Failing the States doing that, did the Commonwealth and States agree that the Commonwealth would legislate to protect the sea from pollution even though the three-mile zone was otherwise controlled by the States? Have any or all of the States passed such protective legislation? Has the Commonwealth passed legislation, and if not why not?

         —There was an agreement reached, but it is not quite in the terms just put by Senator Coulter. At the time of the offshore constitutional settlement of 1979, agreement was reached in relation to ship based pollution, whereby the existing arrangements would continue so that Commonwealth legislation would apply to ships outside the territorial sea and State legislation would apply to all ships within the territorial sea.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The offshore constitutional settlement also included agreement that the Commonwealth should prepare legislation which would implement the provisions of the International Convention in Relation to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. In implementing the latter convention, a saving clause was to be inserted to allow the States to legislate to implement certain aspects of the convention if they wished to do so. With regard to land based marine pollution and marine pollution through dumping, discussions between the Commonwealth and the States were to continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the second and third parts of Senator Coulter's question, specifically relating to ship based marine pollution, as a result of further consultation between the Commonwealth and the States, Commonwealth legislation now applies in the territorial sea but there is a roll-back clause which allows the States to legislate consistent with the relevant international conventions. Subsequent to the offshore constitutional settlement, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 was enacted to protect the environment by regulating the dumping into the sea and the incineration at sea of wastes and other matter and the dumping into the sea of certain other objects and, as the legislation says, for related purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Act includes provisions that where the Minister is satisfied that State or Territory law will on and after a particular date make provision for giving effect to the Convention on the Protection of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter-that is, the London Dumping Convention-the Minister may disapply the said Act in favour of corresponding State or Territory legislation. Tasmania, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia have passed legislation. Tasmania has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Commonwealth and the ministerial disapplication-I do not like that word much, nevertheless it is the one I am supposed to use-of the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 with respect to the coastal waters of Tasmania is in effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to land based marine pollution, a variety of State legislation is in effect but unfortunately no consistent regime yet exists. I am writing to my State ministerial colleagues on the Australian Environment Council to put to them that we ought to do more towards a national approach to water quality issues. I am hopeful that obvious and increasing public pressure will encourage the States to go along with the Commonwealth and perhaps set national water quality standards which will hopefully then mean that the awful problems we are experiencing in a number of places can at least be monitored against an appropriate and proper yardstick.

         —As honourable senators will now be all too sadly aware, the leader of the New Caledonian independence movement, the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), Jean-Marie Tjibaou, was assassinated yesterday on the island of Ouvea, New Caledonia. His deputy, Yeweine Yeweine, died later from injuries sustained in the same attack. As I have already made clear in my response on the adjournment last night to tributes paid by you, Mr President, and by Senator Schacht and Senator Hill, both of whom were leading an Australian parliamentary delegation to New Caledonia just a couple of weeks ago, the Government deplores this shocking act of violence which has occurred at a time when hopes for a peaceful and lasting settlement in New Caledonia had begun to take root after years of unproductive violence and confrontation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The French Government, in reacting to the deaths, has recalled the two men's political courage and responsibility and their role in helping to bring about reconciliation between the communities in New Caledonia. These sentiments are certainly fully endorsed by the Australian Government. Jean-Marie Tjibaou, whom I had the pleasure of meeting on several occasions in recent years, was a man of great capacity and great personal dignity. He was one of the central figures in the attempts over the last year to restore order and stability to New Caledonia. He played a crucial role in the negotiations which led to what have become known as the Matignon and Oudinot accords on the future of the Territory. He was a man of moderation, a man of peace, and one who was enormously respected in the region. His passing, and that of his deputy Yeweine, is a tragic matter. Again, I take this occasion, on behalf of the Australian Government and Parliament, to express the most sincere condolences possible to his family and people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Details of the funerals have not yet been finalised, but present advice is that they will occur on Sunday. Subject to appropriate arrangements being put in place with the French authorities and the widows of the two men, it is the Government's intention that I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, represent Australia at the funerals. I hope it may also be possible for appropriate parliamentary representation to be arranged.
       </para>
       <para>
        With respect to the implications of the deaths for the future of New Caledonia, the deaths constitute a major blow to the current attempts being made to bring about reconciliation among the communities in New Caledonia. Tjibaou and Yeweine represented the moderate mainstream leadership of the FLNKS which, after the tragedy of the Ouvea incident exactly a year ago, was prepared to recognise the futility of further confrontation and the profound necessity for reconciliation. Their passing will clearly leave a major vacuum in the leadership of the FLNKS, one which will not easily be filled. The traditional, consensual procedures of the FLNKS give cause for hope that there can be patience and understanding on the part of those involved within the FLNKS. I hope also that such moderation can be sustained across the full political spectrum in New Caledonia. The Australian Government simply hopes that the deaths of Tjibaou and Yeweine will do nothing to interrupt the processes now under way in New Caledonia and that Tjibaou's moderate spirit will continue to inspire the communities of that Territory.

I am not criticising the way he put the question. Australian Airlines, for example, operates in the tourist business which is an activity ancillary to its airline activity, but is not its full business. Telecom Australia operates an international subsidiary which does consulting work and has contracts in various countries to perform management and other functions. That was perhaps not intended years ago as a suitable activity for a telecommunications authority which is charged essentially with running the Australian telecommunications business, but it is a very sensible departure from the core business activity because telecommunications is increasingly international. The good technical standard in Telecom makes it very important for it to take advantage of export opportunities and so on.

I ask Senator Button to address his mind to a point arising from his answer-and he may like to think about it: is it intended that these government business enterprises might be allowed to use the funds earned from the exercise of their monopoly powers in pursuit of business activities other than those core purposes for which they were established?

It has no idea of what the community is concerned about, which is why it has lost 20 per cent of the votes each by-election in the last 12 months, and why, in Merthyr, it will get creamed again. I hope that the Queensland Government starts to live up to its responsibilities and acts upon the long-standing Queensland National Park proposal to declare the Olive River gemfield a national park. That proposal has come from the bureaucracy in Queensland, not the Commonwealth.

Were hire car operators in Canberra asked to increase the rate they charge the Government for these services to a rate which is higher than that which they charge private sector clients, that higher rate being nearer that which the Government's own Comcar charges other departments?

         —Senator Stone would know very well that such retrospectivity happened under all sorts of governments. In this context I take retrospectivity to mean a law coming into operation prior to an announcement being made that such a law will be passed. There are two examples of this Parliament passing retrospective taxation legislation. The first was the Fraser Government's 1982 unpaid company taxation legislation. The second was the Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1988, a Government Bill, to which Senator Haines moved an amendment which was supported by all of the Australian Democrats and the Opposition. It imposed a retrospective capital gains tax liability on assets, the ownership of which had been rearranged between September 1985 and January 1987 pursuant to orders of the Family Court of Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are many examples of the Senate rejecting Bills which imposed retrospective taxation liabilities. I will cite two. In 1984 a Labor Government introduced a Bill to reinsert section 3 (12) in the Fraser Government 1982 Act. That section was originally in the Fraser Government's Bill but was later pulled out by that Government. I could give the Senate the details of what that section did, but it would take some time and I will not bother to do it now. The Labor Party in Opposition in 1982 moved an amendment which was identical to the 1984 Bill later presented. That amendment was supported by two Democrat senators, by Senator Harradine and by the entire Labor Party Senate Caucus, but it was defeated. Also in 1984 a Bill was introduced to recoup the taxation avoided by employers who were running bogus superannuation schemes, commonly known as cherrypicker schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most notorious of the rogues who were operating these schemes were the Kelly brothers. For a period of between 10 and 15 years contributions which were deductable from the Kelly brothers taxable income were paid into a so-called superannuation fund. Of course, they were the trustees of the fund and controlled it. Ostensibly, the fund was for the benefit of their employees, although the employees were not aware of the existence of the fund. The Kelly brothers, being in charge of the fund, ensured that no employee ever qualified for the benefits under the trust deed of the fund, and sacked several employees immediately before they qualified for benefits. In other words, the fund was never used, and was never intended to be used, for the benefit of the employees-it was used for the benefit of the Kelly brothers at the expense of the rest of the taxpayers of Australia. We introduced a Bill in 1984 to recoup the tax that the Kelly brothers and others had evaded in that way.

         —I have been asked, in the third part of the question, about inconsistencies. I will cite two examples of inconsistency. In 1982 Senator Harradine voted for the then Labor Opposition's motion to reinsert the original clause 3 (12) of the Fraser Government's unpaid company tax legislation. In 1984 he voted against the Bill which had exactly that same provision in it. His vote in the first instance was not crucial to whether the amendment was carried; his vote in the second instance was crucial to whether the Bill was carried or defeated. It is not possible to be more inconsistent than to vote in opposite ways on the same question.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second example I want to cite is that of Senator Haines. Prior to moving the retrospective amendment which she imposed on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) last year, Senator Haines had always voted against retrospective legislation ostensibly on the grounds of immutable principle, yet she moved that 1988 amendment which imposed a retrospective taxation liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        She was told by me in the Senate at the time that it did have retrospective application, and it was explained to her why it had retrospective application. It is difficult to imagine anything much more inconsistent than a senator who knowingly allows rogues or crooks like the Kelly brothers to walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars-I think it was about three-quarters of a million dollars that they filched from the taxpayers-and then moves an amendment imposing a retrospective liability on completely innocent people.

         —Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I do not think that answer really ends the confusion which now surrounds this issue. As I understood it, the Government's objective was to get clear guidelines for industry with respect to the development of projects which, on the Minister's statement, involve potentially $3 billion worth of capital investment and $1 billion of value added to our exports. Can the Minister tell me what statement-if any-the Government proposes to make to define the full extent of the process which will have to be followed by people wishing to develop such mills in so far as there is Commonwealth involvement? It was my understanding that this statement was to lead to a definition of a process which people would know was available and which they would have to follow. Is the Minister now saying that quite separate requirements will have to be considered, including resource availability?

         —If Senator Chaney reads the statement he will see that it says quite clearly that in respect of particular proposals and of the process, the Government will, in part, be guided by the mission which has been sent overseas to determine the processes which are in use in other countries. This is not a final statement of the Government's position in any sense. The mission overseas will be looking at technical issues and processes. I do not have the statement in front of me, but all that the paragraph at the end states is that, because of the nature of pulp mills, technical issues relating to the quality of effluents and their effects on the receiving environment have to be looked at. The issues which will concern the Commonwealth will be the processes, the technical standards and so on. The honourable senator asked me whether this was intended to exclude the examination of the availability of resources. Of course it is not intended to do that. How can it possibly do that? Many of the resources potentially available to pulp mills are owned by State governments, in some cases by the Commonwealth Government and in some cases by the private sector.

The honourable senator's allegation that the new proposals lack the support of industry is not a fact. As she said in her question, the vast majority of service providers have implemented the new fee relief arrangements. I would suggest that it is a gross over-statement to say that, as such, there is a lack of support by the child care industry. If some local government bodies decline to accept the Commonwealth's proposals while the vast majority accepts them, why then is it the fault of the Commonwealth? However, the honourable senator asked some detailed questions. I will refer them to Dr Blewett and give her an answer in due course.

        The Australian Government will never take a position of seeking to deny the issuing of passports or trying to curb, physically or in any other way, access by its nationals to South Africa. But we constantly draw attention to the continuing iniquity of the apartheid system in that country and the way in which even though in some individual sports efforts have begun to be made to civilise the practical administration of those sports, nonetheless, in an environment where the treatment of blacks and whites is so inherently unequal, where the financial allocations to education, sporting facilities and health are so manifestly unequal, it is just impossible to have normal conditions in that abnormal society. That is the prevailing moral force, if you like, of the position that we, among others, have adopted. There will always be room for argument from time to time about the practical administration of that policy but there can never be room for argument about its moral basis, its principal force, except from the back benches of the National Party of Australia.

I am advised that the parliamentary departments do not have the resources to organise a design competition of this nature.

We are not sure how that can be achieved. The increasing number of civilian casualties is a source of alarm. The failure of the conflict to be brought to a rapid conclusion is causing innumerable problems, as Senator Alston well knows, and ensuring a continuing very tragic loss of life. From the outset the Australian Government's position on this matter has been to resist the Soviet invasion, to be opposed accordingly to Soviet imposed regimes, and to have support for the resistance movement. That remains our position, but at the same time we urge all parties to the conflict to explore fully all avenues which may lead to an end to the war.

       <para>
        The difficulty is that-as the situation in Jalalabad and Kabul has shown-if both sides insist on seeking a military solution, then the path to a settlement of the Afghan problem will be a very long and a very bloody one. We are ready to lend our support to genuine efforts to establish a viable post-withdrawal government able to govern which is acceptable to all Afghans in line with their right to self-determination. We hope that such a government could be put together from the resistance forces and in a way which does not involve further bloodshed and further suffering. If it cannot be achieved in that way and some compromises are acceptable, are possible, that fall short of the kind of scenario that Senator Alston has painted, then, in the interests of common humanity, that is a course to which I think we would be sympathetic. I communicated all these things to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar when I met him the other day in his capacity as leader of one of the key mujahedeen factions in Australia. As Senator Alston knows, I have also conveyed this view to the Afghan Council here in Australia representing a whole variety of resistance groups and civilians anxious to ensure a peaceful settlement there.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's position is, of course, one of recognising states rather than governments. As such, the question of recognising anyone in particular does not arise. In practice, we deal with the particular government that appears to be or is in control of the situation on the ground. In Afghanistan at the moment it is simply not possible to say that any government, whether it be the Najibullah remnant or the resistance forces, constitutes such a government in control. The situation is very fluid, very confused. I simply hope that moderate positions will be adopted, that compromise will be possible and that an acceptable route to self-determination and free elections can be assured.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this environment the question of aid delivery becomes one of continuing difficulty. As is well known, Australia has pledged to provide $20m over three financial years to the UN humanitarian economic assistance program for Afghanistan for the returnees-rather than the refugees, who we are supporting in other ways through food aid and so on, and on which we have spent some $45m to date in Pakistan and elsewhere. The first component of $2m was allocated in March this year to be used by various UN and international agencies to provide short term relief and recovery assistance to Afghan returnees. It is currently envisaged that approximately $10m, mainly in the form of food aid, will be provided to returnees in the 1989-90 financial year. We would like to be able to go further than that but it is a question of practical effective delivery on the ground. We will keep the situation constantly under review. I was given some encouragement by Hekmatyar that coordination arrangements were being put in place that would make possible the effective delivery of a higher quantum of aid than that which we have pledged. So far it does not seem that that has eventuated in a way that will be practically effective, but we are doing our best to keep the aid and assistance flowing.

         —On 3 May Senator Newman asked me, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, a question relating to the Commonwealth appeal to the High Court of Australia regarding the claim to compensation by HMAS Voyager survivor, Bernard Verwagen. I undertook to obtain an answer. It is not true that in 1985 the Government admitted liability to all survivors and agreed to waive the statute of limitations in all applications for compensation. When the Attorney-General decided that the current claim of HMAS Voyager's survivors should be opposed, he set out detailed reasons for this decision. I have provided Senator Newman with a copy of the Attorney-General's statement. The only cases currently active are cases wherein the Commonwealth amended its defence to include a defence based on the statute of limitations.

        One issue in these cases arises from the fact that the defences were amended and the decision on that issue will apply to only four cases. The remaining issues in the current litigation, of whether the claims are justiciable having regard to the fact that they arose out of an incident during training for war, is of general application although it will be of no practical significance where a claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Present further progress in these cases awaits hearing by the High Court.

         —The matter of public importance that I am bringing before the Senate today-namely, the threat to both Australian consumers and producers of the promotion of anti-business attitudes and policies, including product liability and class actions-will be, without any doubt, one of the fundamental issues of the 1990s. In essence, the issue is this: a rising tide of anti-business attitudes and policies which is showing every sign of swelling. The tide is evident not only in Australia; it is prevalent in other Western nations as well. If unchecked, it will do great damage to our productive base. The victims will not only be Australian producers and businesses, both large and small; they will be Australian consumers.

       <para>
        There is a fundamental mutuality of interest between producers and consumers. Every Australian is a consumer. More than half of these consumers are also paid producers of goods and services. The consumerist movement in Australia has ignored this mutuality of interest between producers and consumers. If it had not, we would not now have the rising tide of destructive anti-business sentiments we are now facing. Businessmen and politicians must share part of the blame for this development. Successive governments have failed to demonstrate sufficiently clearly that the market economy does not exist for the convenience of producers but rather that it is all about serving the interests of consumers. As an article in the Economist on 15 April neatly put it:
       </para>
       <para>
        They-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, producers-
       </para>
       <para>
        have to sweat and sometimes suffer in trying to offer consumers the right goods and services at the right prices. Since everybody is a consumer but only half of them are producers, there ought to be overwhelming support for the market economy. If the Thatchers and Reagans who have done much for the market cause had been careful to couch their claims and their actions in terms of consumer welfare, they would be leaving behind more durable change.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think those remarks apply with equal relevance to Australia. In Australia, however, there has been in recent years a further element which has tipped the scales even further towards the development of an anti-business sentiment. That element is the active encouragement of support for anti-business and the pro-consumerist movement by the Hawke Government. This support and encouragement has taken various forms. It includes the appointment of extreme left wing politicians as Ministers for consumer affairs. I refer particularly to the present Minister, Senator Bolkus, who is in the chamber, and his predecessor, Mr Staples. It includes many appointments to important government agencies of persons noted for their anti-business and pro-consumerist attitudes. Perhaps the most striking example is the appointment a couple of years ago of the then Executive Director of the Australian Consumers Association, Mr Alan Asher, as a Trade Practices Commission commissioner. The name of John Braithwaite, the former Executive Director of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO), also comes readily to mind. Government support and encouragement also includes massive grants of taxpayers' money to anti-business groups. The most conspicuous is AFCO. At the 1987 Federal election, AFCO urged a vote for the Australian Labor Party. Last year its budget support grant alone from the Hawke Government was $217,000. On top of that it received considerable additional government funding to enable it to conduct other activities which are cloaked in an ostensible pro-consumer guise but are in reality anti-business and a con of consumers. Such activities include the Labor Party front operation of the national prices network, about which I and many of my colleagues have spoken previously in the Senate and elsewhere and about which my colleague Senator Calvert will be speaking this afternoon.
       </para>
       <para>
        AFCO is the peak council organisation for a wide range of other organisations of which the largest is the Australian Consumers Association. Very few of these organisations are representative of consumers. It is very difficult for an ordinary consumer to become a voting member of the Australian Consumers Association, for instance. The number of financial members of the Australian Consumers Association totals approximately 200. Votes on major policy issues are frequently taken by no more than 50 persons, hardly a democratic representation of Australia's 16 million consumers. The peak body, AFCO, receives more than 97 per cent of its total funding from Federal Government hand-outs. There is practically no financial or other input into AFCO from ordinary consumers. The Hawke Government has also increasingly appointed AFCO nominees to consumer-oriented agencies and committees. In the main, these appointees are not permitted to exercise their own judgment on these bodies. Material I have received from AFCO in recent days contains the following statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        AFCO's policy is that the general consumer representatives should be the formal representatives of the movement and accountable to it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Draft guidelines prepared last year by AFCO on the approach to be pursued by AFCO appointees to agencies, commissions and committees said that at all times the appointees must apply themselves as representatives of AFCO. In most cases these people are appointed to bodies for which they have no relevant expertise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem with AFCO, the Australian Consumers Association and most other so-called consumerist organisations in Australia-and, I suspect, elsewhere-is that they do not represent the real interests of genuine consumers. They are narrowly based and comprise, in the main, consumerist political activists of the left wing ideology at the expense of mainstream consumers. To their credit, some Government members have recognised this and have spoken accordingly in respect of AFCO. They include Senator Peter Walsh and Mr John Brown. These Government members are in a small minority. The overwhelming weight of opinion amongst members of the Hawke Government appears to be in support of this anti-business sentiment, despite the fact that such sentiment is ultimately contrary to the interests of Australian consumers. Some of the constituent members of AFCO have also now woken up to just what is happening. The Country Women's Association has now withdrawn, with the former President of the CWA saying that AFCO is run from Canberra by its seven-member executive with little reference to members. The Tasmanian Consumer Affairs Council has expressed its concern at developments. The Council's 1988 report said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Council has expressed concern about the role of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO) as it affects the interests of consumers. More specifically, the Council has some doubts that AFCO does fulfil the role which its name conveys.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        AFCO maintains that it brings together largely national organisations with concern for consumer issues. Approximately a quarter of the full members of AFCO have only a tentative connection with consumer issues as such, and of the 23 associate members and consultative members, their links with consumer issues could be viewed as tenuous.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Council believes that AFCO's policies on occasion appear to be more related to a particular political philosophy rather than being genuinely representative of consensus thought on consumer issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        When persons are sought to represent the consumer interest on an authority the Council considers this representation should come from a wider range than the members of AFCO.
       </para>
       <para>
        These comments from the Tasmanian Consumer Affairs Council sum up very concisely the concerns that all Australians should have about the directions in which the politically activist consumerist movement, of which AFCO is the lead runner, is heading and the damaging influence it is having on perceptions about business. I draw a very careful distinction between the words `consumerist' and `consumer'. We do, of course, need genuine representation of consumer interests. We do not have it. Instead we have a politically and ideologically driven small band of activists whose agenda is not the agenda of average Australian consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consumerist movement has been heavily involved in promoting proposals for the introduction of class action legislation and product liability legislation in Australia, and it is to these matters that I now wish to turn. Although they are separate subjects, the two are intimately related. Much study has been made of them by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Indeed, the Commission has been examining class actions-sometimes called grouped proceedings-since 1977. In 1987 the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, referred the question of product liability to the Law Reform Commission for a report by 30 June 1989. The Commission is now scrambling to meet this deadline. In the last few days it had produced a draft Bill and has asked for views of the Bill by 22 May in order to enable it to meet the 30 June deadline. That is, of course, an impossibly tight timetable for all those persons and organisations in the general community who will be affected by any product liability to express their views and concerns. That reporting date should be delayed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The threat of introduction of class action legislation is growing. It would be a disaster. The Government should reject the proposals put forward by the Law Reform Commission, but it appears that that will not, by any means, be the case. The new regime of strict product liability being proposed by the Law Reform Commission would overturn the current fault based system in favour of a system where the manufacturer would, prima facie, be liable for damage, loss or injury caused by products which were either `unsafe' or of `unacceptable quality'. The Commission's latest proposals envisage the insertion of a new part Va into the Trade Practices Act. The coalition is opposed to the idea of product liability legislation of the nature which the Law Reform Commission has in mind, for reasons that I will touch on briefly in a moment. To put any such legislation under the wing of the Trade Practices Commission would greatly increase my own concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent developments within the Trade Practices Commission are disturbing. The Trade Practices Commission has given recent indications of adopting a much more broadly based activist role. It appears to be becoming increasingly involved in policy matters as distinct from what I understand its intended role to be, that is, enforcement and adjudication. This changing approach by the Commission was set out very clearly in the recent Ruby Hutchison Memorial Address by the Commission's Chairman, Professor Baxt. This is an annual address organised by AFCO. The address should be widely read by all business people. It is important to note the positive response to his address that Professor Baxt received from the organisers and consumerist participants, if a subsequent memorandum to Professor Baxt from his Commissioner, Mr Allan Asher, is any indication. According to the publication Inside Canberra, Mr Asher reported to Professor Baxt on 21 March that the AFCO organisers, who, in his memorandum Mr Asher calls `the clan', were `all quite thrilled that the Commission at all levels is taking such a pro-consumer line'. There is no doubt that Mr Asher is having a major influence on the Trade Practices Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recent sudden sideways movement, against his wishes, of a senior member of the Commission, Mr Lindsay Coombs, has been commented on in other places. Mr Coombs has been responsible for developing voluntary codes of conduct for business organisations which would be authorised by the Trade Practices Commission. It is alleged that Mr Coombs's offence was to consult business organisations first about co-regulation voluntary codes, and that he should rather have consulted first or at least at the same time, with consumer bodies. If there is any truth in this allegation, it should ring further warning bells for the business community. The Law Reform Commission's product liability proposal widens the concept of defect to include fitness for purposes as well as safety. It disallows certain defences available to manufacturers overseas. It goes further than the European Economic Community directive on product liability which came into force in August 1988. It is, indeed, arguably the most stringent product liability proposal of any country in the world, with the possible exception of the United States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United States product liability system has been described as being in a state of crisis and as greatly inhibiting the competitiveness of United States companies. My colleague Senator Bishop will be discussing product liability later in the debate. The proposals that the Government is to consider will increase prices as a result of increased liability insurance, higher compliance costs, legal costs and opportunity costs of executive time through litigation. It will stifle the development of new products, it will threaten the viability of small business unable to afford or obtain liability insurance cover, it will reduce the competitiveness of Australian products on the domestic and world markets and, very importantly and significantly, it will act against the interests of consumers by limiting consumer choice.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposals also raise more fundamental issues. In particular, it is foreign to our concept of morality and justice that we should be held responsible at law for outcomes which have no basis in either a producer's carelessness or commitment. The proposals, however, do this. The Law Reform Commission's proposals are less an exercise in law reform than an exercise in economic and social engineering. It is extraordinary that the Commission claims in a commissioned research paper that the economic impact of the proposals is likely to be small. The report is unable even to say unequivocally whether the impact on the total community will be a net benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Class actions legislation would have similar debilitating effects on Australian producers and consumers. It has been estimated that the cost to industry of the duo of proposals would be some $2,000m each year. Australian consumers would inevitably be faced with higher prices, to the extent that they cannot escape them. In the export markets the effect would be reduced production, investment and employment and a worsened foreign trade balance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The business sector has expressed three major objections to the Law Reform Commission's class actions proposals. Firstly, the Commission's proposals are radical and are not justified, in that they constitute the use of a massive sledgehammer to crack a nut. Secondly, the costs to the whole community would far outweigh any benefits that would flow from them. Thirdly, there are many technical faults in the details of the proposals which seriously jeopardise the rights of defendants. There are already a range of remedies available to consumers which do not involve time-consuming and costly redress to the courts, although of course that redress is also available. A survey of consumer opinion conducted by the Trade Practices Commission a year or so ago found that it was quite clear that there was not a large body of wronged consumers who were being denied access to the courts. Yet this is the premise on which the whole thrust of class action legislation is supposedly based.
       </para>
       <para>
        These proposals are totally at odds with the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in October last year to reduce costs and eliminate red tape for the business community. Class actions legislation will strangle business innovation, will increase costs and will reduce our international competitiveness. These matters-and this is one of the reasons why we bring this matter to the Senate today-have so far escaped much public exposure. That cannot continue. Issues such as class actions and product liability legislation go to the heart of the environment that we establish for productive enterprise in this nation, and they are therefore of the greatest importance for us all because they affect us all as consumers. Proposals such as this demonstrate clearly the fundamental difference between the approach of the Labor Party and that of the Liberal Party and National Party coalition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Government's agenda is being driven by a small group of self-interested consumer activists. Never do we hear these people or this Government express concern at the massive level of taxation that burdens the community, or the record level of real interest rates, or the dead hand of restrictive work practices or the inefficiencies of government business enterprises. Never do we hear these people recognise the overwhelming positive contribution that the business sector makes to the living standards of every Australian. Those attitudes and these government policies stand in stark, bleak contrast to those of the coalition. The coalition's policies are all about giving freedom to grow to business, enterprise and innovation, not to restrict and hamstring them. Our policies are about lowering the tax burden, not increasing it; lowering interest rates, not raising them; encouraging investment, not crippling it; providing greater choice for consumers, not restricting it; lowering prices for consumers, not increasing them; strengthening the essential mutuality of interest between producers and consumers, not setting them at each other's throats in the way in which this Government seems so determined to do.

He demonstrated that nowhere in the community is it considered to be a viable alternative to this Government. The matter of public importance and the contribution that we have listened to this afternoon are a disgrace. What we have is an indication that the Opposition has no vision for business or for the consumer. There is no policy approach to regulatory reform.

         —Senator Short is so predictable. He is so obvious and so patently shallow that it was very easy to anticipate what he was going to say this afternoon. The honourable senator recited the words contained in a document from the Opposition spokesperson, Mr John Moore. This shows that there is nothing new in his contribution; it is all very predictable. It is no wonder that no-one in the community takes him seriously. It is no wonder he is treated in this way when he comes in here and makes a contribution like that and when he has a Leader like Mr Howard, who makes his decisions by drawing them out of a hat. We know what Senator Short's Party stands for at the moment. We know what direction it is going in. The Opposition might have its token front benchers, like Senator Hill, but those people are being overridden by Bovver boys on the back bench like Senator Short who are driven by political ideology which is irrelevant and intransigent.

        Let us look at this Government's commitment to consumers and to industry. Absolutely no reference is made in Future Directions to consumer affairs or to consumer protection. In this place, apart from the odd personal attack on people involved in the consumer movement, there has been no addressing of the issues. In the instances that there have been a number of issues before this place, such as product safety and food safety, what has the Opposition done? It was prepared to leave Australian law in such a situation that we would have had protection for dogs and dog food but not for Australian consumers and their food. That was a direct result of some of the legislation that honourable senators opposite forced into place. So the Opposition does not have that vision for reform. We on this side of the Parliament, however, do not work in a vacuum. We do not come in here with bland, pious rhetoric.
       </para>
       <para>
        For instance, if the Opposition wants to talk about the interests of both consumers and industry, let us look at the current debate on the wheat industry. The Government proposes what we see as being a sensible, rational and much needed reform to the wheat industry. This reform will remove monopoly control and it will open up competition. There will be sensible reforms for business, consumers and industry. The Opposition's response, however, is to go immediately to water to protect sectional interests. The Opposition's cobbled compromise is very much born out of that sort of situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        One such example is consumer credit laws. We on this side of the Parliament have been trying for about 12 months now to achieve in Australia a regime of consumer protection laws in the credit area which have been sought by industry and consumers for over 15 years. The Opposition, when in government, did nothing about such a proposal. Despite the resistance of some Liberal State Ministers, we will deliver this proposal hopefully this year. A uniform consumer credit Act has been developed by me, industry and consumer organisations. This Act will simplify and reform the regulatory structures. More importantly, it will be welcomed by consumers because it will substantially deliver a level playing field across this country of consumer rights. This is one example of what we are doing constructively to protect consumers and to make the environment much easier for industry to work within.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter of public importance refers to two particular issues discussed by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) over a period of 10 years. The report on grouped proceedings has been handed to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and is under consideration. That report was actually commissioned in 1977 by the Fraser Government which put it on the agenda. Let us not now talk of it in terms of the threat and the destruction of Western civilisation because of discussion on that particular issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us also look at the ALRC discussion paper on product liability. Senator Short says that that is a radical proposal which will destroy business confidence and disrupt our good system of government. Does Senator Short know that countries such as the United Kingdom under Maggie Thatcher and the United States of America and the European Economic Community all have product liability regimes which are commensurate with the one that has been recently revised by the Law Reform Commission and that Japan is currently looking at that sort of proposal? Let us forget about the facts; let us just stick to the bland, shallow, hollow rhetoric that we are used to hearing from that side of the chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Reform Commission has done some great work in recent years. The attack on it cannot be substantiated. It has done some great work in areas such as reform of insurance laws. This reform has been implemented and welcomed by both industry and consumer groups. It has done some great work on the general insolvency problem. A report which it released in this area has been recognised widely as being a balanced and sensible document. On this side of the Parliament we want constructive, positive discussion of these issues. We do not want to be locked into that rhetoric of fear and all sorts of outdated threats.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the two proposals in terms of their aims and objectives. We, on this side of the Parliament, are doing so. We have not dismissed them or endorsed them outright; they are under active consideration. But what we have asked of the community and the challenge that we think people in this place have a responsibility to meet is a constructive debate in these areas. I am not convinced by some of the documents that have been floating around from organisations such as the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI). When we sit down and talk to representatives of those organisations, we find that they admit to the shallowness of their claims and positions. They cannot substantiate them. I have asked the CAI to engage in constructive consultations with the Government. We have had some consultations and the invitation to continue them has been there for a couple of months.
       </para>
       <para>
        We talk about grouped proceedings with the objective of reducing the costs of litigation and improving access to courts, but access to redress of consumers' and individuals' rights is nothing that honourable members opposite know anything about unless, of course, it is on a momentary basis. Let the Opposition forget for a moment its criticism of the concept of class actions which we have heard this afternoon. Let us forget for the moment that it was the Opposition, in the context of Rothwells Ltd and the National Companies and Securities Commission, who raised the concept of class actions, the need for small investors to have broader representative action procedures available to them. Mr Moore, the shadow spokesperson, actively went out into this community agitating for that sort of right to be available. He recognises now that there are limitations in the current representative procedures in the Trade Practices Act, but he also recognises the need for government to address that particular problem of limited access to grouped proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Members of the Opposition have forgotten that now. We now have hysteria and all sorts of comparisons with the United States experience. Mr Moore, Senator Short and Senator Bishop should address the issues and Senator Calvert should get away from his personal obsession. Let me just refer to the little obsession that Senator Calvert has about prices and Price Watch in Tasmania. We run a policy which is geared towards assisting consumers. We recognise that there is a major imbalance in the market place between those who have resources and those who do not. The Australian Government feels that consumers can be assisted by enabling organisations to run an effective price watch mechanism. We have had Senator Calvert, a Tasmanian, talking about Price Watch in his State and how inept and incompetent it is. The Tasmanian Government spent $200,000 running an inquiry into prices in that State. What happened at the end of that inquiry? The Government got a report and the morning after the main editorialising in the newspapers was that the result of spending $200,000 was a report that told the people what Price Watch had been telling them for 12 months. That is a great vindication of the operation of Price Watch in that State endorsed by the newspapers in Tasmania. Senator Calvert has come in here-forgetting about the fact that Tasmanian consumers are somewhat captive in their economic environment-and has tried, in an underhanded way, to attack the organisation which is run in Tasmania. I would have thought that if he were going to be representing the rights of his constituents, he would also take a much more balanced approach to that particular organisation. Instead, he has come into this chamber with a kind of hysteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Opposition were honest about its addressing of these sorts of issues, it would have known that product liability suits in the United States are very much a small proportion of American class actions. Senator Short did not get around to quoting from Mr Moore's paper, even though most of the rest of his speech was quotations. Mr Moore wants to exclude business from any form of group action proceedings. At the moment, under the provisions available in Australia, business quite happily uses those provisions; small business in particular uses those provisions. We are also told that there is no proven need for group action proceedings. The Government is concerned to address this particular issue as well, because it believes that the question of access is vital. One way in which access may possibly be enhanced is by the introduction of the concept of group proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The irrelevance of the Opposition's claims is even further enhanced and is made even clearer by its comments on product liability. Senator Short said that the Law Reform Commission wanted to introduce fault based liability. It may come as a big surprise to Senator Short, but fault based liability does, in fact, exist at the moment in the Australian system. Under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, part 5, division 2a, in some instances there is no need for proof of fault.

        There were amendments put in place in 1978. Who was in government then, I ask Senator Short. It was not a radical proposal then. In recent days we have seen how far the Liberal Party has come. Malcolm Fraser has been out there criticising the Liberal Party for its lurch to the right. We can see why Malcolm Fraser could have presided over amendments to the legislation to give consumers and small business this sort of assistance. We can now see how far the Liberal Party has gone. We can now see what its Future Directions policy really means. It really means total abdication of the rights of individuals in this society. It gives no recognition at all to this issue. Malcolm Fraser knows what he is saying when he expresses concern about the drift of the Liberal Party in this community. That Party represents hard, right wing ideology with no recognition of rights of people. It trumpets the need for economic rationality. Senator Hill can laugh. He is one of the token wits on the front bench.

         —I will adhere to your request, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Liberal Party trumpets the need for economic rationality, yet it rejects without consideration reforms which could improve economic efficiency by closely linking liability to responsibility reforms which could increase incentives for quality in Australian industry, reforms which would remove irrational provisions which potentially allow claims against manufacturers for consumer misuse. One wonders why this is so. It is very clear why it is so. The Liberal Party has not bothered to read the reforms. It picks up the odd document, the odd fear document. It has not addressed the issues. It has not looked at the revised paper from the Law Reform Commission.

        We are not going to take that approach to government; we have not taken that approach and we will not. That is why we have been more successful at addressing some of the problems in this country, particularly in the area of structural adjustment. We are talking here about discussion and further development of provisions which have been in place, somehow or other, for over 10 years. We are talking about provisions which have been in place in many parts throughout the world and we are talking about provisions which have been introduced by Prime Ministers such as Margaret Thatcher. The basis of that knee-jerk response from the Opposition is a proposal which comes from the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI), an inferior brief analysis of all the issues involved. I have told the CAI, and I will tell it again--

That input is recognised and will continue to be made. I will continue to consult with them on a constructive basis. I have done that for 12 months. I am doing it with the whole industry sector and will continue to do so, but neither I nor the Government will be swayed by empty rhetoric.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have to assess critically some of the propositions that have been brought forward. As I said, issues have to be addressed concisely and precisely, in terms of how the Government will respond to them. That is what we are looking at. We are looking at some of the considerations-for example, the contention that there will be a flood of suits under the group proceedings provisions. We also recognise that the Law Reform Commission has put up a couple of proposals that would be geared towards addressing that particular problem. Under its proposal, vexatious and frivolous suits could be tossed out by courts. That sort of proposal makes the group proceedings proposal much more interesting and attractive. We are looking at the economic considerations. The Government does not move away from considering its reform proposals in the broader context. In that context, we recognise that, as opposed to the CAI's contribution, a 200-page document has been published by the Law Reform Commission canvassing the economic consideration on the private liability issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of the radical nature of the proposals, it is instructive to look at particular provisions in and deviations from the United States situation. For instance, there was no proposal for contingency fees. That is one of the major complaints about the United States situation by industry in this country. In Australia, we do not have punitive damages for the sorts of claims for which the United States does. We can also look at the question of certainty and uncertainty in the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        One matter that has been raised is that of insurance fees. In this context, one consideration that has come before us very strongly, and one we are taking into account, is the American situation. For some time it has been contended that these sorts of proposals would increase insurance fees. We have been told that the insurance industry in the United States is in crisis because of its adoption of such proposals. As I said, we are into constructive assessments of these issues. We recognise, for instance, that in early 1989 the American Bar Association which represents all lawyers, not just defence lawyers, in the United States produced an extensive report denying the existence of an insurance crisis in that country and suggesting that the insurance difficulties there resulted largely from outdated, inefficient procedures in the insurance industry. We are looking at that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also looking at the fact that the concept of group proceedings is already established in a number of States in Australia and under the Trade Practices Commission. We do not even need that example to be able to assess that the concept of group proceedings is not a new one; it has been around for a long time. We also recognise, as do people in the Opposition and industry, in some instances, that there are limitations in the group proceedings proposals and in the regimes that operate in Australia at the moment. Those limitations need to be addressed. As one representative of the CAI said during the week, the Confederation is not opposed to group proceedings as a concept. It has some particular problems with the proposals of the Law Reform Commission. In that respect, it addressed the issue constructively, which is more than can be said for the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, I think I have made it very clear that I do not accept the criticisms of the Opposition. Its matter of public importance is based very much on outdated, reactionary, divisive and hysterical rhetoric. It is rhetoric such as we have come to expect from the Opposition. It is a pity, however, that the Opposition continues to do this because most people in the community are not concerned about politicians taking cheap points on each other. They would rather see a constructive assessment of issues facing them. They would rather see an enhancement of their access rights and the development of a system in Australia in which they can participate as equally and fairly as possible. The Opposition matter of public importance shows the Opposition for what it is: totally irrelevant to the system of government in this country.

         —We are debating this afternoon a matter of public importance raised by Senator Short in these terms:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The threat to both Australian consumers and producers from the promotion of anti-business attitudes and policies including product liability and class actions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Short must be one of the most strident anti-consumer activists in our country. We have heard from him an unjust attack on consumer organisations. Among other things he has said that the consumer movement is never critical of the Government. He has said that it is so heavily funded by the Government that its hands are tied. I would like to cite a couple of instances to give the lie to that claim.
       </para>
       <para>
        First of all, the consumer movement in Australia has been among the most strident critics of this Government for its deregulation of the banking industry and the consequences which flow for those who are most disadvantaged in our community, who have really borne the brunt of the increased charges and reduced services that that deregulation has brought upon us. Of course, Senator Short does not wish to raise that matter because the Opposition, during the process of deregulation, has been green with envy as it was unable to get its act together, in terms of its own ideology, when it was in government. Opposition members have had to see the so-called Hawke socialist Government, as it is often termed on that side of the House, do it for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to quote from a document prepared by the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO), an organisation so berated by Senator Short. AFCO also criticised the Government. In its monthly newsletter, a paper on the recall of unsafe products submitted to the Office of Consumer Affairs within the Attorney-General's Department, it says:
       </para>
       <para>
        AFCO also criticised the Government's failure to introduce class actions into Australia. AFCO believes that class actions are part of the essential tools necessary for adequate consumer protection. The Australian Law Reform Commission has had a reference on class actions for a decade. The present Government has successfully contested the last two elections with a policy supporting class actions. The Government should stop `pussyfooting' around and put its policy commitments into action.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are just two examples of the consumer movement being far from silent when it comes to criticism of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why is this matter before us today? I am sure it is really because Senator Short was wined and dined by the Australian Finance Conference earlier this week. Its objections to the concept of class actions are similar to those expressed by a number of business groups which have taken a particularly knee-jerk reaction to the proposals that have come from the Law Reform Commission on group proceedings and product liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am absolutely unable to see the logic of those critics who, on the one hand, say that these reforms are unnecessary and, on the other hand, say they will be unable to cope with the increased costs they will bring. The Australian Democrats believe the Australian Law Reform Commission deserves to be congratulated on the excellent work it has done in those areas. The reports it has produced are thorough, objective and of great assistance to government and all those involved in law-making in these areas. The Commission has been involved in research and community consultation on these subjects for many years and has comprehensively looked at international practices in order to come up with appropriate proposals for Australia. Just this week we have received Discussion Paper No. 37 on product liability, containing proposed draft legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Short, after complaining that the time scale for comment on this proposed draft legislation is too short, then announced to the Senate that the Opposition is opposed to product liability legislation. If he is going to oppose it he should save his time and not bother to complain that he has not got enough time to look at something which he is determined to oppose anyway. It is a bit shallow to be complaining about the time scale when, since the Law Reform Commission got the reference in September 1987, it has published an issues paper, a major discussion paper and a series of research papers. So anyone interested in this area has not had to wait for this document this week and ought to have at least some of his ideas in some sort of order.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consultation process and the processes generally used involved consultants from business, professional, consumer and academic circles; many meetings; 200 written submissions; and, as I have said, the gathering of international experience as well. Really, the Commission cannot be criticised for lack of consultation on this or any of the other issues that it has dealt with. On the issue of product liability, it is very difficult, I think, to argue with much in the propositions in this area. What, for instance, are the objectives of reform in the area of product liability? The Law Reform Commission's discussion paper gives the two prime objectives under the heading `Matching risks and benefits' and says that legislation in this area:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . should, so far as possible, ensure that the risk of the consequences of the way goods act should be carried by those who obtain economic benefit from manufacturing and supplying them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hardly see how anyone can, in principle, argue with that objective. The second objective is headed `Minimising costs'-something that I should have thought Opposition senators would be absolutely in favour of. Under that heading the paper says:
       </para>
       <para>
        It should not impose unnecessary costs on the manufacture or supply of goods or on the process of determining when compensation is payable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely those are laudable objectives, which I would have expected to have multipartisan support. The paper also notes the desirable characteristics of a product liability scheme. It says that any system of rules should:
       </para>
       <para>
        require manufacturers and suppliers of goods to bear the risks of the way the goods act
       </para>
       <para>
        take proper account of other causes of particular losses-
       </para>
       <para>
        and again we see these words-
       </para>
       <para>
        minimise costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the heading `Conclusions' the paper says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has concluded that the existing law does not have the desirable characteristics of a law governing liability for loss or damage caused by goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shortcomings are listed, but since all honourable senators have copies of the paper I shall not take the time of the Senate by reading them out. I want to turn to class actions and a number of other issues. The `Conclusions' paragraph ends by saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        These shortcomings mean that manufacturers and suppliers do not carry the risks when they should, with the result that the price of goods does not reflect all the costs associated with them-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is obviously the costs to consumers-
       </para>
       <para>
        and that persons do not have adequate access to the means of enforcing their rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taking into consideration the fact that that assessment was made after two years of work and broad consultation on this issue, I believe that it is clear that we do need further reform in the area of product liability legislation. Certainly the Australian Democrats support that view. I think that it is worth including here a comment from the Opposition spokesperson on these matters, Mr John Moore, who was quoted in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 27 February. The article says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission's proposals for product-liability law reform is opposed by Mr Moore because it would place `a much heavier onus of proof' on companies defending their products.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the onus of proof should not be on those reaping the benefit of the product, I really do not know where it ought to be. If I am a consumerist for saying that, so be it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to put on the record the Democrats' long-standing support for class actions. We are determined that such an important area will not be allowed to slip down the priority list of this Government. That is not to be overly critical of the contribution of the present Minister, who, I believe, is attempting to push a somewhat reluctant Government down this track. Group proceedings are really about two things-access and efficiency. They are not about the imposition of new regulations on business for their own sake; they are about ensuring that if there is a law, businesses comply with it, and consumers have the opportunity to seek redress if the law is broken. Consumers need access. If Senator Short or anyone else wants to argue against that, he will have to take the heat from an electorate which is saying more and more clearly that both the Australian Labor Party and the Liberals should stop putting the interests of big business above those of ordinary Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Group proceedings are also about efficiency-the efficient use of the courts to enable a large number of people with the same case to protect their rights in a way that is feasible. Actions that are currently not viable will become viable. Courts will be able to deal in one go with a group of similar actions and this will result in considerable savings for all concerned, not just the consumers. The law, as it stands at the moment, precludes many Australians with valid complaints over faulty products from gaining effective legal redress. Some of those faulty products end in the deaths of some of those people. It will be fairer to people who now lose out because they cannot afford to go to law. By joining others in the same boat they will be able to gain compensation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are also benefits for the defendants-those whom Senator Short defends so roundly-namely: reduced costs through basic economies of scale when a defendant can defend all the claims in one action, in one location at one time. Inconsistent results are avoided and the decision is binding on the whole class, thereby resolving the issue once and for all. Settlement negotiations are concentrated and, as a consequence, settlement is approached on a commercial footing rather than the lack of a clear picture which may result in overly generous payments or an unrealistically low figure which has been fixed because of a fear of the commercial consequences of other claims that might come forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are also advantages for the courts. Most notably, the business of the court can be performed with the maximum judicial economy. This ensures that some inefficiency in the administration of justice is not what determines right or wrong. Those who are opposed to class actions rely heavily on the fear of a massive increase in the costs of litigation and they cite the United States of America experience as to why this evil proposal should be resisted. However, they fail to acknowledge that the proposals of the Law Reform Commission differ markedly from United States laws and also that, in any case, the United States is a far more litigious society than Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The claim that business will gain no benefits from the introduction of group proceedings is not correct. I have already outlined a number of benefits that would be available for defendants. Claims that honest and hardworking businesses would be severely disadvantaged by these proposals really have no basis. Quite the opposite is true. Unscrupulous businesses would be adversely affected and that would advantage the reputable ones. At the moment, if there is anti-business sentiment anywhere, it is based on the actions and the responses to those actions in the community. Actions of irresponsible and unscrupulous businesses are probably in the minority since most of our businesses are small businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Claims that there would be an increase in government regulation are really hard to justify. There are a number of areas where, currently, it is feasible only for government to act due to those financial barriers that exist for so many consumers but which, under class actions, could be handled by the consumers themselves. This is really a kind of privatisation of regulation. I would have thought that it should have had the support of the privatisation zealots on my right and I hope that it will gain the support of the deregulationists on my left. Perhaps the Opposition would like to address this inconsistency in its ideology.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are also claims that the cost to the business community would be too onerous. I have already outlined a number of ways in which there would be savings. If there is an increased cost it will be because many people who are currently justified in claiming compensation are prevented from doing so because of the high cost of initiating individual legal proceedings. Anyone who says that this situation does not need to be addressed is saying in essence that, if damage of $1m is caused to one person, it is quite proper for the person responsible to be held liable to pay compensation. But if damage of $500 is caused to 2,000 people the person responsible is free of liability. Of course, that is a morally indefensible position.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Short's matter of public importance raises the issue of anti-business sentiments and he regularly targets the Australian Democrats, community organisations and consumer groups in his ideological diatribe. It is a matter of enormous importance that we do not fall foul of this ideology. I was disappointed to hear Senator Bolkus saying that the Government is looking at proposals. The Democrats and consumer groups in this country will continue to keep the pressure up for action. Neither we nor the consumer groups in this country will be afraid to be critical of this Government while it only talks and does not act in the interests of Australian consumers.

         —In supporting this matter of public importance put forward by Senator Short, I want to look at the actual proposals that the Law Reform Commission outlined in its latest paper-paper No. 37; the implications of how those proposals compare with the directive of the European Community; the situation in the United States; and the consequences for the Australian economy. I begin by drawing attention to the terms of reference given to the Law Reform Commission for its discussion paper and its subsequent draft legislation. The Commission was to have regard to `the cost to individuals and the community arising from injuries and damage caused by defective or unsafe goods'. The point is made by the specific reference to `defective or unsafe goods' that there is a standard. Senator Powell assumes that somewhere out there in the community there are vast numbers of people who are deterred, because of cost, from taking action in respect of damages. That is a totally unsubstantiated and very emotional claim. Although the Law Reform Commission is directed to pay attention to that matter, there is no evidence in any of its discussion papers that it has done so.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Commission was to have regard to `the cost to business and the community, and any effects on the cost and availability of insurance and on product innovation and availability, of any increase in the liability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers in relation to defective or unsafe goods'. It was also to have regard to the relevant law and experience of other countries. I would like to quote from research paper No. 2, entitled Product Liability: Economic Impacts which was put-out by Mr Richard Braddock, a Senior Lecturer in Economics at Macquarie University and a consultant to the Commission. I feel that this reasonably thick tome is almost without worth at all in terms of what it contributes to the real meaning of what costs would be incurred in the community. The conclusion in this tome states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, to conclude-
       </para>
       <para>
        to begin with, note the tautology-
       </para>
       <para>
        on the effects of the ALRC's proposed changes to the product liability laws, these are essentially marginal changes to the existing system, and are not likely to have a significantly larger impact than the shift to manufacturer and importer liability of the 1978 Fraser government amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is clearly unsustainable. It continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The gainers will be those who previously have been inhibited from claiming just compensation for product related loss or injury, including bystanders. In particular, to the extent that higher care levels mean fewer injuries-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is an implication that care is not presently being taken-
       </para>
       <para>
        the community is also better off. Any reduction in child injuries, since the rules of `buyer beware' can hardly apply to children, will be welcomed by everyone. The community will also gain from the more efficient delivery of compensation to victims and lower burdens on taxpayers in this respect.

        Australian goods are also likely to benefit from their enhanced quality at home and on foreign markets, especially as the Europeans have adopted similar policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Specifically on that point, numbers of Australian exporters have been interested in exporting manufactured Australian products into the United States only to find that the importers in the United States will insist that the Australian manufacturer in fact indemnifies them against product liability suits and, as such, the export becomes uneconomic. The conclusion continues:

       <para>
        Harmonisation with the European standards may convey significant advantages in trade. The losers will be the less responsible firms, the supplier of inherently unsafe goods, and certain categories of small business. This latter group warrants some special attention, especially in regard to the provision of appropriate insurance.

        That was something that this Commission was supposed to have investigated. It continues:

        Over all, the impact on the total community is likely to be a net benefit, especially for adults and children who are potential recipients of product related injuries.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all those statements there is an implied concern about unsafe goods or the quality of goods. Yet the proposed regime-and I use the word `regime' deliberately because that is what the Commission itself talks about imposing-gets rid of the concept of any standard of any duty of care of any defence which would rest on the need to prove that goods were either unsafe or of unacceptable quality. For the report to say that these changes are marginal to the system is, to put it mildly, an untrue statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me give one example of a particular manufacturer in this country which has a sister organisation in the United States of America, where product liability does exist. In Australia, in terms of manufacturers, the cost of insurance to this particular firm is 0.9 per cent of turnover, 0.9 per cent of sales. In the United States, because of the cost of product liability insurance, the cost is 2.09 per cent. In other words, the difference is 2 per cent of sales. As most manufacturing businesses work on a return of something like 8 per cent, it is one-quarter of profits. If that is compared to other expenditure that is used in the manufacturing sector, top firms engaged in first grade research and development to improve their products usually spend something like 2 per cent of turnover. We are looking at adding a cost into this system in Australia. We are trying to be cost competitive in export goods, yet we have a non-productive cost of some 2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to examine how the product liability concept has grown up in the United States, how it is now developing in the United Kingdom, what the present position is here and how the regime will alter fundamentally the way in which the law operates here. Firstly, the United States system is a common law based system. It does not have a legislative base. It grew out of the concept of strict liability. Various writers in text books will tell us this arose out of the concept of enterprise based legislation which spread the risk for industrial damage to the employers who were the most able to pay. The concept finally came to its present position in about 1972 when Justice Traynor in the case of Escola and Coca Cola changed the test for foreseeability and the duty of care owed from intended use of the produced good to one of reasonably foreseeable use.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the decade preceding 1988 and the 15 years following that decision the number of product liability cases that have come before the courts in the United States has tripled. It is still growing. It has had dramatic effects on particular industries. In newspaper articles and the like one finds many people writing of individual cases, one-off cases. I think it perhaps is more useful to look at whole industries. I would cite the light aircraft industry, which has been virtually destroyed in the United States by product liability actions. In 1978, for instance, 18,000 light aeroplanes were produced in the United States. In 1988, 600 were produced. The reduction in number was simply because of the number of product liability law suits. The result is that the safety margin in light aircraft-and perhaps one could say large aircraft also-has diminished because now the planes which are being sold are not new planes with upgraded technology but are old aircraft. They are constantly being repaired and are consequently less safe and have no new improvements in technology. Thus the aircraft flying now are less safe and that is directly attributable to product liability legislation. Even the component part manufacturers for the light aircraft industry could not afford to face the law suits for product liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the United Kingdom the position up until now has been the same as it has been in Australia-that is, that liability for unsafe or unmerchantable quality has lain in two areas: actions brought in tort and actions brought in contract. The history of the law is such that the common law does develop to meet needs. In 1932 we saw a particularly important development in the law of tort with the development of Donoghue v. Stevenson-that well-known case of the decomposed snail in the bottle of ginger ale, where somebody bought the bottle of ginger ale and gave it to a friend who drank one glass of the ginger ale before the decomposed snail arrived. She suffered shock and gastroenteritis and sought a remedy. There was no contractual relationship. The question was whether the manufacturer of the bottle of soft drink owed a duty of care to the person who drank it-that is, the consumer, who had no opportunity to examine the contents.
       </para>
       <para>
        The House of Lords finally decided in favour of the plaintiff. An important new development in the common law was established-that is, that the concept of the duty of care was broadened to include people who were in a relationship of close proximity to the manufacturer so that a duty of care lay. Had the Law Reform Commission chosen to develop the theory of maintaining a tortious base to product liability we would have had a totally different set of outcomes. It has chosen to develop the strict liability concept, which means that the question of fault, the question of unsafe or unacceptable quality, becomes irrelevant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The test is then this. I will give an example which I think it is quite possible we could see under this proposed regime. We have all become familiar with the case in the United Kingdom right now of baby foods having razor blades, drawing pins, needles and the like placed into that food in a way which cannot be detected. Under the proposed regime, to be introduced by the Law Reform Commission, the person who is liable for any injury suffered because of the behaviour of the goods is the manufacturer. It specifically provides that the manufacturer is to be the prime defendant. He cannot abrogate that defence. If the case occurred here and this regime was in place, any baby or person who swallowed part of those razor blades or whatever could sue the manufacturer despite the fact that the person who is clearly inserting those harmful objects is a would-be blackmailer who is trying to get the firm to pay extortionate amounts in order to try to keep its good name. The only right that the manufacturer would have would be one of recovery against the person or persons who inserted the dangerous goods into its product. Even that could be at doubt, because most of the remedies for contribution or for recovery rest on the basis of being a tortfeasor, which in turn relies on the concept of fault which is being abolished by those proposals. Mr Hawke, in addressing the Business Council of Australia, made this rather splendid statement in 1984:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am convinced that after 84 years of federation, we have accumulated an excessive and often irrelevant obstructive body of laws and regulations. We seek your assistance in removing from this accumulation as many as possible of those laws and regulations which serve no clear and useful purpose. We see the removal of unnecessary regulation contributing significantly to improved economic growth performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we want to see this country remain competitive, to gain that competitive edge, to increase our number of exports, to enable the consumer-and that means all of us-to enjoy reasonably priced products, then we will reject the concept of product liability as outlined in the Law Reform Commission's paper, the latest one which has just come to hand. It is not a question which can be ideologically resolved. The ideological thrust behind the proposal is that the cost of manufactured goods should reflect any possible damages which may result from any damage that flows from the act of those goods. As I said, that is an ideological base. It is one that this country cannot afford. We are at a crisis point and if our manufacturing sector is to have a chance, then we must reject this proposal.

        Present in the chamber today are Senator Maguire, Senator Walsh and Senator Jones, who are eager to struggle with the economic problems and industrial difficulties within this country. No doubt, they were hoping that some debate might be raised this afternoon about such things as tax cuts, exports and imports, wages, working conditions, the manufacturing base of this country, business investment and unemployment, especially with the Tasmanian election coming on. As I understand it, unemployment in Tasmania is running at over 10 per cent, which is worse than mainland Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the matter that the Opposition wishes to bring forward today? It is not bringing forward any legislation or any proposal that is before this Parliament or that has been put forward by the Government or itself; it brings forward two discussion papers. That is what we are talking about today. The Australian Law Reform Commission has brought forward two discussion papers so that the community can discuss two quite separate issues. One is the question of class actions, which are a procedure that courts might adopt so that issues that come before them may be more readily and cheaply disposed of. The other issue concerns where the responsibility should lie when somebody is injured. Those are the two issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Reform Commission was asked to consider those two issues. The first one, the question of class actions, was referred to it on 1 February 1977 by the then Attorney-General under the Liberal-National Party Government, Mr Robert James Ellicott. He brought the class action discussion before the public. That is the matter we are discussing today. He was the Attorney-General in a Liberal Government 12 years ago. The other issue of product liability was brought forward on the reference of Mr Lionel Frost Bowen, the present Attorney-General under the Labor Government. That was referred in September 1987. There was 10 years between the two references. Perhaps Senator Calvert can answer this question: Instead of our talking about the economy of this country and the issues that really do face this nation, why do they bring before the Senate for debate on a Friday afternoon, when we are on air, two discussion papers which were asked for 10 years apart and somehow run them together, and from that erect a model, some sort of case, which is meant, in some way, to be a criticism of this Government?

She says that, because of all these actions that are brought to get compensation, to get money for injuries that people have suffered, American industry has suffered and suffered severely. She does not want that sort of thing to happen in Australia. But then she goes on and praises the 1932 case of Donoghue v. Stevenson. She says that we should have let the theories and the decisions that the judge made in that case govern the way the law ought to run in this country. But of course the very basis used in the United States for suing for negligently putting products on the market, indeed the very basis for claims against doctors, lawyers and manufacturers, is Donoghue v. Stevenson.

They say that if a person has had his eye gouged out by some sort of instrument that he has bought in a shop, it is just bad luck. If that person cannot prove negligence, having gone through the expensive exercise of court cases and getting experts in and perhaps losing the cases, that is too bad. Senator Short and Senator Bishop say that if people sue for injuries they have suffered as a result of a product they have bought, that is socialism; it is bad.

There was absolutely nothing-no word, no scintilla of sympathy-in his speech today or in the case put by the Opposition for the person who can be devastated by the sorts of products that people can and are provided with by manufacturers.

The small manufacturers will not be affected by this; the insurance industry will be affected-an industry that puts forward, whenever one talks to its representatives, the idea of loss shifting or loss sharing. There is an opportunity here for that industry to loss shift, to loss share, in respect of people who are injured as a result of some sort of instrument or food that is put on the market.

        There is great criticism of class actions. Class actions are simply a procedural action; it is not a substantive issue. It is simply that a court or a litigant should be provided with another way of bringing his, her or its case before the court. In the Greek conspiracy case, police knocked on people's doors in the early hours of the morning and late at night and dragged people off to court. Later, they had to be compensated. Over 200 people were involved. It is proper in such cases that there should be a procedure whereby such people can sue in the one action rather than go through the trauma and torture of instigating 200 actions. Having been an old hack lawyer myself in my day, I should welcome 200 separate cases, but the public might think it proper to keep legal costs down. Members of the public might well think that where 200 people want to instigate the same action-that is, the same set of facts are to be dealt with-one action might be cheaper; and that is correct.

        It is remarkable that when there are great issues to be debated, the Opposition should debate proposals-and they are no more than proposals put forward for discussion-by putting together two discussion papers which were asked for, 10 years apart, by two different Attorneys-General from two different political parties, by saying that there is some sort of set-up by this Government. That is false. The Opposition then states that people who have suffered fierce injuries should be denied compensation for those injuries simply because-and this is theoretical; it has brought forward no facts or figures-this will somehow affect our manufacturing industry. It is just wrong. Having heard the speeches of members of the opposition, I hope that they withdraw their matter of public importance.

        Senator Bishop spoke about product liability and class actions and Senator Short raised a very important matter; that is that some consumer organisations in Australia have been worrying consumers and producers alike with some of the actions that they have carried out over a period. In most cases they were politically inspired. Having said that, I will move on to what I have to say. I have nothing to say about the two papers to which Senator Cooney referred. This matter of public importance points out the threat to both Australian consumers and producers from the promotion of anti-business attitudes and policies including product liability and class actions. It is a sad indictment of the manner in which the Hawke Labor Government has assumed responsibility of the Australian community. It is sad that matters have deteriorated to the point where we, as a coalition, have been forced to bring this matter forward today. We were left with no choice because as things stand there are no winners in the Australian community at present, there are only losers.

        My colleagues, as I said previously, and Senator Short in particular, have told the Senate how the Government has supported organisations that have had the effect of forcing higher prices on consumers and more pressures on producers. In my short address today I intend to give one or two examples of how Government policies are directly affecting both producers and consumers in this country. Senator Short quite rightly said that no-one hears from the Government-sponsored consumer groups about the crippling effects of interest rates, high inflation, work practices and government charges that are being foisted upon small business. I know that Senator Parer has some very solid views on that matter. Australia has an 18 1/2 per cent interest rate compared to Japan which has an interest rate of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent. We have an inflation rate locked in of 7 per cent, whereas Japan has something like one per cent. Why would our producers not think that this particular Government is forcing anti-business policies upon them? The same goes for the consumers. We have the highest taxing government in Australian history, we have no incentive to save and taxes and inflation are rampant. Tax cuts have just been handed out, but within the next 12 months, the way inflation is going, 50 per cent of Australian wage earners will be back on the highest tax bracket anyway.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no question that businesses are continuing to close at an alarming rate around the country. They do so because of increasing government charges and taxes which are being forced upon them, and because this Government has failed to recognise the importance of business, particularly small business, in our economy today. The Government, in its rampant desire to appease the union movement, has forgotten the importance which business, particularly the small business man or woman, plays in the Australian economy. This attack on the Australian producers has not been to the benefit of consumers; indeed, in all cases it has been to their detriment as consumers battle a never ending array of increased prices and charges, a lack of choice and decreasing product standards because of the action of this Government. I will mention one example. One would find very few restaurants open in Tasmania on a Sunday night because of restrictive work practices and the high wages and overtime penalties imposed on restaurateurs. They just cannot afford to open. One must say that the Government is encouraging these sorts of things. This is a reason why small business is suffering. There is no reason to assume that producers and consumers are in opposition. Indeed, both are mutually dependent upon each other for survival. My colleagues have been saying in the debate today that the policies of this Government are definitely anti-consumer and anti-producer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to examine briefly some of the attempts by this Government which have left consumers and producers far worse off than they were when Mr Hawke and the Australian Labor Party came to office. Senator Short mentioned the national prices network. I would like to reply to some comments that were made by Senator Bolkus in anticipation of what I may say today. Senator Bolkus referred to the Tasmanian Price Watch and mentioned that, in my underhanded way, I had come up here to Canberra saying things about that organisation. I have never said anything underhanded about Tasmanian Price Watch. I have been very open in what I have said. Unfortunately, I have not been able to get the publicity that the Tasmanian Price Watch has received. By making ridiculous accusations and claims on prices in Tasmania that organisation has been getting a headline every day. But when one tries to tell the truth about the way it is being run, one is accused of being underhanded.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that Price Watch in Tasmania has been shown to be, as have quite a few other price watch bodies around the country, nothing but a cheap political exercise. I am very concerned, as is anybody else, about people being overcharged. I and my colleagues have been saying all along that we are concerned about the methodology of this Price Watch. We are concerned about the way old and unsuspecting people in our community are being duped into supporting these schemes by thinking they are working for an independent organisation when in fact they are working for the Labor Party. We have made that claim consistently. I do not believe it is being underhanded to bring to the attention of our constituents what we believe is a threat to their integrity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Bolkus commented on the fact that supposedly because of this, we had a price inquiry in Tasmania that cost $200,000. I could inform the Minister, if he were here-he is obviously putting out the press release at the moment-that we have a State Minister for Consumer Affairs who, in his wisdom, decided to have a price inquiry because of the on-going concern everybody in Tasmania has for prices. Tasmanian price watch was not needed, nor do I believe it should take the credit for that inquiry. As I have said on many occasions-and this has not been reported to any great extent-at least the inquiry held by the State Minister for Consumer Affairs did have some credibility which is more than can be said for what is going on in Tasmania now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before price watch came on the scene, Fran Bladel, a Labor member of the Tasmanian Parliament, tried in her own way to bring to the attention of the public concern about prices. In her own way she was doing a very good job. We have a State Minister for Consumer Affairs and a government that are also interested in what was going on. We did not need a high-flying organisation. I think its introduction was a cynical exercise. There is no doubt that this whole exercise was run so that the Labor Party member for Denison, Mr Duncan Colquhoun Kerr, could `meet the people' and could get himself known.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is no secret that the Government made available $87,000 to a favoured few Labor Party politicians around Australia so that they could pursue their particular ambitions and put out doubtful literature on prices. George Gear and Duncan Kerr have both admitted from time to time that Price Watch is having very little effect on prices, but have said that politically it is a good idea. In Denison, we find that Mr Duncan Kerr had a great opportunity to promote himself. He had the opportunity to put his first wife on the payroll and give her a fax machine and extra facilities paid for by the taxpayer. I am then accused of being underhanded for drawing to the attention of the people what is really going on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anyone who ever doubted that the price task force was anything other than a political exercise may like to consider one or two passages which come from its own manual or confidential Caucus document which was headed, `The Price Task Force How to Kit'. It states:

        The attempt by the Hawke Government to cripple the Australian pharmacists concerns me greatly. It is a very good example of the anti-business, anti-consumer policies the Government is pursuing at the moment. It will cause immeasurable harm to consumers, especially pensioners and those who can least afford it. Australian pharmacists represent one of the finest examples of small businessmen and women in our community. They are most accessible to health professionals and they supply one of the lowest cost prescriptions in the world. Through its meddling with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the wish of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) to reduce the costs by something like $300m, in the last 12 months chemists have lost on average $250 a week from wholesale margin decisions and another $125 a week from maximum quantities decisions.

         —Regardless of the Minister's interjections, the fact is that something like 5,600 pharmacists are dispensing $143m in prescriptions annually. The Government's pharmaceutical legislation aimed at reducing payments to pharmacies by something like $283m will force widespread closure of premises. More than 35,000 Australians are employed in pharmacies nationwide. It is expected that at least 1,000 pharmacies will be forced into liquidation by the year 1991 under the Government's program and another 40 per cent of these pharmacies will become unprofitable. So much for the anti-business, anti-consumer policies of the Government.

        Statement by the Minister Representing the Treasurer
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided that the twelfth national census of population and housing will be conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1991, as required by the Census and Statistics Act 1905.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regulations specifying the topics to be included in the census in accordance with section 8 of the Census and Statistics Act were tabled earlier this week.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order that the Parliament and the general public should be fully informed on the questions to be asked in the census, I shall table, at the conclusion of this statement, an Australian Bureau of Statistics information paper entitled, `1991 Census of Population and Housing: Content and Procedures' which describes the topics to be included and the procedures for conducting the census. Final wording of questions and definitions and the sequencing of questions will be decided once all testing for the census has been completed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The census is the most wide-ranging collection undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as it involves contact with every household in the nation. It provides a considerable amount of information used extensively for planning, administration, policy development and evaluation. It provides a statistical snapshot of the whole population in terms of number, age, geographical distribution, and a range of other characteristics. Users of census statistics include Government agencies at the Federal, State and local level; social service organisations; churches; research institutions; businesses; and private individuals. The vast statistical output from the census is available to everyone in the community through the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided that the 1991 Census will cover 7 topics about the household and 24 topics about people in the household. Topics included in 1991 represent a reduced content, compared with the 1986 Census, with 5 topics in the 1986 Census not considered sufficiently justified on cost-benefit grounds for inclusion in 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the ethnic origin topic will not be included in the 1991 Census, comprehensive information on the ethnicity of the population will still be available. Questions will be asked on birthplace, birthplace of parents, year of arrival in Australia, citizenship, Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander origin, language use and religion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The inclusion of additional topics was requested by users, but the topics selected by the Government are considered to represent a reasonable balance between the need for information, the appropriateness of the census as a means of collecting particular kinds of data, the cost of the undertaking and the need to ensure that completing the forms does not impose too great a burden on the public.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government recognises that asking questions of householders in order to obtain statistical information involves a degree of intrusiveness and places a workload on the community. The Government has aimed to minimise both load and intrusion but nevertheless accepts that some degree of each is necessary to support the information required for efficient planning and administration. For most households the completion of census forms requires at the most half an hour every five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The population census affects every household in Australia and it is essential that public co-operation and acceptance be obtained in order to achieve the high quality response that has been a feature of recent censuses. For this reason a public awareness campaign will be conducted prior to and during the census. The aim of the campaign will be to maintain high quality response to the census by convincing the public of the usefulness of the statistics obtained and the confidentiality of the information provided. The availability of assistance for those who may, for language or other reasons, experience difficulty in completing the form will also be made known.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government places great significance on the census as a means of collecting important social and economic data which is of primary concern to a wide range of users. It is recognised that to be of maximum utility such data must be both accurate and timely. Consequently the Government has decided that the census will be conducted without sampling and that all forms collected at the 1991 Census will be processed fully and without delay so that detailed information will be available to users as soon as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of organisations and individuals have requested that information on identified persons and households not be destroyed, but be transferred in some form to archives with access after a specified period. The Government rejects this request.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the census is to gather statistical information and the legal power of the Statistician to direct people to answer census questions, except one relating to religion, is accompanied by strict measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information provided. The Government believes that it would be inconsistent with that purpose and with that guarantee of confidentiality to retain information on identified persons or households.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision to not retain information on identified persons and households was reached after arguments for and against their retention had been carefully weighed. A relevant factor was the very real fear that public confidence in the census, and hence the willingness of individuals to provide full and accurate information about themselves, could be undermined. A further consideration was the substantial costs which would be incurred in storing and accessing the records.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, as a measure of the importance which the Government places on protecting the privacy of Australians, it has been decided that the past practice of destroying all records of names and addresses of persons and households and of not storing these names and addresses on computer files will be continued. The destruction of records will be carried out in accordance with authorisation under the Archives Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Statistics Advisory Council has devoted a considerable amount of time to considering plans for the 1991 Census and its conclusions have been of great assistance to the Government in reaching its decisions.

      <para>
       (1) The Commonwealth Government expects nursing homes to provide a safe environment for residents, staff and visitors. This requirement is one of thirty-one standards stated in ``Living in a Nursing Home: Outcome Standards for Australian Nursing Homes''. This publication specifies quality of life and care outcomes for nursing home residents. Nursing home standards monitoring teams focus on the achievement of the outcome, that is, that residents are safe, rather than the mere presence of inputs or processes relating to safety.
      </para>
      <para>
       The legal basis for the safety requirement is stated in Special Gazette No. S303 ``National Health Act 1953-Section 45d: Standards for Nursing Home Care'', Standard No. 6, which states:

       The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following information in respect of hospitals catering for veterans, and day care centres.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Repatriation Commission ensures that Repatriation General Hospitals (RGHs), Repatriation Auxiliary Hospitals, the Anzac Hostel and the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres maintain all Commonwealth, State and local standards that promote a safe environment for patients and visitors. These standards are also followed in the day care centres operating in RGHs. For staff working in these institutions, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) has occupational health and safety programs. Procedures are also aligned with those set by the Australian Council of Hospital Standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the Commission does not operate any nursing homes, social workers at the RGHs ensure that privately-operated nursing homes that receive Repatriation patients meet Department of Community Services and Health requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to day care centres part financed by the DVA, occupational therapists from RGHs ensure that operating organisations adhere to the required safety standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Nursing homes are not specifically funded to meet safety standards. They are provided a standard grant per resident to provide for basic infrastructure services within the nursing home (for example, food, rent, maintenance). The service provider must decide how to spend this income to meet, among other things, the safety requirements for residents, staff, equipment and building.
      </para>
      <para>
       Funding for child care services under the Commonwealth's Children's Services Program is conditional on the service being licensed by the relevant authority.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) State Governments receive nursing home benefits for each resident accommodated in a State Government nursing home. It is the responsibility of the State Government and the nursing home administrators to allocate their budget to meet safety requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Capital grants under the Children's Services Program are based on the actual cost of the project and as such will cover the variety of physical safety requirements directly associated with the building housing the service.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The nursing home safety standards are monitored by standards monitoring teams, which visit homes at least annually. Where these teams find non-compliance with any standards, including safety standards, they negotiate with service providers to ensure that these standards are met. Where serious and/or persistent non-compliance occurs, the Commonwealth Government, as well as the State Government as appropriate, can invoke powers against the nursing home proprietors. In general, negotiation with service providers is conducted on a cooperative basis to ensure a positive address of non-compliance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Commonwealth recurrent funding is not directed specifically toward meeting safety requirements. The Commonwealth provides a contribution to operational costs which assists services to meet licensing requirements. Other Commonwealth funds are attracted through fee relief subsidies for low to moderate income families.

       (2) The report referred to at Part 1 of this question did not specifically recommended a study into reducing ships' outfits of ammunition as a means of reducing hazards posed by ammunitioning operations in Sydney Harbour. The report observed that a study could be done to weigh the benefits of reduced outfit levels on rates of ammunitioning in Sydney Harbour against the penalties of reduced ships' outfits. The report also observed that in conjunction with other procedural measures, only substantial reductions in ammunition outfits, in the order of 50% are required before staging of loaded barges at Spectacle Island could be removed. This is operationally unsatisfactory to Navy. Further, there is insufficient ashore storage space in the Sydney area to accommodate such quantities of ammunition if it were removed from ships.

       Having regard for the infrastructure and capital investment, there is no satisfactory practicable alternative to the modernisation of Garden Island Dockyard.
      </para>
      <para>
       The alternative to modernising the fleet base facilities in the Garden Island area, which form only part of the fleet base in Port Jackson, would be to relocate the fleet base. At an estimated cost of $230m, this would be vastly more expensive than modernising fleet base facilities at Garden Island (costed at $50 to $60m) and cannot be justified at this time.
      </para>
      <para>
       The appropriate course of action is to modernise Garden Island Dockyard and the fleet base facilities in the Garden Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the long term it may become necessary to relocate some of the fleet base from Port Jackson. This should be to Jervis Bay as it has outstanding advantages over alternative locations for a fleet base in south-east Australia. Initial possibilities are an armament depot and wharf.

      <para>
       The existing arrangements for handling ammunition in Sydney are unsatisfactory and require replacement as a matter of urgency.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other facilities for Fleet Units in Sydney have many shortcomings, in particular there is insufficient room for growth of the Fleet Base at Garden Island and the Submarine Base at HMAS PLATYPUS. In the long term these facilities which are already under pressure will become quite inadequate and will have to be relocated.
      </para>
      <para>
       Facilities for replenishment of stores (ammunition, fuel, food, etc), should be collocated with facilities for maintenance (for fleet base) so that ships can return to their operating areas as quickly as possible. It is therefore highly desirable that a new armament depot be built as close as possible to Sydney to allow it to be used in concert with other existing facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nevertheless, the armament depot should if possible be located in a port with the capacity to accommodate a fleet base later.
      </para>
      <para>
       Jervis Bay, 160km south of Sydney, is an ideal site for an armament depot and has the space available for a fleet base. From the naval operational point of view Jervis Bay is clearly the most practical site for both these facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The only other ports on the east coast of Australia which are at all suitable for the construction of an armament depot are Port Curtis (Gladstone), Brisbane, Westernport, and Hobart. Provision of an armament depot at Port Curtis, Brisbane or Westernport would be much more expensive than Jervis Bay, and construction time would be substantially longer because of the need for long access roads and bridges or viaducts. Because of their long approaches these three ports are susceptible to mining and mine clearance would produce a prodigious task. An armament depot at Hobart would present unacceptable logistic problems.

       In my discussions with ESAC, I supported the continuing work of ESAC in developing a National Strategy for the Conservation of Species and Habitats Threatened with Extinction. I am aware that ESAC will require some funding to enable them to carry out their activities and have indicated to the Committee that there was a possibility of funding being sought in the 1990/91 financial year for this purpose. In the meantime a significant contribution has been made to these important activities through the reallocation of existing resources within ANPWS and through the decision to appoint a number of staff to the Endangered Species Unit.

       (e) and (f) Australia has strongly supported the initiative of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to develop a Convention on Biological Diversity. Australia was represented at the meeting of a UNEP ad hoc working group which met in November 1988 and its report forms the basis for the relevant agenda papers at the UNEP Governing Council in May 1989. The Governing Council is being asked to endorse the conclusion that there is a need for a new global legal instrument for conservation of biological diversity and to map out a process to achieve this. Australia will take an active interest in putting in train steps to conclude a treaty at the earliest time practicable. This process will include the convening of a diplomatic conference at the appropriate point in the negotiating process. Australia would give serious consideration to hosting a diplomatic conference if that were seen by the international community to be helpful in achieving the result desired.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Do statements in the 1986 Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that camera surveillance failed at 82 out of 147 nuclear facilities, that `existing photographic systems . . . are fast becoming obsolete' and that the `change-over from photographic to video equipment . . . is not likely to increase the effectiveness of surveillance' show that surveillance is not, and will not become, an effective element of the IAEA safeguards regime.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Given that the SIR found that the accountancy verification goal at facilities other than reactors `was set at between 1.6 and 5.8 SQ [significant quantities] in 6 cases relating to plutonium', does this mean that one SQ of plutonium, enough to make at least one nuclear bomb, could have been diverted from those 6 facilities without detection in the event of a failure of containment or surveillance.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Do other verification problems reported in the SIR, namely: (a) 17 failures of physical inventory verification at `major' facilities other than reactors; (b) the IAEA's inability to verify some previously unverified inventories; (c) the incomplete verification of direct-use material outside reactor cores; (d) an inadequate number of inspectors in 6 states; (e) long delays in the computer entry of data from complicated inspections; (f) delays in analysing inspection samples; (g) delays by states in presenting accounting reports and notifying the IAEA of nuclear material transfers; (h) the inability to verify the flow of nuclear materials; and (i) the need to assess the unreported production of plutonium, show that the theft or diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material from Nuclear Proliferation Treaty non-nuclear weapon states could have occurred in 1986 without being detected by the IAEA particularly in the event of a combination of safeguards failures at one facility.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Given the conclusion in the SIR that it `is usually more difficult to attain the inspection goal fully at facilities where large amounts of material are difficult to verify than at smaller facilities', will an expansion of the nuclear industry, particularly the projected expansion of reprocessing facilities for recycling plutonium in mixed-oxide fuels, lead to increased opportunities for the undetected theft or diversion of weapons-usable plutonium and uranium.

       (6) Is Canada the country described in example 1, paragraph 99 of the SIR for which verification activities were incomplete in 1986; if not, which country is being referred to; if so, were inspection goals not attained with respect to some or all of the 99 tonnes of Australian uranium converted to uranium hexafluoride in Canada in 1986.
      </para>

       (7) Is Italy the country described in example 2, paragraph 99 of the SIR for which verification activities were incomplete in 1986; if not, which country is being referred to; if so, does this mean that inspection goals were not attained with respect to Australian origin nuclear material (AONM) received by Italy before or during 1986 through Euratom retransfers or swap procedures.

        —The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. The statement that the existing surveillance systems were becoming obsolete was a reference to the fact that the make of camera being used was going out of production. The statement that the replacement video equipment was not likely to increase the effectiveness of surveillance meant just that: the new equipment would not increase effectiveness but neither would it decrease effectiveness. The new equipment was being introduced mainly because the existing cameras were going out of production. The full quote from the 1986 SIR is that `surveillance failed to provide conclusive results' at 82 out of 147 installations where surveillance equipment was used. This does not refer to mechanical failures, but is in fact an acknowledgement of the effect of recent changes in nuclear fuel cycle technology on established safeguards procedures. The Agency is currently providing for additional measures which will be applicable in the event of inconclusive surveillance. At present, even without these additional measures, inconclusive surveillance does not mean diversion would go undetected as surveillance is complemented by other safeguards techniques and information.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The accountancy verification goal (AVG) for a particular facility is established having regard to the IAEA's timeliness criteria, ie diversion of the AVG should be detectable within a predetermined time interval depending on the type of material concerned. An AVG of greater than 1 SQ does not imply that nuclear material balance accountancy is not capable of detecting a diversion of less than the AVG. Further, although the AVG is set independently of other safeguards measures, such as containment, surveillance and inspection, these measures are used to complement accountancy measures. It is highly improbable that both containment and surveillance would ``fail'', as suggested in this question, but in any event the safeguards strategy for the facility concerned is designed to ensure any such failure would be detected so that appropriate action can be taken within the IAEA's timeliness criteria.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. The IAEA stated in the 1986 SIR that it was satisfied that as a result of the totality of its inspection activities in 1986 it was reasonable to conclude that nuclear material under Agency safeguards in 1986 remained in peaceful uses or was otherwise adequately accounted for. The attainment of Agency inspection goals is based on a complex set of criteria, all of which must be satisfied before the Agency deems a goal to have been attained. The partial or non-attainment of inspection goals does not mean that safeguards have failed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Depending on the type of facility being safeguarded between 10 and 20 inspection activities are performed. These involve physical verification of nuclear material inventory, interrogation of surveillance devices, checking of containment measures, and collection and analysis of data and physical samples. Some of these are mutually supportive.
      </para>
      <para>
       By the Agency's technical definition the successful completion of all inspection activities constitutes goal attainment. However, if one or more activities is not completed, a substantial amount of information relevant to drawing conclusions of non-diversion is still available from an inspection. For example, inspectors may not have completed an action in one material balance area (MBA) in a facility-the goal is not achieved, but the remaining information for that MBA and for the MBAs where the goals were achieved is sufficient to support a conclusion of no diversion. The Agency also has available to it other site-specific information gathered by inspectors as well as a detailed knowledge of all fuel cycle activities in all States covered by NPT safeguards.

       The Agency acknowledges that difficulties in the implementation of safeguards do arise. Such difficulties are reported in the SIR and enhance the Report's effectiveness as a tool of critical self-analysis for both the Agency and for member States. The action plan in the SIR provides for progress reports to be made in subsequent SIRs.

       (4) No. Safeguards are designed to detect and, through the threat of detection, to deter diversion of safeguarded nuclear material. Their purpose is not to deter theft. This is a function of physical protection and is the responsibility of States, not the IAEA. The IAEA, with the assistance of appropriate member States, is currently developing the necessary safeguards approaches which take account of the expansion of the nuclear industry, particularly in the case of projected large scale reprocessing facilities.

       (5), (6), (7) and (8) The IAEA avoids references to individual States in the SIR because some member States see the confidentiality provisions of IAEA safeguards agreements as precluding this. Attempts to identify countries from the SIR can be no more than speculation.
