        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to make a minor amendment to section 69 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to permit a taxpayer to receive a deduction not only for the cost of the preparation of a tax return but also for the fees charged by a tax agent for the preparation of additional information required under the Principal Act and under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Self-assessment
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Self-assessment is now a major part of the Australian taxation system and it has radically altered the basis for the preparation of tax returns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Post-assessment checks, whether by way of a desk audit or a field audit, have become a regular part of the assessment process. In addition, objections and appeals are also now an intrinsic part of the self-assessment system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, it is reasonable to allow a deduction for the preparation of additional material required under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act as part of the assessment process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provisions have been included in this Bill to deny a deduction of costs incurred through a registered tax agent in circumstances where the taxpayer has been engaged in a tax avoidance scheme under Section IVa of the Principal Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provisions have also been included to preclude the amended Section 69 being used in contesting a dispute or resolving a disagreement through the courts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Reason for the Bill
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Traditionally, fees paid by clients for services of taxation professionals, when directed towards their business activities, have been deductible against the assessable income of the taxpayers concerned, tax litigation excepted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Doubts regarding the deductibility of fees for income tax return preparation caused by the decision of the High Court in 1950 in Green v Federal Commissioner of Taxation were overcome by the introduction, in 1963, of Section 69 into the Income Tax Assessment Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        More recently, however, doubts have been raised as to the scope of deductibility of fees for professional taxation services in certain situations by particular court decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further concern has arisen as a result of what appears to be inconsistent approaches to the deductibility of fees for professional taxation services that have been taken by officers of the Australian Taxation Office following routine tax audits.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment Bill has been made even more current by a judicial decision of 29 March this year. In the case, His Honour Mr Justice Northrop of the Federal Court overturned an Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision where the taxpayer claimed legal advice in the preparation of a notice of objection on the basis that the essential character of the expense was to obtain a reduction in the amount of tax assessed and therefore this legal expense incurred was not deductible under section 51 of the principal Act. Accordingly, inconsistencies appear to exist in the deductibility of disputation fees as they relate to income tax assessments and fringe benefits tax assessments even though the payment of both income tax and fringe benefits tax is non-deductible. My amendment Bill seeks to remedy this anomaly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe disputation fees are deductible irrespective of whether they are incurred in respect of income tax assessments or fringe benefits tax assessments, except where they involve State, Territory or Federal Court action. Expenditure relating to professional tax fees incurred through a registered tax agent should be wholly deductible except to the extent to which it is private, domestic or capital in nature. As the recipient of professional tax fees will return those fees as assessable income so the payer should correspondingly obtain a full tax deduction in respect of the payment of those fees since, in reality, such outgoings cannot readily be described as expenses of a capital, private or domestic nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, the Australian taxation environment is in a very different state to the position in 1963, when section 69 of the Act was introduced. In particular there has been a move to a system of self-assessment. The Commissioner no longer relies on the tax return as lodged and has instigated and upgraded measures seeking to ensure taxpayers properly meet their liabilities. Those most obvious to honourable senators will be desk audits and field audits. The new system of self-assessment increases the importance and time attributed to compliance, planning and, on occasion, tax disputation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The importance of the role of tax advice in legitimate business administration and strategic planning has increased significantly. Today, tax is just one of the many important costs of operating a successful business. There now exists a much broader tax base, particularly with the inclusion of foreign source income and capital gains and there has been added further tax burdens, including fringe benefits tax. There is a recognition by the Australian Taxation Office of the co-operation of tax agents in the administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the very substantial role played by tax agents in assisting taxpayers to meet their obligations and, indirectly, to assist in the revenue collection process.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to note that statistics show over 50 per cent of appeals against decisions and assessments of the Australian Taxation Office are resolved in the taxpayer's favour. Several other jurisdictions permit deductibility of taxation fees for taxation services. These include the United States, Canada, West Germany and Japan. The circumstances that 25 years ago initiated the limited concession embodied in section 69 no longer prevail.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like, in closing my remarks, to express my thanks to officers of the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Australian Society of Accountants and members of individual accounting firms for their valuable advice on this Bill. Although many accountants and lawyers would like the amendment to be wider than I have proposed, I think the Bill before the Senate will address many of the anomalies that have been identified. I earnestly believe that this simple Bill will remedy an anomaly which exists in the complicated area of taxation. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to reform the outdated legislative framework under which Australia's international liner trade is carried by sea. The Bill will repeal and replace Part X of the Trade Practices Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Liner shipping is characterised by the carriage of mainly containerised cargoes on defined trade routes. In 1986/87 Australia's liner exports totalled 8 million tonnes valued at nearly $13 billion. In the same year our liner imports totalled over 6 million tonnes and were valued at over $21 billion. In total around 50% of Australia's foreign trade will be transported under commercial conditions coming within the framework of this Bill. Australia's liner exports are mainly primary commodities such as wool and meat and liner imports are mainly high value manufactured items such as industrial machinery and equipment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes embodied in this Bill will encourage a more competitive shipping environment for the benefit of Australian shippers. At the same time Australia's exporters and importers will continue to have access to the benefits of frequent and reliable sailings provided by liner conferences. These reforms are part of the Government's strategy for overall micro-economic reform and complement our efforts in the national shipping and waterfront sectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        An international feature of liner shipping is the organisation of ocean carriers into so-called liner conferences. These conferences are in fact cartels combining resources and restricting competition among themselves in order to provide high quality, integrated shipping services. Liner conferences continue to carry the majority of Australia's liner cargoes with participation levels between 50-80% on Australia's trading routes. Non-conference or independent ocean carriers transport the remainder and their competition with conference carriers provides exporters with alternative freight rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The benefits to exporters and importers of access to reliable, efficient and frequent shipping services have been recognised by governments of all major trading countries. Where ocean carriers have associated to offer these services as a liner conference the necessary exemptions from national laws regulating anti-competitive practices have been provided. Australia is no exception, and conferences for many years have received full exemption from Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits anti-competitive and exclusive dealings in exchange for complying with the regulatory provisions of Part X.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, there has been strong concern within the shipper community that the exemptions were too broadly based and while there were benefits in the conference system, conferences were overly protected to the disadvantage of shippers and non-conference operators.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government shared this general concern and established the industry task force to review Australia's liner shipping legislation. Shipper, ocean carrier and union interests were represented on the task force. Following consultations with some 50 industry and government organisations, the task force presented its findings and recommendations in 1986 in the ``Liner Shipping Report''. The report was circulated to all members of Federal Parliament at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The task force was strongly of the view that Australia's overall interests would best be served by regulation that is directed to the promotion of a fair, competitive environment which would ensure access to the market for all ocean carriers on equal terms and which would penalise and eliminate abuses of the system and anti-competitive practices. It has been the focus of much public debate and comment. The report and industry reaction to it formed the basis of the Government's consideration of the reforms which are now embodied in the Bill that we have before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overall thrust of the Bill is set out in the ``objects'' section and is aimed at creating a more balanced, competitive liner shipping industry to enhance Australia's trading interests. Australian exporters' access to conference services has been retained with appropriate safeguards against abuses of conference power. This will be achieved through three key mechanisms incorporated in the Bill, namely:
       </para>
       <para>
        a transparent registration procedure which requires conference agreements to be publicly available and contain minimum standards
       </para>
       <para>
        permitting only partial and conditional exemption from Part IV for anti-competitive and exclusionary practices
       </para>
       <para>
        requiring conferences and ocean carriers with a substantial degree of market power to negotiate with representative shipper bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        In enhancing shippers' negotiating positions with conferences the two stage transparent registration mechanism will give shippers advance notice of proposed carriage arrangements, permit shippers to participate in negotiations regarding minimum service levels before the conference agreement is finally registered and provides and early opportunity for registered agreements to be investigated by the Trade Practices Commission on complaint by an affected party.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill seeks to limit the exemption from Part IV to the minimum necessary for the continued provision of conference services to Australian exporters and provides that breaches of Part X be enforced by the provisions contained in Part VI. The Bill is therefore an integral part of the Trade Practices Act while recognising the uniqueness of the liner shipping industry. The resultant complexity of the Bill can better be understood by dividing its major provisions into seven broad categories.
       </para>
       <para>
        1. Limited exemptions for conferences
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has accepted industry arguments that there are benefits in the continued operation of the conference system. However, in future, conference exemption from Part IV of the Trade Practices Act for the provision of services to our shippers will be restricted to section 45 (anti-competitive agreements) and section 47 (exclusive dealings) and then only to the extent necessary for the provision of rationalised services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides the exemption for both inwards and outwards liner conference shipping services for the ``blue-water'' and foreign land based components only. The exemptions do not extend to stevedoring operations and the transport of cargo by land or air in Australia which will now be exposed to Part IV. However, the government has accepted that the fixing of door to door service freight rates and the determination of common terms and conditions for bills of lading which could breach Part IV are of benefit to Australian shippers and will be given limited exemption from Part IV. In order to minimise potential conflicts of law with other countries the additional safeguards and regulations of registration and negotiations associated with the exemptions are confined to outwards liner shipping services.
       </para>
       <para>
        For outward liner shipping services the exemptions will limit conferences to practices such as the charging of common freight rates by their members and entering into loyalty agreements with shippers. However, for conferences to gain an exemption for practices not specifically identified in the Bill, the additional practices will have to be necessary for the effective operation of the conference and have overall benefits for shippers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 46 (misuse of market power) will be expressly applied to all conference operations. The Government cannot accept the situation where conferences continue to be exempt from the Trade Practices Act's provisions concerning misuse of market power. The Bill also contains a provision modelled on section 49 (price discrimination) which prohibits discrimination between similarly situated exporters.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. Minimum standards for conference agreements
       </para>
       <para>
        An important condition attached to the exemptions I have outlined is that conference agreements in our export trades must meet certain minimum standards. Most importantly, the agreements must contain details of minimum service levels such as frequency of sailings, ports of call and cargo carrying capacity, which conference members undertake to maintain. The Bill ensures that conferences will be required to negotiate minimum service levels with a shipper body designated by the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Conference members will also be required to provide for the resolution of disputes in Australia in accordance with Australian law rather than be able to utilise some other procedure. The Minister will be empowered to waive this requirement where particular circumstances warrant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Conference agreements will have to provide for the withdrawal of a party to the agreement upon reasonable notice without penalty. This recognises that over time an ocean carrier should be in a position to respond to changing market circumstances by being able to withdraw from a conference without undue delay.
       </para>
       <para>
        3. Transparency
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the regulatory scheme contained in the Bill, the secrecy provisions of the existing Part X will be swept away. In future, all outwards conference agreements will be entered onto a public register. Details on the register and copies of the agreements will be publicly available. To ensure our shippers have an opportunity to examine and challenge such agreements, all conference agreements will have to remain on the public register for 30 days before coming into effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision will, of course, be made to protect commercially sensitive matters contained in conference agreements where this is justified and does not disadvantage Australian exporters. Even in circumstances where a request for confidentiality is granted, an abstract of the relevant matters must be provided for the public record.
       </para>
       <para>
        4. Enhanced Shipper Rights
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill encourages shippers to associate to act as a counterbalance to the cartel powers of conferences and the negotiating powers of ocean carriers with substantial market power. The Minister will be able to declare a shipper association, which represents Australian shippers generally, to be a designated peak shipper body and certain association, which represents the interests of a particular group of shippers, to be a designated secondary shipper body.
       </para>
       <para>
        The designation of a peak shipper body or the nomination of a secondary designated shipper body will empower that body to negotiate minimum service levels. Such bodies will also be able to require conferences and non-conference operators with substantial market power to negotiate, whenever reasonably requested, over arrangements for and the terms and conditions of carriage in our export liner trades. The parties to the conference agreement will have to have due consideration to matters raised by the shipper body and exchange such information as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill grants appropriate exemption from Part IV of the Act for designated shipper bodies to exercise the powers which I have just indicated. In addition, all designated shipper bodies will receive exemption to negotiate and enter into loyalty agreements with ocean carriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill overcomes a deficiency of the existing Part X which permits ocean carriers to unilaterally impose freight rate increases without negotiating. In future ocean carriers regulated by the new legislation will need to provide 30 days notice to the relevant designated shipper body before freight rates and service levels can be varied. This period of advance notice can, with the agreement of the designated shipper body, be reduced to meet commercial circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        Shippers will have access to the Trade Practices Commission to resolve problems which may arise between themselves and ocean carriers. The provisions of conference agreements and the way they are being applied will be able to be challenged before the commission on the grounds that the shipping services are not efficient or economical or are not being provided at the capacity and frequency to meet the needs of affected shippers. Complaints in regard to loyalty agreements will also be able to be referred to the Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        5. Non-Conference Operators
       </para>
       <para>
        With the exception of the requirement to have an agent for the purpose of official communication, most non-conference operators will not be regulated by the provisions of the Bill. In other words, the pro-competitive provisions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act will apply. However, where non-conference operators are deemed to have substantial market power they will be required to negotiate with an appropriate designated shipper body over arrangements for and the terms and conditions of carriage.
       </para>
       <para>
        6. Unfair Pricing
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for allegations of unfair pricing by ocean carriers to be referred through the minister for consideration by the Trade Practices Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions concerning unfair pricing are a safeguard measure to help ensure the long term stability of commercial shipping services. They will not provide protection from fair competition for inefficient ocean carriers. It is not in our national interest to discourage any genuinely low-cost commercial operators from offering competitive services to Australia's shippers. The Bill provides minimum criteria which have to be met in order to sustain allegations of unfair pricing and ensures that our national interest is taken into account by the tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        7. Australian Flag Shipping
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill continues the existing policy whereby conference and non-conference operators with substantial market power will be prohibited from hindering an Australian flag operator from engaging efficiently in outwards liner cargo shipping.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian flag shipping will, in the event for example of its operations being unreasonably disadvantaged by other carriers on non-commercial grounds, have access to the Trade Practices Commission for investigation of the complaint. Australian flag shipping accounted for the carriage of some 7% of our liner exports and 9% of our liner imports in  1986/87. The Government has made strenuous efforts to encourage Australian flag shipping to be more efficient and we are not prepared to stand idly by and allow our operators to be discriminated against on a non-commercial basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against the background of the major provisions I have just described, the regulatory framework embraced by the Bill represents a substantial change from that with which the liner shipping industry has become familiar over the last 20 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relative terms the position of shippers will be significantly strengthened while the conferences will lose a good deal of the immunity from Part IV of the Trade Practices Act which they enjoy under the existing Part X. In order to enable the necessary negotiations to take place and to ensure a smooth change is made to the new regulatory regime, the Bill provides a six month transition period during which the business of carrying our exports can continue uninterrupted while agreements are submitted for registration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Liner shipping, like any other sector of the international economy, is constantly evolving. While there is some flexibility in the provisions of the Bill to take account of change in the market place, the Government is determined to ensure that Australia's liner shipping legislation remains relevant in the light of future developments and is achieving its objectives. Therefore, it is the Government's intention that this legislation should be the subject of a review which will commence no later than seven years after it enters into force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the legislation being proposed makes no specific calls on the revenues of the Commonwealth. Similarly, the fees to be prescribed under appropriate provisions of this legislation will do no more than offset costs incurred in administering the regulatory process.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill proposes new legislation, the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989, to provide bounty assistance to Australian shipbuilders from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill incorporates changes in policy announced by the Government in November 1988 following the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's (IAC) report ``Ships, Boats and Other Vessels'' dated 29 June 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current legislation, the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980, provides for a cash limited bounty assistance scheme to shipbuilders who commence construction of vessels prior to 30 June 1989. The proposed Bill will continue this form of assistance, at rates which will be phased down until June 1995, when the bounty assistance is proposed to cease. The continued assistance for that period is considered essential so that this industry can continue to build on the significant gains in efficiency and competitiveness it has achieved over the last few years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's 1984 decision to extend bounty payments to include those built for export and to tighten registration regulations for bounty purposes has led to an export orientation on an unprecedented scale. Currently export orders amount to $300 million. Recent orders include two unique high speed catamaran car and passenger ferries for the Irish Sea.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ten fishing trawlers are being built for an Indonesian company and two luxury motor yachts worth more than twenty million dollars left Australia in February for the United States.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a significant reorientation for the industry. Over half the vessels completed in the first half of this year have been for export whereas in 1984-85 only one ship was exported from Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This success has only been achieved by the industry investing heavily in marketing, capital equipment, new technology and training. However, although the need for bounty assistance for the shipbuilding industry is reducing as the industry becomes more vibrant, withdrawal of assistance at this stage would be premature as the cost of entry into the international market has resulted in trading losses for many firms in their initial years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the government favours a continued period of assistance and believes that a bounty is the most appropriate form of assistance considering the impact that a tariff would have on ship users' costs and the contraction in local demand for ships. The IAC has also concluded that a bounty was its preferred form of assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The government therefore proposes in this Bill to introduce a new bounty scheme with the following elements:
       </para>
       <para>
        To be eligible to receive bounty under this bounty scheme, clause 4 provides that a vessel will have to be between 150 and 10,000 gross construction tons, and be both self propelled and navigable. Other floating structures, such as floating hotels, Sydney Harbour tunnel sections and other non self propelled floating structures, will not be bountiable. There is no special provision for commercial fishing vessels in this bounty scheme such as exists in the 1980 Act, as this was originally introduced to coincide with a manning level which is now no longer relevant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 5 of the Bill provides that bounty will be paid on the costs incurred by a shipbuilder in producing a bountiable vessel at the rate applicable when the costs are incurred rather than paying bounty on the cost of the vessel at the rate applicable when the vessel is commenced, as occurs under the existing bounty scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bounty will be paid on the production of ships regardless of whether they are for export or domestic use. Such a bounty, unlike specific export subsidies, is not proscribed by Australia's obligations under the GATT treaty; indeed the proposal to phase out the shipbuilding bounty is in accordance with the spirit of the GATT to remove all production subsidies for manufactured goods. The only exception is that in accordance with the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA), Subclause 9(1) of the Bill has been included to exclude from eligibility for bounty vessels exported to New Zealand after June 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 10 of the Bill proposes the phased bounty rates to provide bounty assistance in the following manner:
       </para>
       <para>
        For bountiable costs incurred between 1 July 1989 and 30 June 1991: 15% of the eligible costs of constructing or modifying the vessel (plus 20% for overheads) will be paid as bounty to the shipbuilder completing the construction or modification of the bountiable vessel;
       </para>
       <para>
        For costs incurred between 1 July 1991 and 30 June 1993: 10% of the eligible costs (plus 20%) will be paid as bounty;
       </para>
       <para>
        For costs incurred between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 1995: 5% of the eligible costs (plus 20%) will be paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        No bounty will be paid on any vessel completed after June 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        To be eligible to receive bounty, shipbuilders must meet the clearly defined registration criteria proposed in Clause 17 of the Bill. These criteria have been introduced so that assistance is channelled towards those shipbuilders who have the potential to be world competitive. We have valuable empirical evidence of the effects of a laissez-faire approach to manufacturers' ability to seek shipbuilding bounty-this system operated during the 1980 to 1984 period and the net result was a moribund and severely fragmented group of 91 part-time shipbuilders who were primarily engineering ``jobbing'' shops and fishermen or ferry operators seeking to minimise the capital replacement costs via bounty.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1984 the Government targeted the assistance to shipbuilders with a long-term commitment to their particular industry. The aim then, as it is now, was to create a world competitive industry capable of exporting and capable of long-term survival with lowering levels of subsidy.
       </para>

        A number of changes have also been made to administrative provisions of this Bill, to further streamline the scheme's operation. For example, the method of overhead allocation has been significantly simplified. No longer is it appropriate to base assistance around protection as was done in the 1980 Act. This Bill positively encourages higher utilisation of overheads whilst recognising the need for a sound core of what may be loosely termed indirect costs or overheads before a shipyard can genuinely become a world competitor. The criteria requiring applicants to employ 40 persons arises from our analysis of these aspects. Evidence shows that firms with fewer employees simply do not have the capacity to meet the aims of this package.

       <para>
        Analysis of data on the position relating to new entrants to the industry since the introduction of registration criteria is also revealing. More than 40 firms have been registered since 1984 while at any one time there are normally around 20 active builders. Many of today's success stories emanate from firms new to this industry over the last five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is designed to maintain the momentum achieved by this industry, while finally reaching a point where direct assistance is no longer required.

         —The Opposition welcomes this reference, which is a matter of significance. I wish to make a few brief remarks about the necessity for the reference and the areas that I hope the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will address. It has long been a matter of academic concern that the shield of the Crown is so vaguely understood and defined. Indeed, it has been a fairly arcane notion over the years, but it has come into particular focus in recent times with the increasingly commercial activities of both Commonwealth and State governments, and in particular the introduction into this Parliament in recent months of a package of Bills relating to government business enterprises. It has become clear from scrutiny of those Bills that there have been differential provisions in relation to the shield of the Crown to the extent that some Bills have mentioned the doctrine, others have not, and the ones that have mentioned it have done so in different terms. It is still very much a matter of statutory interpretation and objective assessment of what is known as the control test as to whether any particular enterprises are entitled to claim Crown immunity.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not think that it is currently a matter of practical concern at Commonwealth level, but it has been a matter of particular concern at State level where there have been a number of egregious instances of State governments adopting what can only be described as a cavalier approach to the issue. I wish to put on record at this stage one example which I consider to be flagrant. It relates to evidence given by the Victorian Treasurer, Mr Jolly, to the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation in Melbourne earlier this year. Mr Jolly said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I would be very reluctant, to say the least, to support the removal of the shield of the Crown, given the fact that you are required to meet a number of other requirements above what is required for private sector organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Short asked:
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the additional checks and balances that apply to, say, the VIC the VEDC or VET that do not operate in the private sector?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Jolly's response was:
       </para>
       <para>
        For a start, you have reporting requirements to Parliament, and secondly you have the scrutiny of Parliament itself and the potential for various committees and other forms of inquiry to occur at relative ease, I would suggest.
       </para>
       <para>
        I asked Mr Jolly:
       </para>
       <para>
        Why should a State instrumentality engaged in commercial operations not be subject to the same disclosure requirements that apply to all other corporations? It should not, surely, be a matter of whim. You may say, `We will comply with the spirit', but when it comes to the crunch and you do not want to cooperate with the NCSC, and you have the numbers in the Lower House, there is not going to be any parliamentary inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Jolly said:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the ultimate, the electorate will decide what it will do in those circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regard that as a thoroughly unsatisfactory response. It is clear that the Government in that instance is putting the operations of statutory authorities above the law. Indeed, when one peruses the prospectus of the Victorian Equity Trust one finds the same general attitude being adopted. I think that is something that the Parliament can no longer tolerate.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look at the activities of the State Government in Western Australia we can safely say that Mr Alan Bond was very fortunate to escape a finding of unacceptable conduct. That was simply because there was a very real concern on the part of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) that the State Government Insurance Commission (SGIC) of Western Australia was entitled to invoke the shield of the Crown. Indeed, there are authorities to the effect that those who have commercial dealings with a government agency entitled to the shield of the Crown are themselves protected. In that situation the NCSC felt that it had little option but to reach a commercial settlement with both Mr Holmes a Court and Mr Bond. I think that is a very undesirable state of affairs. I believe that the Commission should have gone further than merely forming a tentative finding of unacceptable conduct and should have made the actual finding on the evidence that was available to it. One of the principal reasons it did not was that Mr Bond was able to shelter behind the shield of the Crown. That is not a situation that should be tolerated.
       </para>
       <para>
        The SGIC made it very clear in correspondence with the Australian Stock Exchange that it regarded itself as not bound to comply with the provisions of the take- overs code. That is an intolerable situation. There are very many commercial activities of government now that must be conducted on a level playing field. Organisations such as Telecom Australia are increasingly entering into joint ventures and other commercial arrangements. There is absolutely no reason why they should not be forced to comply with the same legislative and other statutory obligations. The Trade Practices Commission should have no fears about its power to intervene in circumstances where it would intervene in the private sector, and the shield of the Crown in relation to commercial activities of Government business enterprises would seem to be an increasingly outmoded and irrelevant notion. I think that needs to be tested.
       </para>
       <para>
        People have written on the question and the sooner a committee of inquiry such as the one chaired by my good friend Senator Cooney has the opportunity to investigate these matters at some length, the sooner we will be able to judge whether the sorts of responses that we have heard in recent times from State Premiers are much more than subterfuges. I hope that we can ultimately devise a test which can be applied across the board instead of having to resort to this tortuous case by case assessment of the control test and ultimately that we will be able to see that commercial operations of government are not put in any privileged position.

        <para>
         (i) refuse to sign and ratify the proposed Minerals Convention,
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
         (iii) increase its own level of environmental and scientific activities in the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Antarctic environment is unique. On that proposition there is no disagreement anywhere around the chamber or, indeed, anywhere in Australia. It is a unique environment in terms of its terrestrial life. It is unique in terms of the effect which developments in the Antarctic may have on global climate and weather patterns. It is unique in that some 70 per cent of the fresh water resources of this planet are actually contained in frozen form in the Antarctic continent. The situation in terms of sovereignty and political arrangements in the Antarctic is also unique. The Antarctic continent is regulated by a series of extraordinary international arrangements which mix aspects of claims of sovereignty with policies of states which either have not made claims or actually reject the validity of such claims.
        </para>
        <para>
         The continent is subject to a number of international regulatory operations and conventions. Among these, for example, are the original 1959 Antarctic Treaty, the 1964 Agreed Measures for the Conservation of the Antarctic Flora and Fauna, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals adopted in 1972, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources which was adopted in 1980 and aspects of Australian domestic legislation, the Whale Protection Act 1980. All of these are similar in the respect that they share a common philosophy, namely, to limit and control exploitative activities and in some cases to prohibit absolutely certain behaviour or practices which may occur elsewhere in the world. For example, there is a total prohibition on military activity taking place in the Antarctic and on the introduction of nuclear weapons and nuclear facilities into the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         These arrangements have been carefully developed over a number of years. Indeed, many people in this chamber have participated in some of these developments. For example, in 1980 I was actually one of the delegates from the Australian Parliament to the final negotiating sessions dealing with the development of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Mr Jacobi, then a member of the House of Representatives, and I signed that Convention on behalf of the Australian delegation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Australia, of course, lays claim to some 42 per cent of the continent. We reasserted that claim in the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty Act 1960. That is an area of approximately 6.1 million square kilometres. We maintain three permanent bases-Casey, Davis and Mawson-and, in addition, there is a permanent station on Macquarie Island and four temporary summer bases in the Larsemann Hills, the Bunger Hills, on Heard Island and at Commonwealth Bay and a new summer field camp is proposed in the Prince Charles Mountains.
        </para>
        <para>
         Discussions first took place in the 1970s about the possibility of there being some exploitation of the mineral resources of the Antarctic. It was in 1970 that this issue was first put on the international agenda. In 1975 it was proposed by New Zealand that a convention be adopted to prohibit entirely any mining in the Antarctic. At that stage this proposal did not find a great deal of favour in the international community. It is fair to say that a number of developments have occurred since 1975, particularly in relation to our understanding of the impact which activity in the Antarctic may have on the international climate and the control of the atmosphere.
        </para>
        <para>
         Negotiations on a proposed mineral regime began in earnest in June 1982 and they have certainly been extraordinarily complex. Over the years, a series of about a dozen meetings have taken place, under the chairmanship of Mr Chris Beeby, an official from New Zealand. Critical meetings in the development of this Convention were, for example, those held in Washington in January 1984, in Tokyo in October and November 1986 and Montevideo in May 1987. Arising from these a convention was developed and eventually a final text agreed upon. That convention is entitled `The Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities'.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government presented the text of this Convention, together with certain other supporting material, to the Senate on 22 November 1988. It indicated at that time that there ought to be a period of public discussion about this matter and that it would eventually come to a decision as to whether it should or should not sign and ratify that Convention. This is a point of considerable importance. The Convention cannot come into place unless all of a designated number of countries become signatories to it. To come into force, the Convention requires ratification by the 16 Antarctic Treaty consultative parties, including Australia. Virtually all of those parties, except Australia and France, have now indicated that they will become party to the Convention. If Australia and France become signatories, the Convention will come into force. However, a decision by either country not to enter into the Convention will mean that the Convention itself will not come into force. Unanimous consent is required in that regard. Therefore, both Australia and France are in the unique position that they now hold a virtual veto over whether or not the Convention comes into force.
        </para>
        <para>
         The motion which I have moved in the Senate today on behalf of the Liberal and National parties asserts that it is the opinion of the Senate that Australia should not enter into the Convention and should, therefore, bring about a situation in which the Convention itself does not come into force. The motion says that the Senate believes that the continent needs to be protected as fully as possible and that mining activity is incompatible with that necessary degree of environment protection. It therefore calls on the Australian Government to refuse to sign and ratify the Convention and, indeed, to go further by taking steps to convene a meeting of the Antarctic Treaty parties to develop an effective regime to prohibit mining in the Antarctic. It must be conceded that at the moment there is no formal prohibition on mining activity taking place in the Antarctic. An informal moratorium has been in place for the best part of 10 years. As a result of that, no significant mineral activity has taken place.
        </para>
        <para>
         Those who defend this Convention do so on the basis that if we do not have a convention there will be some sort of unregulated scramble for mineral and hydrocarbon development in the area and that as a result a regulatory arrangement is now necessary. We on the Opposition side believe that quite the contrary is the case. We believe that the Convention, as drawn, effectively encourages and facilitates mineral activity to take place in the Antarctic. In the absence of this Convention, we say that mining activity will not take place in the Antarctic for a number of reasons, including economic, political, technical, and scientific reasons. Because that unregulated scramble will not take place we will have time to move to turn that informal moratorium on mining activity into a formal regime which prohibits mining activity in the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         Catherine Wallace is a lecturer in the Faculty of Commerce and Administration at the Victoria University of Wellington. In an article entitled `The Antarctic Minerals Convention-Environmental Protection or Pre-condition for Development' she states:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . an unregulated scramble-
        </para>
        <para>
         that is to say, an unregulated scramble in terms of mineral activity-
        </para>
        <para>
         is inherently unlikely, because without security of tenure projects will be unbankable for either private or public sector enterprises. By removing obstacles to development, the impact of the convention would be to facilitate mining.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a point of view that we endorse. Because I am conscious of the time constraints in the debate today, I therefore turn to the areas of criticism that the Opposition has of the Convention. Before doing so, may I say that it is a matter of public record that there are divisions within the Government on this particular matter and divisions of opinion within the Cabinet and, indeed, within the Caucus. We know that, on 21 September 1988, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in terms which indicated that he had reservations. In his letter he said:
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not believe that Australia should sign the Convention until we attempt further to negotiate provisions that better protect our national interests.

         . . . signature would mean we would, in effect concede our economic claims over Antarctica for virtually nothing, forfeiting our sovereignty over Antarctica and opening up the possibility of subsidised production competing with Australian mineral producers. . .

         Mr Keating continued:
        </para>
        <para>
         Serious contention may have been avoided in Antarctica for over 30 years but I suspect that this is because the basic question of who benefits from resource exploitation in Antarctica has previously not been addressed very seriously.
        </para>
        <para>
         He indicated in his letter that the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) shares the same point of view. It is known, for example, that Senator Evans has expressed the view that there should be signature of this convention for the reasons that I have outlined, that Mr Duffy as the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Senator Richardson, on 2 June 1988, issued a joint media release in which they welcomed a successful conclusion of negotiations for a convention to regulate any future mineral activity in the Antarctic. On 14 April 1986, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) opened a meeting of the consultative parties in Hobart where he expressed general support for the development of such a regime. Therefore, as I say, we know that there are some divisions within the Government over this matter.
        </para>
        <para>
         For example, we know from some reports that Mr Keating apparently is attracted to the idea of the Antarctic as a world park, a concept which I think Senator Evans once described as something having attraction only for the sort of people who believe in elves and fairies. I think that is a correct recollection of what Senator Evans said on that occasion. It is like his other pronouncement that Kakadu stage 3 was basically `clapped-out buffalo country'. May I say that Senator Evans is quite correct on both counts and is extremely perceptive in his observations about Kakadu stage 3 and now a proposal for a world park in the Antarctic. The Opposition does not support the concept of a world park in the Antarctic. We believe that Australia should continue to maintain its claims of sovereignty. I am yet to be persuaded that that is compatible with the world park concept as it is primarily advanced by Greenpeace and a number of others. It is for that reason that the Opposition has not advocated a world park approach but rather the development within the existing Treaty framework of an anti-mining-a prohibition on mining-regime taking place in the Antarctic continent. When this matter was debated last in the Senate that was the point which I made-that the Opposition was not in favour of the world park concept but nevertheless I believed that the environmental protection guidelines under the Convention were not adequate.
        </para>
        <para>
         I know that Senator Sanders has made some comments in the media basically pointing out that, on the last occasion on which this matter was debated, the Opposition indicated support of the minerals regime. That is not correct. The Opposition has never publicly given any indication of support. When this matter has been debated during the last few months, the Opposition has consistently said that the matter was being discussed by the shadow Cabinet, as indeed it was, on the basis of a paper which I put forward in my capacity as shadow Minister for the environment, and shadow Cabinet came to a decision on that matter. That decision was endorsed by the joint Opposition parties at their meeting yesterday.
        </para>
        <para>
         May I therefore turn to the basic objections that we have to the Convention. First, the Opposition asserts that the Convention is fundamentally inconsistent with underlying principles of the Antarctic Treaty itself, in that it is exclusive, exploitative, and majoritarian. Further, it introduces an element of competition and commercial rivalry which is totally at odds with the whole spirit of the original Treaty.
        </para>
        <para>
         Secondly, we believe that the Convention itself establishes potential for conflict. As the Treasurer rightly observed in his letter, the harmony of the Antarctic regime has in part no doubt been based on the fact that the issue of who benefits has not previously been raised. This Convention will destroy that and will, no doubt, lead to international disputation over the issue of money. If, for example, one looks at an article in the Australian newspaper of 23 January 1986 headed, `Mineral search threatens to melt Antarctic Treaty', that makes the point quite clearly. Thirdly, we believe that the Convention introduces an unnecessary element of secrecy into its operations. Articles 37 (11) and 37 (12) of the proposed Convention provide for commercial secrets to be maintained by the sponsoring states. This is the first time that any Antarctic instrument has contained secrecy provisions. All others specify that all information must be open and made available to all Antarctic parties and to the international scientific community. The Opposition regards this as a very dangerous precedent.
        </para>
        <para>
         Next, we believe there is a genuine question of the loss of sovereignty. If the Convention is enacted in its current form Australia will not be able to decide which mineral activity takes place in its own claimed area. We will lose our veto over activity within our own territory once the minerals resources commissions have passed power to the Regulatory Commission, which will make final decisions in the matter. In our opinion, it would lead to a free-for-all within our own sovereign territory once an explorer has been granted a permit by the Minerals Resources Commission. The Convention even gives the regional regulatory commissions, which Australia cannot control, power to override the expert and independent advice of the scientific, technical and advisory committees which are set up under other aspects of Antarctic law.
        </para>
        <para>
         Next, there is the question of the associated loss of revenue. No royalty is payable to Australia for mineral activity undertaken in our territory. Again, the Opposition regards this as a bad precedent. The revenue surplus which may accrue to the Commission from payments by licensees does not, on one interpretation of the relevant article-namely, article 35 (7) (b)-have to be shared in any particular fashion so as to recognise Australia's claim to benefit from activities taking place within the Australian Antarctic Territory.
        </para>
        <para>
         Then there is the question of subsidised mining. The analysis of the history of the Convention will indicate some very significant problems as far as this is concerned. When one looks at the original Chairman's draft, a document entitled MC/17 REV-V, the following point was included under proposed article 2 (Objectives):
        </para>
        <para>
         (f) follow orderly mining practices and act in an economically rational manner;
        </para>
        <para>
         This was deleted from the final text at the insistence of the United States of America. In its place a mere statement appears in the text of the final act of the consultative meeting of 2 June 1988 to the effect that `unfair economic practices', including subsidies, `should be addressed in the context of the relevant multi-lateral agreements'. Given the recent experiences which we have had with the United States and others with our trade subsidies I believe that this is a clear indication that the United States, Japan, perhaps Germany and other parties would proceed with a regime which includes subsidised mining in the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         One must consider that the greatest threat is not so much physical mining activity taking place on that 2 per cent of the continent which is ice free, but rather drilling and prospecting in the offshore waters and on the continental shelf of the Antarctic for oil and hydrocarbon resources. Given the fact that the Japanese have enormous financial surpluses available to their Government to subsidise these sorts of activities; that they have a program for deliberate support of private sector companies, the so-called NEDO programs, which are involved in seeking alternative sources of fuel and energy for Japan, and that the Japanese, as we know, are chronically short of their own oil resources, I believe there is a very real risk, despite the technological difficulties and the economic costs concerned, that the Japanese would want to and would be attracted to subsidised activity in the search for oil in the Antarctic, with the potential for all of the disastrous consequences of a version of the Exxon Valdez problem or the blow-outs which have been seen in oil operations in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years. Of course, we know of a couple of recent oil spills in the Antarctic region involving both an Argentinean vessel and a Peruvian vessel.
        </para>
        <para>
         The next point in terms of our criticism of the Convention is that we believe that the provisions establishing the liability of operators for the consequences of their failure to observe proper environmental standards are inadequate. Article 8 (4) of the Convention provides for a limitation on liability of an operator for environmental damage which `could reasonably have been foreseen'. Given just how disastrous the environmental consequences of a major disaster in the Antarctic could be, the Opposition regards this as quite unacceptable. It is only if operators are subject to a strict international regime of full liability that they will ever take the care which is necessary. The failure of nations such as Poland and the Soviet Union to take due care in matters such as observing fishing quotas, especially for krill, gives no cause for confidence; even less so does the clear track record of major companies of a nation like Japan, which will no doubt be in the forefront of oil exploration. The issue which I have previously raised about the subsidised search for oil in the Antarctic is of particular relevance.
        </para>
        <para>
         One could make a number of other criticisms. I have focused on some of them. From Australia's point of view there will undoubtedly be a diversion of resources into control or monitoring of mineral activities. We spend little enough as it is in establishing our proper claims in the Antarctic. We spend little enough as it is in pursuing the proper scientific and environmental work which ought to be undertaken. I do not believe that we should divert resources for this purpose.
        </para>
        <para>
         Environmental concerns include those which may occur as a result of natural disasters which could be precipitated by such things as seismic activity undertaken as part and parcel of an exploration or mineral development program. I refer also to the impact of additional activity on areas such as the very limited emperor penguin rookeries and the impact on scarce fresh water supplies. For instance, the Davis Base has already drained Station Tarn Lake to provide regular supplies of water to a small station. Unnecessary problems have been caused by a failure to manage garbage disposal properly in the Antarctic. There are major questions about infrastructure concerns, such as the potential for building solid runways for heavy aircraft-an already controversial matter having regard to French activity at Dumont D'Urville which has been condemned by the Opposition, and which was condemned by Senator Brownhill in his capacity as acting shadow Minister for the environment in a press release which he issued on 19 January this year. Certainly, we should consider the loss of that aesthetic quality of the Antarctic wilderness which is very important and which has always impressed those people who have had the opportunity actually to visit the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         I know that the immediate response to this debate by Senator Gareth Evans will be to make all sorts of accusations of improper motives. He will undoubtedly wave a copy of Ian Warden's article in today's Canberra Times which he has in front of him at the moment and make all sorts of claims that this is a matter which has been raised only because of political considerations. He is entitled to make any such claims that he likes, but people who have followed this debate, including all of the representatives of the conservation associations-the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness Society, the various Southern Ocean coalitions who have had discussions with me and with Mr Howard over a number of months-will know that this is a matter which we have been pursuing and that we have kept them fully apprised of the work being done by the Opposition back bench committee chaired by Don Dobie, MP, and by me, within the resources available to me as the shadow Minister.
        </para>
        <para>
         They will know of the extent to which they have provided information which has been drawn on very heavily in the discussions which have taken place both in the shadow Cabinet and in the joint party rooms. They will be in a position to make a judgment as to whether what I have been saying to them, what Mr Howard has been saying to them and what the Opposition has been saying to them over a period of some months about the way in which we were attempting to resolve this sits well or does not sit well with the claims that Senator Evans or anybody else might make that this is purely a political stunt. They will be able to judge that in exactly the same way as they will judge what political stunt may be pulled by any political party in dealing with environmental matters.
        </para>
        <para>
         Nevertheless, we have consistently said, as we did in the debate on Senator Vallentine's motion, that we were developing a position on this matter, that we were not ready to vote on the matter until it had been properly considered by our shadow Cabinet and in our party room. That process having been in train for a considerable period, and having now been completed, the Opposition parties make it quite clear that their concluded view is as expressed in the motion-that Australia should neither sign nor ratify the proposed minerals convention, that we should take steps as a nation to convene a meeting of the Antarctic Treaty parties to develop an effective regime to prohibit mining in the Antarctic and that the Australian Government should take steps to increase its own level of environmental and scientific activities and commitment to the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         I hope that by the passage of this motion today, the Government will be given an indication of the view of the majority of the Senate and that the Government will be able to take that on board when it seeks to reconcile the conflicting opinions which exist within its own ranks. I hope that at the end of the day this debate will have made some contribution to persuading the Government to adopt precisely the position which the motion puts down and to make a significant contribution to the protection not only of the Antarctic environment but, indeed, of the environment of planet Earth as a whole.

          —The Government strongly agrees with the first leg of Senator Puplick's motion in so far as it commits us to the proposition that the Antarctic continent should be protected as fully as possible from threats to its unique environment. Equally, in the second paragraph, in its reference to mining activity, I can certainly say unequivocally that the Government would need a very high level of persuasion before it was prepared to accept the proposition that mining activity of any kind in that unique environment would be compatible with protecting that unique environment.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         But there are a number of other aspects in the motion which are much more arguable. Certainly we would find it quite premature to endorse that part of the motion which urges us to refuse to sign and ratify the proposed minerals convention. The Government is considering whether we should do just that. The argument that we have to wrestle with-and I do not honestly think that Senator Puplick wrestled with it-is that signature of this convention may well prove to be unquestionably the best way of protecting that unique Antarctic environment. Certainly, that is the kind of thing which is very strongly arguable for reasons I will come to in a moment. Certainly it is the view that Government negotiators have adopted to date in seeking to get the best possible content into that convention and certainly it is a view that we are going to have to take very seriously into account.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Puplick demonstrated some untoward sensitivity in the latter part of his speech, anticipating as he did that his motives would be somewhat brought into question as a result of moving this motion. Methinks Senator Puplick doth protest too much. There are all sorts of reasons for thinking that what we are confronted with today is the emergence of a quite remarkable new phenomenon in this place. Mr Ian Warden in the Canberra Times captured with considerable precision and deftness the dimensions of that phenomenon. We really ought to share Mr Warden's contribution with the rest of the Senate as Senator Puplick was kind enough to mention it in his own speech. Mr Warden said:
        </para>
        <para>
         We all thought we knew where we were with the Liberals on environmental matters and felt comfortable in taking some of our own political bearings from their horrid ideas on the luscious mineability of everything, everywhere. And so it is that ringing declarations from a Liberal-
        </para>
        <para>
         he was referring, of course, to Senator Puplick's putting down of the notice of motion yesterday-
        </para>
        <para>
         about the environmental sanctity of Antarctica have an incongruous and perplexing quality about them, as though a legendary anti-Semite had suddenly found virtue in the Jews or as though a Pope had spoken out in favour of abortion.
        </para>
        <para>
         It would be churlish to speculate that this is token greenness on the part of the Liberals and that they have chosen to become green-tinged about a far-flung and penguin-infested place, which, while it may be dear to the hearts of environmentally aware voters, is not itself divided into electorates and hence does not present any of the difficult and vulgar jobs versus-conservation issues presented by environmental issues in Australia. Churls will say that for the Liberals, Antarctica is so far out of sight and out of mind as to be no more real and immediate to them than one of the rings of Saturn.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is lots more in the same vein but I think that is sufficient to capture the flavour. I often say that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who find Ian Warden funny and those who do not. I suspect that Senator Puplick may well have been in the former category but I cannot blame him this morning for being in the latter.
        </para>
        <para>
         In any event, be that as it may, what is the substance of this proposition that we are wrestling with? The Government is wrestling with it, I hasten to say, very seriously indeed. We are not being cursory or dismissive in our reaction to the arguments that are coming forward from Senator Puplick and others. To understand where we are at on this whole matter it is necessary to go back a step or two to the Antarctic Treaty system itself and Australia's aspirations and role in relation to it. Over the years successive Australian governments have maintained six different objectives in respect of Antarctica: first, to maintain the Antarctic region free from strategic and political confrontation; secondly, to preserve Australia's sovereignty or claims of sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory; thirdly, to protect the Antarctic environment; fourthly, to take advantage of the special opportunities it offers for scientific research; fifthly, to be informed about and able to influence developments in a region geographically proximate to Australia; and, finally, to derive possible economic benefits from the living and non-living resources of that Territory.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Antarctic Treaty system has been seen, I think quite sensibly, by successive Australian governments as the best vehicle-in fact the only conceivable vehicle-for pursuing these various objectives. We were one of the original signatories to the Treaty which was concluded in 1959 by the then 12 nations which had maintained Antarctic stations during the International Geophysical Year in 1957-58. The Treaty came into force in 1961 and since then the number of Treaty parties has grown to 39. Included in this number are the so-called consultative parties, now 22 of them, so designated because they are engaged in substantial scientific research in Antarctica. These are the parties which actually manage the Antarctic Treaty system.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Treaty itself has been supplemented by additional instruments for the management of Antarctica, including the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and now, in that context, the proposed Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. Collectively, these instruments and activities taking place under them have come to be known as the Antarctic Treaty system. I think it has to be said that in terms of advancing those various objectives, not only on Australia's behalf but in terms of the world's interests in maintaining a stable strategic and natural environment down there, the Treaty system has been tremendously important in keeping together what could otherwise be a very messy situation.
        </para>
        <para>
         The need for a convention governing the possible exploitation of minerals became apparent to the Antarctic consultative parties in, as Senator Puplick said I think, the mid-1970s. It was recognised then that failure to put in place some agreement on mineral exploitation activities could lead to an unregulated scramble for resources with resulting conflict over claims and damage to the fragile environment. This prospect directly threatened then, as it does now, the whole fragile Treaty system. In fact, it was more a concern to preserve the Antarctic Treaty system than a concern with the distant prospect-and it still is distant-of possible economic benefits which, in 1982, led to the start of negotiations for a minerals convention. Those negotiations have been very protracted, as I think again Senator Puplick has indicated, with 12 sessions of negotiations over six years culminating in the adoption in June last year of a final act, a formal document, recording the state of agreement, thus far, and a convention. It was also agreed, as has been said, to continue a moratorium on mineral resource activities pending timely entry into force of the Convention. One of the real issues we have to wrestle with is whether, failing the entry into force of a convention within a reasonable time, that moratorium will be able to be sustained. It cannot be assumed that it will be.
        </para>
        <para>
         The decision then to commence negotiations for this Convention-which I rather wish in retrospect had been called an environment protection convention rather than the name it was given because essentially that is what it is about and I think it would have saved us a lot of trouble in the process-was influenced not by a concern to get access to and economic benefit out of it but by a concern, as I have said, to preserve the Antarctic Treaty system by avoiding the disputes which would be likely to arise from any unregulated attempt which might be made to engage in mineral activities. The point has been made by those closest to this affair over the years that, failing entry into force of this sort of convention, the prospect of such a scramble and such a breakdown of this house of cards-the Treaty system itself-is very real. The Chairman, Chris Beeby of New Zealand, noted in a recent paper:
        </para>
        <para>
         In the worst case the result could be a breakdown of the Treaty, the loss of the disarmament regime that it contains and, more generally, of the stabilising effect that it has had on the entire area south of 60 degrees south latitude.
        </para>
        <para>
         So much for the background to the minerals Convention. Let us come back to the proposal that is before us. Throughout the course of the negotiations we have argued vociferously, vigorously and, for the most part, pretty effectively for environmental protection provisions in this Treaty which have been far-ranging and of really significant impact in their character. We wanted strict liability; we wanted unlimited liability; we wanted narrow defences for anyone who might engage in such activity and cause environmental damage in the process; we wanted strict threshold requirements to be satisfied before people could get in there and do anything at all; we wanted an effective enforcement mechanism; and we wanted a substantial role for the countries with actual territorial claims as distinct from those which are just drifting around the edges, so as to enhance our capacity to impose this sort of regime. I think it has to be said that, overwhelmingly throughout negotiations, we have been successful in achieving these various objectives. When the text was adopted by consensus back in June 1988 it contained most of the provisions that we were seeking to put in it.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Convention is a very long and complex document but it is based on a set of objectives and principles set out in the document itself which are structured in this way and it is important to appreciate this: the Convention prohibits mineral exploration and development unless it is judged, based upon assessment of adequate information, that those developments would not cause a significant adverse impact on the environment, on living resources and on weather patterns. Again, mineral exploration activity and any subsequent development are prohibited unless technology ensure safe operations. Again, these activities are prohibited unless the capacity exists to monitor key environmental and ecosystem parameters and to respond effectively to accidents.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Convention is not one that is premised on the assumption that mining will take place or that it should take place. The Convention provides a framework for deciding, based on environmental and other information, whether mineral exploration may take place and, if it is ever approved, for closely regulating it when it occurs. In fact, it provides that mining shall not take place unless it is clear, as I have said, on the basis of objective criteria, that mining will cause no significant environmental harm. It may be that, judged against these criteria, the Convention will operate in practice to effectively rule out mining altogether. All of those things need to be understood because an enormous amount of argument that we have heard in public and in this chamber from conservation groups and from those speaking along those lines is based on the premise that the Convention equals mining in Antarctica, that the Convention is somehow premised on the assumption that mining will occur, must occur and should occur and that the whole Convention is, by its very character, structured in such a way as to advance that as an objective. That is not the objective at all of the Convention and it is tremendously important to appreciate that right at the outset. I think a failure to appreciate that colours and prejudices looking at the Convention calmly and objectively on its merits.
        </para>
        <para>
         Of course, two basic positions are becoming evident in the public debate on the question of signature of the Convention. Firstly, there is the view that, if there were no Convention, there would be no mining. Secondly, there is the view at the other end of the spectrum that the Convention is an appropriate way to seek to ensure proper regulation and environmental protection. I have been seeking to make it clear that the Convention, as drafted, certainly contains within it the elements enabling proper regulation and proper environmental protection. Certainly it is not premised on any assumption that mining will occur. It may be that there is some halfway house between those two positions. It has been argued by a lot of people that, if some appropriate leverage is exerted, the Convention can be improved in a number of ways. That is something that remains to be seen. It is certainly something that we will continue to look at very carefully, although certainly not everything that we wanted ended up in the Convention. It is certainly the case that there are additional machinery clauses, in particular relating to the liability regime, which remain to be negotiated in the subsequent protocol. It is certainly arguable that maybe some of those negotiations can and should be brought forward so as to run in tandem with the implementation, the coming into force, of the Convention itself.
        </para>
        <para>
         All of these issues will be ones that we will consider very closely in the period ahead, particularly since it has now become apparent that Australia is not the only country that has a continuing debate going on about the signature of the Convention. Such a debate is now very obviously going on in France as well. This is very interesting since France, throughout the course of the negotiations, was one of the industrialised countries that was most keen to have a limited liability regime and less than formidable environmental protection provisions. The atmospherics in that country have changed and that may make it possible for some of these things-in particular, the terms of the liability protocol which remain to be negotiated-to be strengthened.
        </para>
        <para>
         But the basic point that I want to repeat is that, without going so far as to say that I believe that signing the Convention is the only way forward at this stage, certainly it is arguable, from everything that I have said to date, that a convention with the regime that I have described is the only way of ensuring that proper threshold barriers are placed against mining activity and that, as a result, the environment is fully preserved. It should be noted in this respect that quite a lot of the opposition to signing the Convention does not come only from the left wing, the environmental lobby, but also from the right wing, the mining industry. It is based on the view that the environmental protection provisions as they presently exist make it too difficult to exploit such mineral resources as may exist in the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         We keep on coming back to the issue. We have common objectives, namely, the protection of the Antarctic environment. What is the best way of getting there? Is it through a convention of the kind that is on the table before us, or is it through a course of action which would lead to the obstruction of the coming into force of that convention and a hope that there could be an extension of the absolute moratorium that now prevails? This is the nub of the question we now come to. It has to be said that without a convention in place containing the elements that I have described, the way could be open for unregulated mining, with no coherent provisions at all for protecting the environment.
        </para>
        <para>
         In the absence of a convention a claimant country, let us say for the sake of argument Argentina, could make an important mineral discovery in its Antarctic territory and decide to go ahead and mine. Some non-claimant industrial majors, for example the United States, Germany, Japan, could themselves combine to mine perhaps in the unclaimed sector, perhaps in a sector which is claimed by somebody else given that the sovereignty claims of all countries with claims in Antarctica are pretty fragile. The example of the reciprocal arrangements which have been entered into between some major industrial countries which did not sign the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention is relevant here-the kind of industrial partnerships that it is possible to imagine occurring and being implemented in practice in various parts of the Antarctic continent.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is at present an informal moratorium on mining in Antarctica. The 33 negotiating states at the Wellington meeting on the minerals convention agreed that this should continue pending the Convention's timely entry into force. But what is a timely entry into force? What degree of patience will have to be exercised by those countries with an interest in getting to work on the ground? There are unquestionably some of them with that gleam in their eye at the moment. It must be said that if the Convention goes into limbo, does not come into force, we could see an end to this present commitment to restraint, which has always itself been a rather fragile affair. It cannot be assumed that it will continue indefinitely.
        </para>

         Senator Puplick said that he and the Liberals are not running the idea of a world park, which has a great deal of appeal to all sorts of other people and obviously has an intuitive emotional appeal. Nonetheless, he expresses enthusiasm for the concept of an ongoing moratorium. In practice, though, I have to say that the concept of an ongoing, open-ended moratorium on resource development activity in practice would produce a result that is very much akin to that which is involved in a world park concept where mineral resource activity would be prohibited forever. Because they are parallel concepts, exactly the same considerations have to be addressed. Will a moratorium stick? Will the argument for the forswearing of any possible future interest in resource development of the kind that is involved in a world park concept be attainable? They are different ways of asking the same question, and it is a question addressing to the realities of the international environment as we find it.
        </para>
        <para>
         In that respect we have some useful evidence already on the table as to what the likely reaction of the international community may be. The world park proposal has had a run in the past. It was put forward by New Zealand in 1975 when the minerals issue was at a very early stage of consideration. It was rejected out of hand, not because there was any immediate interest in mining in Antarctica, but because Treaty parties were not prepared to foreclose the possibility that, should exploitable resources exist there, they might one day be extracted, albeit under stringent regulation, and albeit subject to the proviso that such activity was first found to be safe and environmentally acceptable-in other words, subject to the conditions contained in the present convention.
        </para>
        <para>
         Treaty parties faced with the reality of that kind of response, which unquestionably continues to be the response of all the major industrialised countries, and most of the claimant states as well right through to the present, then went about pursuing what they perceived to be the realistic alternative of negotiating a convention to establish mechanisms for deciding whether areas of Antarctica should be opened up to mining and for regulating it if it should occur. The environmental standards which have been established are arguably the toughest that exist in any international agreement.
        </para>
        <para>
         The other dimension that needs to be mentioned is the notion that Australia somehow can credibly go it alone-that we could at least proclaim a national park in our own territorial claim area in Antarctica and perhaps set some moral or practical example of forbearance in regard to development activity in that segment of the country. But to make that kind of suggestion and to build upon it any of the other notions about a world park or a moratorium by the territorial claimants to Antarctica at the moment is to fail to appreciate yet again the fragility of the claims. I am not making any great public confession of a point that is not supremely obvious to all those who are familiar with this area when I refer to the fragility of Australian and other claims to territorial sovereignty. Our own claim is based on exploration activity, occupation, variety of legislative and administrative acts and a long course of scientific activity. The Australian claim has long been challenged by a number of countries. It has only been expressly recognised by four countries, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France and Norway. It has not been recognised by the United States or the Soviet Union, the two countries which have engaged in the greatest exploration and activity within our sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         As to our claim, I do not want to get into all the labyrinthine legal arguments about what constitutes occupation and so on under international law. Nothing we have done has, any more than is the case for any of the other claimant states, the kind of universal, international recognition which would give us an absolutely rock solid claim to the kind of tenure which could exclude activity by other countries. The whole Antarctic Treaty system, which I began by describing, while ostensibly preserving the position of various territorial claims that have been made has set a trend of emptying asserted claims to sovereignty, Australia's among them, of any real practical content. The Antarctic Treaty initially provided for this by demilitarisation and freedom of movement for the purpose of scientific research. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources involved giving up the right to national regulation of marine resources in maritime zones surrounding Antarctica. So, in successive incremental ways, sovereignty claims are, in effect, continuing to be undermined by this generalised regime of which we are enthusiastic supporters. It is about the only way that we can continue to sustain any kind of credible toehold on the Antarctic continent.
        </para>
        <para>
         The fascinating point about the minerals convention is that it stands alone among the various Antarctic Treaty system documents-all those I have mentioned-in expressly recognising a special position for claimant states such as Australia. It does this in providing for representation on the key institutions of the Convention, the regulatory committee, the commission and so on, and in according claimant states special voting rights. Given the trend of events since the negotiations for the Antarctic Treaty back in the 1950s, this concession by other countries-a concession to a point that was strenuously argued for and fought for by Australia-is a major achievement and all we could realistically hope for in that respect.
        </para>
        <para>
         I make the point in yet another way that this Convention does offer advantages for Australia and for the sorts of principles that the Australian Government has been traditionally trying to espouse, environmental protection principles pre-eminently among them, which may simply not be attainable under any alternative approach. There is the vacuum approach which just says, `Abandon the convention and keep your fingers crossed that there will not be a scramble'; the approach which says, very optimistically, as Senator Puplick has done, `Let us argue for a continuation of a moratorium'; and the approach which argues, even more optimistically, for the creation, through some sudden universal conversion to values which have not hitherto been obvious, the sudden commitment to a world park. Those alternatives-at least the moratorium and the world park alternatives-have obvious attractions. But the huge question all of us have to confront and ultimately answer is whether they offer any better chance of protecting the environment than what is contained in this Convention. One is entitled to suggest, as many people have within the Government-although it is not an issue that is yet finally resolved-that the minerals Convention does offer the best way forward in preserving those values and advancing those causes in which I think all of us in this chamber share a common belief and a common commitment.
        </para>
        <para>
         For that reason it is far too premature, far too robust and far too pre-emptive an approach to try, as this motion does, to commit us right now to refusing to sign and ratify the proposed minerals Convention. In going down that course we may be cutting off our nose to spite our face. It may not be the most appropriate way to go about achieving the objectives that we all want to see implemented.

What he has stated basically is that, rather than having an unregulated scramble, he favours a regulated scramble for the minerals in the Antarctic. I note that the Minister is leaving the chamber.

          —Senator Hill says that it makes him worried. As Ian Warden would say, we are all worried when Senator Puplick makes an environmental statement, so I guess that is fair. The fact is that the situation has changed. Senator Evans said, `Well, the world park concept was rejected in the past; it is not realistic'. Yes, it was rejected in the past, but the times have changed. They have changed so much that Margaret Thatcher of all people is now professing to be a greenie.

        <para>
         The Government, living in its rarefied atmosphere, with its bunker mentality and its ministerial offices and the big white cars, does not realise that the times have changed. They have changed largely because of the greenhouse effect, which has brought home the environmental situation, the parlous state of the environment, to many people around the world. On my recent trip to China I found that the main topic of conversation was environmental pollution. Around the world this is a major issue. The Government does not recognise that the public opinion around the world would support and does support a world park in the Antarctic. It is operating in the past; it is putting its faith in treaties. In the past treaties have been worthless in the Antarctic; they have not done a thing for it. The only thing that protects the Antarctic from exploitation and development is economics. At this time it is simply uneconomic to mine for minerals there; it is simply uneconomic to drill for oil. It is not because of any treaty or any agreement; it is because it is uneconomic. When the economies get viable, treaty or no, the developers will be in there open slather and no minerals convention will stop them.

We have to take a new look, a new step. We cannot rely on these treaties. What have treaties done to protect the Antarctic cod, the krill or, indeed, anything else in the Antarctic? The treaties have done nothing; it is economic pressure and public pressure that are important. Public pressure is becoming more and more powerful. The whaling stopped not because of any treaty but because of the activities of organisations such as Greenpeace and others which put the pressure on, which focused the public attention, leading to public pressure. Public pressure, not treaties, is what is important here.

         Senator Evans informs us that under this treaty no mining would take place unless it could be proven that there would be no significant damage. The Antarctic is the most fragile environment on earth. Anything that happens in the Antarctic will affect that area. The mere presence of human beings upsets the balance. That is why we call for the proclamation of a world park. Senator Evans also said that the treaty would call for the best available technology. In my previous incarnation as a university professor at the University of California in Santa Barbara, I spent six years studying and working on the problems of offshore oil development, watching technology develop and watching what happened when the technology failed. Scientists still have not been able to ensure blow-out free offshore drilling. They still have one blow-out for 1,500 wells. There is no way in which their technology can get any better than this. I predicted at the time of the North Sea oil development-in fact I wrote the cover story for the New Scientist-the disasters which happened in the North Sea. I worked with the Norwegian Government in framing legislation to try to avoid some of those things. I was also a violent opponent of the Alaska pipeline and I foresaw what happened a month ago in Valdez. I predicted that along with many other people.
        </para>
        <para>
         The oil companies will always say that they have the best available technology. They will always say that no accidents will happen, but they will. Does the Government think that the oil companies are not looking at that area right now? In the Bulletin about a month ago there was an obscene photograph, or a montage, showing an iceberg with a drilling rig right next to it. Of course if this iceberg shifts its position-and they do; they float-it would wipe out the drilling rig. This is really an advertisement for an Australian rig building firm called Eglo Engineering Pty Ltd. It states:

        <para>
         When you look at Eglo, what you see is only the tip of the iceberg.
        </para>
        <para>
         The company says that it can build rigs all over the world, even in the Antarctic. It is looking at the area and, as is obvious from this advertisement, has absolutely no concept of the problems involved there. It must be stopped at all costs.

         Members of the Opposition have turned green. I welcome them. Ian Warden was mentioned at great length by Senator Evans. I would like to bring to the Senate's attention that other magnificent contributor to the Canberra Times, Mr Pryor, its cartoonist, who has a cartoon in today's paper. It shows Andrew Peacock with green leaves and stems coming out of his head and holding up a sign saying, `Keep the miners out'. John Howard also has plants growing out of his body and is holding a sign which says, `No mining in the Antarctic'. Senator Puplick, minus his bow tie but wearing a double-breasted suit-he is dressed very stylishly indeed-is carrying a sign saying, `Hands off the frozen continent'. Two individuals who look like public servants are walking by and saying, `Worst case of election fever I've ever seen'. That may be so; but, as I said earlier, I welcome the Opposition's support. If the Opposition realises the depth of the feeling in the community about the Antarctic and wishes to capitalise on it, more power to it; good on it.
        </para>
        <para>
         I wonder, though, whether the Opposition realises that it may be the force which can kill this treaty completely. I do not know that it realises this. I hope that it does. I hope that its action is not merely a churlish and cynical act to gain political support. I hope that the Opposition is not just going to let this motion die. It probably will pass and that will be the end of it. I hope that the Opposition does not feel that that is the end of it. I hope that it realises that this whole issue may come back before the Parliament and it may have the opportunity to vote yea or nay on this treaty.

        <para>
         I refer to the document entitled the Australian Treaty List put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra. It is part of Treaty Series 1971 No. 1. It says, under the heading `Ratification':
        </para>
        <para>
         Some treaties become effective upon signature. Others require ratification, that is, formal confirmation by a signatory State. Ratification again is an Executive act and the approval of the Governor-General is accordingly necessary before any international agreement in inter-governmental form is ratified by Australia. Matters of this nature are normally placed before the Governor-General in Council by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and when approval for ratification has been given, the appropriate instrument of ratification is executed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Although ratification is an executive act, in practice agreements of major political significance are frequently submitted to Parliament for approval before ratification. Reference to Parliament is, of course, necessary where legislation is required to put into effect within Australia the terms of a treaty. State Governments are also often consulted . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         It looks as though this may in fact come back before the Parliament as a Bill. When and if it does, I sincerely hope that the Opposition will remember the strong words that were spoken today against this treaty. I sincerely hope that the Opposition will join the Democrats and the Independents in defeating this treaty once and for all. If Australia led the way in the world in defeating this treaty, it would give strength to the other nations to actually push ahead for a world park concept and we would be able to preserve the Antarctic in perpetuity and not merely have a moratorium on mining that the Opposition would like to have but have perpetual care for this last great wilderness area on earth.

          —It is wonderful that the National Party of Australia is in on it as well. Part of my original urgency motion that came before the Senate on 12 April was to promote the formulation of a comprehensive conservation convention for the Antarctic based on the concept of a world park.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         This matter was subject to debate on 12 April when Senator Puplick moved an amendment to my motion which called on the Government not to sign the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA). Senator Puplick's amendment, in effect, called only for more discussions. Although I agree that more discussion in the community has been necessary, it was very obvious at that stage that the Liberal Party was not willing to vote against and not sign CRAMRA. I am very glad that the Liberal Party has come to that position in the past few weeks.
        </para>
        <para>
         Obviously, the Liberal and National parties are responding to community concern on this subject. I would say that they have been lobbied very conscientiously. A lot of that lobbying has probably come from their own members who are genuinely concerned about this very important environmental issue and also they have no doubt been successfully lobbied by the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is doing a sterling job to preserve this unique wilderness for the world community.
        </para>
        <para>
         Of course there are votes in this issue and perhaps the Australian Labor Party will recognise this soon, as the coalition has. Let me remind Senator Puplick, the coalition and the people of Australia of what was said here on 12 April by one of the Liberal Party spokespersons who entered the debate. That was Senator Crichton-Browne. He said:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . if Senator Richardson thought there were any greenie votes to be got out of not signing this thing, he certainly would not be signing it.
        </para>
        <para>
         A little later he accused the Australian Democrats and me of having drawn ourselves together `in pursuit of whatever irresponsible leftover greenie vote there is'. That comment was made only a few weeks ago and he has obviously been proved wrong. I am very glad that the parties are bigger than the person in this case.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is not an irresponsible vote. It is very sensible and very sane. It is certainly not a leftover greenie vote. It is a growing greenie vote. I am very glad that the coalition parties are responding to that. Senator Crichton-Browne also said that Australia's signature of CRAMRA was irrelevant. He said:
        </para>
        <para>
         Whether or not the regime is signed by Australia will in no way affect whether or not there is mining in Antarctica.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a totally illogical statement. He also said:
        </para>
        <para>
         The truth of the matter is that Australia will be able to make no contribution if it is not a signatory of the treaty.
        </para>
        <para>
         I am very glad that his Party's more carefully considered position has shown his judgment to be wrong.
        </para>

         When we look at the Government's position we find that Senator Evans this morning has reiterated the Government line that CRAMRA will limit and monitor mining and that this is not based on an assumption that mining will occur. Whom is he kidding? It is not based on any logic at all. One does not stop something by regulating it. The Government is opening the door for mining to occur, albeit under scrutiny. The fact is that enormous pressure would be applied, once CRAMRA was in place, for the scramble for minerals in Antarctica as soon as it was seen to be economically viable, which Senator Sanders has already pointed out.
        </para>
        <para>
         We can stop mining by not allowing any opportunities for that to occur by putting in place a creative alternative like the world park. The current moratorium on mining should be extended while a comprehensive conservation convention is worked out. Obviously, that will take quite some time. Senator Evans doubts whether a moratorium would stick while those discussions were in place. In other words, he has contradicted his own argument because what he was saying by implication was that as soon as CRAMRA is signed the countries and companies that have been waiting patiently all this time will immediately move ahead with their plans for mining. He knows that that is what will happen. I do not believe that we should be giving miners that chance. We should let them know now that Antarctica is off limits. We should let them psychologically adapt to that reality.
        </para>
        <para>
         What the people of the world want is a world park to preserve the wilderness and the species which are at immediate risk if development is allowed to interfere with their lifestyles. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has publicly dubbed conservationists speaking on this issue as pixies and elves. It shows how out of touch the Minister is with the breadth and depth of feeling about the Antarctica. There must be millions and millions of pixies and elves who would like to see this last vestige of nature's magnificence relatively unspoilt by human activity.
        </para>
        <para>
         There are not many untouched places on earth, which is why so many people are rallying to the sensible and popular cause of keeping Antarctica free and absolutely free of mining. It is not only mining that puts Antarctica's fragile environment at risk. Tourism is also a concern. That was mentioned, but not in any great detail, in the debate on 12 April. Limits to the kinds of tourism that would be allowed there should also be worked out in the context of a world park. If CRAMRA were signed the international cooperation of scientific teams also would be jeopardised. It has been a success story in research opportunities which are not limited by political considerations. That would disappear, too, because CRAMRA would turn Antarctica, like the rest of the world, into a competitive arena rather than a cooperative one, which it is, by and large, at the moment.
        </para>
        <para>
         Australia has a special opportunity to make a stand on this issue. It would be a welcome change to be in the company of France. But it would be a great tragedy if the present Government squandered this special opportunity. I know that many Government members will not be happy about having to vote on party lines against this motion. I strongly encourage the Government to have the guts to do what the Opposition has done, which is to respond to popular opinion on this subject-to preserve Antarctica free from the ravages of mining.

          —I begin by reflecting on the Opposition's response to the motion which Senator Vallentine moved a little over a fortnight ago in this chamber. I remind the Senate that Senator Vallentine's motion stated:
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The need for the Australian government to refuse to sign the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA), and instead to promote the formulation of a comprehensive conservation convention for the Antarctic, based on the concept of an Antarctic World Park.
        </para>
        <para>
         On that occasion, Senator Puplick, who spoke for the Opposition, successfully moved, with the support of the Government, to amend that motion. He moved:
        </para>
        <para>
         Leave out all words after `urgency:', insert: The need for the Australian Government to promote adequate public discussion of all of the issues arising in relation to whether or not Australia should become a signatory to the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA).
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, a little over a fortnight ago we had the spectre of the Opposition strongly opposing the principal thrust of Senator Vallentine's motion. Now, a little over a fortnight later, the Opposition has turned around and is seeking to gain political mileage by supporting at least the first part of Senator Vallentine's motion, although I must reiterate-and I would like to speak later on the Opposition's second point-that it is not supporting the world park as an alternative.
        </para>
        <para>
         We are very concerned that the Opposition in no sense understands the main thrust of conservation. Its basic program is still one of exploitation. Nonetheless, for political reasons on this occasion the Opposition has seen it desirable to support the rejection of CRAMRA. Like Senator Vallentine, I have to welcome that support because, hopefully, it will mean that when the Government introduces legislation, which I believe it should do before it can ratify CRAMRA, the Opposition will join with the Australian Democrats and the independent senators to reject that legislation. The Government would therefore have to reconsider an alternative to CRAMRA.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is interesting that we have this image of a party as a whole turning around in a little over a fortnight. This indicates again the stupid instability of the party system which locks in members. I am sure that a fortnight ago many members of the Opposition were opposed to what Senator Puplick was saying, as there are probably members of the Opposition who are now opposed to what Mr Howard said recently in Queensland-comments which seem to have given the Opposition a new green tinge. Nonetheless, we have this flip-flop arrangement because of the operation of the party system which, clearly, is in nobody's interests.
        </para>
        <para>
         All members of the Parliament would recently have received a letter from Jacques Costeau whose comments are a useful point at which to begin this debate. He writes:
        </para>
        <para>
         Antarctica, a peaceful land, rich in opportunities for scientific research, is threatened. In spite of the best intentions of the nations which adopted the Wellington Convention-
        </para>
        <para>
         he is referring there to CRAMRA-
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . any attempt to exploit Antarctica's minerals carries serious hazards.
        </para>
        <para>
         He then made an appeal. He said:
        </para>
        <para>
         On the behalf of the 300,000 members of the Cousteau Society and its sister organization in France, Foundation Cousteau, we appeal to you, the members of the Australian Parliament, to oppose the Wellington Convention.
        </para>
        <para>
         He has asked us to oppose CRAMRA. As I indicated in the debate here in this place a little over a fortnight ago, the Antarctic provides a very useful object lesson for us. It is always important to point to the conditions of which the proposed exploitation of the Antarctic is merely a symptom, rather than dwell on the symptom alone, as the debate so far this morning has done. I point out again that human beings, as a separate animal species, have been around for about six million years. We believe from cosmological evidence that we may be around for another 500 million years if we look after our environment. We have had some one per cent of our life on this planet so far; we are a very young animal. Yet already, in just 200 years of industrial exploitation of the planet, we have apparently got to the stage where we need to wreck the last continent on earth in exactly the same way as we have wrecked every other continent in seeking the last few resources which will prop up this industrial so-called civilisation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Surely our desperation for resources after such a short time should give us an indication that something is wrong with the way in which industrial civilisation is exploiting this fragile planet. Rather than seeking to get a few more years supply of oil, copper, iron or anything else out of the Antarctic, we should bear in mind that our descendants into the distant future have a right to call on those resources. We should be doing something far more substantial in relation to adopting more conservative ways of approaching the planet; in other words, we should be living with the environment instead of living against it.
        </para>
        <para>
         As Senator Sanders pointed out earlier, we have abundant evidence of the serious damage that we are doing on a global scale. There are serious problems of ozone depletion, particularly over the Antarctic. There are major changes in the composition of the atmosphere, with a whole range of greenhouse gases coming from our industrial activity. We do not yet know how to turn that around. We have serious resource depletion in many areas. We are slaughtering tropical rainforests and other forests at a prodigious rate. Surely we should be saying to ourselves, `Look, there is something wrong with the way we are proceeding. We should not be going into places like the Antarctic. We should not be seeking just to get a little more of a resource for a few more years'. Clearly, sooner or later, we must change and now is the time to bring about that change.
        </para>
        <para>
         As several other speakers have pointed out, the Antarctic treaty has persisted and worked remarkably well for nearly 30 years. It has achieved a demilitarised zone and prohibited nuclear explosions, the dumping of nuclear waste and nuclear testing in that region. It has guaranteed the freedom of scientific research and the free exchange of scientific information based on that research. I point out that that position will not obtain if we see a minerals exploration-exploitation regime implemented in the Antarctic. Under such a regime, information which is gathered by companies will not be freely available to others.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Antarctic has been used for these scientific and peaceful purposes and there has been a temporary hold on territorial claims. This has certainly worked well for quite a long time. It is intended to set up under CRAMRA a regime for controlling the exploration and exploitation of minerals in the Antarctic. Currently, activities in the Antarctic are covered under the existing treaty whereas, under CRAMRA, Australia would totally lose its right to control those activities of exploration and exploitation in that Territory which it claims as its own. However, at this stage, Australia is in an extremely strong position to control the direction of CRAMRA or any alternative treaty which might replace it. Under CRAMRA, those nations which claim territory in the Antarctic have a right of veto over CRAMRA. In short, if Australia refuses to ratify CRAMRA, CRAMRA does not come into operation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Unfortunately, the motion moved by Senator Puplick does not really put anything in its place. I certainly join with Senator Vallentine and say that Australia should immediately take a lead not only in refusing to sign CRAMRA but also in bringing the Antarctic nations together to negotiate a new treaty aimed at establishing a world park in the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         I totally disagree with Senator Evans. I agree with Senator Vallentine and Senator Sanders in believing that Senator Evans apparently is not aware of the enormous change in understanding and public opinion since 1975. The world is now aware of problems such as the greenhouse effect and the decrease in the stratospheric ozone, problems which will persist for centuries. At the recent Greensborough by-election, the poll showed that the four most important issues were environmental issues. That was not so in 1975, but it was the case this year. Also, it is not only in Australia; it is a worldwide phenomenon. It is against that background that we could now successfully move to negotiate an alternative treaty which would reject exploration and exploitation of minerals and put in place an alternative internationally agreed world park convention.
        </para>
        <para>
         The supposition that we can proceed safely to explore and exploit minerals is based on the view that these conventions can be made to stick, that somehow there are technical devices that can be put in place that will ensure that harm will not occur; but it is quite clear that every really major accident in recent times was due not to failure of technology but to failure of the human technology interface; humans had failed. The Three Mile Island accident, the results of which are still being cleaned up years later at a cost of billions of dollars, resulted from human failure in the control room, an inability to understand the technology. At Chernobyl, again those in the control room were unable to understand properly what was going on in the reactor. Most recently and most relevantly in the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska, the skipper was evidently drunk and incapable of taking charge of the vessel, and the vessel, proceeding along a channel 16 kilometres wide, ran onto a rock and spewed oil over a very important area, something that the oil companies said would never happen.
        </para>
        <para>
         There are numerous examples in the Antarctic in which the terms of treaties have led to a failure because of the inability of people-not the treaties-to cooperate. In 1977, the Antarctic Treaty nations gathered and signed the Convention on the Conservation of Marine Living Resources which was designed to regulate fishing in the region. All decisions under that convention had to be reached by consensus, and the nations agreed. But that crippling concession has shown that the conservation measures adopted can only be as strong as the most reluctant and shortsighted members. Between 1977, when it was signed, and 1983 it became clear that Antarctic fish stocks were being dangerously over-exploited and at least three species of fish had been so overfished in some areas, particularly around the island of South Georgia, that less than 10 per cent of the original stock remained. The attempt to control what was happening was thwarted and those proposals had to be put in place again by a consensus process.
        </para>
        <para>
         Greenpeace found on Deception Island 47 barrels of fuel several of which were leaking their contents into the ground near a beach frequented by penguins, fur seals and several other species and birds. Some of these people in the Antarctic simply showed a total disregard for conventions. So it is human failure.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is certain that if CRAMRA comes into place, with the best intentions in the world there will be accidents in the Antarctic which will do irreparable damage, because what is quite clear from the Exxon Valdez accident is that, even where a large population was in the near vicinity and presumably a number of facilities were already available, there was a complete inability to deal adequately with the oil spill. If something similar happened in the Antarctic there would be a total inability to cope with the damage. So we simply cannot afford to go down that road. We cannot afford to have exploration or exploitation of minerals in the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         I mentioned earlier the problem caused by the change from the openness of scientific data, as applies now under the Antarctic Treaty, to the confidentiality of data under such an exploitative regime. It is quite clear that this would cause conflicts between competing nations, and the Antarctic would progressively descend from being a place of peaceful scientific exchange to one of conflict and competition between nations.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Antarctic is a very important source of data for monitoring the global environment. One could reflect again on the very important work in the Antarctic in understanding the mechanism for ozone depletion in the stratosphere. The mechanisms of chemical reaction in the stratosphere, which were predicted in the early 1970s by Rowland and Molina, have substantially been confirmed by work in the stratosphere over the Antarctic. In view of the greenhouse effect and the cooling of the stratosphere, an understanding of that mechanism may become absolutely vital to a possible extension of that stratospheric ozone depletion to the rest of the world should the temperatures in the stratosphere over the rest of the world descend to those that obtain in the Antarctic. From ice core samples taken in the Antarctic, a picture can be built up of what the global atmosphere was like over almost the last 200,000 years and also what the global temperatures have been. That gives a very important fix on what is being done to the atmosphere at present. That type of work is likely to be interfered with very seriously if the exploration and exploitation of minerals are allowed to proceed in that area. It is a very important area from the point of view of getting that base data on the environment.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Puplick and others have pointed out that only approximately 3 per cent of the Antarctic is not ice-covered. Of course, if exploration and exploitation go ahead that is precisely where buildings, runways and various other structures would preferentially be put. Again, that is precisely the area where many of the seals, penguins and other creatures of the Antarctic which can go on to the land build their nests and carry out other functions important to their life cycle. Even with a continent as vast as the Antarctic, there is an immediate conflict concerning the areas which it is important to protect, because only a very tiny part of the land surface is available for such biological activity and the sorts of activities which humans might want to carry out there.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Australian Democrats support the motion put up by Senator Puplick, but we would prefer to extend it beyond merely calling for Australia not to sign CRAMRA but to seek an international agreement which would extend the limitation on mining exploration and exploitation. We would seek to extend it, as Senator Vallentine has already indicated, to the point at which Australia would take the lead and seek immediately to engage other nations in the establishment of a world park. I point out again, and this must be stressed, that Australia has been very reluctant to take a leading role. Australia seems to have adopted the mentality that it is a third-rate power. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) talked about a banana republic some time ago.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let us stand up and be counted. We have an enormous opportunity here. As a claimant state we have an ability to veto CRAMRA. Let us do that, as the first thing. As the very next thing let us proceed down that same road and use that opportunity to establish a mechanism which would put into place a world park concept. Let us engage other nations in a dialogue which will lead to a new convention and which will see a world park established in the Antarctic. I would like to conclude with an appeal from Sir Peter Scott in which he said:
        </para>
        <para>
         In my view, Antarctica stands at the crossroads. If the minerals convention is signed and brought into effect in its present form, it will mean that human greed, the desire for short-term profit, the urge to conquer new frontiers at whatever the cost to the environment, will have triumphed yet again. It will mean that the devastation brought over virtually the whole of the rest of the globe is likely to spread to the last wilderness. Antarctica represents the last chance we have of proving that we really will change our ways and begin living in harmony with the planet.

          —As the Australian Democrats are not prepared to acknowledge the usual convention in these matters of one speaker a side, it is necessary for me to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to answer some of the matters that have just been put by the last speaker. Whilst there is much with which we would agree, where the last speaker failed was to acknowledge the leadership that has been taken by Senator Puplick and the Opposition in this critically important area. Therefore, I commence by reminding the Senate that this is a motion of the Opposition, reflecting its now announced policy in this area. Senator Puplick has this day moved:

         (iii) increase its own level of environmental and scientific activities in the Antarctic.
        </para>
        <para>
         In effect, the Opposition is indicating to the Government that it is our view, after legitimate debate within the parliamentary and political process, that the Government should now make a stand, take the lead within the world community and acknowledge that perhaps positions that have been taken in relation to the prospect of mining in the Antarctic are flawed, and that this Convention should not be ratified. Furthermore, as I have indicated, we advocate positive steps to be taken by this Government particularly in the area of lifting our environmental and scientific activities with the Antarctic, which have been much criticised as far as this Government's performance is concerned.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government should go one step further and not only say that it will not ratify this Convention, but draw the parties to the Treaty together to look at the first steps of putting in place an effective regime to prohibit mining in the Antarctic. I would have hoped that the members of the Australian Democrats would have applauded that position without qualification. Rather, they have sought today again to demean the debate in political terms by asserting that this motion is a populist act on behalf of the Opposition. That is clearly offensive to Senator Puplick who, I think, is accepted widely as having taken the lead in this debate for a long time and who has maintained a consistent position.
        </para>
        <para>
         There was criticism that while the political process was taking place and our position was being debated within the party room it was not possible to support certain motions in this place. That is quite a legitimate position to take. It does not mean in any way that there is a change of attitude. The Opposition is proud of the leadership it is showing in this area and it is hopeful that the Government might respond positively to that leadership, now knowing that the parties which obtained more than 50 per cent of first preference votes in this country in the last Federal election are of the view that the Government should not ratify this Convention.
        </para>
        <para>
         One of the reasons why the Opposition has reached this decision is that it seems to us to be inconsistent to say, on the one hand, that we are opposed to mining within the Antarctic and, on the other hand, that a convention which sets in place a regulatory mechanism for mining in the Antarctic should be ratified. Again this morning the Minister tried, to some extent, to argue that that simply was not so. It seems to us that one cannot maintain credibility in an argument in opposition to mining if one accepts a regime for mining. The Opposition stresses to the Government that if it is to go back to the consultative parties to the Treaty and maintain and promote an argument against mining, it cannot do so having ratified this Convention.
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not underestimate Australia's role and influence in this area. I suspect I am one of the few senators who have actually played a part in the consultative party meetings in New York, when I had the privilege, two years ago, to be a parliamentary adviser to the Australian mission to the United Nations. I am well aware of the influence that Australia has, having been an original consultative party and having sought to maintain a lead in the Antarctic debate over the years. I repeat, that that is a lead which is becoming harder to sustain while this Government is not prepared to give the commitment that is needed, particularly in the scientific area in the Antarctic, to justify our continued assertions to sovereignty. Nevertheless, Australia is regarded as a leader within the Antarctic debate, and from that position of strength could be doing a lot more to promote a regime to prohibit mining than has been sought by this Government to date.
        </para>
        <para>
         What we really find, I regret to say, is a government divided on the issue. In public statements, some Ministers advocate signing the Convention and some are opposed to it. One can only suspect that the Government's objective is again to attempt to give the impression that it is really opposed to the Convention and to mining in the Antarctic whilst, in the end, saying that it had little choice but to ratify the Convention. I reiterate what others have said: Australia and France are the two parties which still have the power to halt this process by refusing to ratify. We hope that the Government will take the lead that we have set today.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is important to put the debate in context. When negotiations for this Convention started nearly a decade ago there was a different world attitude as to the safety of mining in areas that are environmentally fragile. Through many experiences in the meantime, the world community is now much more doubtful about our capacity to avoid very serious damage from unexpected side effects of that mining. We had one very recent tragic example-the Exxon Valdez vessel off Alaska. The world community has now changed its attitude a great deal. We are now seeing it in the debate that is taking place in Europe and in the United States as to whether this treaty is really the right way to go. That is indicative of the fact that if the Convention negotiations were to start today, rather than a decade ago, they would be of a very different nature. They would be, rather, along the lines of that which we advocate-a regime to prohibit mining and to protect the environment, rather than a scheme to regulate mining within Antarctica.
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not think that there is anything wrong with Australia recognising that fact and saying that our attitude, together with that of most of the world community, has now changed. It is not too late to change our minds and say to our treaty partners in the Antarctic forums in New York, `We have changed our minds. We recognise that the world attitude to mining within fragile areas such as the Antarctic is very different today, and we want to approach this issue from a very different point of view'. I think that that sort of leadership would hold Australia high in international esteem. Having experienced attitudes within the world community in New York, you will be well aware, Mr Deputy President, that those who have a special privilege in relation to the Antarctic-sovereign claimants, claimants by virtue of their scientific endeavours in the Antarctic, and the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which are also involved in the consultative process-are somewhat envied by the rest of the world community. While the rest of the world community will tolerate the special privileges we have in relation to the Antarctic, it nevertheless expects a great deal of us. It expects leadership, and I think that it has shown that in this debate we are heading in the wrong direction. Basically, that is our rationale in coming to the conclusion that this Government should now act, that at this belated stage it should show leadership by acting as we have set out in this motion.
        </para>
        <para>
         I conclude by briefly putting our position in the context of our record on the environment. We have heard a lot of nonsense this morning from both the Australian Democrats and, in more moderate terms, Senator Vallentine, who said that this is some sort of last-minute greening. Sometimes the coalition's record in relation to environmental matters during its years in government has been understated, perhaps because we do not promote ourselves and our achievements as effectively as does the other side. Let me briefly put this decision on the environment in the context of our record in relation to parks. I refer to the proclamation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by our Government; our prohibition of sandmining on Fraser Island; the proclamation of the Kakadu and Uluru parks; the proclamation of the Christmas Island national park; and the proclamation of the marine nature reserves which were established under the Coral Sea proclamation.

         The coalition had so many environmental firsts. I mention briefly those relating to the Antarctic. It was our Government that put in place the Antarctic Treaty Act 1960, the Antarctic Treaty (Environmental Protection) Act 1980 and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981. It was our Government which secured the listing on the World Heritage List of the Great Barrier Reef, and Kakadu stage 1 in 1981, and which secured the listing of the Willandra Lakes. It was our Government that initiated proposals for the listing of the Lord Howe Island group and the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks in 1982. One could go on. If I were to take the time of the Senate I could refer to the Acts that we passed to prevent and to reduce pollution. All I am saying is that this is not a sudden greening. Anyone looking objectively at our proud record in relation to environmental protection over many years will see that this decision is but an extension of that record. Therefore, we have moved this motion in the genuine hope that the lead that we have shown will be taken up by the Government and that it, on behalf of all Australians will give the appropriate lead to the world community.

          —I am very pleased to be able to support the motion that has been moved by Senator Puplick. I am certainly very well aware of what the Opposition has done in relation to the environment in the past, and I am appreciative of those areas in which I consider that it has made considerable advances towards preserving the Australian environment. I am very pleased that this has emerged from the Opposition at a time when Australians of all political complexions are becoming very aware of the importance of preserving the environment. Through the excellent Australian Broadcasting Corporation program Four Corners, they have become aware of a place that they had never been to, namely the Antarctic, and the potential for devastation that is occurring there right now as well as the potential for devastation if the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities is signed and ratified. In the past, of course, this treaty was negotiated largely in secret. The negotiations began in 1981, and this Convention replaces the voluntary moratorium on mining that has been in place since 1977.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         If ratified, the Convention will facilitate the exploitation of mineral deposits in the Antarctic. I and the Opposition, and, I think, the Australian Democrats, disagree with the Government on this matter. The Government claims that if the Convention is signed it will provide a mechanism for protecting the Antarctic and that the way will be clear for instituting some control, but I think it is very clear, from the way the French have already been behaving in the Antarctic, even without any controls in place, and from the terms of the Convention, that there is no way we could guarantee that mining would not occur in the Antarctic. It is my belief that the only way we can prevent that is by refusing to sign and ratify the Convention.
        </para>
        <para>
         When Senator Evans tabled the document he drew attention to Australia's primary objectives in the Antarctic. He summarised them as follows: to maintain the Antarctic region free from strategic and political confrontation; to preserve Australia's sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory; to protect the Antarctic environment; to take advantage of the special opportunities that Antarctica offers for scientific research; to be informed about and able to influence developments in a region geographically proximate to Australia; and to derive possible economic benefits from the living and non-living resources of the AAT. Yet we need to question whether this Convention, which is the most recent to be negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty nations, will be in either Australia's interests or in the interests of the Antarctic continent. If it comes into force it will change forever the nature of the continent and Australia's place in it.
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Evans also drew attention to the need to maintain the political and strategic stability of the Antarctic region as well as Australia's position as a claimant state. The Antarctic Treaty was negotiated in 1959 as a result of United States initiatives. Those initiatives arose from concerns about geo-political tensions which were generated by competing sovereignty claims in the area and by a desire that was engendered by the Cold War to prevent a dominant Soviet influence in the Antarctic. When the Treaty finally came into force in June 1961, the Antarctic was established as a zone of peace. That meant that it could not become the scene or object of international discord. Military activities are prohibited under the Treaty, as are nuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive materials. Thus it was established as the world's first nuclear free zone.
        </para>
        <para>
         Seven states lay claim to part of the Antarctic. Australia's claim of 42 per cent, as we have heard, is the largest. Other states claiming sovereignty over the continent are New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Chile, Argentina and Norway. The claims of Chile, Argentina and Britain overlap and in the past have been a source of conflict. Another 15 per cent of the continent is unclaimed. The United States and the Soviet Union maintain a basis of claim, that is, they maintain the right to lodge a claim at some time in the future.
        </para>
        <para>
         The nature of these claims is complicated by the fact that they are not mutually recognised in international law by all the other Treaty states or by the non-signatories. Australia's claim, for example, is recognised by Britain and New Zealand and, in turn, Australia acknowledges the legitimacy of the claims of those two countries. However, article 4 of the Treaty puts all claims on ice, so to speak, so that all parties, whether claimant states or not, are able to maintain their position regarding those claims and therefore avoid open conflict. Thus, the Antarctic Treaty system has become an excellent example of international cooperation.
        </para>
        <para>
         This could all now be changed with the signing and ratification of the minerals convention. I will not go into any further details now as I covered them earlier in an adjournment debate, but I point out that the Antarctic has already suffered considerable devastation from human intervention. Oil spills have already had a great effect on the ecology, the wildlife and the very sensitive environment of the area. Much of the wildlife in the area has already been overexploited and will have an effect on the ecological systems right around the globe.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Treaty is intended to protect the environment, not to destroy it. It seems to me that in the lack of a provision for unlimited liability there is a great danger of nations destroying the environment and not even having the opportunity or being forced, under the Treaty, to clean up the mess. Even in the face of some provision for limited liability, one might ask: to whom could liability be directed for the destruction of the unique environment? That is one of the fears of conservation organisations around Australia and, indeed, around the world.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is an obligation under the Convention to clean up the damaging effects of mining but there are still no specific details for the rehabilitation of the environment. Yet we could ask: how can such a susceptible and fragile environment ever be returned to its original state? We only have to look at mining in Australia to see how an even sturdier environment has been affected. It is true that the nature and extent of the mineral deposits in the Antarctic are not yet known but surely for once, given the importance of the Antarctic to the health of the entire world's climate and to its ecosystems, we could refrain from preventing any exploitation of an area upon which the future of all of us depends.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government has been very disappointing in not taking a leading role in this area. It has not given some commitment to its supposed stand on conservation matters by renegotiating the Convention. It has not taken an international lead by refusing to open the way for any kind of exploitation of the Antarctic and pointing out the sorts of things that we have heard today from the Democrat speakers and from Senator Vallentine-that is, that it is a region worthy of preservation, not only for its own sake, its beauty, its unique wildlife and its unique ecosystems but also because we do not know what sorts of effects damaging this environment will have on the world. We can be sure, however, that the effects will not be good.

       DEBT RECOVERY UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT AND THE VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS ACT
      </para>
      <para>
       In order to give some guidance to persons and organisations who may be considering making a submission to the Committee on this matter, I would like to make some brief comments on the proposed reference.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act contain various provisions relating to the recovery of money from recipients of benefits under these Acts. These provisions principally deal with the recovery of overpayments, which are deemed to be debts due to the Commonwealth. For example, section 246 of the Social Security Act deals with recovery of overpayments by reason of false statement or representation, or because of failure or omission to comply with any provision of the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recovery under section 246 is by way of deduction from any future benefits. The section also provides for the payment of an additional sum by way of penalty. The Committee is interested in examining the operation of the section, particularly its impact on persons whose benefits are reduced in accordance with the section.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 162 of the Social Security Act allows the Department of Social Security to garnishee money that is due or payable to a person indebted to the Commonwealth. It covers situations where, for example, that person has money in a bank account, is entitled to wages from an employer or is entitled to a lump sum payment under a contract or, more likely, a damages settlement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subsection 162 (7) provides that if there is any precondition to the payment of the money, then for the purposes of the garnishee process the precondition is deemed to have been fulfilled.
      </para>
      <para>
       This covers situations where, for example, the signature of the person is required before the money can be released. The provision could also conceivably operate to prejudice someone who has a contract with the person for goods and/or services. For example, the performance of work by the person could be said to be the precondition to the payment of his or her wages. Theoretically, the Department could deem that this precondition has been met and garnishee the person's wages without any work being performed. Similarly, the provision of goods by the person under a contract could be deemed to have been fulfilled and the contract price then garnisheed by the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 205a of the Veterans' Entitlements Act operates in a similar way.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both provisions carry significant sanctions if a person or organisation fails to comply with a garnishee order.
      </para>
      <para>
       The committee is concerned that the sections may operate otherwise than as intended, to the detriment of third parties, and intends to look into and report on the operation of the sections.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 164 of the Social Security Act and section 128 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act give the Secretaries of the relevant Departments extensive information gathering powers in relation to persons indebted to the Commonwealth. In the course of the committee's recent inquiry into the proposed national ID system and the tax file number, these provisions were the subject of some criticism. It was suggested to the Committee that the provisions were unduly intrusive on the privacy of the persons concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 164 has subsequently been amended in such a way as to alleviate some of the concerns communicated to the Committee at that time. Nevertheless, the Committee intends to examine the operation of the provisions in more detail than was possible in the course of the previous reference and assess whether these concerns are justified.
      </para>
      <para>
       Section 251 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary of the Department of Social Security the power to write-off or waive debts owing to the Commonwealth. Recent amendments to the Social Security Act have given the Minister for Social Security the power to issue directions on how the Secretary is to exercise his or her power. The Committee is concerned about the type of directions which could be issued by the Minister. Particularly, the Committee is concerned that the Secretary's discretion could be restricted by such directions to the extent that there was no longer any real discretion with the Secretary. Accordingly, the Committee believes that this matter warrants further examination.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, I note recent media interest in relation to a proposed code of practice governing, among other things, the actions of banks in relation to the accounts of social welfare beneficiaries. The initial focus of concern was a proposal that banks be entitled to deduct up to 14% of a social security benefit paid into a customer's account if the bank believed that the customer owed it money. The banks and the Department have subsequently agreed on 10% as a more appropriate figure.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee's concern in this matter is two-fold. First, there is the question of whether, in the light of the fact that section 249 of the Social Security Act declares that pensions, benefits and allowances are `absolutely inalienable', such a deduction is possible as a matter of law. Second, there is the fact that there is no requirement for the bank to actually prove the debt to the satisfaction of, say, a court. The recovery action relies solely on the banks' belief that the person is indebted to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee intends to seek submissions from all interested parties and to report to the Senate by the last sitting day of 1989.

       SHIELD OF THE CROWN
      </para>
      <para>
       The Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which recently tabled its report in this place, recommended that the matter of `the shield of the Crown' be referred to a parliamentary committee for further examination. It became clear to that Committee, in the course of its enquiry, that the doctrine of the shield of the Crown was now a matter of some importance, given the growth in the number and activities of public corporations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst the Parliament has recently enacted legislation to establish corporate structures for a range of government business enterprises, there has been no uniform legislative approach to the shield of the Crown doctrine. In any event, there exist many statutory authorities whose ability to invoke the doctrine needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. In the State domain there are a number of statutory trading enterprises which have invoked the doctrine in recent times. It is therefore desirable to attempt to identify a common approach to this vexed question. This is what the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee will be doing under these terms of reference.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee will shortly be calling for submissions. In doing this, it expects to have the benefit of a range of informed views when it comes to deal with the matters raised by the terms of reference.

        The Australian Capital Territory has recently completed its first election. Perhaps `completed' is a slight overstatement, but it certainly has had an election under the legislation that this Parliament passed late last year. I said that might be somewhat of an overstatement because it is now some eight weeks since the poll took place and yet the ultimate result has not been declared. It is clear that there have been problems in relation to the election process. It is not as clear where those problems lie and what is the best solution to improve the electoral process and perhaps the electoral system for the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is fair to say that this first election, like all first elections, should not necessarily be treated as a norm for the future. A large number of individuals and parties stood and, no doubt, an element of novelty was involved in the first election for self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. The matter was further complicated by the fact that, in many ways, the election process clearly became a referendum on the subject of self-government itself and that referendum type approach to the election distorted the ultimate outcome. That is a reasonable political position to be taken by candidates who oppose the self-government process for the ACT, but it certainly has had the effect of distorting the result as a number of no self-government candidates have been elected to a government which is in existence. They are now in the interesting position where, despite their pledge to bring self-government to an end, they are about to take their seats in the governing body. So the extent to which these somewhat extraneous factors have complicated the first poll in the ACT is unclear, but it is clear that, not having had a result after eight weeks and with the degree of public concern about the whole electoral process, this Parliament should address the concerns that have been expressed within the ACT since the election.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to us on this side of the chamber that the most appropriate vehicle for examining these questions is the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Matters. The ACT self-government has been formed out of Federal legislation, and the Federal Parliament is the only body with the capacity to change the ACT electoral system. The Joint Committee of this Parliament has now had experience in dealing with these matters. It has built up a certain expertise and it certainly has an interest in matters of this nature. There are the alternatives of setting up yet another select committee or attempting to send the question off to some outside body. They seem to us to be unnecessary whilst we have a body within our establishment specifically designated for such purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said last night, that Committee has other work on its plate, which is not unusual in this parliamentary process. In fact, it still has three current references which were given to it in 1988. But I am sure that it will expedite consideration of this matter with the haste that it deserves. Of course, putting that in context, a four-year term of parliament was set up for the ACT. It is, therefore, unlikely that there will be another election for a number of years. So there is some time to address quietly and sensibly the result, the practices and the processes of this election and, as I have set out in this motion, to look at ways of improving the practices and processes for the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much of the debate has addressed the unique electoral system for the ACT that this Parliament settled upon late last year-the so-called modified d'Hondt system. For many of those who have been opposed to self-government, the modified d'Hondt system has been a handy vehicle to blame for the delays and complications that have occurred. We all have different views on whether that is a valid criticism. I do not wish to limit this Committee in any way from considering the application of this modified d'Hondt system in practice; I think it should do so. Therefore, I hope that Senator Jenkins did not get the impression last night that, in some way, we were trying to exclude that. This is the unique system that has been settled upon for the ACT; it exists nowhere else in the world. Its basic format is common within Europe but there are variations and, as far as the variations concern a greater capacity to express preference in the latter stages of the count, it is unique. The Committee should look clearly at the one practical application of that system that we have-that is, the immediate past election-to see whether it should be further modified or varied.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Australian Democrats would rather re-examine all other possible electoral system options which have been available since the ACT self-government debate started. Certainly that would be possible, but one wonders what it would achieve. It really amounts to a political debate which has been gone over many times over a number of years. I note that in the motion Senator Jenkins has on the Notice Paper she again wants consideration given to the possibility of implementing a Senate-type proportional representation system for the ACT. Consideration can be given to that, as it has been given over a number of years, but I fear that the same political obstacles will be encountered that have been encountered in the past. No doubt the Government would like to look again at the possibility of single member electorates because it is fair to say that, at the moment, there is some considerable political advantage in that system operating in the ACT.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that various calculations have been made since the election but my information is that, on that system, the Australian Labor Party would have won every seat in the ACT. Surely that would not have been a fair reflection of the vote which was cast at the last election? Apart from the fact that it would not reflect the vote of the Opposition parties here, it would in no way reflect the very significant vote that was given to the Residents Rally and other community groups within the ACT. That is the reason why we have objected to the suitability of a single member electorate system for the Australian Capital Territory. It simply does not seem to fit the unique city-state environment for which we have had to form an electoral system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the Senate system is possible but I fear that the result would be even less stability than we are finding at present, in that the chances are that a greater number of individuals or small parties would have been elected. We have accepted all along that, in some ways, the system for the ACT is a compromise between democracy and stability. I think we have the democracy and a system designed to provide greater stability than the Senate proportional representation system. So far we do not have stability for the ACT and it will be a challenge to those who have been recently elected to offer that stability in difficult circumstances. I assure those elected that there will be nothing worse for the Australian Capital Territory at the moment than to force upon it another election in the current environment. I hope that they will be big enough to provide that stability and the good government that the Australian Capital Territory needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those reasons I doubt the value in again going back and analysing the various alternatives of single member electorates or a Senate-type proportional representation. The same political hurdles will be met that were met before, which have to be answered in the only way possible and that is by political compromise. Political compromise resulted in the system that we have today. Nobody says that it is perfect and I am sure that it can be improved. I hope that when the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matter looks at the application of the system it will make recommendations for improvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to speak at length, but there is one other interesting facet that I wish to mention. I found it fascinating that the d'Hondt system was blamed for the fact that it took six weeks to count the first votes and check their validity. It seems to me that that exact process would have had to take place if there were a Senate-type proportional representation system and that not one hour would have been saved. In no way can I see how that time can be blamed on the d'Hondt system. It may be blamed on the physical difficulty of dealing with massive ballot papers, or I suspect that the process could have been helped by a little more planning in the Electoral Office. However, I await the parliamentary Committee's view on that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not interested in apportioning blame. I am interested in improvements within the system to expedite the count in future and to improve the voting process at the next election. In other words, I am not so interested in looking to the past but rather to the future. Therefore, I have expressed the Opposition's motion in broad terms. I have moved that the Committee should review the electoral system and the electoral process, with a view to recommending changes which might improve the process and expedite the count.
       </para>
       <para>
        I specifically mention two questions-not in an attempt to limit that consideration, but rather because I think they are specific matters that should be addressed. The first is the level of deposit that is imposed on prospective candidates. The deposit level is designed, in part at least, to dissuade mischievous candidates from standing and unnecessarily complicating the procedure. I would hate to see a deposit level dissuading a genuine candidate from standing because that would conflict with the democratic objective that I would seek. Nevertheless, it is designed with the purpose of ensuring that candidates are at least serious in the process. Democracy is a serious concept and in some ways a fragile one, as we see throughout the world, and should be respected. I have asked that the Committee look to see whether the deposit level should be varied for future elections. I think at present it is only $100 for the ACT which in terms of the damage that can be done to the process by candidates who are not genuine is very low.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second question that I ask in the motion that the Committee specifically consider is the cut-off level in the d'Hondt system under which candidates cannot be successful but as to which their next preference can be distributed. That figure was determined more by a convenient formula rather than by anything else. It varies throughout Europe. In some places it is a stated percentage figure rather than a formula. There has been some criticism in the ACT that perhaps it was set too high. I think that an objective, bipartisan parliamentary committee should examine specifically that question and advise the Parliament whether it believes the formula that has been adopted sets the percentage at the most appropriate level.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to Senator Jenkins's motion, I have no concerns with the parliamentary Committee looking at the previous advice given by the Australian Electoral Commission to the Government on the d'Hondt system and the difficulties that it saw in the system. I regret that that advice was not before the Parliament at the time we debated the Bills, though I wonder whether it would have changed much. What was finally decided was a political compromise and in many ways what seemed to be the only political compromise open. Nevertheless, all information is useful in debate. It would have been useful to pursue the Electoral Commission on its assertions to see whether in the opinion of the Parliament they were well founded. Therefore, I am happy for the Committee to examine those matters and I do not think that our motion restricts the Committee from so doing.

        In the application of the existing system the Committee will have to look in some detail at the modified d'Hondt system. If it does so now with the hindsight of experience and forms the view that it is unworkable, as some have asserted, no doubt it will say so. If it comes back with a report of that nature to the Parliament, the Parliament will have to address it. I shall be surprised if it does so because, apart from one small variation which it seems will take only a few days in the count, it is a well-tried system within Europe, although it is somewhat new to Australia.

        Some day, when I have nothing better to do, I would like to go out into the community and ask all those who say that they do not understand how the d'Hondt system works to explain to me how the Senate proportional representation system works. I shall be surprised if I get more than 5 per cent of the community who can explain that to me. That emphasises in my mind that it is the d'Hondt system that has attracted the blame, but I think that the problems may lie elsewhere. However that is for the Committee to find. I move this motion in a constructive way and in the hope that in due course it will provide for the Parliament recommendations that will improve the electoral system and process in the Australian Capital Territory, which can only benefit the total Australian Capital Territory community.

        I shall not go through the sorry litany of events that have surrounded self-government and the different electoral systems which have been considered for the ACT other than to say that the choice of the d'Hondt system and then a modified d'Hondt system was the fourth preferred choice of this Government. Quite clearly, we preferred 17 single member electorates, or as a second choice nine single member electorates and eight elected by proportional representation a la the Senate system. Our third choice was a pure d'Hondt system, and finally our fourth choice forced upon us was a modified d'Hondt system.

        I do not agree with the criticism of the Australian Electoral Commission as to the time it has taken to do this count. It takes eight weeks to do a New South Wales Senate count with 45 candidates. Here we had 117 candidates, with as many below the line votes as one has in a New South Wales Senate election. It takes one or two weeks to strike a quota. There is no point in putting inexperienced staff on these matters or in having existing staff working weekends and over Easter. In that process they will simply make mistakes and one will have to start all over again. The Electoral Commission has tried as hard as it can, within resources but also within the possibilities of doing this count, to have it completed.

         —I do not know what definition Senator Archer is using when he quotes foreign debt, but a very common and misleading way of presenting foreign debt is to quote only the gross debt. The net foreign debt in Australia is of the order of $95 billion and as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is somewhat lower than it was 12 months or so back. I have made it very clear publicly on many occasions over the last few years that I see that as a real problem, but measures are being taken to address it. They have been taken over a number of years. For a start, we are now in our third successive year of declining real government outlays and the fourth year of declining real government outlays is approaching. That has never happened before in Australia. We brought in a significant Budget surplus last year, there will be a Budget surplus this year approaching 2 per cent of gross domestic product, and there will be a Budget surplus of similar size next year. No previous Australian government produced a Budget surplus at all. I suspect that Senator Stone, in his many years in the Treasury, would never have even contemplated the prospect of any government producing a Budget surplus. So at Federal Government level a great deal has been done about those matters which are directly under the control of the Federal Government.

        I wish briefly to make two other comments. The first is that the current level of the current account deficit is contributed to very significantly by the investment boom, again the largest level of investment as a proportion of GDP that has ever been recorded. In the short term that has aggravated the current account problem. The final point is that there is one way of overcoming the current account problem-the New Zealand way. The New Zealand current account is expected to move into surplus in the first quarter of 1989. That is being done, however, by pushing up unemployment a full six percentage points and not counting the extra per cent or so that New Zealand exports to Australia annually. That is one way of overcoming it. It is not the preferred way of this Government and, indeed, it should not be the preferred option for any government.

         —The Australian Government very much welcomes the new atmosphere of cooperation and reconciliation which has become evident in recent weeks among the major players in the Central American conflict, with one area of exception only, which I will come to in a moment. At their summit on 13 and 14 February, the Presidents of the five Central American countries-that is, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala-agreed on a comprehensive program for peace in the region. On 24 March the Bush Administration undertook to work with the democratically elected Central American leaders and expressed support for a non-military solution to the crisis in Central America. On 5 April in a speech to the Cuban National Assembly, we had Mr Gorbachev calling for an end to foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign states.

       <para>
        Certainly, the Australian Government welcomes those expressions of political goodwill by the five Central American Presidents and by the Unites States of America and the Soviet Union to support a negotiated non-military settlement of the conflict in the region. We consider that only a genuine commitment to reform in the political, social and economic instabilities of this troubled region will resolve the continuing tension and conflict which exists there.
       </para>
       <para>
        We call, as we have in the past, on all governments who share the objective of peace, stability and democracy in Central America to demonstrate their support for the peace process. It is in this context and against that background of some very positive developments that we view with concern the increase in violence in El Salvador following the elections on 20 March, which violence has included, among other things, the assassination of that country's Attorney-General. It, in turn, resulted in raids on church and human rights groups in San Salvador on 19 April in which a British citizen resident in Australia, Ms Eve Scarfe, was arrested and detained overnight by El Salvadoran authorities. Ms Scarfe was released unharmed on 20 April and is now understood to be in Costa Rica. The Australian Embassy in Mexico City has been asked to investigate the circumstances of these arrests, particularly the case of Ms Scarfe, and to make appropriate representations to the El Salvadoran authorities.

       <para>
        We note President-elect Cristiani's stated intention to honour the peace accords of the five Central American Presidents to open the political process to all parties and to pursue negotiations with the FMLN. We believe that a process of negotiation with respect to human rights of all Salvadorans is a necessary first step towards national reconciliation. We have made a number of representations on human rights cases to the El Salvadoran authorities and will certainly continue to raise our concerns about issues as that is appropriate.

In answer to the question about what the Government's program is, I advise the Senate that last Thursday week I took part in a national television hook-up with all the State Ministers for agriculture to launch the national soil conservation program. That is a program which will enable the Commonwealth, in consort with the States, to put in $45m over the next three years to conduct a national strategy to preserve Australia's land, water and soils. The national conservation strategy is aimed at meeting four particular needs: supporting community land care support groups; helping public awareness, education and training; assisting research into the area; and supporting major programs which are demonstration programs to show that success can be achieved if we work cooperatively in this field.

        I might say that the article that has been referred to by Senator Beahan is a very useful one. It is one of a number of articles which have begun to appear in Australian newspapers and periodicals over recent months. Just last weekend the Weekend Australian had a feature piece in its insert magazine. The West Australian some six weeks ago had a major feature piece on land degradation in Western Australia and the rising problem of salinity in that State. The Sydney Morning Herald, over several days, had a series of articles on land degradation. Peter Fray, along with the other journalists who have been associated with giving long, detailed and thoughtful consideration to this problem, are to be commended because they are doing Australia a service. This is not just something for country Australians. This is something for urban Australians to understand so that they may support the efforts that are being made by the joint governments of this country to resolve the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have talked in this chamber-I do not propose to go over it again-about the dimensions of this problem. It is a serious problem for Australia. It is fundamentally our most important environmental issue. The prime focus of the campaign we launched last Thursday week is to encourage land-holders to modify or change their attitudes about the management of the land in their care so that it is farmed within its capability and so that the husbandry and farming practices engaged in are ones which enable the land to be passed on to successive generations of Australians as land able to sustain our agricultural output while preserving its en- vironmental position as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude my answer by saying that I believe we now have the strategy in place. We now have the key part of the funding in place. We now have the focus on changing attitudes among those who care for the land operating reasonably effectively. As we proceed down that track, much more will be achieved in real outcomes so that we can expect that the problem of land degradation, which is the most serious problem, will come under control.

        As we all know, a primary objective of the EEP was to enable the US to win back market share from subsidised agricultural exporters. While this has happened in some markets at the expense of the European Community (EC), overall the cost has fallen on unsubsidised exporters such as Australia and other members of the Cairns Group. The statistics bear repeating: Australia's share of the world wheat and flour market has declined from 19 1/2 per cent in 1985-86 to an estimated 11.3 per cent in the current financial year. Meanwhile the US share of the market has increased from 28.7 per cent in 1985-86 to an estimated 42.9 per cent in 1988-89 while at the same time the European Community, against which the EEP has allegedly been targeted, will have increased its share from 17.4 per cent to an estimated 20 per cent or very near to it.

        Further damage has occurred through the price depressing effect of the EEP on world markets, which has in turn further reduced grower returns. We are monitoring the Budget debate in the US on the future of the EEP. We certainly welcome ongoing US Department of Agriculture and General Accounting Office (GAO) reviews of the program's operation. We are making an input into the GAO review process through a quite substantial document which is presently in process of preparation, spelling out with as much precision as we possibly can the way in which the EEP has operated to Australia's disadvantage and without advancing, we would argue, the cause that it was originally put in place for.

        A number of further representations will be made at different levels within the US Administration on this subject in the period ahead and particularly in the context of the renewal of the farm legislation which is proposed over the next year or so. It may well be that another delegation by an all-party parliamentary committee of the kind that Senator Macklin, I know, has been previously involved in would be a useful contribution to that process, particularly in sensitising a number of senators and congressmen who tend, as do many people in the United States, not to look beyond the boundaries of that country, or in their cases their own constituencies, in determining the economic impact of measures of this kind. It may be that an effectively led, managed and briefed delegation of this kind could make some impact again in sensitising the US Congress and Administration to our concerns. I will certainly pass on that proposal to the Prime Minister. We will discuss it, no doubt, in the period ahead as one of a number of statagems that we need to put in place to advance the cause.

Is the Minister aware that, in response to a question from me during the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, a senior officer of the Civil Aviation Authority advised the Committee that he believed that if no action had been taken the aircraft would have missed each other by 25 miles, but as a result of the actions of Sydney air traffic control, they in fact finished 10 miles apart?

         —I am advised that the Civil Aviation Authority has investigated claims that an air safety incident was alleged to have occurred over south-western New South Wales shortly before 5 a.m. on Saturday, 29 April, involving an Air New Zealand B767 en route from Perth to Auckland and a Qantas 747 en route from Singapore to Melbourne. The aircraft were cruising at the same altitude of 37,000 feet and their projected flight paths crossed approximately 30 nautical miles north of Wagga. As the Air New Zealand aircraft was not in normal communication with Sydney air traffic control, the Qantas aircraft was radar vectored by Sydney air traffic control away from the flight path of the Air New Zealand aircraft. There was no breakdown in separation and no threat to the safety of the aircraft, as the altitude data displayed on the radar screen alerted the controller to the potential conflict. The occurrence is subject to scrutiny by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and a report can be expected within the next couple of weeks. That might give us an opportunity to explore further the latter parts of the honourable senator's question.

I refer, in particular, to the shortage of skilled maintenance staff which, over a period of 18 months, has required Qantas to cut some flights and place contracts for servicing 747 and 767 aircraft with six overseas airlines. First, can the Minister advise the Senate whether the standards of those overseas airlines embody the same stringent maintenance criteria as do those of Qantas? I note that one of those airlines has experienced both loss of life and other flight mishaps in recent times. Secondly, are inadequate and uncompetitive salary levels in Qantas a major cause of the falling number of maintenance staff? Finally, to ensure that safety is maintained, has the Government taken, or will it take, steps to financially assist Qantas to attract additional engineers or to provide training that will produce qualified engineers?

         —Qantas is acutely conscious of its fine safety record and reputation. I am sure that there is no question of its entering into overseas maintenance contracts in circumstances other than those that would continue to absolutely guarantee that reputation. When things happen, as they sometimes do, Qantas's reaction, unlike that of some other airlines, is not to sack its public relations staff but to go to the root cause of the problem and resolve it. The fleet that is being maintained by Qantas is one of the most modern of any airline in the world and its reputation, as we know from recent academy award winning movies, among other things, is second to none in the world. I will see whether Qantas or the Department wants to answer that part of the question about the overseas maintenance arrangements in any more detail, but I am totally confident in Qantas's capacity to get that right.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As to the underlying problem which has produced the situation to which Senator Panizza refers, the Government recognises, as it has to, that the aviation industry is currently experiencing shortages of skilled labour in the maintenance and engineering sectors. In consultation with other parties, we are progressing award restructuring packages, training and skill enhancement strategies and overseas recruitment. Further overseas recruitment will take place this year which will assist in relieving the immediate shortage. I know that is taking place with the very active cooperation of Senator Robert Ray and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs so far as all levels of that recruitment are concerned. In addition, Qantas is expanding its maintenance facilities and increasing its intake of apprentices. Again, I think it is doing everything conceivably possible to relieve that shortage. Qantas is still expanding its services, but at a reduced rate. This is a temporary measure during the off-peak period which will relieve the pressure on maintenance staff and maintain Qantas's high standards. The introduction of the 747-400s, which is presently under way, will also relieve the situation by providing greater capacity and flexibility.

The first is the one of simple ignorance, that is, failure by a lot of people to understand what is going on and what the proposed changes are. The second is vested interest. We have an example right now of both of those problems with the Government's legislation to deregulate wheat marketing. There is a great deal of ignorance. There is misunderstanding about the effects that the Government's proposals would have and there is a lot of vested interest, principally by the National Party of Australia. But one of the superficially encouraging things about Australian politics is that both the major parties-I use that term deliberately-have become more receptive to micro-economic reform in recent years than either of them was before. However, a third party has a vested interest in perpetuating the status quo and, indeed, in perpetuating ignorance. Recently, we saw the Leader of the Opposition, for reasons of cosmetic unity, having his wishes on the Victorian Senate ticket accepted by the National Party. However, there are disturbing indications that there was a secret trade-off in that-that is, the Opposition's ostensible commitment to micro-economic reform in respect of wheat marketing will be emasculated by a string of amendments that the National Party will move in the Senate.

        In particular, it has been reported in the press-I do not know whether it is accurate-that the National Party will move an amendment to remove from the Government's legislation the overriding of State government marketing regulations. If that is correct, the Opposition's amendment will emasculate the deregulatory aspects of the Bill. The Opposition has neither confirmed nor denied that. Perhaps its members do not know yet. Perhaps the National Party has not quite succeeded in mugging John Howard properly. This particular example is a very good demonstration of the difficulties in having micro-economic reform accepted.

I would not have thought that there would be any real question as to procedure. I think what the senator is questioning, then, is the result of the procedure. It would seem to me that, if the Government agrees that an independent assessor ought to be appointed to perform a task such as the one that Mr Yeomans performed on Christmas Island, it is the responsibility of the Government to get out of the way and allow the assessor to get on with his or her job. In the case of Christmas Island, I am confident that Mr Yeomans performed his task competently, and the Government has seen no reason to regret his recommendation or its acceptance of it.

         —There have been two recent landings on the north-west coast of Western Australia. A group of 14 landed on 1 September 1988 and a second group of 11 arrived on 25 April 1989. The first group consisted of Bangladeshis and Indians, and a Lebanese. Several of them had previously applied unsuccessfully to migrate to Australia. They were carrying documents indicating the contact point for legal aid officers in Australia. All but one of the first group were found to be ineligible to migrate to Australia under the refugee or special humanitarian program and were deported from Australia on 7 February. The cost to the taxpayer for detention, processing and deportation of these 14 individuals was in excess of $200,000.
        </para>

       <para>
        The second group, consisting of 11 Bangladeshis, included two of the original 14 previously deported. The second group is being detained and questioned in the Broome prison, and deportation is anticipated as soon as travel documents are issued by the Bangladeshi authorities. There are many similarities between the two groups, including the point of embarkation being the Indonesian island of Kupang. My Department is of the view that these arrivals are part of an organised scam to bring illegal migrants to Australia. Australia has been fortunate in many ways not to have experienced the same level of illegal immigration as countries such as Canada and West Germany. Unfortunately, a variety of vested interests in the legal fraternity do seek, under the existing Commonwealth Migration Act, to find loopholes so that such people can stay. I am always a little surprised when I receive letters from them asking me to show my compassion in certain cases. I believe, and the Government believes, that that sort of compassion should be reserved for those who apply legally to come to this country, wait for months and months in a queue and, sometimes disappointingly, have to be refused because they do not qualify. That is where my compassion lies and I am sure that is where the compassion of all honourable senators lies; it is not for the queue jumpers.

         —Senator Bjelke-Petersen raises an issue which is very much in the forefront of Government consideration. As she would know, the Government is in the process of preparing its policy on retirement incomes. As a precursor to that policy document, the whole issue of retirement incomes has been discussed and assessed by the Social Security Review, and an issues paper from that review was released on 24 October 1988. In its major conclusions, the review has suggested to the Government a number of issues that should be the cornerstone of any long-term retirement incomes policy. Equity and adequacy are two of those major cornerstone policies. A third one, of course, is certainty. The review has suggested that, in developing a policy, the Government needs to make major changes gradually in view of the long-term expectations, plans and commitments of older people. The Government has also been advised that further improvements in its retirement income arrangements will need to occur within the present dual system of age pension and occupational superannuation. Incentives to work, especially among the aged, and to save, must be maintained and improved. One of the other major conclusions of the review is that arrangements should be as simple as possible, consistent with the need for both equity and effectiveness.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The review suggested a number of major options in respect of direct payments. Amongst them was a suggestion that, in the longer term, a guaranteed minimum retirement income of 30 per cent of average weekly earnings from a combination of the age pension, occupation superannuation and investment income should be a target, and that an income tested retirement income supplement, restricted to pensioners with very little other income, should also be a target. Rent assistance was also discussed as well as living alone allowances, pensioner bonuses for the older aged, and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The issues that that review raised quite constructively are very much part of the consideration of the Government and will be at the forefront of its consideration when it develops its retirement incomes policy, which the Australian people will receive quite soon.

         —That is the same question which the honourable senator asked yesterday. Senator Chaney made a speech in this chamber which I saw on television. I thought he looked good. It was only when I listened to him that I realised how awful the speech was. He asked this rhetorical question, `One might ask what is happening to production under the politics of this Government.' I can tell the honourable senator that the answer to his question is this: Total manufacturing production in real terms has risen by an average of 3.6 per cent a year under this Government, to the highest level in recorded statistics. That is for the December quarter last year. Senator Chaney asked that question which sounds terrific, `What is happening to manufacturing production under this Government?'. That is a beautiful rhetorical question which is left floating around in the air with no answer. He came in here to get the answer.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        By contrast, in the last year of Senator Chaney's coalition Government production fell by 14 per cent after a sluggish performance throughout the 1970s. It is the same old story. We saw it yesterday with Senator Puplick introducing the 1960s show again about science and technology in Australia. Senator Chaney, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, is now doing it because he is not prepared to face up to that comparison. He has asked rhetorical questions and I give him the answer now.
       </para>
       <para>
        When alluding to these issues yesterday Senator Chaney should have taken a slightly closer look at the data and production statistics for March. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show a trend in decline in production for 13 items out of 27 surveyed in March compared with February. If the honourable senator had looked at the figures available for the last few years he would have seen that those fluctuations are there month to month all the time. This was the decline referred to by the honourable senator and the massacre referred to in some sections of the media, which I do not want to name. I would regard it as derogatory to name them in this context.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a pity that Senator Chaney, in his press release-trumped up with a full moon in Western Australia presumably-did not refer to the numerous caveats and qualifications made by the Statistician. What are they? The items surveyed in the figures Senator Chaney referred to cover 14 per cent of total manufacturing output in Australia. Senator Chaney draws enormous conclusions, and poses long rhetorical questions, from statistics relating to 14 per cent of manufacturing output in Australia. As the shadow Minister for industry for a long time now, Senator Chaney should know that these figures are highly volatile, the data is preliminary, the items are unweighted, the seasonal adjustment process has been distorted by the presence of Easter in March and, in yearly terms, the picture is reversed.

That is an unkind interjection to say that I mispronounced a word. Senator Teague, in seeking to make a point, said that I did not acknowledge that there was a drought in 1982. That was precisely the point. That was what afflicted this country in 1982 and the 29 years beforehand-intellectual drought in the government of the day; a total drought. That is why we have this problem today. There is nothing in these statistics which Senator Chaney has tried to make so much of to suggest that productivity or competitiveness has slumped in the month of March. There are production item figures which move around as demand fluctuates and firms change their production lines to match these fluctuations. These are not output figures for industry sectors but represent a very small sector of industry.

Certainly, the suggestion about going to non-bleached paper wherever possible has some merit. Economies of scale have to be established, and probably only governments initially can establish those. However, the suggestion has some appeal. I will pass the question and the editorial to Minister West, and hope that we will get a response within a reasonable time.

         —Since we came into government in March 1983 a top, if not the top, priority of this Government has been the stimulation of employment, high employment growth. We have succeeded spectacularly in that objective. The number of people in employment has grown by more than 1.3 million in a six-year period or, in percentage terms, by a massive 21 per cent. The most recent figures-those for the period March 1988 to March 1989-show that that growth rate is being maintained. In that 12-month period, employment increased by 237,000, or around 3.2 per cent. Across the mainland States, employment growth generally in that 12-month period has been high, ranging from 0.5 per cent to above 6.5 per cent. Once one moves away from the mainland, of course, there is an exception. In the 12-month period Tasmania actually incurred an absolute fall in employment of almost 4 per cent. Of course, Tasmania has performed poorly in the whole six-year period relative to the mainland States. Aggregate employment growth in Tasmania has been just over 11 per cent-not much more than half the national average-over that period. That does not sit at all comfortably with the 1982 policy speech by the present Premier of Tasmania, when he said:

        He certainly has not delivered on that promise. Tasmanians are being asked to vote again, but many of them have already voted with their feet. In the 12 months to May 1987-the period for which the most recent figures are available-there was a net migration out of Tasmania of 1,400 young people in the 20- to 24-year age group. Whereas Tasmania was once noted for exporting apples, it seems that, under the Gray Government, it is noted for exporting its future.

At a recent conference, the engineers were told that Australia would have to spend large amounts of money-between $370m and $500m by 1995-overseas on space-related activities to maintain our communications satellite systems.

        In 1986 the Government announced a response to the report commissioned from the Academy of Technological Sciences, which became known as the Madigan report, relating to the possibilities for development of a space industry in Australia. Since then, we have had a small space program, intended to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the Madigan report proposals. In the second half of 1988 I asked the Australian Space Office to make a detailed study of the opportunities for an Australian space industry. Working under guidance from the Australian Space Board, and in consultation with industry and the research community, the Space Office is formulating a strategy for the development of Australian space industry activities. I hope to bring recommendations on this issue to the Government shortly.

        The estimates of expenditure to which Senator Foreman referred, and on which I cannot comment in detail, are contained in the report entitled The Space Policy for Australia. That report was prepared at the request of the Minister for Science in 1985 or 1986. The more general claims made in the article quoted by Senator Foreman derive from a paper prepared by the national committee on space engineering of the Institution of Engineers. I am not privy to the contents of that paper, but I have seen press reports about it. As far as the Government is concerned, expenditure under the national space program totals $5.4m in 1988-89, with similar levels currently committed for future years, and, of course, some resources devoted to space-related research in other organisations.

Given that there has been a change of leadership in the Division, I expressed my confidence in Mr Moncur and stated that when that position comes up for appointment it will require somebody very good to beat him. If someone is to defeat Mr Moncur for that position, he will have to be very good indeed. I gave him a vote of confidence, though I did not announce his appointment. Certainly, he has not yet been appointed.

         —Senator Chaney asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Reynolds, to verify changes in outstanding public rental housing applications. I am sorry that I do not have the exact date of the question. The figures cited by Senator Chaney on 9 March are correct. Levels of outstanding rental applications have increased in most States. This includes Queensland, where rental applications increased by a massive 48 per cent to 13,665 in the 18 months to 31 December. Some of this increase was a response to private rental market pressures arising in Brisbane from World Expo 88.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Movements in waiting list levels over time reflect a number of factors, including general economic conditions, house prices, interest rates and, as exemplified in Queensland recently, private rents. However, the point to highlight is that public housing waiting list data need to be interpreted with great care, particularly when comparing figures between States. It is also important to remember that different eligibility criteria apply to public housing in each State-for example, in Queensland where young single people do not have access.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, State practices differ with regard to other forms of housing assistance such as home purchase assistance and also the availability and standards of public housing stock. A better indicator of State public housing effort is to compare the levels of public rental stock on a population basis. As at 30 June 1987, stock per thousand head of the population ranged from 55.5 in the Northern Territory to 11.1 in Queensland, the lowest in Australia. In Australia the average stock per thousand head of the population is 19.

       </para>
       <para>
        This answer was sought following an answer given by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Reynolds, who unfortunately, because of her back injury, is not here to provide the answer herself. I have moved to take note of the answer because I believe that we should come back to the debate when Senator Reynolds is available. The answer which the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) has given, which no doubt was provided for him, is full of holes and does not contain the apology that we were promised by Senator Reynolds if her original statement in this place was wrong, which clearly it has been shown to be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators should remember that Senator Reynolds said in this place that if there was an increase in housing waiting lists around Australia we should be examining the respective records of the States and their ideological commitment to housing and that that would throw up a very interesting pattern. It does. The figures that have just been confirmed as correct show that in those States which have non-Labor governments, the housing lists have either reduced or have grown by a much smaller proportion than the housing lists in those States which are governed by Labor.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is no answer for the Minister to try to confuse the issue. I do not blame Senator Reynolds directly because I assume that she may have been out of action because of her back. But the answer which has been delivered on her behalf by the Leader of the Government is deceptive and warrants further debate and analysis. If a State is successful in encouraging private home ownership, then having a lower public housing stock is to be expected. If a State, for example, has a large resource industry which provides a great deal of rental housing which might in another State be provided by a State housing authority, again that would affect the ratio of public housing to population.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important point is that a Minister of the Crown with responsibilities in this area made the direct political point that the nature of a State government, whether Labor, Liberal or National, would have a direct relationship to public housing lists. The figures show that in those States which do not have a Labor government there has been either a reduction in the waiting lists or a much smaller increase than in the Labor States. I await the apology that was promised by Senator Reynolds. She said that she would examine the figures and come into this place and apologise. I trust that before we resume debate on this motion she will deliver the apology she promised. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       Mr President, you would be well aware of concerns that we have expressed over and over again about the slowness of response by the Department of Defence to many questions asked in the Senate and at Senate Estimates committee hearings. But this matter was of particular concern to the defence forces because it goes to the heart of the morale of the forces. Honourable senators would be well aware that the morale of the Australian Defence Force is at an all time low and the losses are at an all time high.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question that I asked related to the opportunity which Australia had had to appoint a senior Army officer as commander of the multinational force in the Sinai. I asked whether approval had been given for this appointment when the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, stepped in and vetoed the appointment. I also asked whether the appointment had now gone to Lieutenant-General McIver of the New Zealand Defence Force and, if so, whether the Minister could advise whether the Prime Minister had denied an Australian the chance of such valuable experience when it was at no expense to the Australian taxpayer. I further asked whether considerations of Defence Force morale and Australia's international role as a promoter of peace were ignored. There is the nub of the matter. This was not something that would have cost Australia money and it went very much to the morale of the Defence Force. Although those were straightforward and factual questions requiring straightforward and factual answers, it has taken two months to today to get even a basic response from the Minister that a reply is on the way. The Senate does not find that good enough.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst I appreciate that the Minister, Senator Richardson, is merely representing the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), I hope that he will take back to the Minister the Senate's concerns about the constant slow response to questions of all kinds asked of the Department for Defence and the Minister for Defence. However, this is of great symbolic importance to the Defence Force. It is not just a question of whether senators' questions are treated expeditiously by this Department and this Minister. Certainly honourable senators on my side of the chamber are concerned about this. We find quite unacceptable, firstly, the treatment which the Senate has had in relation to the slowness of answers but, more importantly, the effect which the matters enclosed in my question have on the morale of the Australian Defence Force. I expect and hope that the Minister will obtain such an answer before the end of this week in light of the slowness of the response to date.

          —As I indicated a few minutes ago, the Opposition had intended to bring this matter on for debate by way of a matter of public importance. We have made some small procedural adjustment which I hope will effectively permit a slightly larger number of people to participate in the debate. But the Opposition is anxious to have at least some preliminary debate on the interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities on Rothwells Ltd, not least because the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) acknowledged in Question Time today that he has no detailed knowledge of the matters which are contained in it. I think it is important that Ministers in this Government should have some understanding of the scandalous state of affairs in Western Australia which is disclosed by this report which is not a matter which has been hidden away completely in the past because there has been a great deal of newspaper publicity about it. But at least we have a non-political exposition of the facts which have surrounded the Rothwells Ltd debacle. I trust that that will draw it to the attention of the Government in a way which will lead it to understand just what a shameful government we have in Western Australia.

        <para>
         The report is a sorry tale of dereliction of duty on the part of that Government and its Ministers. I think the report shows clear evidence of the theft of taxpayers' money. I say that because it is quite clear that taxpayers' funds have been misapplied by the Western Australian Government and have been used for purposes which I do not think can be properly described as public purposes. There could be no clearer case of a breach of the duty which a government owes to its taxpayers and its citizens than the events which surround the Rothwells debacle. I believe it is important that in this Senate we draw the attention of the Government, and not least the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) who is at the table, to the facts which are disclosed.
        </para>
        <para>
         In a debate in which my speaking time is limited to a quarter of an hour I cannot cover a great deal of this voluminous report but I wish to deal with the report enough to demonstrate that there has been a clear breach of the duties of the Government of a kind which no reform of the company law could fix, or remedy, or prevent occurring in the future. This is not a case of the law being inadequate; this is a case where Government Ministers have totally ignored their clear public duty and, in the case of one Minister-Minister Grill-he used his ministerial authority to override the objections of the Western Australian State Electricity Commission to deliver a cheque for $15m which was to be misapplied-that is, not used for the purpose for which it was delivered. A clear, open public scandal is evidenced in these documents and that should be understood at the Federal level. It is important that that should be understood at the Federal level for the reasons that are set out in Senator Tony Messner's notice of motion given just a moment ago.

         In the last week we have seen the nonsense of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) saying to the Government of New South Wales that the raising of taxes to meet the essential needs of that State and, in particular, to tackle the serious environmental pollution caused by years of government neglect, for a legitimate and, some would say, essential public purpose, should be the subject of financial penalty at the hands of the Commonwealth. It reflects the views expressed in this place that Queensland should be subject to financial penalty because of what the Government has seen as the misapplication of funds. But in the case of New South Wales the argument is that the proper raising of taxes and expenditure of money on public works should give rise to a reduction in Commonwealth funding. This report shows the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of public money for private purposes. It is a question that has to be addressed by this Government. If it is to attack State governments which legitimately expend money on public purposes, what does this Government intend to do about a State Government which makes clearly illegitimate expenditure?
        </para>
        <para>
         How does one encapsulate what is contained in this report? The simple facts are set out and I wish to refer in particular to part 8 of the report, on page 42, headed `the PICL Transaction', the petrochemical plant debacle. This was a proposals which was owned by two people, Mr Connell and Mr Dempster. The report tells us that in 1986 Mr Connell bought his half share of the project for $400,000 from Mr Dempster and they became equal shareholders. It was a proposition to build a petrochemical plant in Kwinana. They obtained a mandate from the Government saying that they could build a plant, they got certain letters of intent and put a deposit on a block of land. In the ensuing time, in all the shifting of funds that went on in Western Australia, this project changed hands several times. We find it set out in the report that it changed hands for $30m plus and that a value of $28.5m was put upon it. There are various references to its being shifted about. By 31 January 1988 we find in a statement of assets and liabilities for L. R. Connell and Partners that it was valued at $150m. It just sort of grew up.
        </para>
        <para>
         Then in the debacle that followed the bail-out of Rothwells by the State Government and the commitment of a guarantee of $150m worth of taxpayers' funds, suddenly Petro-chemical Industries Co. Ltd (PICL) acquired a value in the eyes of the Western Australian Government which led it to purchase about 43 per cent of the project for $175m. What was paid was a total of $400m, of which the Bond interests fronted up with $225m. This involved the Dowding Government, not the discredited Burke Government, and we have heard what Senator Walsh and Mr Dawkins think of Mr Burke, and I join them in their opinion-he is unfit to take part in the political life of this country. But it is not Burke we are talking about. It is Premier Dowding, who handed over $175m worth of Western Australian public funds for an asset which had no value to the State Government because that Government had the capacity, if it wished to have a petrochemical plant of its own, to give itself a mandate to have such a plant. All it was dealing with was a $100,000 deposit on a block of land, some statements of intent entered into, a mandate obtained from the Government and suddenly that was worth $400m. This report says:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . the project was still in the planning stage.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a direct quote from the report of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). The following passage appears in the same paragraph, paragraph 8.15:
        </para>
        <para>
         The most valuable asset possessed by PICL was the government mandate . . . the arrangement between Connell and Dempster was extraordinary and the Commission finds it surprising that Dempster was prepared to accept one-seventh of the price paid to Connell.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is amazing, is it not? These were equal shareholders, one of whom walked away with $50m of the $400m and the other walked away with $350m. This same report sets out what happened to the $350m. It paid off the State Government's existing liabilities by discharging the National Australia Bank liability, and the rest of the money virtually went back to the Bond interests, which were owed the money by Rothwells. This is all set out in paragraph 8.22. It was a glorious round robin of cheques, with $175m worth of public funds involved-and now the saga continues with the Western Australian Government guaranteeing the development expenditure. It is now in for another $100m. It has loaded this project with this front end cost which will make it uneconomic in the future. It is a financial disgrace, it is theft, and the people of Western Australia are paying for it and will continue to pay.

         I turn to a later part of the report. We find in part 9 the disgraceful involvement of Minister Grill. Minister Grill is not some poor trade unionist who has found himself a Minister of the Crown with no educational background-not that there are many trade unionists like that these days as most of them are highly educated people. Grill is a lawyer who practised and who has a strong commercial background. He has been involved in commerce, in mining and in other commercial activities as well as in his law practice. I commend to the Leader of the Government in the Senate an examination of part 9 of this report, where we find that as part of solving yet another part of Rothwells' problem the State Electricity Commission of Western Australia was being asked to prepay Western Collieries for coal yet to be delivered a sum of $15m. Again, a public body was asked to hand over a cheque for $15m-not for a legitimate purpose, but as part of a scheme to divert that money to sustain Rothwells in its extremity. That is the disgraceful role of a Minister who is a qualified lawyer, a man with extensive commercial experience. I quote from paragraph 9.11:

          —I think Mr Heron was a public servant in the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The point of this debate is that this Government so readily turns a blind eye to chicanery on the part of people with whom it is in the closest political association. It appointed Premier Burke to be this country's representative in Ireland after he had committed $150m worth of taxpayers' funds to the Rothwells bail-out. I put this simple question: When Barry MacKinnon as Leader of the Opposition in that State was being pressed to support that, I said, `Barry, ask for Treasury advice on the subject'. That is the history of Labor in Western Australia-abuse of the trust that the Western Australian electorate put in it, and it is disgraceful.

         I say to the Government that in light of the clearest possible demonstration that taxpayers' money has been stolen by this Government, what is its response when it will threaten the Government of New South Wales with financial penalties for raising taxes for essential public works? What threat does this Government offer the Dowding-Grill, in my view, criminal combination, when it throws the money of the people of Western Australia down the drain, when that Government gives it to selected commercial enterprises which it seeks to rescue? This is a disgraceful saga.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let me briefly touch on one other matter. One of the unhappy things that happen when people steal as a servant is that the employers often let them off-they let them go away. I remember as a lawyer doing a case where a fellow took $250,000. Earlier he had been dismissed by a bank from which he had stolen a few thousand. The bank did not press charges. In this case the NCSC, in an attempt to avert financial panic, agreed to suspend its inquiries into Rothwells so that the ill-fated rescue promoted by Premier Burke would proceed. I think there is a lesson for those who are administering the company laws of this country that if they see a thief they should not stop investigating him; they should get into it and gaol him as soon as possible. I think that is the lesson to be drawn from what I am sure was the well-intentioned decision of the NCSC to suspend its investigation.
        </para>
        <para>
         I hope that there will be a later opportunity to debate this matter in greater detail. The sad fact is that the matter we are debating today is just one of a list of examples of where the Labor Party under both Premier Burke and Premier Dowding has paid out taxpayers' money to rescue the people with whom they were closely associated. I refer to the Teachers Credit Society, Rothwells, the Swan Building Society, losses with the Danbury Group, the repurchase of the Perth Technical College site, $30m invested in Spedley's, and so on-the Wild West. Those people in the Labor Party have made Western Australia a laughing stock and have impoverished the people of Western Australia on the way through.

          —I know that quite a number of people wish to speak on this matter and I will therefore try to be brief. A very large number of aspects come to light in the interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). It comes at a time when the Parliament has received a report from the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. Presumably in a week or two this chamber will again be debating that legislation.

         One issue which the Rothwells Ltd debacle clearly illustrates is the need for effective oversight of companies by regulatory authorities. One very important goal of a regulatory authority should be to maintain the confidence of investors in the securities market by ensuring adequate protection for investors from criminal elements or from other activities with the exception of those which are a purely commercial risk.
        </para>
        <para>
         One of the arguments that have been put about against the proposed new national scheme is the notion that a unified scheme would be more prone to tampering by politicians and that improper practices would be more likely to occur. Having read this report, one sees that there is absolutely nothing magic or automatic about a Federal-State system or a cooperative system providing a proper level of scrutiny of commercial activity. There was always resonating in the background of the recent Committee inquiry the matter of Rothwells, which certainly led me to propose, and the Committee to accept, the notion that we ought to have a standing parliamentary committee to oversee the operations and safeguard the independence and effectiveness of any new Australian security commission. It is an area which is vital to the economic health of the country and to encouraging more Australians to invest in Australian industry.
        </para>
        <para>
         Paragraph 1.04 of the report raises the use of the title `merchant bank'. I think the use of this title merits some consideration about what precisely is a bank within the Australian context. That is becoming a lot more difficult to determine. This could very well lead to many Australian citizens being dis- abused of their money by the operation of organisations with a variety of titles which seem to give them some support. For example, while our trading banks and savings banks are subject to quite rigid and strict Reserve Bank prudential controls, other organisations do not have that. The purpose of these rigid controls is, first, to ensure that none of our properly constituted banks experiences a liquidity crisis so that depositors are always able to withdraw their funds how and when they wish, and, secondly, to ensure that the banks do not become insolvent. Whether merchant banks using the title of `bank' ought to be subject to these types of controls is an interesting point. The interests of depositors investing with a merchant bank are not protected by the types of protections provided elsewhere for depositors with trading and savings banks. Nevertheless, the unsuspecting public could very well be led erroneously to believe that their investments are safe because they are under Reserve Bank supervision, when clearly they are not.
        </para>
        <para>
         It may very well be that the use of the title `bank' is misleading to the general public and that we ought either to restrict the use of the term or to force those banks which are not trading and savings banks to state clearly that they are not subject to the safety net of control by the Reserve Bank. I think either of those two methods would be an advance on the current context, which is very confusing to the ordinary Australian who may not be aware of the details of the matter.
        </para>
        <para>
         The second point I wish to make is about the lemming-like deregulatory thrust of the Hawke Government. Let us look at the items with which the NCSC is particularly concerned. They include the failure of the board of Rothwells to play any practical part in policy or other matters within the company or give any leadership or guidance; grossly inadequate financial control procedures; reckless lending policies; failure to obtain proper securities for loans; failure to enforce interest payments and monitor cash flows; excessive exposure to associated individuals and companies; and failure to institute and enforce proper audit procedures. A list such as that would surely be of benefit to anybody who was interested. The fact that this organisation has flourished for a long time and takes so many funds in makes us wonder whether or not our regulatory system is operating for the protection of the market or for the protection of those elements who wish merely to make profits for themselves at the expense of other Australians and contribute nothing to the general well-being of the community. However, I am not at all sure that when one opens the deregulatory door and lets in the pigs one can get too upset by the mess that they finally make.
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe that we ought to be looking at the methods and the avenues by which we have sought this deregulatory thrust and question whether or not other comparable economies that consider themselves to be free enterprise economies, ones that see themselves as open, have gone the way that we have. For example, we might be able to come up with an Australian version of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, thereby guaranteeing that the Australian counterparts of small depositors who lose out in situations such as this within the United States are protected within the Australian context.

It actually means that we can invest to insure those people who otherwise would lose their entire life savings. There are many such suggestions floating around at this point in time. I do not want to be tied to any particular one at this stage. We certainly need to be extremely careful, in the light of this report, about where we go with further deregulation. Our financial institutions, in particular, need a strong, vibrant and effective regulatory process. It is a welcome addition, not a burden, because it provides long term stability to our financial markets. It provides security for those people who wish to invest.

         Any other approach is likely in the long term to be damaging while it may in the short term appear to be successful. Damaging the confidence of our investors, as undoubtedly this instance has done, leads to overall damage to the market which most of us here would hope would be able to operate effectively and increase its usefulness to our economy. We are all mindful that the NCSC report is an interim one. The important thing is not the debate in this place or what we say, but rather the ongoing actions of the regulatory authorities in pursuing the points raised in this report so that, where criminal activities, no matter by whom or at what level, no matter whether they be in industry or in politics, that are uncovered are pursued in the proper course and the proper fashion.

         It is not for us here to stand as judge and jury; rather it is for us to lend our support to the process which has already commenced and to hope that the suspension of the inquiry will not be a prelude to its disappearing but rather will be a prelude to proper activity through the courts to find what type of relief, if any, might be available for those investors. But, equally importantly, the sign must be given to other people who wish to pursue these types of reckless exercises with other peoples' money that none of the people in the areas of authority intend to allow this to occur and that they will in fact use the law vigorously and to its utmost extent to pursue such people into the courts and obtain convictions of them, so that it serves as a warning to others that the exercises of extraordinary recklessness outlined here will not in fact occur again.

It is a report of the utmost significance. I must say at the outset how much of a tragedy it is that this report was not available to the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which reported to this Parliament only two weeks ago on the conduct of corporations law in Australia and on the massive legislative package which is now before the Parliament and which was brought in by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) to upend and overhaul the whole process and law relating to the regulation of the corporations and securities industries in this country.

Regrettably, the Committee was refused permission to receive that report in time to take it into account. The report that we now have had tabled shows quite clearly how relevant it is and would have been to the work of that Joint Select Committee.

         This report deals with an enormous range of matters of the most fundamental importance, going to the whole heart of the integrity of government in this country, to the relationship between government and business and, therefore, to the whole concept of corporatism in this nation. It is a path-which this Federal Labor Government has led us down and which Labor governments in the States, particularly in Western Australia and in my own State of Victoria, have led us down-of big business and big government getting into bed in a way that has resulted, as this report shows without any shadow of a doubt, in the pack rape of the taxpayers of this nation, in the theft of taxpayers' money, in enormous damage to investor confidence in this country and in enormous damage to the perception of the integrity of government in this country. They are very serious matters indeed because they go, in many ways, to the morality of this nation and, certainly, to the morality of corporate activity in this nation.

         This report is a saga of corruption, incompetence, maladministration and total disregard for the use of taxpayers' money. It is a report that is so detailed that in the limited amount of time available to us today it is almost impossible to pick the areas that ought to be dealt with. I look forward to further debate on this report and its aftermath, because without any doubt there will be continuing ramifications from this report in the future.

         One thing I thought I should do is to read into the Hansard record a couple of paragraphs that are contained in this report, because they give, in stark terms, examples of just what was happening in the relationships between the Western Australian Government and very limited parts-but important parts-of the corporate sector in Western Australia when the question of Rothwells Ltd and its bail-out was being considered. Let me just quote from chapter 9 of the report, which deals with the final collapse of Rothwells. That chapter lists and documents how an attempt was to be made to help the bail-out by getting the State Electricity Commission of Western Australia (SECWA) to put funds into the Rothwells bail-out in a way that had nothing at all to do with the normal commercial undertakings of the State Electricity Commission. The State Electricity Commission was asked by Western Collieries Ltd, which was part of the Rothwells group, to make a payment of $15m for ostensible reasons, the end result of which was to try to ease the liquidity crisis that the Rothwells group was experiencing.

          —It was asked by agents of the Western Australian Government who were in collusion-which is the only word that can be used to describe this-with the partners of the Rothwells operation in attempting the bail-out, against all conceivable odds, of the company and the group. The State Electricity Commission was written to by Western Collieries Ltd which, as I say, at that stage was in the process of being taken over and brought into the Rothwells group. Western Collieries, in a letter dated 10 October 1988, wrote to SECWA seeking payment of $15m. Paragraph 0.09 of the interim report states:

         SECWA did not respond to the letter from WCL.

         That is, Western Collieries Ltd. The paragraph continues:
        </para>
        <para>
         Apart from one telephone conversation between Mr White, Chairman of SECWA, and David Crawford of WCL, it heard nothing further about the matter until 21 October 1988-
        </para>
        <para>
         that is, 11 days later-
        </para>
        <para>
         when White was rung from a meeting being held in the office of the Premier of Western Australia and asked whether he would agree to make a prepayment to WCL on that day. The telephone call was initiated by Mr Bill Heron, the Deputy Under-Treasurer for Western Australia. Although the prepayment was to be of funds from SECWA to WCL, everybody at the meeting knew the money was going to be used to aid Rothwells in the difficulties it faced by 5.00 pm that afternoon.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, it had a fundamental liquidity crisis which it had to try to tackle by five o'clock that afternoon. The report continues:
        </para>
        <para>
         There was no attractive commercial advantage for WCL and White's concern was that SECWA might effectively become an unsecured creditor of Rothwells once its $15 million had gone in that direction.
        </para>
        <para>
         He was obviously dead right. Paragraph 9.10 of the report states:
        </para>
        <para>
         On the evidence, the interests of WCL were incidental to this arrangement. It was purely a means of solving yet another Rothwells problem. Payment arrangements between SECWA and WCL had been in place for some time pursuant to a coal supply agreement. A variation required board approval from WCL, but despite some assertions to the contrary, the evidence indicates that the board (or at least the non-Rothwells directors) were not even consulted about, let alone asked to meet to approve, this desperate scheme.
        </para>
        <para>
         Paragraph 9.11 of the report states:
        </para>
        <para>
         White would not agree to making the payment. Heron then passed the telephone to Mr Julian Grill, who at the time was the Minister assisting the Minister for Economic Development and Trade. The effect of Grill's conversation was to direct White to arrange the payment. White did so and a cheque was drawn payable to WCL for $15 million and later collected by Lloyd.
        </para>
        <para>
         Lloyd was a director of Rothwells. In other words, from a meeting in the office of the Premier of Western Australia calls were initiated to the State Electricity Commission of Western Australia which in the end resulted in a direction to that Commission to put money into what everyone at that stage knew was a futile cause.
        </para>
        <para>
         Another incident-`incident' is the lightest possible term one could use about this situation-involving Mr Grill occurred just a day or so earlier in that month when on 27 October 1988 Rothwells again sought to use Western Collieries, through its facility with the Rural and Industries Bank at Collie, in a separate transaction to meet an urgent problem. The report states:
        </para>
        <para>
         This time Rothwells approached the bank wanting some $6 million by way of overnight facility for WCL. That amount was to be on-lent to Rothwells which, by now, was in its death throes. The bank refused because it knew of Rothwells position.
        </para>
        <para>
         Grill was then approached and asked if he would contact the bank to try to persuade them to change their mind. He agreed to do so and specifically asked the bank to consider rendering this further assistance to Rothwells. He was refused. The former head of the Department of Cabinet, Kevin Edwards, then contacted the bank and its position was reversed. The bank was persuaded and the facility made available. Its repayment did not occur until 2 November.
        </para>
        <para>
         The very day after this repayment, Rothwells was placed in the hands of the provisional liquidators. No clearer example could possibly be given of the way in which the Western Australian Government played fast and loose and illegally and corruptly with the funds and the affairs of the State of Western Australia. I compliment the NCSC on the regulatory and investigatory role that it has undertaken in this exercise. I do so despite some of the criticisms that have been made of it.
        </para>
        <para>
         The important point, apart from the disgrace to the Government of Western Australia as a result of the actions that were perpetrated, is that that is not the end of the matter. This problem is not confined just to Western Australia. We have exactly the same problem in my own State of Victoria where the Victorian Government is now attempting to wind up a government body, the Victorian Economic Development Corporation because it has become such a corrupt embarrassment to it. With Labor Government connivance, contrivance, encouragement and persuasion, this Corporation was forced into bed with a range of companies in Victoria on the shoddiest of investigations and without proper regard for the use of taxpayers' money. The net result is that the Corporation lost $110m of taxpayers' money.
        </para>
        <para>
         I say to the Senate that if governments in this country continue down the route of trying to involve themselves with matters which have no earthly connection with the role of government-I am talking about commercial activities-we will pay a very heavy price indeed, not just in terms of the pack rape of taxpayers, but also the inevitable corruption and maladministration that will result. We have seen it par excellence in this interim report on Rothwells. We have seen it in my own State of Victoria. We will see it time and again unless we get government out of this corporatist approach of thinking that something good will come out of working with the private sector in terms of financing arrangements as distinct from the inevitable corruption, maladministration and incompetence that results. The report on Rothwells by the NCSC serves as a more than timely reminder. It is one of the landmarks that will pave the way in the Senate, the Parliament, and, I hope, the nation, for a much greater awareness and consideration of the fundamental issues that are involved.

It must be a matter of very great concern that not only is the Victorian Government not prepared to come clean by way of allowing a full and thorough investigation of the $110m loss by the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VEDC), but also it is in the process of shuffling its accounts across to the Rural Finance Commission so that it will be even more difficult to ge to the bottom of that mismanagement.

         It is Rothwells that we are concerned about today. One has to say, after even only a cursory glance through the interim report, that if ever anything is clear it is that the business of government should not be business. The Western Australian Government has tried to stand the traditional role of government on its head. It has perpetrated what can only be described as a travesty of the free enterprise and free market system because implicit in that notion, which even those recalcitrant learners such as Senator Bolkus have now come to recognise, is the fact that the free market imposes certain disciplines, but one of the requirements of such an approach is that those who fail should be allowed to fail. That is precisely what has not happened here.

         Senator Short has very eloquently catalogued the offences clearly committed by Minister Grill.

         For Ministers of the Crown to be up to their necks in arranging transactions that could only have the effect of making taxpayers' money available to private corporations that were sinking fast is nothing short of a scandal and has been quite correctly described by several of my colleagues as nothing other than theft of public money. I have the greatest concern that the way in which this whole matter has been allowed to proceed to date has not caused the Western Australian Government to alter its stance fundamentally. The rhetoric has changed to some extent but there has been no repentance, no contrition, no acknowledgment of wrongdoing and, therefore, no basis for any confidence that these things will improve in the future.
        </para>
        <para>
         This interim report contains a sordid account of desperate and dishonest Government actions. It is a graphic picture of larceny of public moneys on a grand scale. The first rescue attempt was the result of a package put together by a Mr Aleco Vrisakis who, at that time, was not only a frequent visitor and friend of Laurie Connell, with whom he used to stay most weekends in Western Australia, but also a very well paid legal and financial adviser to the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia. It was Vrisakis who put together the so-called rescue package-a corporate plan for restructuring the Connell empire that, on its face, involved Connell in coming up with some $70m of his own money in order to refinance the operations. But what is quite clear now from this report is that that was a mere device and subterfuge, that Connell in fact-and I would suggest aided and abetted by Vrisakis-conned the NCSC. I hope that there is a lesson to be learnt from this exercise and that should be that, where the NCSC suspects that offences have been committed, it should not allow itself to be seduced by the importuning of Government Ministers. Even Mr Henry Bosch, for whom I have considerable regard, acknowledged before the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation that he had kept Western Australian Government Ministers informed of his attempts to keep the Bell-Bond-SGIC deal out of the headlines.
        </para>
        <para>
         We know for a fact that the same approach was adopted in the Rothwells matter, that indeed the settlement rescue package put together by Vrisakis was part of an agreement that the matter would not be publicised. Indeed, in an affidavit tendered in evidence before the Supreme Court of Victoria, Connell said that it was a precondition of the Western Australian Government's lending its assistance that there be no investigation by the Commission. We know indeed that the Commonwealth Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) was exceedingly reluctant to intervene to conduct any public inquiry into the affairs of Rothwells prior to the Western Australian State election. We now have it sworn on oath by Connell that in fact the Western Australian Government was insisting that the matter be kept quiet, and that is precisely what the NCSC did. It rearranged the deck chairs so that Connell was forced to step down and it put in place, of all people, Lloyd and Vrisakis, one of whom is now on criminal charges, and it kept the matter quiet.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Henry Bosch says that it was necessary to do that in order to maintain investor confidence. I regard it as a very shabby and dishonest basis for not allowing the law to take its course. It is the classic argument that is always put by governments to prosecutors that somehow there are special circumstances that warrant a matter not being proceeded with. That is indeed what happened in this case. If it had not been for that-in other words, if the first rescue package had not been allowed to be put in place and if matters had simply taken their course-we would not have had that disgraceful and dishonest second rescue attempt under which the Western Australian Government colluded with the Bond Corporation to buy out the Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd for some $400m. If ever there was a charade, that was it. Senator Chaney described it as a round robin. I think he was far too charitable. It was simply a device for bailing out Rothwells on a grand scale with public moneys for which the Government felt no responsibility at all. It was desperately keen to assist the rescue of Rothwells when it was clearly beyond redemption.

In merely pointing to the fact that that infamous conversation in which pressure was brought to bear on Mr White of the State Electricity Commission of Western Australia (SECWA) took place in the office of the Premier of Western Australia the report makes it clear that the Premier has a great deal of explaining to do. His discredited predecessor, the former Premier, Mr Burke, who was the architect of this scandalous approach, in my view should be recalled immediately from a position where he is a continuing embarrassment and is no longer fit to hold any public office. The same can be said increasingly for the majority of members of the Western Australian Government.

         This is a sorry saga. It is not the usual one in which quite often it can be said that people were the victims of their own ignorance or greed. This is a case in which investors in Rothwells had little or no knowledge of what was transpiring and could not have been expected to know simply because the Western Australian Government regarded itself as being above the law. It did not need to invoke the shield of the Crown when it was engaged in this sort of transfer of public funds. It was engaging in activity which cannot be dealt with by the law of the land, is not susceptible to the companies code and is really not something that any regulatory authority can do anything about. The only possible solution to a problem as serious as this is for the Government that perpetrated the offence to be thrown out of office. If that involves the blocking of Supply in the Upper House in Western Australia I am sure that the people of Western Australia will welcome the opportunity to bring in a government that has some honesty and integrity.
        </para>
        <para>
         So the report does, I think, provide quite a number of lessons. It certainly will not be the last word on this sorry matter but, if it has the effect of making it clear that governments should not be in the business of business, that there is a separate and distinct role for government to play in encouraging a competitive environment in which businesses can prosper and if governments can confine their roles to that sort of stimulation, we will all be the better for it. But if governments are to get their fingers in the till in this manner, if Premiers are to close their eyes to any wrongdoing and somehow pretend that it is all a matter of public relations, and as long as the public does not think that there is anything terribly new about the allegations and nothing needs to be done about them, there is really no hope for us. I hope that this tale of ineptitude and dishonesty will stand as an object lesson for us all.

         I would now like to deal with a matter of direct government intervention in a farce-a disgrace-which simply cannot be justified and which is, to a modest extent, revealed in this sanitised version of the interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. There has clearly been an attempt by the Australian Labor Party to cover up for its colleagues in Western Australia who were involved in this, one could say, up to their necks but it may be more appropriate to say up to their pockets. The significance of this report is to be seen particularly in the section dealing with the Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd (PICL) transaction. This is the element which so clearly demonstrates how taxpayers' money was conveyed totally improperly into a ruin, a structure which, as has been established, had never been successful, whose accounts were totally phoney and which could not be rescued, not simply because there had been a stock market crash but because it was never viable at any stage. Rothwells Ltd did not collapse because of the stock market crash, but failed because--

As is clearly spelt out in this report, it demonstrates a disgraceful situation in which the Western Australian Government, in conjunction with Mr Alan Bond-who, I understand, is friendly with someone well known to members of the Government and who seems to be continually photographed with him; he is referred to by senior members of the Labor Party as `Bondy' and `My mate Bondy' and other suitable expressions-purchased half of PICL.

         The whole saga of this petrochemical project is an extraordinary one. As this report outlines, the Commission is unable to understand how a value of $400m could have been put on PICL in July 1988. The Commission notes that at the time of the valuation and, indeed, at the time of the sale, the project was still in the planning stage. While considerable work had been done on feasibility studies and the necessary agreements and arrangements, and while a deposit of $100,000 had been put on a block of land-I must say that $100,000 does not seem to rate very highly among these multi-millions of dollars going down the drain-the physical project had not begun. The report says:

It is unbelievable that $400m should have been spent largely by the Western Australian Government on behalf of the Western Australian people buying something which it had created itself and had the right to re-create. There was nothing specifically limiting about the mandate to start up this petrochemical project. In fact, the Government, had it been a rational government concerned with the assets of the people of Western Australia, could as well have said to another group, `This project will not get off the ground. Let us give the mandate to someone else'. Here we have the Western Australian Government involved in spending $400m to buy part of this project when, as the Commission has stated, it is unable to understand how a value of $400m could have been put on the project, particularly when, I repeat, the most valuable asset possessed by PICL was the Government mandate. Why did the Government do it? We have not yet heard a coherent statement from the Western Australian Government about why it spent good taxpayers' money on buying something which the Government itself had created for nothing. The mandate was a gift from the Government, yet the Government bought back its gift at a total cost of around $400m.

          —The honourable senator is from Western Australia and knows only too well what was going on. Three hundred and fifty million dollars of these loans were loans by Rothwells to its boss, Mr Connell. These loans clearly were worth so little that the only person who could buy them back was Mr Connell. They were bought back as a result of this deal with the Western Australian Government. That deal is unjustifiable, unsupportable, disgraceful and exposed by this document. Even though so much of the material on which legal action is likely to take place has been expunged from it, there is enough in this document to dramatise how disgraceful this transaction was.

         During April and May 1988 proposals were afoot within Rothwells whereby a significant portion of its loans portfolio (amounting to $350m)-

         that is that sum Senator Knowles spoke of-
        </para>
        <para>
         was to be sold off. The plan was to rid the company of `non-performing loans'.
        </para>
        <para>
         I suppose the company would have known perfectly well that they were non-performing because they were to the managing director, Mr Connell. If anyone would have known they were non-performing the company would. This sale was to be to Connell. By July 1988 the purchase of the loan portfolio became public. On 21 July 1988 the Commission asked Rothwells to provide information to its shareholders and to the market generally about the proposal that Rothwells would sell the portfolio to a Connell company. The Commission then considered that the information that had been provided by Rothwells for the proposed meeting with shareholders to approve the transaction under the rules of the Australian Stock Exchange was unsatisfactory.
        </para>
        <para>
         Following discussions between Rothwells representatives and the Commission, Rothwells released further information to the market. This was when the Western Australian Government stepped in to try to help its mate. An announcement was made of the role of the Western Australian Government and Bond in purchasing the PICL project-the petrochemical project. In those circumstances, the Commission announced that it would take no further action on the matter of the inadequate, inappropriate and unsatisfactory nature of the information being provided to Rothwells shareholders. The Commission having decided to take no further action, assurances were given that the completion of the PICL deal would see Rothwells out of the woods on a permanent basis. Of course, those assurances were empty, just like the coffers at Rothwells. It looks as though the Commission did not believe them either, because it began a further examination.
        </para>
        <para>
         As the Commission then reveals, the sale of PICL to the Bond group and the Western Australian Government as part of the rescue of Rothwells and as a means by which Connell could extinguish $350m of his non-performing debts was one of the most important aspects of the attempts to save Rothwells. In other words, it is clear that the Government of Western Australia was aware that this was one of the most important parts of the rescue operation, and that it was prepared to risk the money of the taxpayers of Western Australia in this ludicrous and risky venture, particularly recognising that the shares in PICL, which had been sold for $400m, had cost Mr Connell a tiny fraction of that amount. In 1986 Connell purchased his half share of PICL from Mr Dempster for about $400,000, and, effectively, Dempster and Connell became equal shareholders in 1986.
        </para>
        <para>
         What turned $400,000-worth of assets into $400m-worth? What magic thing suddenly transformed a $400,000 company into a $400m company? There is one simple answer: the Western Australian Government, by giving the company the special opportunity to construct a proposed petrochemical plant at the Perth suburb of Kwinana. Shortly after acquiring his interest in the company, according to the report, Connell negotiated a government mandate with the appropriate Minister of the Western Australian Government, Mr David Parker. I must say that Mr Parker's role in this matter is absolutely incredible, and no doubt that matter will be taken further in the appropriate place and at the appropriate time.
        </para>
        <para>
         By January 1987, PICL was earmarked to be the company that would construct a proposed plant in the Perth suburb of Kwinana. This was an extraordinary situation. The Government's action was the only reason that $400,000 of investment became worth $400m, yet the Government itself was prepared-but has never fully explained why-to pay that incredible amount. The Western Australian Government was prepared to join Mr Bond in paying Connell 10 times the amount that he had paid for it. This is an absolute scandal. It is incredible that taxpayers' money should be used in this way. One can only hope that those who have been involved and who are culpable will be brought to account for their behaviour. I have been prepared at all times to face any criticism or inquiry for anything I have done, and I have always been totally cleared. I hope that other members of the Senate can say the same.

I have been in the Senate for four years and have heard the words `Patrick Partners' thrown at him on several occasions-most unjustifiably, I have always thought. I know the honourable senator well. As far as I am concerned, he is a man of outstanding integrity, and I should have thought that most other people here would agree.

         Arising out of this interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission, there is an opportunity that we, as a Senate, as a parliament, and as a community, can take. We ought to look at how we, as a nation and as a community, have conducted ourselves in the corporate sector over the last few years-indeed, for longer than that, because this is not an isolated incident in the history of corporate life in Australia. I refer off the top of my head to the Gollin incident of some years ago, and there were other problems as well. It is said that this has some significance because of the part played by the Western Australian Government. From what I have heard so far today, I think the debate has gone down an unfortunate path. It is unfortunate not because the Government of Western Australia, and people in it, have been criticised. They are open to criticism, and if they deserve it, the criticism is properly made. It seems to me that the Western Australian Government, and people in it, have been criticised in a rather unfortunate manner.
        </para>
        <para>
         On the basis of the material in this report, there is reason for concern as to the part played by the Government. No doubt, that concern ought to be taken further, and relevant matters ought to be investigated. But it does not do that investigation any good for honourable senators to come in here-Senator Chaney led the charge, most unfortunately in my view-and accuse members of the Government of being thieves, of robbing taxpayers. Senator Chaney made emotive appeals, appeals that may sound good and, indeed, may score points in parliamentary debate but, ultimately, do not serve the community or achieve what we here ought to be on about. The reality is that very little, other than allegations, has been put before us to justify in any way what Senator Chaney says. In my view, it is disappointing that that approach should have been taken in the context of a serious report, a report which, unfortunately, has evoked exchanges of a personal nature across the chamber rather than a proper analysis of what we ought to do and where we ought to go-the proper issues raised by the matters set out in this interim report. I think paragraph 4.06 of the report should be looked at. It reads:
        </para>
        <para>
         For at least three years before the stockmarket crash Rothwells enjoyed a reputation as a high flying and dynamic entrepreneurial company. Although it was never admitted as a member of the Australian Merchant Bankers Association, it was frequently lauded in the media and widely accepted as an aggressive and successful entrepreneur. The attractiveness of depositing with it was actively promoted by many investment advisors and its total loan book rose to in excess of $800 million. Its shares were also actively promoted and rose in value from $1.32 in 1982 to a high point at $3.85 in March 1987.
        </para>
        <para>
         It may well be that it became central to the Western Australian economy and that in that context the Western Australian Government felt that it was obliged to do something about the fact that Rothwells had begun to fail. The question that arises out of the quoted passages is: how is it that, under the present system of regulating corporations and financial markets in Australia, the reality did not match the cosmetic appearance of what was going on? Clearly, the public and the market thought that Rothwells was operating soundly and well and was on the way to greater things. How is it that, given that appearance, money was apparently squandered and the inevitable collapse of Rothwells was speeded up by the stockmarket crash of October 1987? What is it about our regulation of the corporate sector and the financial markets that caused that situation?
        </para>
        <para>
         It seems to me that we ought to be facing these issues in this debate. If the Opposition wants to use the Rothwells collapse as a means of scoring political points against its opponents in the west, so be it. The Opposition may wish to concentrate on this issue, but I think this is a great opportunity for us to look at the issues that are ultimately of great concern to the public, to the people who invest and to the corporate sector which, by and large, and in spite of the examples of disaster that have been quoted today, has served this country well. How can we regulate the corporate sector, not so as to destroy the proper market forces but so as to ensure that the shareholders, the people who buy and sell in the market, can operate in an honest context?
        </para>
        <para>
         Senator Macklin said earlier that this is an opportune time to consider the corporations legislation that will be dealt with soon. It may well be that when this matter is properly brought to the fore it will prove to be considerable reason for the adoption of a scheme controlled solely by the Commonwealth. Under such an arrangement, decisions that ought to be made could be made more quickly than they are under the present Ministerial Council scheme.

         I conclude by sounding a warning against the abuse that tends to fly from both sides of this chamber in respect of people's characters. Such attacks are made for political reasons. Although that abuse is part of the cut and thrust of this place, there is always a danger that the more serious and weighty matters will be overlooked and opportunities will be missed for making sure that the collapse of companies such as Rothwells Ltd do not occur and that the many people who have invested in them do not suffer disastrous losses.

          —I would like to pick up a few of the concluding remarks of the last speaker, Senator Cooney. The honourable senator made the very valid point that there must be something wrong with corporate regulation in this country when an event such as that described in the interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) on Rothwells Ltd is the subject of such a catalogue of disasters. The truth is that had it not been for the intervention of the State Government of Western Australia we would not have seen the foul-up in the regulation of the Corporate Affairs Commission that subsequently has transpired. If we go back to the very first stage of the collapse of Rothwells, when the rescue package mark 1 was put into place-I think it was in the last weekend of October 1987 immediately following the stock market crash a week or so before-we find that the Western Australian Government used its aegis, its shield if you like, to give the impression that by its intervention it had created a safe vehicle in which people could invest.

        </talk.start>
        <para>
         At that time the Premier of Western Australia was Brian Burke and the present Premier, Mr Dowding, was a Cabinet Minister and party to all the arrangements and agreements that took place. That Government saw fit to interfere with the market place, thereby upsetting the process of corporate regulation.
        </para>
        <para>
         At the time of the rescue plan, in conjunction with a number of corporate operators in Western Australia and other parts of Australia, Mr Burke, the then Premier of Western Australia, did a deal with the NCSC. He said to the NCSC, `We will not require you to undertake an investigation of the affairs of Rothwells at this time and as compensation we will ensure that the credit of Rothwells will continue.' In other words, the Western Australian Government induced the NCSC not to investigate the affairs of Rothwells any further and bring them to light in return for a deal that it would virtually guarantee the moneys owing by Rothwells to its creditors.
        </para>
        <para>
         We are not talking about large corporate creditors, although they were certainly part of the scheme. In the main, the people who stood most to lose if that surety failed were the small depositors with Rothwells. They had relatively small sums of money. In many cases they invested their whole life savings in Rothwells because the Western Australian Government had told them that, if they continued to maintain their investment in Rothwells and not withdraw it, all would be well. That is how the Government of Western Australia chose to interfere with corporate regulation. The result was the disaster which is now well chronicled in the report before us.
        </para>
        <para>
         The involvement of the Western Australian Government in Rothwells in October 1987 was designed to create the feeling that it had given its support to Rothwells, that all was well, that Rothwells could continue trading, operate as normal and--

          —`Training' is probably the better word. That involvement was designed to create the feeling that Rothwells could continue its operations and, thereby, eventually repay all its creditors and manage its way out of the problem. As subsequent events have shown, that was a false hope. There was no chance at all of Rothwells surviving, given the enormous mismanagement by its managing director, Mr Connell, and the apparent total abdication of responsibility by the directors of the company. No doubt those matters will be reported upon extensively in the future and no doubt actions will be initiated.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The other point that has to be made is that at that stage the Western Australian Government, given its involvement to the tune of $150m or more, actually installed its own managers and its own supervisors of the operations of Rothwells. Those people, in particular Mr Lloyd, who previously had been an assistant town clerk in the Nedlands Council, undertook the supervision of a multimillion dollar operation in Rothwells. We know that the NCSC has charged Mr Lloyd since then. We are yet to find out whether that develops into a more serious case. That issue is enough evidence of the total lack of regard and care which the Western Australian Government should have taken to ensure that people were properly protected.
        </para>
        <para>
         At this point we do not know what the involvement was of those appointees of the Western Australian Government-Mr Lloyd and another person, Mr Edwards. All we know is that, whatever they were doing, they failed to achieve success in that it led to the eventual collapse of Rothwells in the latter part of 1988.

Consequently, he cannot argue that this report and the information that was available to the Government could not have been made public.

         I think we should turn to the central point. At the stage that it was obvious that the collapse of Rothwells was inevitable and the Western Australian Government finally decided, after 12 months, that it could not possibly prop up the affairs of Rothwells any longer for whatever reason it wished to do so, it entered into a set of transactions which was designed to get the Western Australian Government off the hook and ensure that Rothwells could not possibly be examined by auditors, receivers or liquidators in any objective way. I refer to the final investment of about $175m of Western Australian taxpayers' money into the Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd operation at Kwinana. As we all know, this operation consists of a block of land and a few pieces of paper on which agreements have been made, with the Western Australian Government, of course, to supply gas to such a plant. The total value of this operation, which consists of practically no assets at all, is $400m. I notice that the NCSC says in its report that that is a most remarkable price to have been achieved. I think it is outstanding. Turning a lump of land worth a quarter of a million dollars and a few bits of paper with words that really have no binding agreement attached to them into $400m is some financial operation. I am sure that Senator Boswell would be very proud of that if he could ever achieve it.

          —Wouldn't we all. The Western Australian Government achieved it. We have to ask the question-indeed, the NCSC is asking it: How much is the $175m that the Western Australian Government invested actually worth? The truth is that it is not worth anything. The Western Australian Government has constructed an asset-at this time its value cannot be tested although there is plenty of comment about as to its real value-and it has said that it is worth $175m. So it has created some kind of parking lot for an amount of money that would otherwise have been lost by the Western Australian Government in Rothwells operations. The Western Australian Government has merely created a fictitious asset where this amount of money is recorded pending some kind of operation to retrieve it. Of course, that operation revolves around the establishment of a petrochemical operation at Kwinana which has very dubious chances of success.

         In a nutshell, that shows what the Western Australian Government, under Mr Peter Dowding, is all about. We have also seen that well-celebrated transaction where Government Ministers leant upon the State Electricity Commission to obtain a cheque for $15m at the death knell of the Rothwells operation to keep it from collapsing. That was supposed to be some kind of advance payment in respect of the supply of coal by one of Rothwells' subsidiaries. Of course, that was a hopeless and totally fictitious transaction but, again, it was designed by the Western Australian Government to try to save the collapse of Rothwells.

        <para>
         Two things are clear: firstly, for some reason or other the Western Australian Government saw fit to get involved in the Rothwells operation right from the start. Secondly, it saw fit to create the shield under which Rothwells could operate for about 12 months and thereby prevent ordinary creditors either from withdrawing their funds or from being paid out by Rothwells. This created a false impression of the security of the investment in Rothwells and was only putting off the evil day. The fact that the Western Australian Government got involved in this matter to this extent demonstrates a lack of probity, a lack of good judgment and a lack of pure common sense on the part of that Government. It demonstrates quite clearly that, even though it just sneaked back into office in the State election, it does not deserve to hold the treasury bench in Western Australia.

          —I just want to make a few remarks about the interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) to the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities that has been tabled. I make it quite clear that, as far as I am concerned, in any walk of life, whether it is in the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia or any other party, whether in government or in opposition, no-one is above the law of the land and above investigation to ensure that functions are carried out. If that means embarrassment to the Labor Government in Western Australia, so be it. Some of my Labor Party colleagues have made public their views on some aspects of what has happened recently in Western Australia and the way in which the Western Australian Government became involved in some of these arrangements. The report of the National Companies and Securities Commission deals in part with some of those arrangements. So far as I am concerned as to the consequences of what has happened, I do not think anyone can justify defending actions which subsequently may prove to be outside the laws of the land. The old saying is `Let the dominoes fall where they shall'. People take that responsibility and that is what being in public office is all about.

        <para>
         Senator Alston got quite excited when speaking on this report. He made the blunt suggestion that Supply in Western Australia should be stopped to bring down the Government and force an election. We all understand the political motive behind Senator Alston and other members of the Liberal and National parties in wishing to defeat the Labor Government in Western Australia. It came as a terrible shock to the Opposition earlier this year that Premier Dowding was able to lead the Australian Labor Party to a third successive victory. One must remember that the Opposition parties in Western Australia made the affairs of Rothwells the major plank in their election campaign, but they were still unable to win that election. That campaign took place only in the early part of the year, and it seems remarkable now that Senator Alston and others salivate at the thought that they can force an election by using their numbers in the upper House in Western Australia. I trust that in future Senator Alston will be consistent.
        </para>
        <para>
         What was Senator Alston's view in the late 1970s when a whole list of scandals regarding land deals enveloped the Victorian Liberal Government? Ministers in the Hamer Government had to resign, public officials were charged and some actually went to gaol. It was a whole sorry story of public moneys being wasted and deals being done to benefit particular private people. I do not know whether Senator Alston, then a senior member of the Liberal Party in Victoria, called for the upper House in Victoria to stop Supply to force the Hamer Government or the Thompson Government to an early election. I suspect he did not do so. Despite the sorry spectacle of revelations from the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police misconduct, no member of the Opposition parties has called for an immediate election in that State. That has not happened, even though evidence has been tabled pointing to the most sorry kind of corruption in that State, with former Government Ministers admitting that they were misusing public funds. I have not heard Senator Alston calling for Supply to be stopped in Queensland in the Parliament to force an early election. Therefore, if Senator Alston or other members from Western Australia intend to go down that track, I hope that they will maintain their consistency and look back to other sorry circumstances which have come to light and which at times have embarrassed the Liberal and National parties.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is another aspect of this report which Opposition members have not raised, although I appreciate that they have had only 15 minutes in which to develop their arguments. I would emphasise that this report deals not just with the Western Australian Government's involvement in the so-called rescue of Rothwells, but also with aspects of the operation of public and private companies in Western Australia. In view of the information identified by NCSC, it is clear that in the near future this Parliament, and indeed other parliaments, will have to look seriously at introducing amendments to legislation to ensure that the operation of companies is more rigorously tested. I draw the Senate's attention to chapter 10 of the report which deals with audit responsibility. There is no doubt that if the Australian public is to have confidence in investing in companies, it must have confidence in the fact that annual financial reports published by companies and certified by auditors are true and accurate. Chapter 10 contains severe criticism of the audit procedures carried out by the auditors of Rothwells and associated companies. I believe that this area must be seriously looked at. We shall have to demand more vigorous attention by auditors, otherwise people will not have the confidence to invest in the future. I quote from paragraph 10.03:
        </para>
        <para>
         Thus, the provision for doubtful debts was reduced from the original assessment by the auditors of $127 million to $70 million. The auditors then signed off the report without qualification.
        </para>
        <para>
         I am sure everyone would agree that a reduction of $57m in doubtful debts is a significant figure, but that amount was signed off by the auditors without qualification. That is part of the problem we shall have to face up to. I quote from paragraph 10.07:
        </para>
        <para>
         Rothwells published the consolidated financial statements for the half year ending 31 January 1988 in March. The statements provided no information on the build up of interest receivable or the difference between interest recognised as income and that actually received. Without such information it was impossible to assess the quality of the earnings and assets as reported. The implication in the document that interest income was actually received (as opposed to `receivable') was, in the circumstances, quite mischievous and misleading to those who relied upon it.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, weaknesses in the audit provisions have been exposed, which further emphasises my point. Finally, I quote from paragraph 10.10:
        </para>
        <para>
         In particular, it is astonishing that the auditors had no suspicions about the nature of the transactions which occurred on 31 July 1987. Nor did they look behind them or endeavour to establish whether the transactions were bona fide, properly secured, in breach of the Code and correctly documented.
        </para>
        <para>
         It can be seen from other chapters in the report that in regard to the running of Rothwells, I would suggest that if a bunch of five-year-old school kids ran a pie table at the local bazaar in the same way in which Rothwells ran its accounts, the teacher would keep them in after school. Accounts were kept in a sorry state, to the detriment of Rothwells itself. Those senators who have read the report will see that some loans were made and were not documented; there was not a proper register of share certificates and of assets held in shares. I believe that Parliament and the Government will have to examine the procedures of companies as a result of this report.
        </para>
        <para>
         Although the Opposition may be salivating that this document is extremely embarrassing for the Western Australian Labor Party and to the Labor Party generally, we do not escape that responsibility. We do not draw back from the fact that this matter has to be debated and that people who have been responsible for these decisions will have to face the consequences, whatever they may be. This report should also be taken as a basis for understanding that amendments have to be made, for the protection of Australian investors, to the way Australian public companies operate, so that we can have an Australian stock market that is not some variation of the local Totalisator Agency Board gambling operation; so that investors do not face the same sort of risk they face when having a bet on the races. When people are investing money in the stock exchange and public companies with the caveat of buyer beware they should know that the information on which they are basing their decisions has been properly published and documented and audited by public auditors and so on.
        </para>
        <para>
         I will conclude on those points. I am sure that some members of the Opposition will be looking forward to further reports on this matter. I certainly will follow this matter with interest, as I believe the Australian public should.

          —I had no intention of speaking on the interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) this afternoon, but I cannot resist, particularly having just listened to Senator Schacht's contribution. I think the way in which he has down-played the role of the Western Australian Government on this whole matter is a great tragedy. Very early on in his address to the Senate he made the comment, `Let the dominoes fall where they do and that is what public office is all about'. How sanctimonious can one get? What public office is all about and should be all about is telling the truth. Of course, the Western Australian Government chose not to do that right from the word go on this issue concerning Rothwells Ltd. It chose not to do that throughout the State election campaign in January.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         Senator Schacht might well say that the Liberal Party of Australia ran a campaign on Rothwells. That, to a degree, is true. What he failed to say was that the campaign and the election had been called for the week before an interim report on Rothwells was to be brought down. That is a very important factor. What did the Government have to hide if it was not prepared to go full term and have the report on Rothwells brought down? Of course, the Premier, Mr Dowding; the former Premier, Mr Burke; and many of the Western Australian Government Ministers have categorically and unequivocally denied their involvement, when this report quite clearly sets out that they are in up to their eyeballs.
        </para>
        <para>
         The attempts of the Western Australian Government to rescue Rothwells have been laid out quite clearly in this document. They go right back to the first rescue which followed the stock market crash of Tuesday, 27 October 1987. The Government held secret little meetings with the various people involved. It should also be remembered that many of the people about whom we are talking today just so happen to be members of the Curtin Foundation, which is the major fundraising arm of the Australian Labor Party. Let us not forget that, because many of these people had been given positions by the government as a sinecure and they got into this, well and truly, beyond all shadow of doubt, further than they could possibly handle.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think it is a great tragedy that the people of Western Australia did not have the benefit of information such as this prior to going to the polls in February. As my colleague Senator Messner has already said, many people who had invested virtually all of their life savings with the Rothwells merchant bank stand to lose all of that money. If this Government or the State Government believe that that is playing fair, I question their ethics as well. Many small operators are very much down the list as far as the concern of the Western Australian State Government goes. If they were not a way down the list, why did that Government choose not to report accurately its involvement in the Rothwells saga, what it had attempted to do and the amount of taxpayers' money it used, which will never be seen again?
        </para>
        <para>
         Honourable senators on the Government side play down the fact that the amount involved was only $150m, $350m, $70m or whatever. That happens to be a lot of money. More importantly, it is a lot of money for many people who stand to lose their life savings. Let us not forget what this Government did in terms of concealing the State Government role. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has been questioned on this for many months now. He has hedged the issue non-stop. I suppose I do not blame him to a degree, because he knew exactly what was going on. He knew that the Labor Government in Western Australia had to go to the polls, so I suppose that he had the interest of his Party at heart, but is it not a pity that either the State Labor Government of Western Australia or this Federal Labor Government did not have some concern for the constituents of Western Australia? I note today in this debate that not one Labor senator from Western Australia has made a squeak about this issue.

         Let us go back to the deals that have been done, the wheeling and dealing of the Lloyds, the Edwards, the Dowdings, the Connells and the Bonds. How sad it all is in terms of the books being fudged. The executive summary of this report says that the administration, the management-all of those sorts of things-were absolutely appalling. Even when the Commission requested that details be changed and that management and administration be changed, that request was not taken up. Connell's removal as principal of Rothwells was perceived publicly to be his removal, period. In practice, that could not be further from the truth because he still maintained, as this report says, a very powerful influence.
        </para>
        <para>
         The report then refers to the Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd (PICL) project and to the State Electricity Commission. How many more examples do we need of government involvement, government manipulation and government rorting to the exclusion of the people of Western Australia? The report refers to the missing cheques for the collieries. The list simply goes on. As I say, I think it is a great shame that the people of Western Australia did not have the benefit of this report and those that are to follow. In hindsight they will be able to see the way in which they have been bluffed into re-electing the Dowding Labor Government. I remind the Senate that the majority of people did not vote for the Dowding Labor Government. The Liberal Party in fact received 52 per cent of the votes, the majority of votes; nonetheless, sufficient preferences in sufficient seats went to Mr Dowding. How many people in Western Australia would like to have another crack at the whole show? It is not a case, as Senator Schacht said, of salivating over the possibility of another election; it is a case of getting a responsible and honest government that can run the affairs of Western Australia, which has not happened over recent years with Mr Burke and now with Mr Dowding. It will be very interesting for the people of Western Australia to see the further developments that will be taking place over the next few weeks.

        I find the 1987-88 annual report of the Australian Safeguards Office totally inadequate as it fails utterly to deal with the reports of flag swapping of uranium that arose during the period covered by this report. Item 41 and annex K assured us that the accounting procedure was consistent with safeguards agreements but what we learned from the Euroscam revelations last year, just about 10 months ago, was that these are only a shuffling of paper and not worth the paper they are written on.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to a report in the Age on 19 April 1988, Dr Hans Blix, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), agreed that it was impossible to know whether or not Australian uranium was used in nuclear weapons. When asked if Australian uranium could be used in nuclear weapons he replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        I don't know. We safeguard quantities, not the atoms. Whether those atoms go somewhere else, I don't know.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting that on page 7 of the report the Australian Safeguards Office also quotes Dr Hans Blix, in an address to the Canberra Press Club on 20 April, as saying in respect of the IAEA safeguards:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . during the 25 years it has been operating not one case has been found where nuclear material or equipment under safeguards has been diverted to weapons production.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, that is not the whole story and this is what the Australian people ought to know. Dr Blix also said that the IAEA cannot prove that weapons materials have not been diverted from uranium which is covered by safeguards agreements. It seems to me to be not telling the whole story for the Australian Safeguards Office to quote from Dr Blix in that context in its report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The IAEA is totally understaffed and it is like the police policing themselves. This was the authority which was set up to promote the nuclear industry but which also finds itself in the position of monitoring the nuclear industry internationally. It does not have adequate staff to do the job efficiently, and when it goes to do its alleged spot checks on various nuclear plants, of course notice is given so that if anything untoward is happening in any plant it can very often be covered up. It is a paper shuffling exercise.

        A further report in the Australian for 3 June 1988 confirmed that Australian uranium covered by proper international safeguards entered the same process as material not covered by safeguards. In this particular case Australian uranium going to the French enrichment plant at Tricastin was used for both military and civilian purposes. This was very clearly identified and detailed in this Parliament and outside about a year ago. Yet this report says nothing about that at all. In fact it states that everything is okay in terms of the safeguards agreements. It is just not true.

        Annex K seeks to explain the accounting procedure but at no point does it state that this is a paper shuffling exercise and that the yellowcake concerned gets physically mixed up with yellowcake from other countries which are not subject to safeguards agreements as soon as it reaches the enrichment facilities in France, the Soviet Union or any- where else. Yet we know that that is the case. Mr Kerin and Senator Cook, the Ministers responsible, were forced to admit exactly that about a year ago. Apparently exactly the same thing happens with uranium from Saskatchewan in Canada which also ends up in France as well as the United Kingdom and the United States. Again there is no guarantee that it does not end up in nuclear weapons programs or somewhere like the nuclear bazaar in Khartoum which we learned about last year as well. There is nothing about that, of course, in this report, which is just giving just part of the story.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, it was about the same time as the Euroscam reports were being published that these reports of a large plutonium and uranium bazaar in Khartoum in the Sudan came out. One article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 May 1988 referred to a documentary called The Terror Trade-Buying the Bomb which described deals made as far back as 1980. Libya, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Pakistan, India and the Palestine Liberation Organisation reportedly were involved in the auction style deals with uranium and plutonium apparently filched from nuclear processing plants in western Europe. One reference was to material coming from a nuclear processing plant in Belgium, a country with which we have a bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement, according to paragraph 43 of this report.

        I fail to understand how such bland assurances about safeguards in the European Atomic Energy Community can be made in light of some of the scandals going on that I have referred to and, of course, that have been referred to in earlier debates here.

       I wish to make a few remarks on the consultations between the Government and Australian Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd during 1988. This, of course, is very much at the core of what is known in Australia as the two airlines policy, the tripartite arrangement between the Federal Government and the two domestic airlines. Of course, the airline industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in Australia. This Government has given notice that the two airlines policy will end in the next few years. In fact, we had to give something like seven years notice to bring this highly regulated arrangement for the air transport industry in Australia to an end. The results of that policy in particular areas have been quite disastrous for the Australian public. Those who use the airline industry regularly and have to pay the fares really do experience airline performance which is very much second rate by world standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wish to talk particularly about something that affects my State of South Australia and some of the other less populous States, that is, the particular practice of parallel scheduling, the so-called duplicated flight departure times that the two domestic airlines, Ansett and Australian Airlines, are notorious for. At so many airports around Australia one can see one plane taking off and another from the other airline taking off within 15 minutes of it. It is a blight on our system. It is an obnoxious practice. It is one that would not be tolerated in any other developed country of the world. It is the bane of people living in South Australia.

        —I know from Senator McKiernan that it is a bane in Western Australia. I know particularly from Senator Tate that it is a real problem in Tasmania. I am sure that those senators who are from North Queensland or from the Northern Territory will also agree with me that their choice of flight departures is severely limited by this dreadful practice engaged in by Australia's two domestic airlines. The airlines simply parallel each other right around the country and effectively reduce the choice of flight departure times. The airlines have tried to justify this by saying that they to do it only in peak hour slots, that is, early in the morning and late in the afternoon. That is one of the arguments that I have heard. In fact, if one goes to an airport one can witness this practice all through the day, not just in the morning and evening slots. In the middle of the day one will find both airlines having planes taking off almost in tandem around the country.

       I would like this afternoon to speak particularly about the Adelaide-Canberra route, which is one I am sure is of great interest to Senator Hill. I know it is to me and to the Western Australian senators, such as Senator McKiernan, who come through Adelaide to fly to Canberra. The non-stop travel between Adelaide and Canberra is of vital importance not only to government officials but also to people in business and to those in the trade unions going to national meetings.

        —Of course. We find in recent years one of the two airlines has pioneered a non-stop flight from Adelaide to Canberra in the evening leaving at 6.40 p.m. We now have the practice where the other airline operates a service at 6.50 p.m. On one evening we have a parallel service between Adelaide and Canberra and yet there is only one other service direct from Adelaide to Canberra in the whole week and that is on a Monday. So that is two of the three non-stop services on that route-I know that Senator MacGibbon of Brisbane is probably eating his heart out that we actually have non-stop flights to Adelaide.

       In reverse, the other airline pioneered non-stop flights on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons just after 4 o'clock-a great service of enormous benefit to people travelling from Canberra, the national capital, to South Australia and Western Australia. What has happened now? We find in the new airline schedules that the other airline is flying on both days at 4.20 p.m. and has absolutely no other non-stop services from Canberra to Adelaide for the whole week. What a disgrace! This practice would not be accepted in any other developed country in the world. With a highly developed airline system, we have this idiotic, crazy policy where planes chase each other across the sky over Australia on a daily basis. One airline did the right thing with respect to the thin route between Canberra and Adelaide. But the other airline, after finding that the venture was a success, has a service which chases its competitor's plane 10 minutes later. I know that this practice also upsets people travelling to Western Australia and Tasmania and it is time that it ceased.

       <para>
        This Report summarises the progress by the Australian National Line (ANL) in implementing its equal employment opportunity program during 1987-88. I will not talk much about the very limited progress which has been made in the last financial year. However, I want to refer to the basic problem that ANL has because of the method of employment of ratings for ships' crews, which is one of the major concerns of the shipping industry and is crucial to the development of a proper equal employment opportunities program. In passing, I note that there were two female ANL officers out of a total of 503 at the beginning of that financial year and two female officers out of total of 393 at the end of that financial year, reflecting the decline in size of the ANL. In other words, during the year 1987-88, the ratio of females to males actually increased although the number of female officers had not increased. At this moment, the ANL has no female officers. It had two; now it has none. One left to get married and the other has gone to work for a different shipping line.
       </para>
       <para>
        Officers are direct employees of the ANL and therefore directly under its control and subject to its equal employment opportunity program. However, ratings and the terminal operational staff are not directly employed by ANL and are therefore outside its control in terms of its equal employment opportunity program. Page 5 of the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Seagoing crew employees are also not directly employed by ANL nor does ANL have a control in their selection. Seagoing crew are employed on an Industry Roster basis and they are contracted by ANL to man our vessels according to their position on the roster at the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to talk for a couple of minutes about this seaman engagement system or seamen's roster, because it is the root cause of a lot of problems in our shipping industry, not least in our equal employment opportunity program. Seamen and stevedores have a system of industry-wide employment which is unique in Australian industry. Ratings are employed by individual ships from an engagement pool. The number in the pool is determined by the relevant unions and the ship owners and selection of the individuals to make up the crew is made by the unions, not the employers. The cost of administering this system has been borne in the past by the Department of Transport and Communications. However, this is about to change and the cost will be met through direct charges on the ship operators.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to the cost of administration, there is a further cost to ship operators for attendance money to eligible seamen not assigned to a ship. These provisions cost in the vicinity of $2m a year and are financed by levies on the ship operators. The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) was sceptical about this arrangement and concluded that the attendance payments were a form of unemployment benefit and questioned the need for the industry to provide its own unemployment benefit when the Government provided an economy-wide system quite separately. Submissions from ship operators to the IAC inquiry into coastal shipping expressed a strong preference to move to company employment of ratings because they believe-I am sure they are right-that only in this way can one encourage proper training, proper involvement with the success of their enterprise and, if profit sharing is appropriately introduced, some interest in the efficiency of the organisation they work for. In particular, given that there are more technically advanced ships, the current pooling system effectively ignores the need for skills specific to these vessels and forces shipowners to take on the next seaman in line on the roster, regardless of whether he can do the job.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an absurdly out of date system. We must move to company employment so that a proper emphasis is given to things like the equal employment opportunity, training and involvement with the success of an enterprise. Ultimately, we will have to go to enterprise unions in the shipping industry. This is the only way that we will overcome the gross exploitation of the labour monopoly which presently exists on our coastal shipping trade. Without that, there can be no efficiency, no equity and no fairness.

         —Earlier this morning senators were discussing a motion by Senator Hill relating to the reference of a matter to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters concerning a perusal of the Australian Capital Territory election system. I was concluding my remarks by saying that I do not believe criticism of the Electoral Commission's handling of this count has been necessarily well based. That is because it is a complex system and once the d'Hondt system was modified one ran into all sorts of technical problems. If the count is rushed and a mistake is made everything has to go back to square one. I pointed out that the New South Wales Senate election with about 45 candidates and a slightly simpler system, took eight weeks to count. For a start, it takes two weeks to strike a quota. Also, because of the peculiar rules of the d'Hondt system, as the primaries are being checked they are classified into certain categories so as to make the later count much easier. Those who argue that the Electoral Commission should have put on another 20 or 30 staff should have stressed to them that qualified staff are needed to check preferences. I have seen several Senate counts especially since the law was changed to introduce ticket voting. I did not see this one. Anyone who did would have realised the immense complexity of the task. Professionals are needed to do it because a few amateurish mistakes can affect 50, 100 or 200 sets of preferences and when a mistake is made everything goes back to square one.

        I am not all that confident that, given the current nature of the modified d'Hondt system, any better method can be developed by the Electoral Matters Committee or the Electoral Commission so that these votes can be counted better. I doubt that the d'Hondt system, in terms of timing and speed, can be improved. It might be done by excluding candidates or by the electorate taking election matters more seriously than it did on this occasion but, on the whole, I am not confident that the d'Hondt system can be so refined as to make the count quick. Talk of computers is nonsense. The cost is immense and the program saves absolutely no time. It has been suggested from time to time that the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) be used.

        I doubt that we will ever get the answer to the problem but one possibility is to go to a simple electoral system. I favour 17 single member electorates. That is opposed by everyone else because people say that the Labor Party would win the lot. I do not know the Labor Party in the ACT too well but with 17 single member constituencies the Labor Party would not have won a majority. The constituencies are so small with 10,000 people that the voters do not let party loyalty dominate their thinking. They vote according to the quality of the candidates and all sorts of candidates would get up.

         —Senator Hill probably believes that Labor would get a majority and I wish he were right, but I doubt it. I say that based on my experience of local politics in the ACT. However, to my mind, that is a more simple system.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have always been consistent on this-I have always agreed with preferential voting and single member constituencies for a lower House and proportional representation for upper Houses. The former distributes power and the latter distributes representation. Having only one chamber may be the answer. It may be better to go back and have nine single member constituencies and eight elected by proportional representation. At least it would be a far more simple system. However, I do not know that we can rewrite history.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do think, however, given the views of the Electoral Commission expressed in the documentation referred to in another debate by Senator Jenkins, and given the fact that there is great public disquiet, the very least we can do as a Parliament is send this off for inquiry, and so we should. The Electoral Matters Committee and its predecessor over the years have a fairly good track record. Their inquiries have produced some very eminent reports. The Committee is not one of those stuffy committees of the Parliament. It is always relaxed because everyone on the Committee knows more than any of the witnesses appearing. That makes it a unique committee in many ways. The fact that Sir John Carrick is no longer on it makes its quality suffer somewhat because he was the all time expert in these matters. Nevertheless, it has a very good collection of individuals on it and I am sure that they will approach their task and try to find the solution rather than engage in political point scoring. As Senator Hill pointed out, it is only three years nine months until the next election and it is absolutely essential that the system be made workable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I appreciate that Senator Hill had the courtesy to approach the Chairman of the Committee and raise matters with him. That is something that is too often overlooked in this chamber when senators are rushing off on point scoring exercises. The reality is that the Committee probably will not be able to give the reference due consideration this year, given the inquiries that are in train, but certainly it can start off by advertising, by getting submissions in and having the Electoral Commission do preparatory work all in good time for a serious inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend Senator Hill's motion to the chamber. I repeat what I said earlier that, even if this motion goes down, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) in any event, using his power under the committee system, will refer this matter to the Committee. On being informed that the Senate chamber was more than likely to do that, he withdrew and ceded that responsibility to this chamber.

         —The Australian Democrats support the objectives of Senator Hill's motion and are pleased indeed to fall in with the agreement of a limited debate on this motion, just as I was pleased to greet the Minister's suggestion yesterday of a limited debate on my motion, because the two motions do have the same objective, although there are some differences of emphasis. For the record, when my motion was raised with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I had no objection.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When I put forward my motion I did not know that Senator Hill would bring on a similar motion on the day on which my motion was scheduled for debate. Be that as it may, as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) says, that is now water under the bridge and I certainly do not intend to retaliate against the Minister for his attack on me by seeking to have my motion debated on the date previously scheduled for that debate. The only thing that matters at this point is that the method and practice of the first Australian Capital Territory election be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for inquiry and report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I circulated copies of two proposed amendments to Senator Hill's motion. This morning I gave copies to Senator Hill and to the Government Whip. I should like to flag those amendments at this stage. I sought, first of all, to have removed from the second part of Senator Hill's motion the words, `with a view to recommending changes which might improve the process and expedite the count'. I sought to have those words removed because I believe that in directing the Committee in this way we may be in fact limiting, by expressing this view, the extent to which the Committee would look at the issues raised and, in fact, anyone would be at liberty to make submissions to the Committee raising any issues with the Committee that, in his opinion, the Committee should consider. I am sure that Senator Hill will also do this.
       </para>
       <para>
        My amendments also seek to remove clause 3 for a similar reason. In clause 3, Senator Hill speaks of two matters. The first is that he wishes the Committee to examine particularly whether the deposit required to be paid by candidates is adequate. Senator Hill has said that he wants the amount raised because, if the deposit were a higher amount, the mischievous might be deterred from nominating. It certainly might deter the mischievous poor but I do not think it would deter the mischievous rich. The question to ask is why so many individuals and parties nominated for the Australian Capital Territory election. I do not think it was out of mischief but more as a means of expressing their dissatisfaction with the electoral system and therefore as a means of protest, and certainly this was the perception of the media during the election campaign. It would be more advisable to find a satisfactory electoral system in order to deter such a protest. In a democracy where all those eligible to stand are entitled to do so it will never be possible to prevent the mischievous from standing. However, an aware electorate will respond to that by its vote.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another element of our democracy is that one does not need to be wealthy to be a member of Parliament. Indeed, I am happy to say that these days one does not need to be a landowner to be eligible to be a member of Parliament. Of course, a salary is paid; so one does not need an independent income. One of the problems, if there were to be a considerably higher deposit, is that this would be seen to favour bigger, established and more monied political parties rather than smaller parties or community groups and sincere independents. I am sure that Senator Hill would in no way want to deter these people from nominating for election. Besides which, some 63 per cent of voters in the ACT chose not to give the first preference votes to either the Labor Party or the Liberal Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second part of the third aspect of Senator Hill's motion deals with the cut-off level for successful candidates and questions whether that is set at the most appropriate level. I am sure that that will be one aspect at which the Committee will look. Here I presume that Senator Hill is referring to the 5.5 per cent of first votes required by candidates in order for them to be eligible for election. These could be a grave anomaly in that although candidates or parties require that 5.5 per cent to be eligible for election, it could well be that the last candidate in a Party list may well be elected on less than that percentage. I am sure that the Committee will look at that aspect very closely indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The electoral system which the people of the Australian Capital Territory used for their election on 4 March is the very much modified d'Hondt system. It has one thing in its favour, which is that it is a proportional system and certainly the results of the election reflect that. Rather than being dismayed at this election result we should take heed of a letter published in today's Canberra Times which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Congratulations to the 17 candidates finally elected! They should realise that they are the servants of the the ACT voters, who demonstrated by their votes that the majority are thoroughly disillusioned by party politics. It is to be hoped that the 17 members, freeing themselves from groups, numerical order in group, and number of votes gained, will act as independents with open minds on each issue raised, seeking only the best interests of the ACT.
       </para>
       <para>
        When that Assembly meets, which we all hope will be next week, we will see the possibilities of legislation reached by consensus. I suggest that legislation reached in that way may be better quality legislation than that which is simply arrived at because of the numbers. The House of Representatives is a House of Parliament elected on single member electorates. Any legislation put into that House will pass through, and does so usually without amendment, because the Government has the numbers. I was listening to a debate in the House of Representatives yesterday and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), which is in Western Australia, said that they were wasting their time debating a certain issue. He knew that, like two other pieces of legislation which had passed through the House of Representatives earlier that day, it would come to the Senate, be amended and then have to be debated again with amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must ask ourselves why it is that it appears to be that only in the Senate can we have proper debate on legislation and have amendments put forward which, on very many occasions, are accepted and change the legislation. It is because the Senate is elected on a proportional representation system. The members of the Senate-the senators here-reflect the diverse wishes of the electors. Indeed, it is up to us all to be accountable to our electors. The author of the same letter in the Canberra Times states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The new ACT Legislative Assembly can set up a type of non-party administration which might well be the envy of the states and Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        It certainly will be very interesting to see what happens. I turn to the proportional representation system that was used in the recent election in the ACT and quote from a letter sent on 18 November 1988 by the Deputy Electoral Commissioner to the ACT Administration. He describes the modified d'Hondt system as, `an electoral system unknown to mankind'. It is known to mankind now, of course, and mankind in the ACT certainly knows what it is all about. The Deputy Electoral Commissioner points out in that letter grave flaws within the system. He describes, for example, the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a candidate . . . could have all his first preference votes transferred away from him, and yet win a seat because of the transfer to his party of the votes of other candidates. Many would regard this as absurd.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us see what the Electoral Matters Committee comes up with as far as that is concerned. I turn to another point dealt with in a letter written by the Electoral Commissioner himself. He describes the d'Hondt system as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also a system which is now so close to the Senate system that critics will ask why the Senate system, which is already familiar to ACT electors, is not being used; and there will be no convincing answer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister said earlier that it is important that people have a system which is well-tried and well-understood. Certainly single member electorates is one of those systems, but so is the Senate system. We have that system not only used for the Senate but also for the Legislative Council of New South Wales, the Legislative Council of South Australia and, of course, in the House of Assembly in Tasmania we have the Hare-Clark system which is similar to that and deemed by many and acknowledged by experts to be one of the best and most democratic systems available. I hope that the Committee will look at that type of system too. In an article which appeared today in the Canberra Times headed, `Need for referendum to rid us of d'Hondt system', Malcolm Mackerras speaks highly of the Tasmanian Hare-Clark system. He describes it as a system which, if it were to be adapted for the ACT, would mean:
       </para>
       <para>
        Three multi-member electorates each returning seven members.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hare-Clark voting and counting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ballot papers to employ what is known in Tasmania as `Robson rotation' to prevent parties from regimenting their vote.
       </para>
       <para>
        Automatic provision . . . that where there are three federal electorates in the ACT the federal and territorial boundaries be the same (as in Tasmania).
       </para>
       <para>
        Vacancies to be filled by counting back the votes from the previous general election of the member who had died or resigned.
       </para>
       <para>
        That would eliminate the need for expensive by-elections. It would also mean that by-elections could not be used for party political purposes and the Assembly would simply carry on. In that article Malcolm Mackerras proposes a referendum. Unfortunately, there is a flaw in his argument where he suggests that the referendum should be similar to that held in Tasmania over the location of the dam. As we all know, that referendum had a very different result from that which was expected by the government of the day. We will have to look very carefully, if we are to hold a referendum, at the types of electoral systems that are proposed, and to be sure that all feasible systems are offered to the people of the ACT.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion-I do not want to overrun my time-I should like to give the opinion of the Proportional Representation Society of Australia of the d'Hondt system, which is, of course, a proportional system. The Society describes it as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Machiavellian d'Hondt scheme, fully operational preferential voting applied for the first time in the ACT. However, each vote was deemed to be cast either for one of the nine independent candidates or, in the case of party candidates, for the party, regardless of whether the first preference mark was placed in the square against the party's name or in a square against one of its candidates' names.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is another of the flaws in this system. We should certainly move very vigorously to put this matter before the Committee. It is true that the Committee is busy, but the sooner it has notification that this matter is to be looked at, the sooner it will be able to get on with it and rearrange its business accordingly. At this stage I will move my amendments to Senator Hill's motion in order that the Committee may have a broad perspective and not feel that it is in any way limited by parts of the motion. I move:

         —In effect, the Senate is debating Senator Hill's motion to refer to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, for inquiry and report, the method and practice of the first Australian Capital Territory election. As a member of that Committee, I should like to say a few words, some of which will have been said in this debate already. As honourable senators will know, the Committee has a very full plate. As I think the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) said, it cannot be expected that this reference will be satisfied this year. Because of the nature of the reference, and because of its implications, it will certainly require considerable effort on the part of Committee members and probably on the part of those who are going to make submissions to the Committee. I refer, for example, to the third paragraph of the motion:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        (3) That Committee particularly examine whether the deposit required to be paid by candidates is adequate and whether the cut-off level for unsuccessful candidates is set at the most appropriate level.
       </para>
       <para>
        That will open up the whole aspect of deposits, which is one of the questions before the Committee, presumably perennially. The second paragraph of the motion reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) That the Committee review the electoral system and the election process with a view to recommending changes which might improve the process and expedite the count.
       </para>
       <para>
        That will take considerable time. Inherent in it is the question whether the system can be salvaged at all. That might relate to the question whether the electoral system, as distinct from the voting system, is appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        That, of course, opens up a great can of worms-it opens the matter up to political considerations. I am not sure whether the Senate wants the Committee to involve itself in the appropriateness of the electoral system-that is, the number of members in the Assembly; how the numbers are to be distributed; and whether there should be single-member electorates, a proportional system, or whatever. Is it the intention of the Senate that the Committee should engage in such political considerations, or is it the Senate's intention to say to us, `Look, a decision was made by the Parliament in respect of the electoral system. Have a look at the voting system and see whether it is appropriate to be used for the purpose of achieving the result set down by the Parliament.'? That narrows the matter a little and introduces some sort of technical approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may well be that, at the end of the day, the Committee will say that the electoral system is inadequate for the purpose of fulfilling the task of electing members in accordance with what was determined by Parliament. Under those circumstances, of course, it would be up to the Parliament itself to decide whether to change the system of voting or whether to change the basis of the electoral system itself. I agree with all those who have said that some consideration has to be given to this matter. I am sure that if it is referred to the Committee, as proposed by Senator Hill, the Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Lee, will pursue that task with the vigour and objectivity-not to say the laid-back approach, as the Minister suggested-that we have adopted in other areas. The informality with which the Committee conducts its proceedings is beneficial. We all know what we are about. We have been around the place for a few years now, and I think we understand each other. That cuts out a lot of wasted talk. Having said that, I will not waste any more words.

         —On behalf of the Opposition, I should like to say that we will oppose both amendments, although I understand that the first will be passed. The reason we oppose the first is that we believe that it is better to give this inquiry some focus-a focus in relation to the existing system, much along the lines of what Senator Harradine has outlined, to see whether, in the words of the motion, changes might be made that could `improve the process and expedite the count'. There is no doubt that, by deleting those words, the Senate is making it clear that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is invited to look at all possible alternative systems for the Australian Capital Territory. To me, that simply takes the debate back by years and touches on issues raised by the Australian Democrats today and by the Government this morning. The Democrats said, `We still favour a proportional representation system and we want to have another go at it'. Senator Ray said that the first preference of the Government remained a single-member electorate system. All that I can see is that the debate will not be advanced because, ultimately, it will come down to a political decision that has to be made in the Parliament-a decision that was made, after a lot of agony, late last year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would have thought that the better procedure would have been to accept, as we do, that there is no magic in this particular electoral system. But, presumably, it can be improved with expert advice. With the efforts of Senator Harradine's experienced Committee, it no doubt can be improved. We would be looking for a constructive and worthwhile contribution towards better government in the Australian Capital Territory. That is our preferred position and that is why we prefer the words that we have set out in our motion.
       </para>
       <para>
        We oppose the second paragraph of the Democrats' motion because we think that the two specific matters raised in the third paragraph of our motion-that is, the deposit level to be paid by candidates and the appropriate cut-off level for unsuccessful candidates-are important questions that should be specifically addressed. We see that as being in no way restrictive but rather simply guiding the Committee on two issues upon which the Parliament can reasonably expect advice from the Committee. For that reason we therefore oppose the second part of the Democrats' amendment.

       The implementation of the tax file number system, which as we all know was the subject of legislation passed by the Parliament about six months ago, was a matter of great contention in this place. After a prolonged period of examination by the Opposition and negotiation between the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown, and the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, certain agreements were entered into in regard to privacy legislation. That privacy legislation was enacted at the same time as the Bill was brought in for the establishment of the system. At that time the Opposition agreed only to the implementation of the Bill and of the tax file number system on the basis of the safeguards which were incorporated into that privacy legislation. That must be regarded as absolutely fundamental to the position of the Liberal and National parties and their support for this legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the time that the Bill was being discussed in the Senate, the spokesman for the Liberal and National parties on this matter made it quite clear that notwithstanding the passage of the privacy legislation and the adequacy, as it was regarded at the time, of that legislation, the Liberal and National parties would continue to monitor the legislation and its administration by the Australian Taxation Office to see that privacy was protected and that the rights of individual taxpayers and individuals generally within the community were properly safeguarded. This system has been in operation, in official terms, only since 1 March this year, a little over two months ago. We have come to the conclusion that those privacy conditions have not generally been adequately adhered to by the Government. We have had evidence of this in recent times and this has been the subject of considerable press report and comment by Opposition senators and Opposition members of the House of Representatives. We have seen examples of mishandling of highly confidential matters by the Taxation Office which has allowed highly confidential tax file numbers to fall into the hands of those persons who have no entitlement to that information.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have instanced cases of the Taxation Office forwarding to deceased taxpayers details of tax file numbers. It is not likely that deceased parties would receive tax file numbers but it is quite possible that living persons who wished to obtain a duplicate identity and a duplicate tax file number could use such a tax file number to establish a separate identity, thereby escaping the penalty provisions of the tax file number law. As we know, a tax rate of 50.25 per cent is applied to any income which is not the subject of a declaration of a tax file number. It follows that if a person could utilise a false number and declare it to an employer or use it for declaring interest or some other income, no tax would be paid.

       This example of the way in which the system could be abused was brought to the attention of the Senate during debate six months ago; it was the subject of more general discussion in the prelude to the period during which the Australia Card was also the subject of debate. One of the concerns that we have is that numbers can be distributed to people and other persons can gain access to those numbers. This flows directly to the lack of application by the Commissioner of Taxation to his duty to ensure that a high degree of confidence, which should be the subject of his concern, is maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have seen examples of as many as 77,000 tax file number letters being sent to people in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory who have changed their addresses. Quite clearly, these letters were not marked `highly confidential' or as private information in any way, yet they could quite easily have been picked up by people who could have utilised them for their own purposes-quite apart from the lack of privacy that that would offer any taxpayer who had been forwarded one of these letters. As many as 58,000 letters have been sent to people in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory in a similar way. The people to whom these letters were addressed either had changed their addresses or had died. Again, ordinary people had access to the private, highly confidential information of people's tax file numbers which could then be used or misused for other purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the essence of the complaint of the Liberal and National parties so far. We have seen other examples that also justify our concern. A large number of tax file numbers were sent out-the total number cannot be estimated unless the Tax Commissioner can advise us in the course of this debate-in March this year in unsealed envelopes. Privacy provisions could easily be evaded in that way. People could find out tax file numbers and use them for whatever nefarious purpose they might have in mind simply by opening the unsealed envelopes, taking out the letters inside, recording the tax file numbers, slipping the letters back into the envelopes, leaving them as they were, and sending them on their merry way to the taxpayers. The essence is that privacy can be offended and violated and, as a result, a taxpayer's personal information in the tax system could be at risk. A person applying to the Australian Taxation Office, with the benefit of somebody's tax file number, could find out the affairs of that taxpayer.
      </para>
      <para>
       I put it to honourable senators that this has occurred within the first few months of the history of the tax file system. We have seen, therefore, a collapse of the agreement that the Liberal and National parties made with the Government in supporting its legislation last year. That is why we have sought to bring this matter to the attention of the Senate and the public generally in recent weeks. That is why we now seek to refer the matter to a Senate standing committee where it can be further examined, where perhaps other cases can be found and where a line of action can be recommended to the Parliament whereby we could correct this matter. The matter is raised by us as it goes to our fundamental support for the legislation. We see it as being vital to the future development of the legislation that we ensure that people's rights are properly protected by the privacy legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       No doubt numerous other matters have come to the attention of Government senators-they have certainly come to the attention of Opposition senators-which concern the operation of the system itself. It seems to me to be quite reasonable for those matters to be brought into the open in the discussions of the Committee that we are now seeking to establish. It is not just a question of whether superannuants, for instance, should be the subject of this kind of legislation; and it is not just that people on very low incomes, such as widows or older people, may have had no experience whatsoever in dealing with the voluminous forms that are required to be completed in relation to the tax file number system. It is really the overriding concern that people feel that Big Brother appears to be looking over their shoulders in the everyday administration of their personal financial affairs. That concern needs to be expressed most in the course of the deliberations of the Senate Committee. It is something which needs to be balanced. We in the Liberal and National parties understand full well that the Government's intention with the introduction of the tax file number system was to stop tax evasion. But, as we warned at the time, that has to be balanced with the privacy rights of individual Australians as well.
      </para>
      <para>
       This matter of Big Brother and the operations of the Taxation Office has been thrown into sharp relief in recent times. One concern that has come to our attention is the fact that people are required by law to start using the tax file number that has been designated to them by 1 April this year. Given that the law stipulates quite clearly that that use needs to have been commenced the Taxation Commissioner, in his press release dated 30 March 1989, said, `It does not matter if you do not comply with it in the first few weeks or so. We will not be too hard on you'. Apparently, that is the kind of flexibility that the Commissioner of Taxation has deemed he has in dealing with people who are retired or people who have received pensions notwithstanding the fact that the Parliament has made a law which states that it is mandatory that the system operate from 1 April.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the Commissioner of Taxation has been challenged as to whether he has powers greater than the Parliament has granted him, he has turned round and said, `There is a rather more general provision in the law which allows me to exercise that power'. He has referred us to section 3a of the Taxation Administration Act which states, `The Commissioner has the general administration of this Act'. The Taxation Commissioner is saying, `I have been clothed with the power by the Parliament to administer generally the Income Tax Assessment Act. Therefore, if there is another Act which stipulates certain conditions as to time and terms, I need not concern myself about that because I can then vary those arrangements under this more general provision of the taxation Act and act according to my own discretion'. That is a matter of the greatest concern to taxpayers, and should be to all members of this Parliament. An unelected official is acting outside the Parliament's Acts which are specifically designated to him by the Income Tax Assessment Act. He chooses to vary the conditions because of what in the end is a very vague clause of the Taxation Administration Act which he claims clothes him in absolute power.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that this reduces Parliament to an utter farce. Why do we sit here passing legislation and debating such matters as this if the Taxation Commissioner can merely vary his approach according to his own interpretation of some other sections of the Act? Who will challenge those powers, once having been exercised? Who will take on the Commissioner in the courts? Certainly superannuants and retirees will not have the resources to fight the Taxation Commissioner in the courts on such issues. It raises the most general fears, concerns and alarms in the community to see such powers exercised by the Taxation Commissioner. That is the reason for our concern. We will remain vigilant on this matter until we have appropriate responses. As we do not see such a response coming from the Government, we believe that the only way in which this matter can be properly resolved is by conducting a Senate inquiry as laid down in the motion.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also of concern, as more and more examples of the lack of concern for privacy become evident, that such powers are extending into wider and wider sections of the community. We know now, some time after the legislation was commenced, that those who receive social security and veterans' pensions are required to submit tax file numbers and to subject them to the normal provisions of the law. Their failure to declare that tax file number will result in their being taxed on pensions to the extent of 50.25 per cent. Clearly pensioners, be they social security or veteran pensioners, would be people who would not be in the most opulent of circumstances. Therefore, a loss of income of over 50 per cent would mean a great deal to them in terms of their weekly survival. The Government has been unfair in its treatment of that class of people.
      </para>
      <para>
       We must remember that people in their older age, and particularly women, have not had the experience in business that many younger people may have and certainly members of parliament may have. As a result people in their seventies and eighties are bewildered by the mass of paper with which they have to deal. This is a penalty upon such people and could easily mean serious loss of income during particular periods that could cause them undue hardship. As I understand it, one of the most disturbing aspects of this matter concerning superannuants and retirees is that this was publicised by the Tax Commissioner only towards the starting date of 1 April, rather than much earlier to give people plenty of notice so that they could prepare themselves for these things.

There are much wider concerns about which we should like to hear more. The Senate Committee certainly could judge the affairs of pensioners and veterans more effectively than could the Senate as a whole. As this Committee supervises the affairs of finance and public administration, I believe that it would be the proper body to look into these matters.

However, they found that no forms were available. Therefore, they were unable to complete the required duty and as a result are montes to have the tax applied at 50.25 per cent on their superannuation.

       These days no quarter appears to be given by the Taxation Commissioner, or if he does give quarter it is only at his own discretion. Apparently he resents the right of any parliamentarian to take on these questions in order to determine the privacy rights of individuals. I suppose Senator Walsh would seek to paint the Liberal and National parties as the friends of the tax avoiders as he normally does, and he no doubt will again. It introduces the view to the fair-minded person that we need a means by which the rights of taxpayers can be protected. I am interested to see that my colleague Senator Watson recently gave notice that he proposes to introduce a Bill which allows tax deductability for proper legal and accounting advice where tax audits occur in individual cases.

       It is the arrogance of this Government in dealing with these issues that concerns us most of all. That was evident in the debate in the House of Representatives. The Government gagged the debate after one speaker on our side had spoken and, in the course of Mr Porter's introductory remarks on the subject, cut him off at the knees. It was not even prepared to listen to the debate or to the issues being raised. This arrogance demonstrates quite clearly the lack of concern by this Government for these issues. The Government was not even prepared to ensure that the envelopes enclosing the tax file numbers of individuals went out to taxpayers marked `Highly confidential', `Confidential', or even `Private'. They were sent out as ordinary mail so that anybody could gain access and misuse that information. It is just as well that we have a balance of numbers in the Senate where we can raise these issues, whereas in the House of Representatives the Government can use its numbers to close down any debate it wishes.

       The Government is totally ignorant of the concerns of individuals in this community. We keep hearing about hands on levers and how the Government can manage the economy better than anyone else since Federation, yet we end up being in a bigger and bigger mess with greater debt every month that goes by. This comes from the great array of geniuses who sit on the other side. Amongst them there is total ignorance on the question of the issues that concern ordinary individuals. The issue that is before us tonight is one of them. It is about privacy, the interference of government in the ordinary affairs of individuals and the concern that government is somehow bigger than all of us. It is that total abdication of concern for people that the people of Australia are worried about. It is something which we in the Liberal and National parties are concerned and worried about, and it is something that this Senate should be worried about. I call on all members of my Party and the Australian Democrats to support this motion.

        —It is generally cold comfort after the event to be able to say, `I told you so', but, cold comfort or not, that is what has to be said in relation to this matter. The fact is that the Australian Democrats said last year that the tax file number legislation would not work; that the safeguards were more apparent than real; and that members of the Opposition were being conned by the Government, and allowing themselves to be conned for reasons that were never made clear to us. They paid no attention when we pointed out to them anomalies; loopholes; gaps in the legislation; clauses that were not going to work; and whole sections of the legisation that left people unprotected in a variety of ways from bureaucrats, from information falling into the wrong hands, from information being released without their knowledge and from information being contained on files that was neither up to date nor accurate. This, of course, is the result.

       As Senator Messner has pointed out, in February and March of this year letters were sent to all States addressed to people who were dead or who had changed address, in envelopes that were not sealed; there have been innumerable instances where information as sensitive as an individual's tax file number could fall into the hands of somebody for whom it could be useful indeed but was never intended; and we have seen the arbitrary extension of the deadline.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Messner has made a great deal out of his horror, his shock and his distress that all of this has happened, yet we signalled in the debates last year that this was likely to occur. Absolutely no notice was paid to our concerns or to our cautioning at that stage. Of course, the Democrats will be supporting the reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We are concerned enough about the matter raised by Senator Messner to agree to his proposition, but his proposition amounts to a litany of the mess that has occurred as a result of the deal that was done last year by the Liberal and National parties with the Government on the tax file number legislation and the Privacy Bill. And it was a deal. It was a pretty shoddy deal at that, because what we finished up with were two pieces of legislation which were quite inappropriate for the times, which were not necessary when other steps could have been taken, and which did nothing to protect individuals from the invasion of privacy and other potential problems of the sort that has been raised in Senator Messner's motion.

       I have some difficulty at times coping with the blatant, not to say breathtaking, hypocrisy of the Liberal and National Party coalition, which I presume is what it still is as of today. In 1986-87 those two parties, along with the Democrats, the Australian Privacy Foundation, various civil liberties groups and the odd right wing tax rorter, I will admit, opposed for very different reasons the Australia Card legislation. In 1988 when the Labor Government modified its plans by removing the need for a piece of plastic with a photograph on it to be imposed on all and sundry, members of the Opposition fell over themselves in their eagerness to support the Australia Card Bill. What caused the change of mind, I do not know. What made them think that the simple omission of a piece of plastic with a photograph, name and address and a magnetic strip on the back would make such a difference, I do not know. What we have, to all intents and purposes, is what the Australia Card Bill set out to do minus the card. That is an easy enough element to include in the system sometime down the track if a government of that mood gets control of both Houses of Parliament.

       As a smokescreen the Opposition parties huddled in a corner with Government Ministers and worked out that they could save a bit of face and get a trade-off for the passage of the tax file number legislation by having some ineffectual, half-hearted privacy legislation introduced. That privacy legislation does not even cover the private sector. It covers only the public sector and, as we have seen because of the events that have led to today's motion to send this matter to a committee for investigation, that does not essentially protect anybody from anything. It is privacy legislation which is ineffective and is not doing what it should do. It does not protect anybody at all from the private sector incursions, because they are not included in the Bill, and it does not adequately protect people from the bureaucracy, particularly at the Federal level.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the Democrats pointed out, in the debate and during the committee stage of the Bill, that the tax file number was a dangerous piece of legislation, leaving the way open for abuse by government departments, and that the Privacy Bill was a legislative colander, we got little support for our concerns from the Opposition parties. Indeed, so anxious were they that the tax file number legislation should go through and that the privacy legislation should go through that in the end they did not care how inadequate those pieces of legislation were and at one stage they took the extraordinary step, on the part of the Liberal and National parties, of actually voting against one of their own amendments because the Government said that it was not prepared to accept it. That was one of the more extraordinary things that happened in a fairly extraordinary debate last year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nevertheless, the Opposition cannot say that it was not given due warning of where this little exercise on the part of the Government was heading. In my second reading stage speech in November last year I said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . as a result of the passage of this legislation . . . instead of being given a new number, an existing number, namely, the tax file number (TFN) will be used-it will make it very easy indeed for governments to control, manipulate, if not actually tyrannise, groups and individuals in society.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know that there are those . . . who say that if people have nothing to hide they have nothing to fear. They say, `I do not care who knows what my tax file number is. I will put it at the top of this article that I am writing on this legislation'. That is fine. I suppose that if one has nothing to hide one has nothing to fear, so long as the situation exists where one knows what it is that one has to fear. If one does not know that, I guess one does not really know what it is that one ought to be hiding.
      </para>
      <para>
       I repeat a point that I made in that speech last year:
      </para>
      <para>
       Our society is not based on a system of legislation hinged on the idea that if one has nothing to hide one has nothing to fear. Our system is hedged about with protections of people's privacy.
      </para>
      <para>
       I say now that, whenever we move to put an impediment in the way of their privacy being maintained, we should move also to hedge that impediment about with the elements of protection that are needed so that information cannot get into the wrong hands and cannot be misused, misallocated or collated and collected in some wrongful manner. That means ensuring that personal details, of course, such as our tax file number, should not fall into anybody's hands other than those who are authorised to have it. It is not just a matter of its not falling into the wrong hands. We do not know whose the wrong hands are likely to be. What we do know is that, if we have a piece of legislation as intrusive and as potentially damaging as this, we ought to make sure that nobody has access to the information other than those who under the legislation are entitled to have it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Later on in my second reading stage speech I made this point:
      </para>
      <para>
       The worst of it all is that, since the original Australia Card legislation met its doom, the Australian Taxation Office appears to have done nothing of any consequence to improve the integrity of the tax file number. The integrity of the tax file number does not mean spreading it around to all and sundry. It means improving its credibility. At the moment it has less credibility than a passport number. The cosy deal that was done between the Opposition and the Government to pass this legislation has achieved nothing except to get their rich mates off a hook.
      </para>
      <para>
       That point bears further consideration. Had the Australian Taxation Office put aside its gung ho consideration of imposing a tax file number on millions of Australians and concentrated first on giving that number the same integrity as the passport number has, we would not have been faced with the situation of these tax file numbers being posted out in sealed or unsealed envelopes with `Confidential', `Very Confidential' or `Private' or nothing at all written on the top. Dead people would not have had numbers sent to their previous addresses. People would not have had these things sent to homes they no longer lived in. The onus would have been on the individuals to take documentation to the Tax Office to prove they were who they said they were, or to lose out by paying the top marginal tax rate as a consequence. This whole fuss and bother could have been avoided by a much simpler procedure.
      </para>

       Senator Messner complained today that pensioners have to pay 50.25c in the dollar if they do not comply with this requirement. He all but burst into tears at the thought of those people being penalised like this. I point out that that was his idea; this 50.25c in the dollar penalty for failing to provide the tax file number to the Australian Taxation Office was the Opposition's way of saying, `If you don't want to provide the details, you don't have to; but you will suffer by having to pay the top marginal tax rate'. All that did was to allow people on very high incomes to get away with whatever they had been doing and to have a choice in whether they provided the information.
      </para>

       At the time we moved an amendment which would have genuinely given everybody, whatever their income, whatever their status in life, whatever their age, a choice about whether to supply their tax file number to the relevant private sector institution. It involved providing them with information if they chose to or giving them a much better choice, giving them the opportunity, for example, of having 30 days in which to let the Tax Office know that they were working at a particular place and what their name and tax file number were or whether they had money invested in a particular institution and what their name and tax file number were. `Complete the triangle', we said at the time, `between the Tax Office, the individual and the income source. But don't make it a one way street and don't penalise little people'-in the way the Opposition was prepared to do by putting on the very financial impost that Senator Messner has just complained about.

       Then we came to the privacy legislation-a piece of law for which the Democrats had been arguing for years. But it was introduced into this place in a form which was extremely deficient. We pointed that out at the time, and Senator Messner's motion indicates that we were right. We said in November of last year:
      </para>
      <para>
       Worst of all, it will not be an effective protection against misuse or abuse of the tax file number or the legislation behind it.
      </para>
      <para>
       We noted that the information privacy principles needed to be strengthened and that there needed to be a provision to sue for damages for breach of privacy. The Opposition in fact moved an amendment concerning the right to sue for damages for breach of privacy, and we supported that amendment. It moved an amendment regarding the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's review of a decision of the Privacy Commissioner, and we supported that. We supported a number of amendments and we moved others. The Bill went back to the lower House and was sent back here with some of those amendments classified as unacceptable to the Government. One of them was the major Opposition amendment with regard to the right to sue. What did we see happen? The Opposition voted against its own amendment. I find it extraordinary, given that situation, that Senator Messner should get up here and argue that it is somehow the Australian Taxation Office's fault for not properly using an ineffective, loophole-ridden piece of legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       This whole sorry mess has occurred as a result of the collusion that occurred last year between the coalition parties and the Government. It was inevitable from the beginning of that little deal that we would end up where we are today. It is a messy, unworkable system. Privacy protection is almost non-existent. It certainly has not been sufficient to prevent the abuses listed in the motion from occurring. There is an urgent need to take steps to ensure that an individual's tax file number is not sent to the wrong address, that it does not fall into the wrong hands or that it does not disappear in the postal system thus leaving him liable to a deduction of 50.25c in the dollar for everything he earns. I hope that at the end of the exercise, when the Committee has looked at this, it will come back with some recommendations and suggestions on how both the tax file number legislation and the privacy legislation can be amended in order to ensure that the right number goes to the right person; that ordinary individuals in society are not penalised unnecessarily; that information contained in departmental records is up to date and accurate; and that people know what has been written about them and to whom information is being released.

        —An awful lot of people out there now believe in ogres that they never believed in and never had any reason to believe in before. There is absolutely no reason for people to have to confront the difficulties they are currently faced with as a consequence of the mismanagement of this legislation caused by the Government's incompetence in drafting and the Opposition's unwillingness to plug the loopholes last year. There is no reason why the many thousands of tax file number holders who have been disadvantaged over the last couple of months should have been placed in that position. There was no reason for any of this to happen. If people cannot be at least partly assured that the Government and the bureaucracy are doing everything they can to make sure that the files are accurate, up to date and not abused, ill-used or released improperly, one wonders just exactly what sort of society we are living in. This is not a dictatorship. This is not the sort of society in which people have to put their thumb prints all over things, and I hope it never becomes that. I did not expect even Senator Walsh, in his fiendish run for cost-cutting measures, to claim that it is not only unreasonable but probably unlikely that information will ever be up to date.

       As Senator Messner has indicated, it is certainly true that the Australian Taxation Office has not fulfilled its obligations. It is certainly true that letters have been sent to the wrong addresses; that letters have been sent inappropriately; that letters have been sent in unsealed envelopes; and that there has been no indication of confidentiality on the front of letters. But the real culprit in all this is not simply the operating habits of the Australian Taxation Office; it is the system and its architects on both sides of this chamber.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is very unfortunate indeed that we have to face up to the sort of motion that we are debating today, which seeks to refer the question of these infringements to a committee. That Committee will be asked to investigate the administration of the tax file number system and to inquire and report on the extent to which the Australian Taxation Office in its implementation of the tax file number system has failed in a variety of ways to abide by the provisions of both the Privacy Act 1988 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988. Maybe at the end of this exercise both the Government and the Opposition will have the grace to admit that there was not only some other way of catching the rorters and the tax cheats in the community, but that even this way could have been improved so that we are not faced with the debacle that we have seen happening over the last two months.

        —Last year a number of the more irresponsible, time-serving mediocrities of the Parliament, especially of the Senate, had some success in selling to a few gullible or lazy journalists a conspiracy theory about the Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey and, of course, big-noted themselves in the process. The theory which they peddled then was backed up by a legal opinion from, would honourable senators believe, an anonymous QC and some pseudo-legal advice from one of the Senate Clerks. However, their limited success in that bit of self-aggrandisement has encouraged the same sorts of people to try on another stunt; hence this motion. Its purpose is the self-aggrandisement of those who support it. Its effect will be to feed conspiracy theories about the tax file number and, in the process, squander quite a considerable amount of taxpayers' funds. If the Senate carries this motion it will have shown itself to be following the lead of the Peter Sawyers of this world and the League of Rights, as well as providing for every other ratbag in the country a privileged forum in which they can run their wild allegations and conspiracy theories.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I want to make a couple of comments about the speeches of Senator Messner and Senator Haines. First, I provide a straight bit of factual information. Senator Messner asked how many notices had been posted since 20 March. I have been informed that 3.8 million notices have been sent out since 20 March; I am not sure how many were sent before that. I earlier interjected in regard to comments made by Senator Messner about the Commonwealth's superannuitants. That matter was also raised by his Liberal Party colleague, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), whose comments were published in the West Australian some day last week. The honourable member for Forrest alleged that Commonwealth superannuitants, unless they had their papers in order by the end of April, would have 50.25 per cent deducted from their pay. The honourable member for Forrest, of course, did not bother to check any facts before he rushed off to the newspapers to big note himself. The fact is that the Commissioner for Superannuation has sought and obtained an exemption, until 30 June 1989, from the requirements to impose those taxation arrangements. I signed a letter to Mr Prosser today telling him that.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another point about Senator Messner's comments that I want to make is that he criticised the Australian Taxation Office for not sending out information in envelopes marked `private and confidential', while simultaneously running the theory that a significant number of people out there are eager to get their hands on this information so that they can misuse it. If there are such people, would they not be much more likely to intercept an envelope marked `private and confidential' than an envelope not marked `private and confidential'?
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Haines referred to `the Liberal Party's alleged breathtaking hypocrisy'. I find that hard to take from a senator who has delivered sermon after sermon about the inviolable principle of non-retrospectivity in taxation legislation but who last year moved an amendment, which was supported by the Opposition, which imposed retrospectively a liability for capital gains tax on totally innocent people and who, on previous occasions, allowed crooks such as the Kelly brothers to walk away with literally millions of dollars that they had pinched from the taxpayers of Australia through fraudulent pseudo-superannuation scheme arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       I shall now deal with the substance of the motion, if it can be said to have any substance. The points are designated with roman numerals (i) to (iv). Points (i) and (ii) refer to envelopes containing tax file numbers or tax file information being sent to people who were dead or had changed their addresses and those points were supported, backed up or supplemented by a number of wild allegations about the consequences. Taxation assessments have always gone out to people who are dead or have changed their addresses, and taxation assessments have always-if not always, certainly since I have known anything about them-had the tax file number on them. Admittedly, they went out to fewer people.
      </para>
      <para>
       While I am on this point, let me say that I am astounded that even the Democrats could believe that it is possible for the Tax Office to have a totally up to date set of records of all persons who are still living and where they live. Surely even the Democrats could work out that if the Tax Office posts a letter with, let us say, a tax assessment in it on the same day that somebody dies, the letter will not be delivered until maybe several days or several weeks later. It is functionally impossible for the Taxation Office to have a totally up to date record of all surviving taxpayers and their addresses. It is as impossible to have that as it is to turn back time. I would have thought that even the Democrats would have been able to work that out.
      </para>
      <para>
       Letters including notices of assessment will continue to be posted by the Tax Office to people who are dead or have changed their addresses, a fact which the Privacy Commissioner has acknowledged in discussions with the Taxation Office. The Privacy Commissioner has set, as a standard, that such errors should not exceed 1 per cent of the tax file numbers posted out since 20 March. I understand that the error rate has been contained within that 1 per cent. It is functionally impossible to have in the Tax Office, no matter how many resources are devoted to it, the names and addresses of taxpayers completely up to date. So points (i) and (ii) are essentially fatuous.
      </para>
      <para>
       Point (iii) refers to allegedly unsealed letters. Apparently, some letters went out from the Adelaide office with faulty gum on the envelopes. That appears to be the reality.
      </para>
      <para>
       Point (iv) criticises the Taxation Commissioner for not getting a proclamation from the Governor-General to extend to some later period the 1 April date for producing a tax file number. Senator Messner has semi-conceded that that is trivial as well, because the Taxation Commissioner does not need such a proclamation. He relies not only on the discretion afforded him by the Taxation Administration Act but also by section 221 (d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       As my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) pointed out in the House of Representatives today, what we have from the Opposition is the latest instalment in an ongoing campaign against the Commissioner of Taxation. I do not wish to be too uncharitable but I have a suspicion that the real reason for the Opposition's hostility to the Commissioner of Taxation results from his cracking down effectively on some of their tax-dodging mates, in stark contrast to the dark and negligent Howard years during which a number of people got away with grand larceny in the area of tax evasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Privacy Commissioner could deal, and indeed to some extent has dealt, with the sorts of complaints contained in this motion. The motion seeks to duplicate that function in the Senate. It is no surprise to me that the Democrats would go along with such a proposition heedless of any resource constraints. After all, if they believe that it is possible to have a completely up to date record of the names and addresses of taxpayers, if they believe in the fairies at the bottom of the garden, if they believe that the Government has a magic pudding, or if they believe in the existence of a cargo cult, it is not surprising that they would be heedless of the cost of undertaking any activity at all.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Liberals, however, are supposed to be hard-headed, economic rationalists pursuing a deep and fundamental commitment to parsimony with public money. That parsimony is automatically suspended when it comes to the operation of the Senate. The rule that takes over then is self-important extravagance and self-indulgence. Because I do not think it is worth spending too much time on this matter, the final word I want to say on it is that appropriations for the Senate have increased in real terms by nearly 30 per cent since 1984-85 and by 17 per cent in real terms since 1985-86. In that same period, Commonwealth outlays in total have fallen by about 6 per cent. Those are the figures after adjustments for one-off items. A pattern of extravagance and self-indulgence has been followed here and is being continued tonight in proposing this motion which, it is clear, will be carried but, of course, as could have been deduced from what I have said, it is not supported by the Government.

         —The Copyright Amendment Bill and the Circuit Layouts Bill are being considered cognately. In relation to the Circuit Layouts Bill, I note that both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have indicated their support for that legislation. That is certainly appreciated and it is consistent with what I understand to be industry support, if not enthusiasm, for this legislation. That goodwill is even permeating the chamber. The Government is committed to fostering the development of the Australian computer chip industry and this Bill is an important part of that development. The Government is hopeful that the Bill can be passed before the conclusion of the World Intellectual Property Organisation Diplomatic Conference on the draft treaty on this topic which commences in Washington on 8 May 1989. We would be pleased if we could give our delegates to that important international conference the information, the message, the missive, the electronic epistle, that this Parliament has agreed to the passage of that Circuit Layouts Bill. I am sure that, with the support of the Opposition and of the Democrats, that can readily be achieved.

        I have already indicated that, for all the reasons that I outlined at length yesterday, the Government will not support the Opposition's second reading amendment. The Democrats' second reading amendment is acceptable, so long as the preambular words are altered in such a way that the Government takes responsibility for preparing the report that Senator Macklin seeks. He wants the Attorney-General's Department to be required, as a matter of urgency, to prepare a report. That would be inappropriate, as it would require consultation between several departments. However, I have given him an undertaking that the Government, calling on all its resources and departmental officers who are relevant to the exercise, will prepare a report along the lines he wishes. For those reasons, I commend the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 and the Circuit Layouts Bill 1988 to the Senate. As I said, the Government will oppose the Opposition's second reading amendment, but will support the Democrats' second reading amendment in a slightly amended form.

        —The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Radiation Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) prepares recommended public and occupational radiation exposure limits for application under State and Territory radiation control legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Australia's Recommended Radiation Protection Standards require that:
      </para>
      <para>
       no practice leading to radiation exposure should be adopted unless it produces a positive net benefit;
      </para>
      <para>
       all exposures should be kept as low as reasonably achievable; and
      </para>
      <para>
       dose equivalents to individuals should not exceed 50 millisieverts per year for radiation workers or 1 millisievert per year for members of the public. For the latter, this translates to a lifetime cumulative exposure limit of 70 millisieverts, or about one half of the natural background. These limits exclude exposures arising from natural background or exposures incurred in medical diagnosis or treatment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Neither the Department of Community Services and Health nor the NHMRC carry out regular monitoring of radiation workers, as this is a function carried out in all of the States and Territories by their own relevant health authorities. However, many radiation workers are monitored through the Australian Radiation Laboratory's personal radiation monitoring service, and average annual exposures have been derived for most occupational groups from this source. These averages differ from industry to industry and the average across all radiation workers is 0.5 millisievert per year, with a range from zero to 3.6.
      </para>
      <para>
       The mining industry is not included in this summary, as miners are monitored in a different way. However, for the very high grade uranium mine at Nabarlek, the Australian Radiation Laboratory found that average exposures through the mining phase were approximately 3 millisieverts for the total of both external radiation and internal exposure arising from radon and its decay products. Averages for other mines are likely to be lower.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) During the past two years, much new research work on radiation risks has emerged, based on a re-evaluation of the exposures experienced by the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and on extended studies of their medical histories. This work is being closely examined by the international scientific community, and it is now generally considered that the radiation risk associated with severe exposure is about three times higher than earlier estimates.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Information about the Japanese atomic bomb survivors is a very important component in the setting of radiation exposure standards, and the new studies have been reviewed in detail by the Radiation Health Committee. In view of the fact that exposures in Australia are very low, the Committee prepared for the NHMRC a Recommendation, which was promulgated in December 1988 and which does not advise a change in limits at this stage. Instead it draws attention to the new information and to the existing requirement that exposures should be kept as low as reasonably achievable. In particular, it advises that managers of workplaces in which employees regularly receive exposures which are a significant fraction of the recommended limits, should exercise particular care.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is anticipated that the International Commission on Radiological Protection will publish revised Recommendations in 1990, which take into account this new information. When this occurs, they will be examined by the Radiation Health Committee and appropriate revisions of the Australian standards will follow.

       (3) Yes. It is important to maintain an appropriate scrutiny of foreign investment proposals. The number of rejections is a reflection of the foreign investment guidelines prevailing at a particular time and the nature of proposals. Although the rejection rate was less than 1% in 1986/87, it was over 3% in 1987/88.

       NOTE: The above figures should be treated with considerable caution as pilots' salaries are calculated using a complex formula, such that the resultant figure is personal to each individual. The major variables to the monthly rate include rank (eg Captain), years of service, aircraft type flown on each trip, hours actually operational each month (varies according to routes bid within each bid period), and whether the flying is day, night or a composite of the two. Pilots are also paid various allowances, including daily travelling allowance, where a pilot is away from home base, and licence renewal allowance.

       The above figures have been provided by the airlines and calculated by dividing the total pilots' payroll in a particular year by the average pilot staffing level for that year. Allowances are included.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) On 13 February 1989 I signed Gazette notices requiring the emergency recall of Neroa Skinless Skin condoms and Harmony Skinless Skin condoms under Section 65L and 65F (1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974. These notices were published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of 21 February 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) This action resulted from tests conducted by the Department of Community Services and Health (DCSH) which did show that an unexpectedly high proportion of condoms of Batch 6018 failed the freedom from holes test under the Australian Standard for condoms. Following a conference conducted by the Trade Practices Commission the Commission advised that `Batch 6018' was not really a batch at all but a number stamped on a proportion of the affected condoms. The Commission advised that the mandatory recall should therefore be extended to all Neroa Skinless Skin condoms and Harmony Skinless Skin condoms.
      </para>
      <para>
       The action also relied upon the results obtained by the organisation, Enersol Consulting Engineers, which is another testing organisation recognised as competent by the DCSH. Tests by this organisation showed that Harmony Skinless Skin condoms failed the 12 litre burst test specified in the Australian Standard.
      </para>
      <para>
       The action was supported at a later date by the rejection by US authorities of a consignment of condoms from the same manufacturer because they failed the US `freedom from holes' requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was found that Batch 6018 was used for both Neroa and Harmony condoms and administratively there was no way that they could be distinguished. That other tests showed the Harmony product to be inferior also made the extension of the recall a reasonable action.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. However, the test procedure is straightforward and the tests were supervised by fully qualified personnel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) There are no National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) approved Australian testing facilities specifically for condoms, although testing facilities can be registered with NATA. The absence of NATA approval does not mean that a laboratory is unable to perform the necessary tests competently.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) I was informed of test results for these condoms by Birks-Chemists of Adelaide and in Japan. It could not be established if these tests were related to the same batch of products subject to the mandatory recall.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Condoms are therapeutic goods and the mandatory recall of Neroa Skinless Skin condoms and Harmony Skinless Skin condoms has been based on advice from and requests by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a matter for the Department of Community Services and Health to assess the adequacy of laboratories for the purpose of testing condoms to the Australian Standard.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The letter from Fuji Latex Co. Ltd to the Department of Community Services and Health was not forwarded to me and I cannot comment on this matter. However, I am advised that the comments in the letter never did apply to the DCSH facility and no longer apply to the Enersol facility.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The Trade Practices Commission's comments and conclusions were fully taken into account.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) I was satisfied that the mandatory recall was soundly based having relied on advice from the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, the Trade Practices Commission and my own Department.

       (1) No. The former Department of Trade did not cost separately, the effects of the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) on the Australian economy and therefore, the government does not have estimates of the cost of the EEP to the Australian agricultural sector for the years 1985-86 to 1987-88. In this context I refer Senator Macklin to responses made to his Question, No. 577 and No. 654, by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.

He referred rather to the cost of the US Food Security Act, as a whole, of which the EEP is only one part. This statement was based on an internal study prepared in November 1986 by the former Department of Trade and referred to in the answer to your question No. 654.

        —The earlier answer to this question which was published in Hansard on 7 April 1989, pages 1221-1225, contained the statement that `Finance regulations do not require public tendering for services such as market research.' In fact, exemptions under Finance directions do not specifically list market research. However, it has been the practice for many years to consider market research services to be covered by Management Consultancy Services, which is specifically listed in Finance Regulation 52aa (2) as being exempt. The amended answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Office of Government Information and Advertising within my portfolio is the agency with responsibility for information coordination and advertising but does not commission opinion and/or market surveys on behalf of all Government Departments and Authorities. Departments and Authorities are responsible for commissioning their own opinion and/or market surveys.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Office, formerly the Information Coordination Branch (which was part of the Department of Administrative Services from 1982-1983, the Department of Special Minister of State from 1983-84, the Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism from 1984-1987, the Department of Administrative Services from 1987-89, and is now within the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) advises and assists departments from time to time with opinion and/or market surveys, usually associated with information campaigns.
      </para>
      <para>
       On occasions the Office has commissioned its own opinion and/or market surveys; there have been 32 such surveys commissioned since 1982. (see attached table).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) See attached table.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (b) See attached table.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (c) See attached table. The number of agencies invited to submit proposals is provided, but not the names and tender prices of the unsuccessful agencies, for reasons of commercial confidence.
      </para>
      <para>
       Research companies are generally selected on the basis of competitive submissions from a short list of consultants whose specialised expertise and suitability for the assignment is known to the Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has been the practice for many years to consider market research services to be covered by the exemption given for Management Consultancy Services, which is specifically listed in Finance Regulation 52aa (2) as being exempt.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) Details of sample size for each survey are available in the reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (b) (i) and (ii) Details of the number of group discussions held and the number of participants in each survey are generally available in the reports but it is not a requirement for consultants to divulge the exact number of participants in each group discussion.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (b) (iii) The names of the participants in group discussions in the surveys are not available for reasons of personal privacy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) No. Actual questionnaires are considered to be commercial in confidence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (b) It is likely that some questions were asked not related to the subject of quantitative surveys to provide demographic data (such as age, marital status, income, education, etc.) to ensure that samples were statistically representative.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Yes. I will send copies to the Honourable Senator.
      </para>

As a result of those allegations the SIU has opened a total of 564 investigative files as at 10/4/89 relating to individual persons, of which 275 remain in various stages of investigation, 211 having been suspended and a further 78 which relate to deceased persons. It is anticipated that as a result of a review shortly to be conducted by the Director of the SIU, Mr R. F. Greenwood QC, a significant further number of investigations will be suspended.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The majority of containers holding Bulka-bags of Monazite are stowed on cellular container ships using shore portainer cranes. A small number are stowed on roll on-roll off ships using fork lift trucks.
      </para>
      <para>
       Containers may be stowed on or under deck segregated from accommodation, regularly occupied working spaces and certain other classes of dangerous goods.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Radiation dose rates up to 22 micro Gray per hour have been measured at one metre from a container.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Fremantle Terminals Ltd, and the Fremantle Port Authority are involved in loading consignments of containerised Monazite. Measurements of the cargo are taken by Radiation Safety Officers of these organisations using radiation survey meters.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No. Waterside workers engaged in loading Monazite consignments have been monitored in the past. The methods employed have included the use of film badges, radiation survey meters and integrating electronic dose meters. In all cases the radiation doses received by individuals were within the limits of the Federal Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No. I am advised that harbour personnel and ships' crews would not receive sufficient radiation from Monazite and Xenotime cargoes for them to be subject to the provisions of State legislation requiring regular medical examinations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No. The Regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency do not require radon and thoron gas levels to be monitored and recorded.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) With regard to harbour personnel in Western Australia the appropriate regulations in connection with radiation exposure are those made under the WA Radiation Safety Act. This is a matter which comes under State jurisdiction. With regard to ships' crews the appropriate regulations are the International Atomic Energy Agency's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive materials. These regulations are implemented through the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code and Marine Orders Part 41 (Cargo and Cargo Handling-Dangerous Goods).
