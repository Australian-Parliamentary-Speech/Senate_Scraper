It was certainly the longest, frankest, most productive and, I think, most encouraging talk I have had on that subject—and I have had many of them over the years—with representatives of the Thai government.

         The situation essentially is this: if we look back at the history of this, during the period of the Vietnamese occupancy of Cambodia from 1978 to 1989 there was unequivocal and openly acknowledged Thai government and military support for the Khmer Rouge, as indeed there was for other elements of the anti-Hun Sen government resistance. Following the installation of the Chatichai government in 1989 and the withdrawal of the Vietnamese, that support took a less overt military form but was more than amply compensated by a huge amount of business activity, not least so far as the logging and gem industries were concerned, with results with which we are all too unhappily familiar.

         When the Chuan government came into office in 1992, and in the context of the UN operation—by that stage, of course, in full swing—there was a stated determination on the part of the Chuan government to sever those linkages which had traditionally existed, and a number of steps were taken, including consolidation of bans on arms trades, on logs, on gems, and a stated intention to be more effective in limiting that access.

         The problem was that for a very long period, despite the excellent intentions of the Chuan government, it has to be said, there were many elements within Thailand that were still offering forms of assistance, nowhere more conspicuously so as recently as just a few months ago, in April-May this year, when—in the context of the abortive Cambodian military operations at Pailin and Anlong Veng—overt support of a major kind was given to Khmer Rouge forces, enabling them to regroup and remount an assault.

         There were other bits and pieces of evidence around, not all of which can be readily disclosed on the public record, which suggested that certainly as recently as four or five months ago this sort of support was occurring. I probably did not give sufficient weight—and I acknowledge this, as I did in the light of my discussion with Minister Thaksin—to the new determination which came over Thai policy really from June and particularly from July this year at the time the Cambodian government actually formally outlawed the Khmer Rouge. That gave the Thai government a new piece of weaponry in dealing with difficult elements in its own system. It has been much more forthcoming in terms of its activity now on the border. And Minister Thaksin, as one element in our conversation, announced after my discussion that he would escort or make available access by our ambassadors and other representatives from interested missions to go down there on the border now, which is something which has not previously happened, and see for themselves the scope and scale of the activity now being mounted to try to deal with this sort of border activity.

         I was given a number of other assurances relating to movement of personnel as well as movement of goods and money and, generally speaking, it was a very satisfactory conversation—certainly, as I began by saying, the best I have had on this subject and really quite encouraging. Under those circumstances and in order to help defuse what had become a difficult problem in bilateral terms and in domestic-political terms in Thailand, I was ready and willing to concede the point that perhaps I had been a little unfair in speaking as much as I did in the present tense given the changes that have occurred, manifestly, since July.

But, really, we are interested in the basis upon which he made statements last week that were highly critical of Thailand, and his need, to the embarrassment of Australia—which is what is of concern—to withdraw those statements, acknowledging that perhaps he had spoken too strongly. What is the factual situation then, particularly when out of the country the minister said he could not give the sources of his information because it was intelligence-based? Now, apparently, he is saying he was out of touch. What exactly is the level of support being given by Thai military personnel to the Khmer Rouge?

         Australia was very active at the meeting and achieved some notable successes, which I would like to outline to the Senate. Australia played a leading role in suggesting ways to mitigate the incidental mortality of sea birds from fishing and took a strong stand on the need for major reductions in such mortality. This had a major effect on the design of conservation measures adopted by the commission for several fisheries and established precedence relevant to other fisheries forums.

         An Australian proposal to improve the procedure for notifying commission members of the results of inspections of fishing vessels, including any alleged infractions of commission conservation measures being committed, was accepted. This will greatly improve the speed with which members are given this information and allow earlier consideration of any ramifications of the alleged infractions and the need for further actions.

         Australia has submitted and gained acceptance for fisheries research data, gathered over three years, for the commission area that includes the Australian territory of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands. This is the first time that a party to the convention has produced the research data necessary for fisheries management before a fishery has commenced and our approach, I might say, was widely applauded. A proposal submitted by Australia seeking to increase the transparency of the procedure used to invite all types of observers—intergovernmental, non-governmental and state—was adopted by the commission. Australia also sought an end to the opposition by some commission members to environmental NGO participation at all commission forums and the placing of restrictions on those NGOs. Unconditional access was secured for environmental NGOs to the commission's scientific committee.

         Australia also secured improved compliance with fisheries management measures. Australia made a presentation on the use of satellite transponders on fishing vessels to allow checking of vessels' positions from a land based monitoring centre, thus improving compliance with management measures. The commission has agreed in principle to the use of such a monitoring system in future in some fisheries, and a design of systems similar to those used in Australia will be submitted for consideration at the next meeting.

         Important advances were also made in the development of assessment methods which take uncertainty into account in determining precautionary catch limits for fish and krill. These advances also resulted from work done by Australian scientists. I think these outcomes of the meeting are significant achievements for environmental protection in all of Antarctica and are further proof of Australia's effectiveness in working within international forums in protection of the environment.

The Prime Minister has consistently stressed the urgent need for a national electricity grid in order to get competitive power prices to businesses around the country. Last Thursday the minister poured cold water on the grid proposal and claimed that `lower electricity prices could well result in greater energy consumption'. Were these remarks simply driven by the minister's insatiable appetite for personal grandstanding and a desperate need to pander to environmental extremists, irrespective of the consequences for business, or did the minister's remarks have the endorsement of the Prime Minister and cabinet? Does the minister support a national electricity grid and cheaper electricity prices for Australian industry?

         Senator O'Chee ignores the tragic reality that, while the great majority of parents fulfil their obligations, there are some cases of children and young people coming from places where they are physically or sexually abused. Senator O'Chee told the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Townsville Bulletin

         that the young homeless allowance was splitting families in the small town of Ravenshoe and said, `In the past year I have realised the problem is getting worse.' The Senate will be interested to hear that the number of recipients of the young homeless allowance in that town has rocketed in the past year from zero to one! I do not know how Senator O'Chee can make a case on those sorts of figures.

         I can assure Australian families that, contrary to the very misleading and, I think, damaging remarks by Senator O'Chee, exactly the opposite is happening: children cannot walk into Social Security and pick up the young homeless allowance. The facts are that, before any payment of the allowance can be made, the claim must be verified. In a majority of cases, this means that parents are contacted. Where this is inappropriate because of the nature of the child's problems, the claims must still be verified, often with teachers, child protection officers, family, clergy or the like.

         Also, under protocol arrangements in place with the states, the Department of Social Security refers state wards and young people who are homeless or at risk to the relevant state or territory department for an assessment of their circumstances and determination of the appropriate care and support arrangements. Parents are also able to provide information to the department at any time. This information must be taken into account when deciding whether to pay or continue to pay the allowance.

         If those opposite want to be taken seriously, I think it is important that they tell the facts about the young homeless allowance, not their preferred version of scaremongering and anxiety. If Senator O'Chee knows any examples that are contrary to that, he should let me or Mr Baldwin and the department know. But what Senator O'Chee has said is absolutely wrong. It is mischievous and only creates anxiety in the community.

         —There was some rioting in East Timor over the weekend. It was essentially of an ethnic character, triggered by an incident in which an East Timorese man was killed by a trader from elsewhere in Indonesia, from Sulawesi, and that generated an explosive reaction from East Timorese locals. A number of civilians and businesses were subsequently attacked and it did turn into a fairly substantial riot, but not on the scale that was originally reported of 1,000 or more people being involved. The figure was, we were subsequently told, rather less than that—not much more than about 100 people being actively involved in the riot.

There have been, however, a number of people arrested in the context of the subsequent rioting. The local police chief says that 72 people have been arrested and will face criminal charges. That is not yet a more thoroughly confirmed figure.

         —Do you want to get it again, Elmer? Let me just simply say this: I am satisfied that the question of political autonomy is very much still on the agenda of the Indonesian government. They perceive the validity of the arguments that are being made in this respect, and there is a serious move to achieve a major troop drawdown sometime during 1995. We had all hoped that it might be rather sooner than that. It looks like it is going to flow through into next year. But I am hopeful that some significant action of this kind will take place, because the Indonesian government realises that the problem is an intractable one; it is not going to go away unless some efforts of reconciliation of this kind have occurred.

         —Bishop Belo is a very important figure in East Timor and his views certainly ought to be taken very seriously, but they do not necessarily represent the be all and end all and do not necessarily represent a practically workable solution. For example, Bishop Belo has recently gone on record as opposing the establishment of an Australian consulate in Dili, yet we have been asked on innumerable occasions by East Timorese representatives in Australia and many other members of the NGO community to press for that as an important and helpful step forward. So there are questions of judgment involved in this and I think we just have to pick our way through that rather than assuming that the words of any one leader or senior figure are necessarily decisive.

         The self-determination that Australia talks about and wants to encourage is self-determination within the framework of Indonesian sovereignty.

         Self-determination in that context, and in the way in which that expression is being used a lot internationally these days, does mean genuine respect for different ethnicity and genuine respect for human rights claims of particular groups within larger national or state entities. That is the kind of thing we are talking about. In that context, some kind of special political autonomy or special status—of the kind, for example, that exists in Jogjakarta or Aceh—might be thought to be helpful in that larger process of reconciliation. It is not by itself enough to solve the whole problem but it is at least part of the answer. The other elements of the answer are those I have described, in particular the military drawdown as well as other measures being taken to respect local, religious and cultural sensitivities to a greater extent than has been the case so far.

I point out that, during the last year, as many people were killed there as in East Timor. Does the minister feel that the granting of special status will assist in eliminating or reducing the killings, tortures and human rights abuses—I know he mentioned the military drawdown as well—in East Timor?

I am perfectly well aware that Aceh has been an occasion for a lot of unhappiness and human rights abuse in its own terms, not so much recently in the last year but certainly for some time before that. Nobody suggests that there are any solutions to this which are simple.

         But Australia's motivation in this is not as Senator Margetts describes. We are, and always have been, absolutely sincere in our endeavours to do the best we possibly can for the East Timorese people. We believe the best way of doing that is within the context of a broad-based, multi-dimensional relationship in which what we say is taken seriously and not just dismissed as howls of outrage from those who are ignorant and not being especially helpful.

Will he also concede that the Australian people will continue to pay the price for this dishonesty in the form of continuing high interest rates?

         report of the Access Economics analysis. Apparently Senator Gibson has not read the closing paragraphs of this report, which say that Access Economics came to a prediction for economic growth in the out years of this current budget which is below that of the budget itself and, might I say, looking at the whole level of private sector predictions for budget growth, below that of what the private sector analysts would have as being the out years of budget growth. The reason that Access Economics has come to the conclusion that it does is, in my view, that it has underestimated the growth and strength in the Australian economy. As a consequence, it has come to a hole in the budget that does not exist. It has done that for the out years.

         The economy at the present time is growing strongly. Budget predictions were for a 4.3 per cent growth over this budgetary year. Private sector analysts now have the level of economic growth up around 5.5 per cent. There is nothing on the screen that would cause us in government to review—certainly not to review downwards—the level of economic growth that we expect for the out years in the budget. Therefore, we do not accept that the illusory hole, predicted to exist based on the estimates that Access Economics has come up with—which appear to be unsupported by other forecasting agencies—exists. As a consequence of not accepting its view of economic life, nor do we accept the implication in the question that Senator Gibson has put—that there is a bigger hole that we will somehow be struggling to fill.

         The projections for the 1994 budget estimated the deficit for 1996-97 at O.9 per cent of GDP, with the budget to approach balance by 1997-98. This would be achieved by expenditure restraint in non-priority areas, causing outlays to fall as a percentage of GDP over the forward estimates periods; lower unemployment, reducing pressure on social security outlays; and projected growth in taxation revenue of 7.4 per cent in real terms in 1994-95 and 6.9 per cent in 1995-96, largely due to being driven up by higher growth in the economy.

         As I have said, Access Economics has forecast higher deficits in the out years, lower economic growth than forecast by the government at budget time, and higher public debt interest costs as a result of higher interest rates. Post-budget developments do not suggest that the deficit projections announced in the 1994-95 budget need to be revised upwards. Higher interest rates will certainly increase public debt interest costs, but faster employment growth since the budget will result in a lower than forecast expenditure on unemployment benefits.

         The growth forecasts for 1994-95 and later years which appear in the budget remain on track. GDP was forecast to grow by 4 1/2 per cent in 1994-95, slowing to a growth rate of 4 1/4 per cent in 1995-96 and four per cent in 1996-97 and 1997-98. While the composition of growth in the 1994-95 period is likely to differ from that of the forecast at budget time, with a weaker farm sector and a stronger non-farm sector, overall developments since the budget suggest that the 4 1/2 per cent figure is achievable. As a consequence, it is interesting to see what Access Economics has written, but the government does not accept its viewpoint.

There is little doubt that economic growth is strong and is continuing, with solid gains in production, sales, productivity, exports and, importantly, jobs across the board. While this must be welcomed, except by the negative people opposite, it has been evident in the past that many small to medium size firms are constrained during periods of growth by lack of patient development capital to fund their growth, yet the performance of these small but potentially high growth firms is crucial to the strength and sustainability of economic growth. Can the minister assure the Senate that the right policy settings are in place to encourage financial markets to direct capital to this vital part of the business sector?

         The government is always looking for opportunities to improve the economic settings. One of the key drivers of economic growth is the availability of capital, and within that broad ambit is the availability of patient capital—patient capital for small to medium size businesses; patient capital that can be invested over a long period and where there may be a high risk but the potential of high return on that investment.

         One of the approaches the government has adopted from a public policy point of view to improve the availability of patient capital for small to medium size businesses was set out in the One Nation statement in 1992, and that is for the establishment of pool development funds—funds which provide a lower tax level than otherwise obtains, but for money raised from the private sector for on-lending to small to medium size businesses. In the Working Nation white paper this year we reduced the tax level on pool development funds from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in order to attract more private sector funding to small to medium size businesses in Australia and to provide a decent pool of patient capital for that sector of the economy.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Since we announced those changes, the number of pool development funds has almost doubled, from 10 to 19, and the amount of extra capital attracted into the economy to the end of June 1994—a very short time horizon between announcement and outcome in this case—was $35 million. We raised an extra $35 million for investment in small to medium size companies. But importantly, by the end of this year, pool development funds expect to raise $140 million in patient capital, the capital for small to medium size enterprises which will be in the market as a result of the settings we have now put into place for pool development funds.

         I understand that existing pool development funds are planning to raise up to $340 million—that is, an extra $340 million—in the longer term. By any measure this is a valuable contribution to the pool of capital available for the small to medium size companies which are, of course, the main engine of economic growth and future employment prospects for most Australians.

         In the discussions that took place, and as a result of those discussions, the suggestion from Australia that we host the next meeting was unanimously accepted by all member countries of APEC. This will be the first fully fledged meeting of APEC ministers in Australia since one of the original meetings was held here three years ago. I think the fact that we were able to secure the next ministerial meeting recognises that Australia is at the forefront of innovative policies for small and medium size enterprises.

         I pay tribute to the success of the organisation involved in the meeting and the agenda prepared by our Japanese hosts. From the discussions that took place amongst ministers, it can be said that most of the issues raised by small and medium size enterprises in Australia are similar to those in most of the member countries of APEC—issues dealing with the availability of finance for small business, technology transfer, the introduction of best practice, and, above all else, the desire of all countries to encourage their SMEs to become export oriented wherever possible.

         The other feature of the conference that we will certainly want to build on next year in Australia when we host the conference relates to several sessions when representatives of small and medium size enterprises from the various APEC countries participated in direct discussion with ministers in an open forum to exchange ideas. This proved very successful. For the conference here next year we are looking at arranging for a greater representation of practising SMEs to hold meetings, to hold discussions, to build up their own networks amongst APEC countries and, as well, to have the interaction with ministers about what are the issues for SMEs within the APEC region.

As the ombudsman for telecommunications is not selected by government, not appointed by government and not paid by government, was the minister just ignorant of the facts or did he just mislead the Senate to cover the 50-odd jobs for the boys that this government has put in place?

         The government is trying to strike a reasonable balance in this very problematic area. It is not assisted by false and wild claims like Senator O'Chee's that we are breaking down families deliberately and expressly. If we were not paying the young homeless allowance, opposition senators no doubt would be demanding more assistance. As I said, I assure honourable senators that I will pass on to the minister any examples of real cases that people can bring to my attention and I will see that they are checked out. But the government's policy, which I understand is what is implemented, and which I know to be implemented, does not conform with what Senator O'Chee proposes.

        I appreciate that when legal proceedings are afoot, the government is somewhat limited in what it can do. But the point I am making is that there is some concern that in Mr Bowra's case he has not been dealt with in accordance with the laws of the United Arab Emirates, in so far as he might well have been treated differently from a national of that country. It is to this end that I am seeking a personal assurance from Senator Evans to make sure that Mr Bowra is dealt with according to the laws of that country.

         Mr Bowra was incarcerated on 5 August this year. A subsequent court order was in his favour—that is, the court ordered his release, but he was not released. Yesterday, he was sentenced whilst not being present. The judgment, which was given in Arabic, was not readily understandable by supporters of Mr Bowra who were there. I understand that his lawyer is to decipher the judgment and analyse it with a view to seeing what action can be taken.

         Nonetheless, this has caused a great deal of distress to Mr Bowra's family. It is a situation which involved a most unfortunate accident which, from all accounts, seems not to have been the fault of Mr Bowra. He took correct evasive action, according to international maritime codes, in relation to the handling of his boat. I again ask Senator Evans to take a personal interest in this matter and deal with it at the highest level.

         I will run through the exact situation. I said that the situation is unique. At present Warwick Smith is CEO of Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Ltd, a company limited by guarantee and of which there is a board. The board provides funds to the company for the complaint services funded by Telecom, Optus and Vodafone. The structure is a council made up of consumer community representatives and industry  representatives and a board of the funding organisation—as I have already told honourable senators, Telecom, Optus and Vodafone.

         The council is the supreme policy making board, therefore not run by industry. The council contracted KPMG to run a nationwide search for a CEO. Warwick Smith was selected from 120 applicants for the position of ombudsman for a period of two years and has a contract with the board. He acts as CEO of the company, which reports by way of annual report and quarterly forums to the community. All staff are contracted to Mr Smith as CEO of the company. I repeat: he is not a government employee. With all that I have read out, I cannot see how, on 30 August, in his answer to Senator Hill's question, that the minister could name Mr Smith as a government appointment in defence of the jobs for the boys situation.

        In so doing, I think it is pertinent to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that this is the Year of the Family, and yet the Department of Family Services persists unabated in giving the young homeless allowance to many young children who are certainly not in desperate need, who are certainly not being sexually or psychologically abused by their parents. It is a fact that this payment is causing widespread concern in the community, certainly no less so in Far North Queensland.

         In answer to a dorothy dixer, Senator Crowley tried to tell the Senate that I was scaring parents about the young homeless allowance. The young homeless allowance has been raised with me so many times this year that I have lost count. However, it is very clear that parents, headmasters and guidance officers at schools not just in Far North Queensland but right around this country are absolutely and thoroughly disgusted with the way in which this allowance is being handed out because, although Senator Crowley would have the Senate believe that there are all sorts of checks and balances on who is entitled to receive the allowance, the truth is definitely contrary to that point of view.

          Yes, that is true. But what sort of verification do students need before they can qualify for the young homeless allowance? That is the question I asked the Senate.

         So what did the child do? The child left the office and went shopping for other people to support the application for the young homeless allowance. It sufficed in this particular case that the child in question got a letter from the next door neighbour who said yes, he had heard arguments in the house next door over the weekend. What house in this country with a teenage son or daughter does not have arguments on the weekend? It is in the nature of being a teenager to argue with your parents.

         But the fact that a next door neighbour heard an argument next door does not mean that the child is being sexually abused and it does not mean that the child is being psychologically abused. It means that the child is having an argument with its parents. If that is sufficient to qualify for the young homeless allowance, then I am very concerned. It is not just me; thousands and thousands of parents around this country are very concerned as well. It is well known at schools in Australia today that all that children have to do is rock up with a story and within 24 hours they can be on the allowance.

         One guidance officer from near Mackay told me that she knows of a case where a young girl went on the young homeless allowance at age 14 or 15, is now a drug addict and is now a prostitute—for the simple reason that the money at first sight seems a lot of money until they have to pay a few bills, until they have to pay for the unplanned expenses, and all of a sudden the money is not enough. That leads the children to petty crime, and in this poor girl's case it led her to drugs and prostitution. That is what the young homeless allowance is doing. In many cases—

         —This is a re-run, Senator O'Chee. I am very pleased to take the opportunity in the few minutes provided to me here to suggest that Senator O'Chee is getting carried away. To suggest that the young homeless allowance is responsible for leading women to prostitution or to becoming drug addicts is an absolute scandal. What is Senator O'Chee's thesis? His thesis is that he wants to kick heads, really, I think. He actually goes a long way to stirring up and aggravating this confusion in the community about the young homeless allowance and whether or not teenagers can rock up—thousands of them, to quote Senator O'Chee in another scandalous piece of misinformation—to guidance officers. As I said to Senator O'Chee during my answer in question time, only 300 people under the age of 15 are on this young homeless allowance, and 1,400 people aged 15. That comes to 1,700 people, hardly Senator O'Chee's thousands of people rushing around this country.

         We can check out the examples that Senator O'Chee gave, if he wants to be serious about it. If a child lines up on Monday to say to a guidance officer, `Will you say that I have had a rough time at the weekend over home?', the guidance officer says no and so the child looks for some other kind of support for the story—if that is all the evidence that is forthcoming, I would like to know a little more detail about it because any proper examination would find just what he said is the case: that arguments over the weekend are not unusual.

         We do not need teenagers to have good arguments. And there can be arguments from Monday through to Friday too, but there may not be a neighbour at home to hear it so easily. Of course arguments happen but they would never be seen as sufficient justification for a child to walk out.

         If Senator O'Chee wanted to say that getting the balance right is a very difficult matter I would take him very seriously. It is a very difficult matter and that is why the Department of Social Security has been concerned with this matter. I might say to Senator O'Chee that the social security department is not my department. I represent it here, and am very pleased and proud to do that, but he needs to be sure it is a social security department matter that we are talking about.

         That department has listened over the years to evidence raised in estimates hearings. I well remember a very constructive meeting when the then Senator Walters, the then Senator Peter Baume, the then Senator Richardson and I discussed across the table the fact that families could not be reassured by the Department of Social Security that their children were okay because there was the matter of protecting the children's privacy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The department has examined the protocols and made absolutely sure that it has made them as tight and serious as it can. I think that, importantly, it has got the balance right in making sure that the children who are in need of support and protection are provided with it and that, at the same time, children who are having a spat with the family are not encouraged to take the first dollar and go. It is much more constructive—that is why I stand by my earlier comments—to find the facts and talk about them instead of whipping up a frenzy.

         If the case Senator O'Chee raises has any substance and if he would like to bring it to the department, I will certainly see that the protocols are examined and, if anything further can be said about such a case, it will be followed up. I have no doubt about that at all. But to suggest that the young homeless allowance is leading to prostitution and drug addiction is a pretty wild and, I think, mischievous claim. It is not helpful to parents who might have a concern about what is best for their children and how they can be assisted in caring for them, particularly disputatious teenagers.

         It is also very concerning for government to know that there are children whose families do not provide them with protection, support, love or constructive arguments and which are a hazard to their children's wellbeing. The state department and the Commonwealth, through the Department of Social Security and this payment, need to assist those children and offer other support mechanisms to provide care for the children.

         It would be much better for Senator O'Chee to write back to the headmaster and tell him the facts of this matter, or pass the letter to me and I will seek an answer on it, rather than for him to go around saying, `Even he says we are inflaming passions.' That is not what he said. He said, `It is a matter of concern.' Indeed, if it is a matter of concern, let us sort it out instead of inflaming things.

         —I was listening to the debate between Senator O'Chee and Senator Crowley. Just for the record, over the last two years there have been five cases—three of which I dealt with personally—where parents, one of which was from Launceston, have contacted my office, saying that their children had been enticed away by other young homeless people because of the extra money they were getting. Those cases were settled and it was proved to be right that young people who were street smart were enticing other youth out of their homes on trumped up charges. I can get the details of these cases for Senator Crowley. They happened last year. I know that Senator Newman has knowledge of dozens of other cases.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Chris Evans this day, relating to the National Environment Protection Council.

        In Senator Faulkner's answer, which related to my home state of Western Australia, he criticised the Western Australian government for not joining with other states in relation to the National Environment Protection Council. I wish to point out to the Senate that when that body was first thought of there was a lot of enthusiasm and optimism because it was thought that environmental laws should be uniform. However, as the states began to examine the matter more closely, it soon became readily apparent that, with Australia being the vast country that it is, the states have differing needs in relation to the environment and that the states' different geography and requirements had to be taken into consideration.

         —Senator Faulkner recognised these different requirements. He said that the legislation would allow for different regions and states to have their needs taken into account. I believe the Western Australian point of view is that, if we do not need the NEPC, why join it? The Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, was the previous mechanism for achieving consistency throughout Australia—and that answers Senator Kernot's question. A mechanism is already in place for consistency throughout Australia, and that is ANZECC.

         I would venture to say that the Western Australian view is that that body is able to do a good enough job without our having to have uniform laws across the country. This in turn says that we have to take each state's situation into account. Why have that legislation when it is not needed? It really goes to the efficiency of government and why we should make a law when it is not really needed.

         This is not a case of the state being obstinate and it is not about saying that this body is, in a ideological sense, something which is wrong or bad. It is more the practical argument that this body is not taking us any further and that ANZECC is a much more practical solution to the issue at hand. Therefore, I think Senator Faulkner's criticism of the Western Australian government is quite unjustified. We can argue this issue on ideological grounds as well, but Senator Faulkner was saying that the Western Australian government was acting entirely on ideological grounds and that it was throwing out something of use in favour of an ideological stance. That is simply not the case.

         Recently there has been a compensation query in relation to the noise levels at Sydney airport. I wonder whether the minister has looked at whether this will have universal application across Australia in relation to airports. The situation in Sydney could well be different from that of, say, an airport at Broome, Western Australia. Does the minister, by his NEPC, envisage setting uniform requirements for compensation payouts? I bet that will be a pertinent question—one which might liven up the minister somewhat when we start talking about uniform compensation. Having regard to the government money which could be at stake, that is something about which the government would no doubt be most concerned.

         —To remind honourable senators, we are dealing with the proposed amendment to section 191N(6) which refers to the tabling of the national indigenous land strategy in the parliament, allows for it to be disallowed and provides that whilst that period waiting for the disallowance is in train nothing can be done in relation to that strategy.

         Senator Campbell aptly summed up the position of the coalition on this point. Subsections (8) and (9) are proposed because one really does not get very far when one simply tables the strategy in the parliament without having some consequential action on it. If accepted, the people who are affected by this strategy would have some form of redress via their elected representatives, senators or members of parliament, to have it disallowed if necessary.

         It would have to be a very serious matter indeed to have a majority disallowing the strategy; we fully appreciate that. One would not envisage a national strategy being disallowed, but the proposed amendment is there in case the strategy goes against the majority of thinking in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. If the feeling is that this strategy has missed the boat, there is an avenue of action that can be pursued.

         I understand that some other senators find proposed subsection (7)—that is, the tabling of the strategy—to be not such a bad idea. It does place it under some sort of purview. I do not think the government takes much issue with this proposed subsection either. A great deal of legislation has strategies and regulations which can be disallowable instruments, but the first thing is for it to come under the purview of parliament. We are proposing to take it that step further by making it a disallowable instrument in accordance with the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.

         It is not as though we are trying to hold up the implementation of the strategy; this is designed to give a second chance for comment by those who are intended to be the beneficiaries of this national strategy. And if we have that, it naturally follows that we have subsection (9)—that nothing should be acted upon something which could be disallowed. I do not think that in the normal course of events the delay would be that great. It is conceded that there is a possibility that there could be some delay if there were a break in time, such as over the Christmas break or the winter break. In the normal course of events that would not happen but I take that argument on board. That is the reason the coalition has inserted proposed subsection (9).

         —The Greens have already put on the record that we are not intending to support proposed subsections (8) and (9) of opposition amendment No. 20. However, I did defend the opposition from some criticism that I felt it was getting, undeservedly, for even contemplating a disallowance capacity in regard to the tabling of the strategy. By that I did not mean to raise Senator Campbell's hopes. Had he given me a moment to speak on the last occasion we were considering the bill, I would have laid his hopes to rest. The Greens are not intending to support proposed subsections (8) and (9).

         Once again I state quite clearly that because we feel that the ILC is very close to being a government body, even though it has the capacity to appoint five Aboriginal people of the seven people to be on that board, it is still too much of a government body for our liking. Because it is like a government body, it is appropriate for it to table its strategy and it is appropriate in some situations that that be considered a disallowable submission to the parliament.

         The Greens do not support this amendment because with every amendment we have been trying to move the ILC away from being a government body so as to be more in line with Aboriginal people in the community. So we see supporting this amendment as actually reinforcing what we believe to be undesirable—that it should be a government board that is quite appropriately able to have its strategy disallowed or made a disallowable document.

         Secondly, even were we to give in on that point, we oppose the amendment because we do not believe that the parliament in its current imperfect form reflects the views of Aboriginal people in the community. Whether the parliament will ever do so is a debatable point. So our feeling is that the amendment would not allow more Aboriginal people to have access through the parliamentary system unless we radically altered our party political basis for decision making. That is the other reason we remain unconvinced.

         As we have said, we are happy to support the tabling of the national strategy document as a public information, on-the-record kind of measure that is very useful. We note that the government has already said that there are several parts of the bill that allow that to be widely disseminated on request, and that is commendable. Therefore, we do not feel it necessary to support the second and third parts of this proposed amendment.

         —No, I did not. Senator Chamarette and I have shared planes all around Australia as members of the native title committee. However, I do understand her concern—the Greens (WA) do want to try to make the ILC as independent as possible. I have thought of an example, which may not be a good example but it is the best I can do at the moment. I have in mind something like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank—the Commonwealth Bank pre-privatisation, anyway—which have a requirement that their reports be tabled in the parliament. Since I have been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration the committee has called members of the board of the Commonwealth Bank before it and cross-examined them about their report. So even organisations as remote now as they are from the Commonwealth in terms of management and decision making can still be subject to public scrutiny.

         The point that Senator Ellison makes is a good one: if the ILC comes down with a national strategy which does not reflect the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people, there is still no mechanism for Aboriginal people to have any effective control over or leverage against the ILC board. So I appeal to Senator Chamarette not to regard parliamentary scrutiny as some form of government intrusion into the ILC. Although the ILC is being made more dependent upon the Australian parliament, this is a way of actually making it less dependent upon the executive. I am appealing on the grounds that the parliament is not the executive, as Senator Chamarette knows better than most. The powers of the Commonwealth parliament, which are quite unique, can be used to make the ILC more independent from government. That is the basis of our appeal not just to support subsection (7) but also to support subsection (8). This would ensure that not only would the document be required to be tabled but also this parliament would be given the power to disallow it.

         The effect of disallowing it is basically to say, `Look, you've done the consultation that the parliament has imposed upon you. You've gone out and spoken to people.' I am reminded that Minister Tickner in particular and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have told this parliament that the government has gone through the widest consultation in the history of Australia in relation to this bill. Senator Chamarette has been told that; I have been told that. Those of us who have taken an interest in this bill know that that is not the case. The government has spoken to whom it wants to speak and heard what it wants to hear.

         We are saying that, even with the consultative provisions that we have put into this bill with the support of the committee—the fact that the board must now consult with Aboriginal groups and not just the ATSIC regional commission—it is still quite possible that the board would come up with a national strategy which did not reflect the hopes, aspirations and views of the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Island people that it seeks to serve. Through this mechanism—that is, requiring the strategy to be tabled and then giving the parliament the power to disallow—the real people that are being empowered are the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Island people and more scrutiny is being put on the ILC board.

         As Senator Harradine pointed out last Thursday, the fact of the matter is that the board is a government creation—the minister does have that power. We are saying that here is a nice effective check to enable Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people to say to the board, `You'd better listen to our views. Don't just consult with us but listen to us because if you don't and your national strategy doesn't reflect our views then we can go to people like Senator Chamarette, Senator Ellison, Senator Kernot and Senator Gareth Evans even and say we don't like this strategy. If you're not listening to our views then we'll ask people like Senator Chamarette, Senator Campbell or Senator Collins to disallow it.' That makes the board accountable to the people, actually reduces the links between the government and puts more power in the hands of the people. That is the effect of the amendment. So I would make one final plea for Senator Chamarette to reconsider her position on the second section of coalition amendment No. 20.

        The series D amendments that the Greens are putting relate to the Indigenous Land Corporation's capacity to own and control the land fund. We will not be putting our amendment D2, which relates to the splitting of the money between the ILC and ATSIC. We are doing that because we have not been successful in omitting section 191U, where the requirement in the legislation is that none of the ILC fund can be used under the Northern Territory land rights act. It is still within the bill, and on that basis we can see why the Northern Territory, at least, would be very anxious regarding the failure to maintain the split between the $21 million going to ATSIC and the $21 million going through the ILC.

         These amendments are to proposed section 192W and consequently omit a series: 193A, 193B, 193C, et cetera. Under the bill, the land fund is a trust account within the Commonwealth public account. As such, the fund is owned and controlled by the Commonwealth government. Investment of the money in the land fund is to be made by the Minister for Finance or his delegate within the Department of Finance or ATSIC.

         The Greens (WA) believe that the Indigenous Land Corporation should own and control the land fund in its own right. We see that the proposed structure of the land fund falls a long way short of the level of self-determination bestowed on Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory by the Fraser government in 1976 in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The New South Wales parliament passed legislation in the mid-1980s which allowed the New South Wales Land Council to manage a fund which will eventually be worth more than $500 million. That model of the New South Wales fund allowed 7 1/2 per cent of all land tax collected in the state to be available for investment and immediate funding over a 10-year period. It is a much better example of self-determination.

         The less overt reason for the land fund being kept within the public account is so that it does not affect the budget deficit. If it is within the public account, then the government never has to come up with the billion dollars—not in one year and not even after 10 years. I think that is a myth being perpetrated in the media upon the public. They have been told repeatedly that Aboriginal people stand to gain a $1.4 billion fund. I think it is time to lay that to rest, not just in the community and in the media but also in the legislation. If the $1.4 billion never leaves the public account and stays in consolidated revenue so that it never upsets in the slightest bit—except by $45 million a year—the budget deficit, then it is not a fund being given to Aboriginal people or to the ILC: it is a government fund. All that happens for the ILC is that it actually has an expropriation from that government money of $45 million a year.

         I do not think the government can win both ways. It cannot say, `We're giving $1.4 billion to Aboriginal people under this fund,' and on the other hand say, `But we're not affecting our budget deficit much at all, only by $45 million a year.' If the government is to have a $1.4 million fund, it should give it to the right people and not continue with this pretence. As we know, all that the ILC is coming up with each year is $45 million—and even $21 million of that is old money—so the budget deficit will only be affected by $24 million a year out of a total deficit that is expected to be $12 billion. So we believe very strongly that the focus of these amendments is to try to give that control and self-determination principle to the ILC so that it has got the capacity to look at the way in which the money is invested, look at the possible earnings and have a much greater say in it than is currently allowed for under the legislation.

         I will say one more thing before I open the debate up to my colleagues to comment on this factor. The government might argue—in fact, I have heard it argue—that it gives Aboriginal people certainty. I think that is true—it will. I have even heard the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, say that it will be a great shame if this bill does not pass because Aboriginal people will not then be locked into this wonderful $1.4 billion fund. I want to make it quite clear on the public record that there is a very good reason that Aboriginal people should not be locked in to an increase of $24 million a year, which is meant to meet the justice requirements of the Prime Minister's purpose for this fund, which is to redress the dispossession of all Aboriginal people or at least the 95 per cent who do not stand to gain by native title.

         I think there is a political reason for this locking in and that is that it takes the land acquisition needs of the Aboriginal community off the agenda for 10 years. So, politically, it may be high risk if it is not locked in but, on the other hand, for Aboriginal people it is an extremely high risk if it is locked in because it allows very little chance of increase. So what we get is the lowest common denominator. Why should the Aboriginal people forever be locked into the lowest common denominator of $45 million a year by this legislation?

         I think, if the amendments that we will be considering later in the `A' series are taken seriously by the government and the quantum is actually increased, the Aboriginal community could stand to gain by having something favourable locked in. But to lock in something that is $21 million a year is a disgrace. That is why these amendments seek to give the control of the money and the land fund to the ILC.

I fundamentally dispute the points that Senator Chamarette so carelessly laid before us a few moments ago about the downside of Aboriginal people being locked into this fund and about this being done purely for political purposes, as she said. There is an obvious benefit to the Aboriginal people who are the sole beneficiaries of this fund being locked into a guaranteed return on the fund; that is, in respect of all the vicissitudes of international economics that could occur in future years. We have just been through one major international recession which we are only just coming out of. That could happen at some future time.

But I think where we part company with Senator Chamarette is that she believes that $21 million to $24 million a year is worse than nothing. The Democrats believe that, while the money may be inadequate, it is not worse than nothing.

         I think we ought to consider political reality here. The fact is that this government and this opposition are both reluctant and negligent in their lack of desire to honestly discuss revenue raising for the things this country really needs to pay for in its future, and that is in respect of a whole lot of services, not just what we owe Aboriginal Australians. Given that we know that that is a political reality, I think it is very unlikely that future governments will place a high priority on a land fund. If we were to defeat this bill, I think it very unlikely that future governments would re-visit this debate. While I agree that this money is a very, very small amount to redress what is needed by way of compensation for dispossession—I do not know whether we have got enough anywhere in this country to do that—given that we are getting a 10-year appropriation, a small appropriation, I cannot agree that it is worse than nothing.

What has really been achieved in the world of political reality, which is the world of political perception, is that the government has created in the minds of people and Aboriginal people a $1.4 billion fund. I congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, for the deception they have created in the minds of the people of Australia. When we go out into the communities—we sometimes get let loose on the weekends, or when the bells ring on Thursdays and we get let out for a few hours—and talk to real people, the perception is that this land fund is a $1.4 billion fund. So I congratulate Mr Tickner and Mr Keating for being politicians in the worst sense of the word, for being Goebbellian politicians, because they have achieved something incredible—they have achieved the perception in the Australian community that there is a $1.4 billion land fund.

         There are two reasons why that perception is unfair. Firstly, for those people in the community who believe that Aboriginals get too much already, that the money is wasted, and who say, `Why should we give Aboriginals something that white people can't get,' of course, it is a good can to kick. For redneck people who want to kick the Aboriginal can, it gives them a nasty, almost racist can to kick. Secondly, for the Aboriginal people and those who care about trying to do something to redress both their dispossession and their disadvantage, it is a hoax because, as has been pointed out by Senator Chamarette and Senator Kernot in two different ways, what this bill effectively does is to appropriate $24 million a year. It does not appropriate $45 million; it appropriates $24 million. As I have pointed out on a couple of occasions, that is roughly—

         The reality, from the coalition's point of view, is that we have looked very carefully and long and hard at this concept of keeping it inside the public account or putting it outside the public account. We remain unconvinced that taking it outside the public account will help Aboriginal people. I think that is the point that Senator Collins has made. At the moment this bill assures for the next 10 years an appropriation in the terms that I have mentioned. We therefore remain unconvinced that the scheme that is outlined in the D series of the Green amendments will achieve any more.

         The coalition has publicly recorded that the concept of the land fund is supported and the appropriation level is supported, and that is to give a commitment into the future. So no scaremongering can occur during the election campaign by saying that the coalition will abandon the land fund. That is on the record. The coalition will be committed to it. We have said, as has been widely reported, that we have some preconditions, but I must say for the record that many of our amendments have received government and even Democrat support—I should not say that; I should say that they have received unanimous support. I place that on the record. When many of the amendments were put in the House of Representatives, the opposition was told that they would not be supported.

I think I may have strayed a little in getting on to the amount because basically the aim of amendment D1 is that `the land fund is a fund under the control and management of the Indigenous Land Corporation'; is to be kept `separate and distinct from any other account, recording payments into and out of the fund'; and `so far as practicable, money in the land fund that is not required for the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation must be invested, but may not be invested other than in the manner for the time being authorised by an act or a state or territory act for the investment of trust funds.'

         While I do think it is an interaction effect with the paltry amount of money, the major point of these amendments is that the money is essentially not in the control of the ILC. So it is a structural amendment that asks why they should not have the right to determine the investment and the capacity of that fund. The models that we feel are superior to that are those put in place in 1976 in the Northern Territory, where there is an advisory committee for the trust account that gains money as a result of the Northern Territory land rights act. The trust account is operated with ministerial approval of payments. The minister is advised by the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account Advisory Committee, of which the minister appoints the chairperson and the land councils elect the 14 members. That committee has the receipt of income, which is royalty equivalents, interest earned on its own investments and other minor receipts, and it is able to allocate it.

         The total of royalty revenue equivalents passed on to the trust account in 1993-94 was a little over $32 million. In addition, $1.6 million was earned in the investment income. We have a model, and it is a model of self-determination. We are moving a long way back from that in this particular fund. We also have the model that I referred to earlier.

         In relation to the New South Wales Land Council's fund, it has the responsibility to receive the 7 1/2 per cent of land tax each year and to invest 50 per cent for the benefit of a self-sustaining fund in 10 years time, and it has the capacity to distribute and allocate the other 50 per cent of revenue it receives each year.

         With regard to the other comments that were made, Senator Collins said that the benefit is indisputable for those Aboriginal people who are the sole beneficiaries of this fund. What I would want to say there is that it may well be in the interests of those who end up being the beneficiaries. The problem is that there is a vast percentage of Aboriginal people who will never be beneficiaries of this fund, because of the amount. Therefore, it is not necessarily a good structure that we are putting in place because the government is actually keeping the bulk of the funding within the public account and not distributing it. Nor is it allowing Aboriginal people and the ILC to have a say in the investment of that so-called $1.4 billion. Each year we are not allowing them to invest the $200 million or $121 million, depending which year, to maximise the expropriation that they might be able to receive. That is the link with the amount. Because they have so little, if they had more say in the money that is being kept in the public account, that is, the $200 million that is there this year and the $121 million that is in that public account for the next nine years, they would be able to maximise their return.

         In fact, in the committee hearings we heard some very interesting testimony from J.P Morgan that the fund is diminishing because it is being kept in the public account and that it would be possible, if the investment was diversified, to increase the amount by which Aboriginal people could benefit. That is another major reason for allowing the money to be outside the public account and for the ILC to be able to control the way in which it generates income, which will then be available to Aboriginal people.

         Senator Kernot said that if we defeat this bill future governments will not do it. She also said that history tells us that if we do not take action now we get nothing. There is one flaw in that. History also tells us that governments tend to get away with as little as possible. Once they have put in place and locked in as little as possible, it is extraordinarily difficult to get them or any other government to increase it. We always get a lowest common denominator. We get: `What can we get away with giving—the minimum amount with the least disruption.' Then forever after, because the political capital has gone to make that change, further improvements are so unlikely as to be wishful thinking.

         Finally, I will talk about the gold medal plan that Senator Campbell raised. I think it is not entirely a coincidence. It might not have been a deliberate intention of the government, but I think it portrays a subconscious attitude that $21 million actually is the unit of nothing appreciable at all to affect the budget deficit. We can give $21 million a year to our Olympic athletes as part of the gold medal plan—believe me, I am not asking that that be reduced—but I think it is the smallest unit that can escape out of the budget allocations without causing disruption. It should be noted that that is the same amount that is being allowed to escape to Aboriginal people to redress the injustice of 200 years.

         I do not think that these things are entirely unrelated;  they are not simply equivalent units. It is enormously useful to the government to provide funding of $21 million as the gold medal plan for our athletes in preparation for the Olympic games, and it is enormously useful to this government to provide Aboriginal people with a land fund, into which they are locked, of $21 million a year. When there is protest at the Olympic games over Australia's failure to address the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country, that will be rebuffed by the government being able to say, `Oh, no, we have you locked in. We have given you all the redress that you are going to get.'

         The second reason is based on an economic and consistent point of view. Another of the government's welcomed initiatives was the superannuation guarantee levy. The government decided that the levy was required because the ageing of the population meant that revenue would not be able to fund superannuation after people retired. I have had arguments with the government about the fact that the taxpayer and the consumer are now really paying what the government should have been paying out of consolidated revenue. Nevertheless, the government said that there should be this superannuation guarantee levy. Where is that put?

         Here it is different. Why? I do not know. Whatever the amount the government has decided on, why can the government not ensure that it is managed by the board? Investment seems to me to be an appropriate way of proceeding. It recognises, as Senator Chamarette said, that the Senate, thus far at least, has indicated to the government the importance of ensuring the empowerment of the Aboriginal people through the board. I would like the minister to respond to the question of why the government takes one attitude in respect of superannuation for the population at large and another attitude in regard to this particular matter.

There are some delegations to the advisory committee by the minister, but they are at his discretion. The minister can determine from time to time what levels of reserves have to be kept in that account. There was a period not so long ago where very few disbursements were made from the ABTA.

         I must say that I take considerable exception to the dismissive way in which the amount of money under this fund is dealt with. This amount of money is provided simply for the specific purpose of providing additional benefit to the Aboriginal people of Australia. What annoys me about the references that have been made by Senator Chamarette and others is that they have referred to the fund as if it were the only measure of financial assistance to Aboriginal people. Entirely fallacious and flawed comparisons have been made with gold medal assistance to Olympic athletes and so on.

         The facts are that government outlays for the benefit of Aboriginal people, which this government provides and strongly supports, are in the order of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year. ATSIC alone receives, from memory, in the order of $900 million a year at this time—and it will escalate in future budgets—which is disbursed for the benefit of Aboriginal people. DEET, for example, currently gets around $300 million a year in terms of specific training programs for the benefit of Aboriginal people. The state and Commonwealth housing arrangements, with which I am also familiar, currently provide in the order of $100 million a year for housing—I think it is $95 million, to be precise—for the benefit of Aboriginal people. The total sum currently being expended, in rough terms, is $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in existing outlays of public money a year—which this government provides and strongly supports—for the benefit of Aboriginal people.

Also, what is the government's position on the effect on the deficit if the $200 million—or a greater amount—was able to be outside the public account or was somehow available to the ILC in terms of control of the investment?

         —The simple answer to those questions is that the $200 million was a start up for the fund. That global amount was set in a way the government sets all these dispersals of public money. Unfortunately, we do not have the facility that the Greens have; which is not having to worry about putting budgets together—basically just printing the stuff for everybody who asks for it. We do not have available to us the magic pudding approach to budgets. I assure Senator Chamarette that the global amount was considered after lengthy consideration by the government as to the total budgetary commitments that it has. So there is nothing magic about the $200 million. That amount was simply determined as the amount to get the thing going.

       This motion now before us, of which notice was given last week, deals with quite a complicated matter with a long history. It is one of rather fundamental importance for effective administration in this country. I would like to say to Senator Harradine and members of the opposition who are interested in this that I want to do three things. First, I want to give an account of the history of this matter. In doing so, I want to make it clear that there has been no deliberate backtracking or bad faith on the part of this government, notwithstanding some suggestions to that effect that apparently had been made. Secondly, I want to explain why it is that the government supports the motion, of which notice was given last week and which is now in front of us. Thirdly, I want to address the question of what happens if this motion I have now moved is not agreed to by the Senate. I want to do all those three things.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        As to the history of this matter, I think the course of events needs to be appreciated if there is not to be some perpetuation of misunderstandings here. Things began back on 16 December 1993 when Senator Harradine gave notice in the Senate that he would move a motion stating:

        That there be laid on the table by the Leader of the Government . . . of the budget sittings 1994 . . . an indexed list of every file . . . held by each Commonwealth Department, grouped under classifications such as policy, legislation, advising, general matters, administration or such other classifications as are most commonly used across departments;
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para>
       There was a further qualification, however, that that list was not to contain `any information which would disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security information.' Although qualified in character, nonetheless, the motion proposed by Senator Harradine was of enormously broad ambit.

        On 3 March 1994 in the context of a rather lively debate we were then having on another matter to do with government ministerial accountability, as part of the government's response to that debate—I quote from page 1454 of the Senate
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        of 3 March—I announced:

       Finally, we will support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting, motion No. 544, notice of which was given by Senator Harradine on 16 December 1993. That motion would require publication by way of tabling in parliament of departmental file titles relating to policy matters, legislation and the like.
      </para>
      <para>
       So I gave a clear-cut undertaking in this parliament that we would support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting, Senator Harradine's motion. That detailed discussion then took place. It was a protracted process, and it involved a lot of discussion between me and Senator Harradine and our respective offices. That culminated, in terms of the documentary trail, in a letter that I wrote to Senator Harradine on 27 June 1994 proposing a motion in terms that were attached to the letter, which was certainly not a comfortable position for the government to adopt. I was well aware that, within the government, there was a great deal of reservation and concern about the practicability of that commitment. But I took the firm view with Senator Harradine that I was obliged by the undertaking that I had given and wanted to act in good faith and to do so particularly before the Senate got up at the end of that session.

        On the following day, 28 June, just before we rose, the motion that was moved in the terms which I had conveyed to Senator Harradine in that letter was in fact agreed to by the Senate. The motion provided for a two-tranche commitment to be made by the government. The terms of that motion, I suppose, are most clearly referred to in the appendix to the Senate committee report, which report I will refer to in more detail in a moment.

        That resolution, however, was referred on a motion by Senator Vanstone on behalf of the opposition to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for consideration and report. There was manifest concern on the part of at least some spokesmen or senior members of the opposition that maybe this whole files business may be unworkable. At that stage maybe members of the opposition were thinking that they might be in government at some stage in the future and were worried about the implication of this kind of extremely intrusive resolution.

        For whatever reason, the motion adopted was in fact referred to the committee for report. That took place. That was the next stage of the business.

       In the remaining paragraphs of that conclusion we went on to point to the nature of the concerns which had been expressed by departments, suggesting that, in the light of those concerns, the committee might wish to consider, having regard to these various views, a different approach than simply adopting the order in its original terms. I refer to paragraph 60 because that was a clear statement from the government—in fact, it was endorsed by the cabinet—that, in the event that majority support for Senator Harradine's motion continued, the government would make its best endeavours to comply with the terms of the order. That position still holds, and I will come back to that point a little later on.

        That is what was said by us in making our submission to the committee. I will not go into the substantive content of the submission; I will summarise that briefly in a moment. I just want to get the history of this clear. On 20 September the committee reported. This was a committee which had three government and three opposition members. The report was unanimous. There was no minority report; it was a unanimous report. The conclusions of the committee—again, without going to the reasoning—were threefold. The committee recommended:

       So in its report the committee is saying, `Put aside the original motion'—even though it was agreed to in the Senate back in June—`Don't try and track back retrospectively and produce lists of files for the past', which would be unworkable, costly and time consuming, `but start now and produce some for the future. Don't do it across the whole range of departments. Just take two selected departments and do this on a trial basis. Then we will come back and look at it again on the basis of that trial experience.'

        That is what the committee reported. Senator Kemp was on the committee. Senator Watson—who is much respected in this place for his approach to administrative matters as well as his indefatigable determination to keep the government honest—was also on the committee. And Senator Campbell, who is in the chamber at the moment, was on the committee as well. They all put their names to this report; it was a unanimous recommendation. And, I believe, it was a good faith recommendation with everyone understanding that it was stepping back from something that the government—and the Senate—had agreed to do. Nonetheless, it was a stepping back in light of the accumulated weight of the evidence that was before the committee as to how all this might work.

        On 10 October, which was the reporting date in the original motion—procedurally, something had to happen in the Senate by that date—there was agreement in the chamber to actually amend the original motion to put a date of 10 November rather than 10 October. I think it should be frankly and honestly acknowledged around the chamber that this was simply a device to defer the whole question for a month while the government drafted the trial motion that had been recommended by the committee. The government could not do that immediately because there had to be consultations within the government as to which two departments would have the honour of bearing this particular responsibility. It was a tricky issue to resolve and it was going to take time. We told people that in the consultative process that occurred.

        I am not suggesting that Senator Harradine was especially comfortable with all of this because he saw us moving backwards from the original terms of the recommendation, but others in the chamber—particularly the opposition—were comfortable with that, and on those terms. I believe it was understood around the chamber that the purpose of substituting that date was simply to defer the debate for a month. I think it is also reasonable to say that there was an expectation—certainly on the government's side—that the majority that had made itself clear in the committee would hold up on the floor of the Senate and that there would accordingly be support in this place for a trial process of the kind recommended by the committee.

        By the end of October the government had resolved which department would do this trial: my own department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was to be one, and the Department of Social Security was to be the other. The Department of Social Security is a large operating department with a lot of practical program delivery dimensions as well as some policy dimensions. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is a large policy oriented department. We thought that this was a fairly reasonable spread which would give us an indication of how workable this system would be.

        At the end of October people were given advice of the government's intentions in this respect. Last week, on 8 November, I moved the motion that is now before us which provides for the revocation of the original June order and provides for a trial exercise on a prospective basis of the two departments concerned. We were ready to debate that motion the following day, 9 November, before the formal time for the production of documents under the original order fell due. Last week, the opposition asked for more time to consider its position on this. Although that produced some technical difficulties about us being in breach of the Senate order, we were happy enough in all the complicated circumstances of this matter to grant that extension of time. Thus it is that the matter comes on for debate today rather than last week.

        That is the history of the matter, as objectively and as frankly as I can describe it, with all the instances of what occurred along the way. As to the arguments for the motion in the terms in which I have moved it and as it is before us on the notice paper, let me just say fairly succinctly these things. The committee was asked by the Senate to examine a number of specific issues: whether the order in its original form would in fact produce material which was in a user-friendly form for senators and others; the practicality of implementing the order; the cost of carrying it out; the implications of the order for Commonwealth departments; and whether any more efficient and effective method might be devised to achieve the objectives of the order.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Manifestly, the terms of reference were sympathetic to the idea behind the order, but nonetheless they sought a pretty wide ranging review of its practicalities, both from a Commonwealth department's point of view and from a user's point of view. The government, as I say, provided a considered submission to the committee which, in the substantive part, pointed out that there were serious practical and other difficulties. We identified difficulties relating to the number of files involved, the usefulness of file titles, the ability of departments to implement the order in the time scale outlined if retrospectivity were required, and there were also serious concerns about the availability of certain classified material.

        It appears that the committee—it says so in its report—found the government's submission persuasive and shared its concerns over these practical and other difficulties. The committee particularly felt that the retrospectivity involved in the earlier order would not easily be workable and that the order should be modified so that it had an entirely prospective application.

        The committee also shared the government's concerns about the possible damage that could arise from premature disclosure of material relating to policy initiatives, and that a government was entitled to have its departments develop policy advice in confidence. The committee also agreed with the government's submission that provision of the information of the kind sought would probably not be of much practical benefit to the parliament, and that the cost and resource implications of the exercise under those circumstances could not be reasonably justified. I think that is a fair summary of the basic thrust of that committee report which, as I say, is signed by Senator Kemp, Senator Watson and Senator Campbell as well as the three government senators. There were no minorities and no majorities about this; it is the unanimous considered recommendation.

        The committee did go further, however, than the government's submission and recommend that a limited trial should occur. The committee was not prepared just to say, `No, don't go on with this'. It said, `No, you should have a go at making this work,' proposing that it should, however, be prospective rather than retrospective, and that it should exclude certain classes of files. The committee considered that it should apply to only two departments and operate for a period of six months.

        As I said, the government's motion now before the Senate is intended exactly to give effect to those unanimous recommendations of the committee, embracing both the opposition and the government. If we look at the terms of the resolution on the notice paper we will see that paragraph (1) revokes the previous order; paragraph (2) establishes the new limited trial and provides that on the first day of the 1995 Spring sittings, which is currently scheduled to be 22 August, the Leader of the Government is to table lists of files created during the first six months of next year in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Social Security; paragraph (3) provides for the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee to evaluate the success of the trial as envisaged by the former standing committee; and paragraph (4) provides for a series of definitions, most of which go to describing the kinds of files which are to be provided.

        I am extremely conscious that this motion does not go as far as Senator Harradine would have liked. It is certainly not as extensive in its scope as the order that was agreed to at the end of June. But it does represent an honest attempt to come to grips with some of the immense practical difficulties involved in making this work in a way that is not just manageable for governments—that is only one side of the equation—but also in a way that is actually helpful to users, that is, people embarking on an exercise of finding out what government is up to and addressing their minds to policy issues and so on.

There will be ample opportunity to evaluate and make a decision as to whether this should continue on a more comprehensive basis.

        I hope the Senate can respond seriously to the kinds of points that I make. I could go on at much greater length about the terms of the government's worries about this—the terms of the Senate committee report—but I think I have perhaps said almost enough to make that clear. However, I should say something about what the government's position will be in the event that I have not succeeded in persuading the Senate and it does not want to revoke the original order and does not want to support this proposal for a trial period that has been put by the committee. If that is the case, I am forced back on the undertaking given in the submission put to the committee. I do not propose to resile from that. I will repeat paragraph 60, which is in these terms:

        I have to say frankly that we cannot comply even this week, or next week or the week after, with this because the work simply has not been done. The reason the work has not been done is that for the last couple of months at least, since the committee has reported and, indeed, when it was known from talking to people what their likely views were, a reasonable judgment was made that something at least would come out of the committee report which would be different from that which was in the original motion. Under those circumstances, work has been put on hold for this. It has not been put on hold in my own department—we have been gearing up to do it, and Social Security similarly—but in the other departments it has.

There are lots of other parts of the submission that go to cost and to the utility of the information thus derived, but paragraph 29 goes to the question of practicality. It says:

        eight departments commented that the suggested categories system is inappropriate. Most departments have their own indexing systems which allows them to locate files by subject at a far more detailed level or on a different basis (eg work units) than the classifications proposed.

       That is a measure of the particular practical problems that are going to be experienced right now. The retrieval systems are simply not in place just to press electronic buttons and get the results wanted. The classification systems do not coincide with the ones in the terms of the resolution. It is just not the way departmental files are organised. To go back retrospectively for files that were not created with this disclosure exercise in mind is an inordinately time-consuming business. It is for these reasons that we wanted to do it—if we were going to do it at all—prospectively rather than retrospectively, so that at least people could develop systems that would enable the information to be readily retrieved. That is the nature of the problem. That problem is a stark one.

        I was most heartened when, after discussions in March, an undertaking was given by Senator Evans in the terms that he has outlined today. In the month that followed there was discussion. It is no good saying that there was not discussion with other departments—there were discussions between Senator Evans's office and other departments. What emerged, finally, in June was not my motion but a motion, the terms of which were agreed to specifically by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I would have thought that was it. I was very pleased because I felt that that was an advance towards open government.

        Sections 8 and 9 ensure that the public is provided with a certain amount of information about the documents agencies hold. This information may not always be sufficiently detailed to assist FOI applicants to identify particular documents. The difficulty is probably greatest for documents that do not contain the applicant's personal information. Concern has been expressed in Parliament that lack of information about agency files causes applicants to incur unnecessary search and retrieval expenses and thereby makes them unable to utilise the Act fully. In response to a motion by Senator Harradine in June 1994, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is inquiring into the practicality, cost and implications of requiring government departments to table in Parliament twice a year an index of files created in the previous six months.

       And then mention is made of the EARC. This is not only designed to be an enhancement, an adjunct, to assist persons who undertake FOI exercises; more importantly, it is an important adjunct, an important tool, that can be used by the parliament for the purpose of its audit and control of executive government function. Thus, I was very pleased when this motion was adopted in the Senate.

        I discussed the matter with Senator Vanstone before she moved the amendment to refer the matter to the Senate committee. From memory, a decision was made that the order should come into effect on 1 September, or the date of the report of the committee, whichever was the earlier. I was given to understand by Senator Vanstone that the addendum was designed to have the committee examine not whether relevant departmental files were to be produced but how they could be more effectively produced in a user-friendly manner. The government make a submission to the committee. The committee asked for only one submission, and that was from the government.

        A number of reports suggest that there would be problems with the number and the usefulness of the files. That is contained in the government's submission. In regard to the number of files, many of the files created would relate to the personal affairs of taxpayers and the recipients of government payments and would, therefore, be outside the scope of the order. If there is a case where a department activates a large number of files each half year dealing with policy advice,  legislation et cetera, electronic database searches could be used for identification purposes.

        The comment in the government's submission as to the usefulness of file titles makes me wonder at the logic behind the submission. Presumably, file titles are useful to the department; therefore, it would seem they would be useful to the parliament.

The suggestion in the government's submission that policy initiatives would be compromised if meaningful titles were produced is, in reality, an admission that the listing of the file titles would assist parliament in its scrutiny of the actions of the executive.

        Although it would be a most regrettable development were it to occur, the possibility should at least be recognised that the requirement to table file lists could, in some limited circumstances, lead to two possible highly undesirable practices, namely, use of less informative, even deliberately obscure, file titles and delaying the creation of files (and thereby jeopardising the proper custody of papers) until the subject had ceased to be of particular sensitivity.

As will be noted by the Senate, it means that virtually every policy file can be excluded from the listing if the government is to decide what is or what is not in the public interest. By contrast, the order of the Senate contains words to the effect `agreed upon between Senator Evans and me'. It only allows exclusion of a part of the name of a file title if that part would necessarily disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security matters. Again, those were the words that were agreed.

Senator Evans hit the nail on the head when he suggested the words `in the public interest'. I am sure the Senate will see that it is important that we stick with the order, which is quite definite on that matter. The way `file title' is defined, it means the name or title of the file, excluding any part of that name or title which would necessarily disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security matters. It is important that the parliament take a stand on this matter, ensure that this order stand and that the government be invited now to do what it said it would do and cooperate with the order, as it said it would.

       In general terms we are obviously supportive of more open government. We were certainly prepared to enter into a dialogue as to whether such a proposal, if passed, would significantly contribute towards providing members of the public with information upon which they could then be more confident as to the proper conduct of their government. We believe lifting the veils of secrecy on government is, in general terms, in the public interest, subject to proper safeguards which obviously include enabling the government to go about its business effectively—issues of national security, personnel and the like.

        But Senator Harradine's notice of motion was overtaken by other events. The principal event was the sports rorts affair, which, as you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, was an appalling incident of government abuse when government used principally taxpayers' money through sports and recreation grants to advance its political interests. Basically the then minister was caught out when she was unable to demonstrate publicly how one grant was given over another—how one applicant was successful over another that was not. That really demonstrated the whole political bias of the sports rorts program of this government.

        Of course, the sports rorts affair was not set up by that minister; it was set up by former Senator Richardson. We on this side of the chamber were particularly interested in getting to the background of that particular program really, I guess, to evidence a case through public knowledge that would ensure better behaviour by governments in the future. What we have seen, particularly of Senator Richardson, is that when the heat is put on, he resigns from his ministry, as he did over the Marshall Islands affair.

       That was the undertaking of the minister. Then, I understand—I understand also that it is not in dispute—that consultation took place between Senator Harradine and Senator Evans as to the implementation of that undertaking and they reached agreement as to a set of words. Senator Evans I think has referred to his correspondence dated 27 June in which he put a detailed drafting proposal to Senator Harradine as to how it might be implemented. It covered, as I read it, all departments. It simply provided for the information to be staggered in the future for management purposes.

        It seems from the correspondence that Senator Harradine, or Senator Harradine's office, agreed to that detail. So basically the Senate was then in a situation where the Leader of the Government in the Senate had given an undertaking to Senator Harradine. He and Senator Harradine had discussed the detailed form of that undertaking, agreement had been reached and it was then in the form of an agreed motion between the two of them to be brought to the Senate.

       Therefore, we moved an amendment to the motion asking that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration look at particular issues within the sentiment of what she expressed. They were issues such as whether the material was being produced in a user friendly form; questions of practicability, how it could be done in a practical way; cost—we are always sensitive to issues of cost; implications for the departments; and, lastly, whether any more efficient and effective method may be devised to achieve the objectives behind the order. In other words, it was not an amendment to the motion to reconsider the substance of the Harradine initiative but rather to see whether it was being implemented in the most effective and efficient way.

I guess one could pose the rhetorical question: if he wants the titles of files and if he wants this degree of open government, why does he not just demand all the files? Why bother with any degree of secrecy about the proposals at all? In this issue of policy development—

        I emphasise again that I am not talking about the accountability for administration. That is what Senator Hill concentrated on—and reasonably so. Where there is some question of accountability of government processes of administration there are appropriate questions that can be asked and committee references that can be made. The phrase that Senator Harradine used was `audit and control'; but audit and control is not an issue of policy development. Those are the sorts of files which I do not see it is reasonable to have provided in this totally open way.

The key point in it is that a government is entitled to have its departments develop policy advice in confidence, including the stages prior to such advice becoming cabinet documents.

But we have a system whereby the government comes up with its budget and its policy proposals, introduces its legislation and runs the gamut of the parliament.

        The committee, while agreeing with this point about developing policy advice in confidence, said, `Okay, let us have a trial which is a real trial—not involving all 18 departments, or however many we have, but involving two departments—to see the practicalities of providing these file titles.' It was a compromise—even though I do not agree with providing the whole extent of the file titles—to say, `Let us see how is would work in practice, and do it prospectively.' I believe strongly that on administrative matters the parliament has a responsibility to oversee, as does the Auditor-General, to make sure there is proper accountability for the way the government performs. But policy development processes should be a matter for the government until it introduces its legislation.

We saw in the debate relating to the print media inquiry the whole argument of public interest immunity. We have seen how far we have been able to take that. We know that we can come to the same dead end in this one, too, I suspect. But, given the Australian Democrats' record on the need for greater accountability of executive government and our involvement in this accountability package, the Democrats cannot come down on this occasion on the side of executive government using the public interest argument yet again.

        A few points need to be made here. Firstly, all of this emanates from the so-called accountability package based, as it was, on a desperate attempt to ensure that there was not a parliamentary, or at least a Senate, inquiry into what became known as the sports rorts affair. Senator Evans, on 3 March, made a number of solemn promises to the Senate. The first part of that package was the new audit act, the parliamentary audit committee—

The second part of the accountability package was a review of the Auditor-General's budget in the wake of the Centenary House royal commission undertaken by Justice Morling. We know there was some delay in that report because of the powers that were required to undertake that inquiry, but we now have the Morling report.

        Although that report may not have come out the way the coalition thought it might, one thing that needs to be remembered by the Senate is that Mr Justice Morling made some comments about the funding of the audit office. He specifically said that there will be a shortfall of just over half a million dollars in the next financial year, rising to a shortfall of $3.6 million towards the end of the lease and a total of $23.3 million during the term of that lease to the Australian Labor Party. So that is $23.3 million under the current funding arrangements that the audit office will be down and $23.3 million the Australian Labor Party will be up. This is mentioned on page 127 of the report entitled

        The report goes on to say on page 127 that, depending on various assumptions that can be made in the Department of Finance arising from the property index, the shortfall for the audit office could be $35.2 million—that is, a $35.2 million windfall for the Australian Labor Party. That is not the money the Labor Party gets; that is just the windfall—the difference between what the audit office would normally be funded to and what the lease at Centenary House would provide.

Not only did he make a specific promise on 3 March to implement, after further discussion, Senator Harradine's motion No. 544, but the government went through, as has been described ad nauseam, a process of negotiation with Senator Harradine to ensure that the motion was put into a format that clearly Senator Evans and the government that he represents would be happy with.

I did not know that there was any hard and fast rule that once a report is brought down from a standing committee, ipso facto this side of the chamber was bound by it. It does not bind this side of the chamber. In fact, in my earlier remarks on this matter some weeks ago I pointed out that, with the report having been tabled, we would be looking more closely at this issue—looking at the response from the government and looking at the response from Senator Harradine.

        Mrs Kelly took the fall. I believe that Mrs Kelly was instructed, probably by the highest people in this government, to make those grants, to make them quickly and to funnel that money out into Labor seats. That is why she spent that money in a very short period—a three-year program. But did we get to the people who were ultimately responsible for that rort, or did we just accept that it was Mrs Kelly who was to take the fall? That is what this particular inquiry would have discovered. But Senator Kernot was not prepared to proceed down that track.

        —in reply—There has been a number of extraordinary features about this debate. I guess the most extraordinary single feature of it was the statement of no confidence by Senator Hill in his three parliamentary colleagues—Senator Watson, Senator Kemp and Senator Campbell—that they were incapable of thinking for themselves, seeing the issues for themselves and responding to the issues for themselves. They were simply sidetracked, says Senator Hill, by virtue of the government submission on this particular matter—a government submission that squarely addressed the very issues that the committee was set up to review.

        The second most extraordinary thing about this debate has been the performance we have just witnessed from the two sidetrackees, who showed their absolute inability to be frank with the Senate by the way in which they ducked, weaved, shifted and diverted their way through their contributions to this debate—doing everything in this Senate except explaining why it is they are now turning 180 degrees on the matters in issue from the positions they adopted when they were sitting on that committee and responding to the issues before that committee. They have done everything today except explain why it is they voted, as members of the committee, explicitly for a recommendation to revoke the order of June 1994 and are now, in the Senate, voting to reinstate and to maintain that particular order.

They ought to be ashamed of themselves. For them to say that they were undertaking their committee responsibilities in a sense of ignorance or of being unaware of the nature of the course of events that had preceded the establishment of the committee is to either dissimulate or to carry ignorance to the point of unbelievable ineptitude.

        The truth of the matter was that it was perfectly evident that the particular resolution passed in June was one that the government was prepared to accept in the very terms in which Senator Harradine moved it. It was clear from my statement in March that there were going to be discussions about the drafting of the terms of that resolution. It was perfectly clear from what Senator Harradine said in the Senate. As reported on page 2100 of the Senate

Senator Harradine had a majority in this place and I had made a commitment to do something in that area. The particular terms in which the resolution came forward were as far as Senator Harradine was prepared to go in those discussions. That was Senator Harradine's right to take that position.

       We also need to look at whether there is another more efficient and effective way to achieve the same aim. So we are not in any way opposed to the intent of what Senator Harradine wants to achieve. We are strongly supportive of any initiatives to improve the accountability of the executive to this parliament. We just want to make the point that for ideals to become reality, a lot of hard work has to take place. Someone has to have an idea.

      <para>
       For once, that was a perfectly sensible proposition from Senator Vanstone about the need to scrutinise again the whole substance of this particular resolution. She was obviously concerned that this might not be the most practical, cost-effective and reasonable way of advancing an aim, or an aspiration or an intention which we were all prepared to share. So that is the basis on which opposition senators embarked upon this exercise. They did it with their eyes open. They showed a bit of policy decency for once in the way in which they responded to the committee obligation. They have run out of decency pretty rapidly as soon as the opportunity has now come to test their consistency and seriousness of purpose in this matter. That will be remembered by most people whom they would like to take them seriously.

        The final point that I want to make is about the workability of the order in the present form.

        As a practical matter of executive government, there are many more kinds of disclosure than those subsumed by just those three categories which would create real practical difficulties for the business of government. Take economic management, for example; take exchange rate management; take the possibility of a new tax measure or a new savings measure with very substantial implications for a particular affected group which the government is at an early stage of considering—matters which, in the time-honoured business of government, all sides of politics have acknowledged to be matters that are entirely appropriately maintained confidential until such time as the government is ready to make the announcement and then to bear the consequences, bear the flack, of the decision for better or for worse.

        Take in my own foreign policy area the number of issues that might well be disclosed by file titles that were other than purely anodyne and purely useless. They might disclose the possibility of a particular visit by some statesman, a head of government or someone from another country which would be highly sensitive and very damaging to our bilateral relations with that government were the terms of it to be disclosed before it was ready to be announced in that other country. That has nothing to do with personal confidentiality. That has nothing to do with national security, because national security does not mean just foreign relations at large. National security means things going to the defence and security of the country.

        Let us instance an important international matter, but not one immediately related to the defence of the integrity of the country—for example, a Security Council candidacy, or a policy initiative that we might be imminently about to launch in relation to some matter of United Nations administration, or perhaps the composition of the Security Council. They may be highly sensitive matters that one does not want perhaps to let out that one is even considering because to do so would be counterproductive to the ends one is trying to achieve. Questions of support for particular candidacies and questions about aspects of one's bilateral relations and a possible shift in policy in relation to some other country—issues of this kind traditionally have been regarded as sufficiently sensitive to justify not only confidentiality as to the detail, because the detail will not be revealed by this, but confidentiality as to whether or not the government is actually in the business of giving consideration to the matter at all.

        These are the things that we are genuinely concerned about in the motion as it is at the moment. Maybe I was not sufficiently focused on them or concerned about them in the rush of events back in June to have focused on the implications of them and to have had discussions in the way that in retrospect I should have. But that focus has been placed upon these sorts of issues, and many others as well, in the government's submission and it was the subject of the committee consideration during that period.

        It is a fruitless task, given the way in which people have now committed themselves and the way in which they are obviously going to vote, to get them to go backwards on this. But I do ask that there be a willingness to look at the implications of this in practice sooner rather than later. If this thing is going to be passed, let us not only do it with the date amendments which Senator Harradine has kindly indicated he is willing to accept—that is helpful and I thank him; and we will certainly embrace those—but let us do it with some earlier review mechanism than that which was originally contemplated after the two-year period.

        I foreshadow that I will so move if it can be done, hopefully by leave; otherwise I will have to put a notice of motion in—and I do not want to debate this all over again. But I would ask, if it is possible to reach consensus on this proposition, that a review be undertaken by the Finance and Public Administration References Committee of the information provided in response to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the amended motion, the committee to report to the Senate by no later than 30 June 1995.

        I would ask the opposition, for all the rest of the absence of help it has given us, at least to contemplate the utility of having some earlier review mechanism in place, given what opposition senators themselves have put their signatures to, namely, a serious expression of concern as to the cost effectiveness and workability of the particular thing that they are now about to ram down our throats.

        I would ask Senator Harradine—I know he is a bit grumpily inclined about this particular proposal—to perhaps reconsider that opposition and perhaps be prepared in good faith to accept the legitimacy of our concerns about just whether this is going to work or not. When he sees what he gets in February and March he might be the first person shrieking for a review, saying, `This is no good. This is not telling me anything.' That is a possibility. It will not be for an absence of good faith; but it may just be the nature of the exercise that he is demanding of us.

       This motion seeks to implement the start up dates of the order and to change them in accordance with a request that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) made during the debate. I am a little disillusioned by Senator Evans's suggestion that he agreed to this particular measure only because he was over a barrel. That has really shocked and disappointed me to a certain extent.

       That is deliberately a pretty open-ended framework for the committee to operate within. I would hope that the committee would use the same intelligently drafted terms of reference in practice that Senator Vanstone came up with before and address that range of issues. Rather than getting into that kind of drafting exercise now, I think it is sufficient to make clear that this is intended to be a broadly focused review, both of the nature of the material that has been flushed out by this order and the issues involved in complying with the order—namely, the costs versus the benefits—so far as the administrative system is concerned. I think that gives the committee sufficient scope to look at basically anything that it wants to look at. Hopefully it will confine itself to things that are helpful in terms of getting a better system of public administration in this country.

        What I was suggesting was issues involved in the compliance with this, and actually a scrutiny of the information provided. There is not a heck of a lot of difference between us, but I do not think Senator Campbell's formulation sufficiently gets the flavour of weighing the benefits against the costs. We really need to look at the two sides of the equation if we are to have a proper review. An alternative formulation would be `the effectiveness of the system of disclosure provided for in this order' or words to that effect. Would that do it?

I think our proposed amendment more accurately reflects what he would hope the committee would do. Senator Evans's words read, `the committee should review the information.'

        —by leave—I oppose that. I suggest that if we cannot reach a resolution here, we should hold it over, Senator Evans can give notice of the motion tomorrow and maybe we will work constructively to achieve a resolution. The problem with such a broad motion is that if the government departments do what they say they were intending to do in their submission to the committee, as Senator Harradine pointed out, they will provide you with a whole bunch of information. In fact, they will target the review. They will say, `We will snow these guys; we will make it ineffective and inefficient,' and the review will be a process to ensure that it falls down. That is why we specifically say `efficiency and effectiveness of the government's compliance with this'—not `issues related to the information'. Quite frankly, I do not think we can support this. I suggest we move on to further business, Senator Evans can fix this by way of notice of motion and we will deal with it more sensibly.

         —I want to address once again, as I have done over the years, the position of Ellenbrae Station in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Ellenbrae Station is located in the heart of the Kimberleys. It is accessed by the Gibb River Road, which runs from the Great Northern Highway in the east, joining the Wyndham-Kununurra Road, which runs to Derby in the west. The station is surrounded predominantly by other pastoral leases, except to the north and west, where Drysdale River National Park is situated. To the east of that, there is the Oombulguri Reserve, which was formerly the Forrest River Mission. As I have said in this place before, in 1990 the first big fire came out of Oombulguri and burnt 80 per cent of Ellenbrae Station. To my knowledge, since then it has been burnt out from that same direction for four out of the last five years, putting Ellenbrae in an impossible situation.

         I asked during estimates and in this place about the position of Aboriginal reserves. I asked whether they have insurance cover—as is the case with any other incorporated organisations or individual organisations which carry on some sort of commercial or cultural activity and which have insurance to cover damage caused by that pastoral lease, farming entity or whatever—with regard to actions they have undertaken which involve water or fire escaping from that property. I could never get an answer as to what the situation might be—especially from Senator Cook, who at the time was handling questions in the Senate relating to that portfolio.

         It is not compulsory to have this sort of third party insurance, but of course it is wise to do so in case, say, a fire goes from my property on to somewhere else and burns the neighbours out. I was never able, as I said, to get any answer on the situation. The owners of Ellenbrae Station have not been able to get any compensation out of anyone in all that time.

         During the debate on the Mabo legislation last year, Senator Gareth Evans, who led the debate on the bill for the government, assured us that all regulations on such things as bushfires and land care would apply to land held by Aboriginals in their own names or land secured by this Mabo style legislation where native title existed. We were led to believe that that was the situation but, of course, now the owner of this station, Byrne Terry, has nowhere to go except to start some impossible sort of action. If there had been insurance, they would have had some recourse, but obviously they do not.

         I do not know where these people can go because, at any drop of a hat, they could get the same treatment. From certain investigations that have been done, we have found out that the attitude of the Aboriginal community and, for that matter, the attitude of the government department responsible for Aboriginal affairs in Western Australia—I wish Senator Collins would visit the place and get his own view on the impossible position that these people are in—towards the land-holders is unacceptable.

         It appears the rights of land-holders are secondary to the rights of the Aboriginal community. That may be so. If they want to think that way, let them think that way. But to take out common third party insurance would be a very wise idea. The people are still legitimately in pastoral pursuits. I say `legitimately' because anyone running a pastoral concern is legitimate when they pay their pastoral fees, adhere to what the pastoral board of Western Australia tells them to do and pay their fees for shire rates and pay their land lease rates to the West Australian government. So they should have some rights in this situation. Clearly, this sort of discrimination affects other people besides the Terrys of Ellenbrae station.

         As I have already said, the present situation in light of the Mabo decision has given rise to conflict between Aborigines and other residents of this country. Until responsible and reasonable safeguards are put in place, this problem will continue—and it is very interesting to note that the minister with responsibility for Aboriginal matters in this chamber has just walked out without listening. Until reasonable and responsible safeguards are put in place, this problem will continue to manifest itself, creating division between the Aboriginal community and other land-holders. Senator Evans told us time and time again during the Mabo debate last year that that would not happen.

         It appears clear that if the fire had escaped from leasehold property—that is, another sort of pastoral lease, under which the majority of land in that area is—the owners of the station would have been compensated through the insurance that they would have held. Through no fault of their own, the owners of Ellenbrae have suffered extreme hardship, which will continue unless the problem is addressed immediately. The attitude displayed by government departments which handle Aboriginal affairs is clearly biased and dismissive of any problems as far as the Aboriginal community is concerned. This is quite contrary to the actual position that prevails.

         In summary, the situation is that this station that operates as a legal pastoral entity has been burnt out four times in the last five years. The year I flew over it, it was completely burnt out. The cattle holding, according to the best figures that I have, has been reduced from about 20,000 to about 2,000 or 3,000 because of these fires—deliberately lit in most cases, as far as I can see—which have driven them almost to the point of bankruptcy. The owners of Ellenbrae have had to take on other jobs, such as operating bulldozers for the shire and doing contract work for the shire, to keep their station going. They have dug in and said that they are not going to be driven out by fires. Yet federal departments are not interested in the problem, nor is the Aboriginal department interested in the problem.

         For the sake of justice, it is time that someone took this matter in hand and did something about it. Otherwise where is freedom in the Kimberleys, or in Australia for that matter? If the government wants to do away with a pastoral industry in the Kimberleys, or if the Aborigines want to do that, let them say so and properly compensate the people.

         I do not believe that is the way to go. We have a viable industry there and we should keep it there. But we should not let the government or anyone else drive these people out by simply burning them out and putting them into bankruptcy. I hope someone takes notice.

         —I rise tonight somewhat disillusioned with what I believe to be the normal processes that should operate under Commonwealth-state relations and responsibilities in regard to environmental management. Many senators will be aware that for a number of months now Senator Woodley, Senator Faulkner, Senator Kernot, Senator Coulter, Senator Ian Macdonald and I have been raising questions about the nature of a major resort development at Oyster Point in the Hinchinbrook area just out of Cardwell. This area, of course, is sandwiched between two unique world heritage areas—the wet tropics and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

         There have been ongoing strenuous efforts on the part of the Friends of Hinchinbrook. There have been strenuous efforts on the part of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to reach some rational, realistic agreement about the scale and type of development that is appropriate in this very unique area, unique not just for Queenslanders or for Australians but unique by virtue of it being an area between two World Heritage designated areas. I have to say it has been a story of frustration, it has been a story of a refusal of the Queensland department of environment to really come to terms with the nature of its responsibilities as a joint manager with the Commonwealth.

         I spent quite a bit of the weekend taking phone calls from the site where people were determined to protect the mangroves. Many senators will say, `Oh, they are protesters; oh, they are radicals, rent-a-crowds.' They are people who are trying to save a relatively small area of mangroves. In this day and age, protection of mangroves, I thought, was pretty well recognised as important, particularly in the vicinity of World Heritage areas. These people are so determined to protect the mangroves. Why do they want to protect mangroves? Why would they sit in mud and walk back and forth through mud for days at a time to protect the mangroves if they did not seriously believe, as the scientists believe, that the mangroves must be protected in order to maintain the existing seagrass beds on which dugong are so dependent?

         Let me describe to the chamber where this resort will be. The resort on land will be, I am sure, an attractive resort. I would say it is far too big. What is on the land is not acceptable in my book, but we are not going to argue about the private land aspect of this. Mr Williams was given permission to put up a fence to protect his site, allegedly from protesters. The only thing is that the protesters have not been on private land; their attention has been towards the mangroves. So the fence went up over the weekend.

         There is this absolute determination to remove the mangroves, even though the private land site needs a great deal of attention and work for months before there can be any resort there. But why does Keith Williams want to clear the mangroves? I will tell the Senate why, and some senators will laugh. He wants an artificial Hawaiian style beach there. Why? Because there is no beach there—it is just mud and mangroves—and those senators who know what mangroves are would know that people would not sit on the edge of mangroves to sun themselves.

         There is another reason why people would not sit on either the mangrove site or indeed the artificial beach and that is that this particular channel area is infested with crocodiles. The ridiculous thing about this whole development is that people in Brisbane are making decisions and they do not seem to know that they are trying to put a beach along a channel that is infested with crocodiles. Who is going to sit on the beach, much less go into the water, when it is infested with crocodiles?

It is very unsafe. By the time you get the stingers and the massive crocodiles that come around the protected fish area, why would anybody want to sun themselves on the beach?' The issue here is: why would a government—a government of which I am very proud, the Queensland Labor government—go out of its way to have the mangroves cleared when there is all this work to be done on private land? It just does not make sense. Quite clearly, it is a classic case of people not understanding the issue, making decisions a thousand kilometres or more south and not seeing the reality of their decision making.

There was no workplace health and safety officer as there should have been. The machine came very close to a number of the protesters.

         It is significant that in this week, when Chile is admitted for the first time as the newest member of APEC, President Frei chose to stop over in Australia. This visit reinforces the common purpose that Australia and Chile have in working to achieve trade liberalisation in our Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large. As we all know, Chile was a major partner with us in the Cairns Group in the Uruguay Round of the GATT and will continue, I believe, to share many of our objectives in the new World Trade Organisation to begin on 1 January next year. More than that, Australia provides Chile with an opportunity for investment. Chile will be able to establish regional offices in Australia as a doorway into Asia. In a very parallel way, Chile is offering Australia a secure investment base and a place for representative offices, not only for Australian business to take up opportunities in that country, but as a doorway to South America generally.

         Currently, Australian trade with Chile is only $140 million but it has grown at the most rapid rate of any country with which Australia has traded over the last 10 years. The average growth for each of the last 10 years has been 35 per cent. I believe that, whilst the whole of our Latin American trade is only one per cent of our exports, it has the prospect of growing three-fold in the next six or seven years. It is with that in mind that I have spoken about Latin America—and Chile and Mexico in particular—as our most prospective business partners, nation to nation, in that region.

         Asia—in particular north-east Asia—will be the priority area for Australian exports, but it is right that we look at our newest APEC member as part of a continent that currently receives one per cent of Australian exports; and could receive three times that amount. Australia has $700 million of investments in Chile. In fact, we are the second largest overseas investing nation in that country. A great part of that investment is in the mining industry in Chile which, of course, is the biggest wealth producer for that country. Australian expertise and equipment, and mineral finance—as my colleague Senator Parer understands very well—are areas where Australia can bring investment, technical knowledge and other expertise to Chile to the benefit of both Australia and that country.

         I not only note the welcome we all give to President Frei in his timely visit to this country, but also want to note that this has other areas of significance beyond reinforcement of its entry into APEC. President Frei's visit is just 12 months after the visit by President Patricio Aylwin, his predecessor as President of Chile. Former President Aylwin had a successful visit to this country, in particular to the parliament here in Canberra where we welcomed him. To have two presidents in succession—in the space of 12 months—coming from Chile is a very accurate reflection of the importance Chile gives to Australia. We should be much readier to respond to the interest Chile is expressing in Australia.

         I urge the Australian government to take up three proposals that I have urged in recent months—and which the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, has happily conversed with me about. We have exchanged letters but it has yet to be fully agreed to. These three proposals are, first, that we establish a bilateral free trade and investment agreement between Australia and Chile, to the benefit of both our countries. I have said in the past that it is not enough for us to get Australia's interests preserved regionally within GATT or the new World Trade Organisation—that is internationally or in APEC. We should have some specific bilateral agreements that are to our benefit and that are WTO and APEC consistent. We ought now to formulate such a bilateral agreement and reinforce all of our opportunities by putting it in place in the coming months.

         The second point is that we establish an air link between Lan Chile and Qantas. That is of enormous importance. The third point is that, whether through the east-Asia analytical unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or through a similar unit, there should be a detailed economic study of our trade and investment prospects to reinforce all that is happening now. For instance, some 30 firms have their regional offices in Santiago, the capital of Chile. I would like the government to very constructively take up these three proposals.

         —Today, protesters were removed from the Oyster Point site near Cardwell in North Queensland. Apparently, they were dragged off by security guards with the coastguard and police looking on. I have been told that protesters on the site were dragged off over and over again. At least two were injured; one was punched unconscious. I am informed that the doctor in Cardwell, not wanting to get involved, refused to treat one of the injured people who had been assaulted by a police officer.

         Margaret Thorsborne, a 70-year-old lady about five feet tall, was dragged off the site with undue force. I might add that two years ago Margaret Thorsborne was declared to be the citizen of the year in Cardwell. What crime had these people committed? None! There were no arrests. The police were just another service provided by the Queensland government to this developer. What the protesters were doing was a service to all of us in Queensland, Australia and internationally. They were trying to protect our world heritage. That is something the Queensland government and the federal government are charged with doing. However, they have done anything but protect our heritage in this case.

         The protesters feel totally disempowered. One of the conservationists just called one of my staff and said, `What do you do? The SES sat under a tarp all day eating pies. This wasn't a show but they turned it into one. What do you do when the people you normally turn to for help, like the coastguard, just watch as someone is knocked unconscious and a gracious and wonderful lady is dragged away? What do you do when the police are knocking people about or turning their backs while someone else does?'

         Today in the Senate I gave notice of a motion condemning the Queensland government for its outrageous behaviour in gazetting a piece of public land for the exclusive use of developer Keith Williams. This public land is now a marine park, rather like a national park, and should not be given willy-nilly for destruction by a 24-hour sneaky gazettal. The protesters were trying to protect the old-growth mangroves, which in turn protect the vast seagrass meadows which feed the vulnerable-to-extinction dugong. Those seagrass meadows have been found by internationally recognised marine biologist Tony Preen to have a rare species of seagrass.

         In fact, the Hinchinbrook Channel is a place with a number of rare and endangered species. That is why it is World Heritage. That is why it is of paramount importance to protect it. Hinchinbrook was called the jewel in the crown of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park when it was nominated for World Heritage. It was called that because it had nearly all the species of mangroves in Australia; three species of endangered sea turtle—the loggerhead, flatback and green turtle; three species of endangered dolphins—the humpback, bottlenose and irrawaddi; and, of course, the dugong.

         There is an area of land near the resort on which Mr Williams wants to build an airport capable of taking 737s. At the moment there is a tiny airstrip adjacent to the Edmund Kennedy national park. Will the Queensland government resume part of the Edmund Kennedy national park for this developer to build his international airport? This tiny strip is at present capable of taking only six-seater aircraft. On the other side, there is the Bruce Highway. I assume even the Queensland government would not gazette that, but who knows? If it makes a present of part of the Edmund Kennedy national park for Mr Williams, perhaps we should say goodbye to the two most endangered mammals in Queensland—that is, the mahogony glider and the cassowary.

         In the future, developers such as Mr Williams will never admit that they were responsible for the death of a species. They promise us the world with jobs and income. But, really, does this resort, built on a huge mudflat where people will have to walk hundreds of metres over mud, swatting sandflies, in order to get to water that is a milky colour and very shallow, make any economic sense? The amazing thing is that the Queensland government has swallowed this snake oil sold it by the developer and is bending over backwards to help him.

         By lunchtime tomorrow, if the federal government does not act to protect these magnificent old-growth mangroves, they will be cleared forever. I call for a moratorium on the clearing, and for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the federal government to act as a matter of urgency to proclaim the Hinchinbrook Channel under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. It is clearly in danger, and we cannot wait until those critically important mangroves are destroyed and the seagrass beds start to die. No-one has a mandate to destroy the earth, but the Queensland government has bent over backwards to give a developer the legal right, but not the moral right, to destroy this part of the earth.

        (2) No. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) is an independent statutory body which reviews decisions following review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The AAT reviews a decision on its merits; that is, it reviews both the facts and the law which apply to each individual case. As it reviews the facts of each case, an AAT decision is binding only in relation to that particular case. The AAT is not a judicial body making a determination on a question of law (which would, of course, be binding on the Department).

       Although the Department considered that the decision in Malloch was not correct, rather than litigate the matter further the Department took prompt action to have the legislation amended to clarify the meaning of the tax file number provisions. The relevant amendments are contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1994.
