If those words were used, I suppose one's reaction depends on whether they were being used geographically or judgmentally. It is well known that many of those people opposite are quite incapable of distinguishing various portions of their anatomy, one from the other. But I think even they would accept that a reasonable case could be made for a metaphorical geographical reference to Australia in those terms.

         The point is, of course, that if we are referring geographically to Australia in that sort of metaphorical way it is the case, as Prime Minister Keating said on television last night, that Australia is an island continent in the South Pacific; it is very distant from what, until recently, have been major world markets; and it is very different from what he described as the ebb and flux or the trading milieu of the developed northern hemisphere. Under those circumstances it is the case that Australia always has to do better. Australia always has to do better than other countries, being located where we are—at this end of the earth. So if Mr Keating did ever say the words that apparently have been attributed to him, they should be seen not as words of disparagement about this country but as words of encouragement.

If the economy is performing well, it regards that as bad news politically because its whole demeanour in current economic debate is to try and damage the nature of the recovery. But this is good news for Australia and Australians everywhere will be pleased to see yet another indicator coming forward which points to jobs growth and increased activity in the economy.

         The Kelly survey which was released earlier this week is a survey based on a sample of 2,000 Australian businesses of all sizes and across all industry sectors. Extrapolating from the results of the survey, Kelly's predict continued growth of some 80,000 jobs into the July quarter. A large share of this growth, some 35,000 jobs, is expected to come from continued growth in the manufacturing sector alone. In accordance with recent experience, much of the job growth is being generated by small to medium sized Australian companies with between 20 and 500 employees. The results are entirely consistent with all of the other major business expectation surveys that have been recently published. Yesterday at question time, in answer to a question from Senator Cooney, I dealt with the ACCI-Westpac survey on industrial trends in the economy, which indicated of course that the expectation of the business sector in manufacturing was very strong and the level of business confidence was very high.

         The latest half yearly survey of Australia's largest corporations by the Business Council of Australia shows that 58 per cent have revised their capital expenditure expectations upwards in the past six months and that 60 per cent expect to lift investment by more than 10 per cent. Firms in the BCI, the top 100 companies in this country, expect their sales value to grow by five per cent in the next year. They indicated that their labour productivity has risen 10 per cent since October 1993, with total factor productivity up by four per cent in the same period.

         The ABS's Australian business expectations survey for the March quarter this year shows clear confidence in an improved trading performance, with 74 per cent of businesses expecting increased sales and 69 per cent expecting higher profits than over the previous 12 months. The expected aggregate rise in profits is 20 per cent, with higher than average rises expected for medium sized firms and in the transport, storage and communications, construction, wholesale and manufacturing sectors—a very bullish expectation of profits.

         As to our responding in a boom-bust cyclical way, of course that is not the case. We have broken the back of all the major problems that have traditionally plagued the Australian economy—particularly those cyclical boom-bust ones—by the fight that we embarked on throughout the 1980s. At the same time that we were changing the micro-economic environment, we systematically reduced the underlying structural deficit of the budget and put ourselves in a position where we could get budgetary outcomes—notwithstanding the recessionary impact of extra outlays that obviously threw that off course for some little time—in the medium term which will be better and more responsible and more soundly based than any other comparable economy.

That seems to be precisely what the minister is attempting to do now.

If the point that is being made in the very explicit terms of the question itself is that the government's fiscal policy is putting interest rates under further pressure, then it is perfectly reasonable for the government in reply not only to point to our own economic responsibility and fiscal and monetary management but also to make the point that the kind of economic vandalism of the opposition's fiscal policy would put interest rates and the Governor of the Reserve Bank under infinitely more pressure.

Finally, I ask: what will the minister do to ensure that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission complies with Australia's international obligations under the convention on biological diversity, obligations the commission is now flagrantly violating in refusing to conduct a fauna survey in Reedy Marsh in northern Tasmania.

The effect of this was to increase the annual licensed maximum of hardwood chip exports to 3.1 million tonnes. The minister approved this licence on the basis that the wood to supply these woodchips would come from operations approved in December last year for operations in 1994. This will not involve the cutting of additional coupes or increases in the size of the coupes. The harvesting of coupes to provide sawlog material, despite the contentions of Senator Bell, does produce wood suitable for the production of woodchips to this amount. A surplus of this wood exists, which, if it were not used as woodchip, would otherwise be wasted.

         The contention of Senator Bell that the size of the coupes approved last year was deliberately larger than required is not correct. The size of the coupes is established by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, taking into account a range of forest management and conservation requirements. In many cases, the size of the coupes is established several years before approval is sought for the export of woodchips from those coupes. In relation to logging in Reedy Marsh, or anywhere else in Tasmania, it is an absolute requirement of Tasmania's forest practices code that pre-logging surveys including fauna are conducted.

To mention some of them, Nortel and Exicom have got together under this program, as have Nokia and ERG, UNISYS and Mincom, and IBM and Aspect Computing. These are Australian firms partnering with international companies which play the Australian companies into this important area of technology and export growth to give them a foothold in the world market.

         The key aim of these programs is to encourage international information technology and telecommunications firms to undertake strategic arrangements in Australia, and both programs have been very successful to this point. Many major companies now have some form of strategic investment in Australia—be it in manufacturing, research and development, or in oversighting regional technical training and marketing operations. These companies have expanded and strengthened their long-term commitment to Australia.

         As a consequence, our information technology and telecommunications exports have skyrocketed. In 1988, those exports were valued at $A170 million, but in 1993 they were valued at $A1.2 billion and the trade deficit in this sector has been stabilised. In the same period, local research and development spending by international companies has increased by a factor of five. The industry is now confident that it can treble in size by the year 2000 and become one of the nation's biggest employment and export sectors. The inauguration of this particular research centre is critical and catalytic in that development.

         Of course it is the case that no institution is going to remain immersed in formaldehyde in perpetuity. It is, of course, the case that Telecom itself may want from time to time to acquire new components of its business or not to continue with some small part of its existing operation. As Senator McMullan and others have been saying publicly, no GBE is different from any other major corporation in this respect. They buy and sell assets all the time. In this very fluid and fast moving economic, commercial and business environment we are in, that may well be the case. But no sale of any part of Telecom is on the government's agenda.

It will not be doing it, and we would not be being urged to do it, for any reason of public benefit because the public benefit is already there through the competitive environment that we have, of course, introduced in recent years.

What then did Mr Keating mean last night when he said that public or private ownership was not important and that he was not averse to selling off parts of Telecom?

I suspect he would be the first to criticise if a decrease in passport security led to the ease of movement of drug traffickers, criminals and terrorists being facilitated. There are stringent requirements, of course, for proof of identity and citizenship in passport issue, but these have not prevented the issue of 700,000 passports in Australia and 39,000 overseas this financial year alone, and another 4,300 which were replaced due to loss or theft.

         It is also the case that my department runs a toll-free Australian passport information service, which has handled over 500,000 inquiries this financial year. A similar toll-free line is established during crises which may involve many Australians. Most recently, for example, we responded to more than 6,000 inquiries from families and friends after the Los Angeles earthquake. We have a very firm policy that Australians overseas receive the fullest assistance in times of difficulty and I think the figures speak for themselves. Certainly my own correspondence does: I got 81 letters on consular matters in the last financial year, of which only six were matters of complaint and a great many were rave reviews for the quality of the personal attention and assistance received from our officers.

I have the greatest sympathy for the distress that relatives go through in these situations, but when someone disappears without there being any clear information about the time or location, there is only a certain amount we can do to persuade host governments in other countries to mount full-scale search operations.

If not, why not? What is the present composition of the advisory committee?

I greatly welcome that as I welcomed the opportunity to discuss that issue with him before he left for that meeting. As to whether PBEC should be given particular status in relation to APEC, that is an issue that requires a bit of consideration. There are a number of business initiatives within the APEC region and it is very welcome that organisations such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are seeking to take initiatives based on their perception of the significance of APEC and an APEC-wide coordinated activity with regard to their kindred organisations, most particularly, as Senator Brownhill would know, with their counterpart in Indonesia in recent weeks. I welcome those initiatives.

         There is also, of course, the Pacific Business Forum, the establishment of which flowed from the leaders' meeting in Seattle, which had its first meeting in Singapore this month. At this stage that is the major business conduit into APEC but PBEC is also represented with observer status. I understand that there is a bit of competitive enthusiasm to have representation there. It is something that we should think about, but it is not a straightforward question because there are a number of competing interests there. That does not in any way minimise the significance of PBEC as a very significant representative body in the region.

         With regard to the composition of the Trade Policy Advisory Council, TPAC, nobody is there in a representative capacity. We do not have people there as the chair of this or the president of that. A significant number of senior Australian business representatives and the president of the ACTU are on that body. The 34 members include representatives of some of the senior government departments and public sector agencies in the trade area, but they are mainly significant business people, mainly chief executives. None of them is there in a directly representative capacity. That means that the representative of PBEC is not there in a representative capacity. Stuart Harris, who is an active participant in PBEC, is on it, so PBEC's views are represented, but no-one is there specifically as a representative of any organisation.

Was Mr Hume speaking on behalf of the Australian government when he made these comments?

         —As to the first remarks attributed to the ambassador by some groups in the Australian NGO community, namely, that Ambassador Hume is supposed to have said that forced labour in Burma is a matter of culture and is therefore okay, my understanding is that during a conversation Ambassador Hume had in Bangkok in April he offered the historical observation that corvee labour has been a longstanding practice in Burma since 1962. Certainly his comments were not intended to condone this objectionable practice. Certainly they would not be condoned by the Australian government. I think there has simply been a misunderstanding or a misreporting of what he actually said.

         As to the other suggestion that the Australian ambassador had conveyed a proposal to Burma's Minister for Border Area Development, Lieutenant General Maung Thint, that an Australian NGO help Burma's military authorities develop the country's border areas, these reports are simply inaccurate. What happened was this: in the context of an introductory call on Maung Thint on 17 June the ambassador asked the minister whether as a matter of general principle non-government organisations would be allowed to work in the country's border areas. Lieutenant General Maung Thint replied in the affirmative.

         The ambassador's question was entirely consistent with the government's position that any humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma should be directed to the areas of greatest need. It is generally agreed that while humanitarian problems exist throughout Burma there are particular needs in the Thai-Burma border region. This follows requests from the Kachin community—which has recently concluded, as Senator Bourne would know, a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC—that the international community provide some form of assistance to Kachin state in the north of the country to alleviate the serious humanitarian problems that exist there. Whether any projects eventuate in Kachin state or whether any other area in the border region develops such projects will depend on whether any Australian NGO puts them forward.

I say finally that Ambassador Hume took the opportunity at his meeting with the minister to encourage the SLORC to work towards a genuine and comprehensive national reconciliation with both ethnic insurgents and the domestic political opposition.

         —Last week the Construction Industry Development Agency held a major conference in Brisbane attended by nearly 500 representatives of the Australian building industry, government, unions and employers. One of the major matters for discussion was the future of CIDA, the Construction Industry Development Agency, which was established in 1991 as a tripartite arrangement funded by the Australian government but with the support of the construction industry. When it was established, a sunset clause of June next year was included. It was always the view of the government, and it still is, that the industry has to take charge of its own reform process after the government has given it its initial start. That was the view discussed at the conference. One of the major themes of the conference was around that particular issue.

         What came out of the discussion was that most of the industry believes that there has to be a continuing reform process, but it should not be run by the government. The industry council will be holding a meeting later this year. At that we hope to have key options put before it about how the reform process should continue, so that well before the sunset clause of June of next year the industry itself knows about its own future.

         I point out to the Senate that since 1991 the CIDA process has been extremely successful in showing that there are ways in which this industry, despite its long history of conflict, can achieve outstanding success. There have been a number of major construction projects in Australia under this process that have been brought in under budget under time, such as the nearly completed third runway project in Sydney, the Glebe Island bridge and the Stanwell electricity power plant in central Queensland. All have been brought to fruition because both employers and employees have worked together to carry out reform on the labour side, including the introduction of multiskilling, building regulations and general improvement in the running of the industry.

         This industry generates about $40 billion worth of turnover, or about 10 per cent of GDP. This is a very important development which will result in major improvements in cost structure and in skill levels. We hope we can make a major effort in exporting these skills through the recently announced Asian infrastructure initiative whereby Australian companies will be encouraged to form consortiums to go into Asia and be more successful in winning the major infrastructure developments in that region. So it was a very successful conference. It was pleasing to see both employers' and employees' representatives realising that the reform process must continue. They are committed to it.

         (4) As noted above, the Commonwealth's interest is in public access rather than in public ownership per se. To enhance the levels of public access, the Medicare Agreements include bonus and penalty mechanisms to increase or decrease funding to States according to the share of total occupied bed days used by public patients. This mechanism is providing an effective incentive for States to increase the public share. It is not in their own best interests to reduce public access, but if this does happen, they will suffer financial penalties.

        The answer that was given to my question was nothing short of an absolutely disgraceful display by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). It showed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate will say on the one hand that they are pro-Australian, yet they will condemn places like Darwin as best seen from 35,000 feet in the air on the way to Paris.

The Labor Party and the Prime Minister clearly are setting about a very divisive and destructive course which will provide no joy for this country whatsoever. All they are doing is digging a grave for this great country because they are unable to come up with policies of their own. Indeed, we have just had the President of the Senate seeking to denigrate the great institution of the Senate.

         I think there are much more important things than rumours to talk about in the parliament of Australia. There was  tremendous content in that interview last night about matters that are of importance to all Australians, not the least of which are interest rates and the way the bond markets are going. There was a whole host of key important things that should be debated in the supreme parliament of Australia. What are we debating? We are debating innuendo. We are saying, `We love Australia more than you.' That is utter rubbish. The love of Australia is not determined by which side of the chamber you happen to sit on.

I will not repeat the comment. It was not a particularly nasty one, it was not a particularly damaging one, it probably was not even accurate; but it was withdrawn.

I appreciated Senator Campbell's comments and took them on board. I did not seek to respond at the time. Those comments went to the question of whether, after speaking in a debate, a senator should stay for the reply.

         Today Senator Abetz has come into this chamber and attacked me and Senator Carr without any notification of that fact. He has made quite scandalous allegations about our contributions to the debate, which he did not stay for. He also chose not to forewarn us that he was going to raise this issue again today. I suggest that Senator Abetz ought to take a lesson from Senator Campbell, who is an expert on such matters. He has given me very useful advice on the etiquette required in the Senate. I am happy to say that I have taken on board Senator Campbell's advice. I also got a lecture from the Deputy President at one stage about such courtesy. I think the Liberal Party would do well to train its new senators in such standards. They are clearly very sensitive chaps.

         Senator Abetz has been very sensitive about the allegations and the whole debate with respect to this matter. The hypocrisy he has shown in the debate has been quite outstanding. This is the same senator who questioned witnesses at the estimates committee about whether they had any relationships with people who are members of the ACTU. He wanted to know whether public servants were related in any way, shape or form—whether by marriage or by any other form of relationship—to members of the ACTU. He thought that was an important issue which he had a right to inquire into. In the same breath, Senator Abetz attacked the department for providing a list of names and classifications of employees of the department to accredited trade union representatives on the basis of privacy legislation and the employees' right to keep that information private. It appears that public servants have no right to privacy in estimates committees. They have to reveal all their relatives, et cetera.

       <para>
        Senator Gareth Evans has two stock answers, or non-answers, to our questions about interest rates. First of all he seeks to attack us in order to avoid any discussion about the hopeless economic policies of the government, and that attack goes along two contradictory lines. In one breath he attacks us for having no policies whatsoever; in the very next breath he attacks us for having policies which he alleges will be too expensive and will run contrary to our position that the deficit should be reduced. His second stock response is that inflation is low and therefore interest rates can be kept low. This is a sort of mantra that the Labor Party has adopted to explain why it thinks interest rates can be allowed to be low.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While Senator Evans has some reputation as a lawyer, he has absolutely no reputation as an economist, and his repetition of this mantra simply shows how little he knows about economics—as my good friend Senator Watson keeps saying when we hear these answers. There are a lot more influences on interest rates than the level of inflation. While we hope that inflation can remain low, there is no confidence in certain sections of the market that that will be the case.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Putting that to one side, inflation is only one small factor influencing the level of interest rates. The Prime Minister and Senator Evans, in answering these questions, continue to ignore the fact that there are a whole lot of influences on interest rates. Interest rates are basically the price of money influenced and determined by the demand and the supply. There is an enormous worldwide demand now for investment capital. As a result of the Labor Party's policies, which Senator Carr would obviously object to, we have become part of the international economy. We have supported that. We are now out there competing in the world marketplace for investment capital. That demand obviously has an enormous influence on the price of money and, therefore, interest rates.

         The ALP cannot have it both ways. The ALP took us into the international marketplace. It deregulated the financial markets. We now have to conduct ourselves accordingly. Those moves by the Labor government, which no doubt the Left objects to, have meant an enormous imposition of discipline on our part as a national economy. We have to get the domestic economic settings right if we want to keep interest rates down and continue to attract investment capital to Australia. That is something the Labor Party continues to ignore. That has been the problem over its 11 years of government. It has sought to take us into the international economy but has not done what is required with the domestic economy to ensure that we can survive in that international marketplace and have interest rate settings which will not damage home owners, small businesses and everybody else.

         There are several things which the government simply has to do and which it has not done to ensure that the domestic economic settings are right in the international environment of a worldwide demand for investment capital, particularly with the booming Asian economies. As Max Walsh said the other day, there is a capital squeeze out there because of the enormous demand for capital. That is driving up interest rates and imposing the discipline on the Australian economy that this government is failing to provide. It means that we must improve the productivity of the Australian economy. That is not being done sufficiently fast by this government. It is tied to the ACTU. It is simply failing to respond by freeing up the labour market in ways that will increase our productivity and, therefore, make us an attractive place in which to invest money.

I did absent myself for a very brief period during the debate. The reason for that was that I had been given a note indicating a potentially serious family matter. I therefore had to briefly absent myself from the chamber to telephone my eight-months pregnant wife and arrange a potential air flight back to Tasmania in the event that that was necessary. I am thankful to say that I did not have to leave immediately.

         More importantly, the Secretary is given a number of discretions which are commercially valuable. These include the power to extend the time for payment of an unpaid fee or late payment penalty, to allow an unpaid fee or late payment penalty to be paid by instalments (paragraph 24.1), to direct that inspection services must not be provided if fees or penalties are unpaid (paragraph 28.2) and to remit some or all of a fee or late payment penalty in special circumstances (paragraph 29.1).

         Paragraphs 30 and 31 provide for reconsideration of decisions by the Secretary and for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This right of review, however, does not extend to reconsidered decisions made under paragraphs 24.1 or 29.1(a), which may be the most commercially valuable decisions. The Committee asks why these decisions have been excluded from AAT review, while a possibly less important decision is subject to review. The Committee suggests that it may be appropriate to amend the Orders to provide for AAT review of paragraphs 24.1 and 29.1(a).

         The Standing Committee has enquired why certain decisions are excluded from Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) review. If provision were made in the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations which would allow recourse to the AAT for review of such cases, there would be scope for exploitation by persons seeking only to delay payment by this means. Any person aggrieved by a decision under the Regulations could seek review of the decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.

         As AQIS operates on a full cost recovery basis, failure to recover its attributable costs would mean, ultimately, that these would need to be recovered from other clients or funded through the budget process.

         The purpose of the provision is to require that holders of visitor visas and entry permits who are over 16 years and intend to study in class-rooms in Australia for more than four weeks must pass a chest X-ray examination unless they are from a country with a low incidence of TB. The object is to protect students in the class-room environment from the possibility of contracting TB through contact with an infected person. The countries designated in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Gazette

         notice are countries in which the incidence of TB is known to be low.

         Thank you for letter of 12 May 1994 raising four matters of concern to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances relating to Statutory Rules Nos 64, 65 and 66 and Export Control Orders No 2 of 1994. These amend, respectively, the Export Inspection and Meat (Establishment Registration Charges) Regulations, the Export Inspection and Meat Charges and Collection Regulations, the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Regulations and the Export Meat Orders.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Standing Committee has asked why certain charges in regard to export meat establishments and domestic meat premises have been reduced under Statutory Rules No 64 and 66. AQlS's charges applying to small premises were significantly reduced from earlier proposals as an interim measure to limit their immediate impact pending the advice of a joint AQIS/industry charging review committee which will consider the most appropriate charging structures for cost recovery.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In regard to Statutory Rules No 65, the Standing Committee has questioned whether decisions made by the Secretary on deferment, refund or remission of charges are subject to Administrative Appeals Tribunal review. There is no express provision that would allow any of these decisions to be referred to the Tribunal for review.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Decisions in regard to the collection of inspection fees or charges are not specified in the Administrative Review Council guidelines as matters excluded from Tribunal review. I understand, however, that the list of exclusions made in the guidelines is not intended to be exhaustive.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If provision were made in the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations which would allow recourse to the AAT for review of such cases, there would be scope for exploitation by persons seeking only to delay payment by this means. Any person aggrieved by a decision under the Regulations could seek review of the decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review Act) 1977.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As AQIS operates on a full cost recovery basis, failure to recover its attributable costs would mean, ultimately, that these would need to be recovered from other clients or funded through the budget process.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For these reasons I believe review by the Tribunal would be inappropriate.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Standing Committee has requested details of the circumstances in which the discretionary powers made in Statutory Rules No 65 in regard to deferment, refund or remission of charges would be exercised by a delegate of the Secretary and of the persons to whom such delegations will be made. I am advised that all the discretionary powers are to be delegated and the delegated powers will reside with the occupants of a small number of AQIS Senior Executive Service positions in Canberra.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In regard to the Export Control Orders No 2 of 1994, the Standing Committee has indicated that paragraphs 139A.2(b) and 139A.3(c) appear to confer powers that are legislative. AQIS has now obtained advice from the Office of General Counsel, Attorney-General's Department regarding the validity of suborders 139A.1, 139A.2 and 139A.3 of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         and a copy is enclosed.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The advice indicates neither paragraph 139A.2(b) nor 139A.3(c) constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Export Control Orders No 2 of 1994 amend provisions in the Export Meat Orders on national controls on the slaughter of animals treated with hormonal growth promotants (HGPs). The national controls are of major importance to Australia as some countries such as the members of the European Union (EU) have placed bans on the use of HGPs and on meat derived from treated animals. Following a review of these controls by EU officials, it became necessary for the controls to be strengthened if Australia was to retain access to these markets. The means of strengthening the controls was agreed to through the work of a joint industry/State/AQIS working party. The draft amendment was widely canvassed and has the support of both industry and the States.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The amendment serves to bring into effect the necessary changes to Commonwealth legislation. It also provides the administrative flexibility essential for the controls to work by providing discretionary powers, including those provided by paragraphs 139A.2(b) and 139A.3(c).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Paragraph 139A.2(b) allows for the declaration of countries other than those specified under order 452 of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Export Meat Orders
         </emphasis>
         . Order 452 calls up an AQIS publication Volume 2 of the "Australian Export Meat Manual" entitled "Requirement for Overseas Countries". Volume 2 details those requirements essential for meat to enter a given country. Paragraph 139A.2(b) provides a mechanism to put in place new importing country requirements immediately they become effective in anticipation of a later formal amendment to the entry for that country in the manual.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Paragraph 139A.3(c) serves to accommodate the variation in national controls as applied at the State level. States have, to a varying extent, developed their own control arrangements reflecting existing legislative powers and available resources. It is not practical to legislate precisely for each State system in place, or that could be put in place.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Accordingly, paragraph 139A.3(c) provides for the various forms that the declaration furnished by the occupier may take, namely by means of a written statement using an approved form, by means of an identification tag attached to the animal itself or by another means as may be necessary to approve from time to time.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If a new system of national controls were to be implemented, that system would be the subject of an amendment to the Orders in accordance with established practice.

I simply want to continue the comments that I was prevented from making in last night's adjournment debate by Senator Ian Macdonald's urgency to comment on the issue.

         I commend to honourable senators the document that I tabled yesterday, which is a brief that has been put together by the North Queensland Conservation Council. It contains an excellent summary of the environmental concerns that have caused the local community and the environment movement to press for a reconsideration of the approval to let this development go ahead. Because that contains a very explicit and ample account of environmental concerns, I will not go over the matters mentioned in the document. However, I would mention that the document also contains a copy of the submission of the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Sport and Territories to the Queensland Office of the Co-ordinator General, in which it was made quite clear that there are very serious environmental concerns that are required to be addressed before this proposal goes ahead. I also commend that submission to honourable senators.

         The other issue I wish to raise is the lack of consultation of Aboriginal people with regard to this development at Oyster Point. People may not be aware that this unique and ancient area, where World Heritage values have been noted, is just outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority area. Aboriginal people and local people are still using 1,500-year-old fish traps which are so well designed they allow for the catching and the maintenance of the marine life without disruption to the marine environment. The fish traps are joined together by oysters that have grown into their structure. The main beach is full of middens and stone tools which are in danger of damage from the numerous tourists going through the area. It remains a very vulnerable area. At the moment there is little capacity to police the area and make sure that camping does not occur on top of burial grounds and shell middens.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is of major concern that there has been very little Aboriginal involvement in the tourist permits that have been issued. The Aboriginal people, the Bandjin people, have had no opportunity to share their thoughts on what would be appropriate and ecologically sensitive development and tourism. They would like the current development stopped and new consultations initiated to look at environmentally and culturally sensitive ways in which to allow tourists into this very valuable area. In earlier days the Bandjin people were forced from Hinchinbrook Island, which was their area. They still visit it and they still maintain a cultural contact. As a result of that, they will be making a native title claim.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The full extent of the involvement and the significance of the area is yet to be determined. That is a very important reason why development should not go ahead. I think that more and more information will emerge. The difficulty is that, because the Queensland state government has given approval for this development, it is likely that damaging construction work will occur prior to the completion of the independent assessment of how the development will affect world heritage values of the area, which was requested by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). It is very important that the Senate realise that the development must not go ahead before proper investigation is made into it.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I call on the federal minister for the environment to instigate a full inquiry into the proposed Port Hinchinbrook Oyster Point development in North Queensland. We certainly welcome his request for an independent assessment. It is certainly appropriate. However, it is not enough to protect the values of this area or to do justice to the Aboriginal people who, for many hundreds and hundreds of years, have occupied this area and who as yet have not been heard adequately in relation to how this development will impact on their land.

         —Most reasonable people would think that by the time one had turned 90 years of age, one would be able to live life peacefully without having to go to a local senator to get redress of a matter. I raise this matter this morning, which was brought to me by the son of the woman concerned, in the hope that I can attract the attention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who has not yet replied to the letter I wrote to him on 20 May this year pointing out what had occurred. I shall tell the Senate this story as briefly as I can. My constituent is a war widow and lives in a retirement hostel in Canberra and, as I said, is over 90 years of age. This is a matter for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs as this woman, being a war widow, has certain entitlements.

         In May of last year she was told by her doctor that she needed a specially made pair of shoes because of her difficulties. She put in the appropriate application to the department for the shoes to which she would be entitled. When she received the shoes, they did not fit. They were returned to the maker to be refitted and stretched, or to have something done to enable her to wear them. When the shoes came back, they still did not fit.

         The doctor then suggested that it would be in her interests to have a pair of sports shoes—running shoes with a soft sole. He felt that might make it easier for her to overcome her difficulty in getting a pair of shoes made to fit her comfortably. So an application was made to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for a pair of sports shoes. She was advised to return the other pair of shoes for refitting and repair.

         The doctor said that the shoes made for her were still totally unsatisfactory and repeated his suggestion that she would be better off with a pair of sports shoes. Of course, sports shoes would be the cheaper option. The custom-made orthopaedic shoes would cost about $300, or even more if they needed to be adjusted several times while the sports shoes are in the vicinity of $90 to $120, much cheaper.

         To date, the shoes which she cannot wear have been refitted four times, all of them unsuccessful, but the department still will not purchase for her, or provide the funding for, a pair of sports shoes which she could be fitted with quite easily and wear comfortably. As a result, she has had to wear slippers. Slippers have their place in life. At times, nothing is more comfortable than a pair of slippers, especially when they go with a nice open fire. But I believe it is very demoralising and depressing to have to wear slippers all the time, which she should not have to do because it is not necessary. She would be comfortable in a pair of sports shoes, would have more self-respect and feel better dressed but she has been forced to choose between a totally uncomfortable pair of shoes, if she wants to be dressed in that fashion, and slippers.

         As I said, on 20 May I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs telling him that I regarded the story as unacceptable. I asked him to personally look into the matter, as I believe it is a matter of urgency, certainly for my constituent. So far I have not had any response. After checking this morning with my constituent, I find she still does not have appropriate shoes to which she is entitled as a war widow. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Resources (Senator Sherry), who is present in the chamber, will take up the matter with the minister.

         I hope that he sees it is a matter of urgency and will urge the minister to see it likewise, The minister should use his discretion to say to the department, `Get this woman a pair of appropriately fitting sports shoes within a week.' This matter would then be resolved.

        (3) Australian Heritage Commission records indicate that the AHC did, in fact, advise the Council in advance of its intention to interim-list places in the Southern Forest Region. A letter of notification about the intended listings was sent to the Shire of Manjimup, dated 8 February 1994. The Commission, in conjunction with CALM, also held a public meeting, as early as February 1992, to inform the local community about the regional assessment project.

The home-owners resident in the area were not identified in the data on private landowners obtained from the Department of Conservation and Land Management and the statutory obligation of the Commission to provide a notice of intention to enter a place in the Register does not apply to those places that have already been listed in the past—as was Windy Harbour in 1978.

The final model was endorsed by both WAFF and the National Farmers' Federation. The role of the Heritage Model Committee was to provide local input as required. I provide the honourable senator with a brief background to the series of events which led to this outcome.

        A version of the model was requested at a public meeting in June 1993, by members of both the local community and the Heritage Model Committee, which made provision for the right of private landowners to veto any proposed recognition of national estate values. The question of veto had been extensively explored by the Heritage Model Committee prior to this meeting, including seeking the advice of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. It was made clear at that time that such a proviso would run counter to the Commission's statutory obligations and past practices as defined in its Act. The power of veto for the protection of individual rights should not be considered a pre-requisite for community involvement in the identification of the National Estate, since there is no question of listing infringing such rights.

        Notwithstanding this clear advice, the model, as proposed at the public meeting, was presented for consideration at the 98th meeting of the Australian Heritage Commission on 26-27 August 1993. The Commission considered the veto proposal at length—along with the Attorney-General's Department advice on the matter—and determined that the power of veto by an individual property owner was not within the purview of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. It did, however, endorse a model for community participation that was consistent with its obligations under this Act. The Commission and WAFF agreed that the endorsed model was in line with their joint agreement of March 1992. This model was, subsequently, also endorsed by the National Farmers' Federation.

        (6) The Australian Heritage Commission did not ignore the suggested power of veto over listing which was requested by members of the Heritage Model Committee. After due consideration of this request and having sought the legal advice of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, the Chairman and Commissioners of the AHC determined that the adoption of the veto proposal would be contrary to the statutory requirements imposed by the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975.

        (7) The Heritage Model Committee established two models. One for future regional assessments and one for the Southern Forests project. This was done in recognition of the fact that it was not possible to apply the former model retrospectively in the Southern Forest Region and that subsequent assessments would involve the community more fully. The latter model, which was devised to take into account the Commission's community participation program over the past eighteen months, has been adhered to.

        (8) The Australian Heritage Commission has a statutory obligation to allow for a minimum three-month objection period following the interim-listing of places on the Register of the National Estate. The 9 June 1994 deadline is in accordance with that obligation as it will be three months since the public notification of the interim-listings was announced on 8 March 1994. The Commission, however, is prepared to consider detailed submissions beyond the 9 June deadline if the nature of any objections received by that date requires it.

        (9) Windy Harbour was originally registered in 1978 as part of the then `Proposed South Coast National Park' whose boundaries were those recommended by State Cabinet in 1976. The area was then nominated for national estate listing by the State Government and entered in the Register without objection. The recent joint AHC/CALM regional assessment identified a range of national estate values across the D'Entrecasteaux area including Windy Harbour.

Prior to 1994, Capital Support funding was provided as a national pool for which non-government schools and centres competed on a project submission basis. In 1994 an allocation of $1,644,000 is available for access by non-government centres. This was calculated on the basis of the non-government centres' share of Capital Support funds from 1991 to 1993. The non-government school sectors were allocated funding on the basis of students with disabilities enrolments in 1993.
