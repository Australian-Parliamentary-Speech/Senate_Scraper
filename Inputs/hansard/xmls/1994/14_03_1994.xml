The fact therefore is that we are down to one per cent. I would have thought that any system that could deliver for 99 per cent of those who go through its doors is doing phenomenally well. However, I take the view that if there is even one per cent who ought to be treated better we have an obligation to improve the system further and get to them as well.

         That stands in stark contrast to the opposition's health policy; we still do not know what it is. Senator Woods, who was the former opposition health spokesman when a member of the House of Representatives, has just been appointed to the Senate. His health policy was ditched last year. The opposition still does not have one. I notice, however, that Senator Bishop is trying to help the opposition out, but we might have more to say about that later today.

         —There have been such reports recently, not least because I recently had the opportunity publicly to release a study by the East Asia analytical unit of my department, entitled `Changing tack: Australian investment in South-East Asia'. The report showed, as Senator Childs correctly stated, that, while Australian trade with South-East Asian countries has been growing very strongly over the past decade—it has made a very significant contribution to Australian economic growth—the reverse has happened to investment. Australian investors' relative interest in ASEAN countries has fallen throughout the 1980s. There has been a focus instead on Europe and the United States.

         There are some very understandable reasons for that, particularly in relation to the 1992 situation in Europe. It is, nevertheless, contrary to one's expectation and an indication that opportunities in the region are being lost. Obviously it is not for the government to decide where to invest. Those are decisions for companies and enterprises, based on their judgments of the commercial factors of any decisions they are making. But the report does highlight that there are opportunities in South-East Asia which may be appropriately considered by Australian business. The reason for initiating the report and for now promoting it is that we want business to consider taking up those opportunities.

         One of the most important things is that the report, hopefully and I think finally, puts to rest the view that in some way investment overseas—in this instance, investment in South-East Asia—costs jobs in Australia. In fact, it makes it quite clear that most Australian investors in South-East Asia source at least some of the inputs for their offshore operations from Australia. So, rather than diverting productive activity from Australia, much of this investment is driving exports, boosting production and creating more jobs in Australia.

         This is not in any way a blanket endorsement that every Australian firm should invest in the region. Each one has to make its own judgment on its own circumstances and on the opportunities in front of it. But the clear message is that investment in South-East Asia will be a very important part of Australia's trade and economic strategy collectively and for many of the companies which go to make up the Australian economy.

         There are a number of recommendations in the report and it is particularly important that they be considered at the Commonwealth-state trade and investment forum scheduled for July. The recommendations are designed to improve information, to assist in the development of networks and to build on Australia's advantages in the region. So I think it is a very important report. It does not provide all the answers, but it raises some issues which are fundamental and central to the development of Australia's trade and economic strategy, particularly in relation to South-East Asia.

         I have had cause to look already, although it requires some more examination, at some of the claims made on that last day. Senator Campbell extended the definition of marginal seats out to 8 1/2 per cent—I do not know of any political party that ever considered that. I then worked out, knowing how bad those opposite are going, that 8 1/2 per cent is something they have to consider. They have to look at every one of them because they are all in strife.

The labour force figures released confirm that economic recovery is generating sustained employment growth. During February, the number of full-time jobs rose by 39,800 and total employment increased by 14,400. Employment is now 217,500 higher than a year ago. Unemployment is down by 34,600 over the past year. Employment growth is flowing to both full-time and part-time jobs. It is pleasing that, over the last six months, a clear growth trend has emerged for full-time jobs. In the last six months, full-time employment has grown by 96,900 and part-time employment has grown by 54,500. These are all excellent signs of growth in the economy.

Female employment is 46,500, or 1.4 per cent, higher than at the peak of the business cycle in July 1990. Female full-time employment has grown by 50,800, or 2.7 per cent, during the past year.

         On 4 March this year the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance jointly announced a due diligence process for ANL. I am not going to confirm what cabinet decisions may or may not have been made last year, but if there had been one, as reported, that was made in June of 1993, it has been quite clearly superseded by the decision of February this year and announced in March by the minister.

The facts are the opposite. The majority of parents become sole parents as a result of divorce or breakdown of de facto relationships.

         The average age of a sole parent—this might entertain the Senate—is about 33 for women and 38 for men. The average number of children of a sole parent pensioner is about 1.8, near enough to two children. The average duration on the sole parent pension is about 3.4 years for women. Many sole parents use the sole parent pension merely as crisis management and a large number give up the pension within three months—that is, they are on the pension for only three months. Very importantly, teenage sole parents make up only three per cent of sole parent pensioners. That figure is actually down from nine per cent in 1980. That is in line with the trend of declining numbers of teenagers giving birth.

         The government has been very concerned to see that all social security recipients are assisted. It has three main aims—adequacy of payments, targeting those most in need, and encouraging people on the pension to move off the pension and to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The JET program has done that with very great success.

         The JET program, as people would know, covers three portfolios: the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the child-care section of the Department of Human Services and Health. It assists sole parent pensioners and their families by providing information and counselling, directing those people to the appropriate training, study or even employment, and arranging child care.

         The program quite clearly has put paid to any notion that sole parents are unmotivated or do not want to get off the pension. In fact, the evidence shows quite the opposite. In the six months from July to December last year, some 7,600 JET clients gained jobs, an increase of around 50 per cent over the same period in 1992-93 and nearly 180 per cent higher than in the same period in 1991-92. It is clear that sole parents participating in JET are getting a good share of the expanding job market to which my colleague Senator Schacht just referred. In addition, nearly 4,200 sole parent pensioners have taken up education and over 12,000 have taken up opportunities to train through a labour market program.

It is interesting that when parliament resumed the minister told us that this was last year's issue, yet it seems to have made some ground since then. Is the minister saying to us that, without any consultation with senior ministers—or in particular the Prime Minister—it was cabinet practice for a minister to be able to vary a direction to expend money over two years to just three months immediately prior to an election? Is the minister really suggesting to the Senate that we accept that the former minister did this off her own bat without any consultation with or direction from cabinet colleagues? Can the minister indicate whether, if a minister takes that course of action, it is necessary to get the approval of the Department of Finance for the committal of such a sum of money in such a short period?

Far from that; it is always, `Give the money to people with a quid who vote for us'—and the opposition talks about political corruption! The opposition has the hide to talk about it when it has developed policy after policy to put money in the hands of those who already have plenty.

         In respect of the proposals that were put to me by the Queensland grain growers association to effectively have the state delivered element of RAS delivered as part of a single body and to have a more cohesive method of delivering it, as I said publicly at the time, that proposal in my view does have merit.

         Currently, the Commonwealth funds RAS very extensively. I think the current budget is in the order of $176 million of Commonwealth funding to RAS. If there is a better way of delivering that assistance to farmers we are certainly prepared to consider it; but the agencies that actually deliver it on the ground are agencies of the state government. Again I stress—because I made it very clear while I was in Queensland—that it will effectively be a decision of the Queensland state government as to whether the proposal has merit or not. But I will be communicating that to the Queensland government this week and I will be quite keenly awaiting its response.

         Access to superannuation has improved dramatically for women. It has risen from 40 per cent in 1988 to about 88 per cent in 1992 for women employed full-time, and it has risen from nine per cent to 55 per cent for women employed part-time. The 40- to 50-year age group has shown the most significant increase of women into the work force. Between 1982 and 1993, the participation rates have gone from 47 per cent to 65 per cent for married women aged 45 to 54, and from 60 per cent to 69 per cent for single women in the same age group.

         The government has not just introduced this change willy-nilly; it has introduced this change because it is very aware of the dramatically increasing labour force participation rate of women and their increasing access to superannuation. At the same time, it realises that, if it was introduced too rapidly, it could cause a very large economic upset for a number of women. That is why it is phased in over 20 years.

         —It is not often that we get a question like this. When we do we ought to pause and remember the total, absolute, complete and overwhelming hypocrisy of the opposition. This was the opposition that obstructed the last budget, which had in it a deficit reduction program, going through. Now it is the opposition that pretends, in this question, to be worried about what the deficit level will be. This is the opposition that tried to prevent a medium-term deficit reduction program being adopted by this government. Opposition members cannot have it both ways. They cannot vote one way in here and speak another way out there. They will be held up by this government to that hypocrisy every time.

         This is a ridiculous question. Everyone knows that the answer to it will be contained in the budget on 10 May. This is a question that goes into the bin as one that is fishing and trawling for budget development information. I might add that the first section of this question relies on a lot of statistics related to the performance of the Stock Exchange and the speculation related to that. One would have to be fairly silly to try to answer a question about reading what the meaning of the volatile circumstances in the Stock Exchange has to do with the current economic situation, because that has been up and down all the time while all of the long-term indicators for economic growth in this country have been steadily rising and while we as a government have had to revise upwards the major indicators for the budget. The best that can be said of this question is that we ought to leave it at that point and ignore the rest of it.

         —When the Conroy review was released and tabled in parliament, I announced that I accepted the thrust of the recommendations but would not make any commitment to individual recommendations and would seek considered consultation with my department, including, of course, Customs. When I met with Customs management and the unions in Customs, I made it clear that I wanted full consultation throughout the full organisation of Customs—from senior management to the ordinary staff members at all levels. As part of that commitment, I said I would be willing to participate in discussions with Customs staff to get their views about individual recommendations.

         In the last four or five weeks I have had the opportunity to visit and speak to staff of the Customs Service at broad meetings in each of the capital cities of Australia, including Canberra. My staff estimate that I have spoken to and heard comments from around 2,000 Customs staff during those meetings. I have also had meetings for lengthy periods with the PSU delegates in each of the capital cities.

Within the Customs Service more than 400 submissions have been received from either individual members of staff or groups of staff at the workplace commenting about the recommendations.

         I have found the consultation process to be extremely worth while. An overwhelming majority of staff members accept the need for change in various aspects of customs administration. They feel rather aggrieved and believe that some of the criticisms in the report should have been directed more at management than at them as the ordinary staff. Many of them are concerned about the recommendations dealing with redundancies, and the suggestion in the report that there may be 1,000 to 1,400 redundancies. They are responding in detail to that recommendation.

         I believe that a good atmosphere for change is developing amongst Customs Service staff members. They realised that the Midford-Paramount case last year was not a good episode for the Customs Service and that they have to get on with the job of change. I am very encouraged by that. I am very pleased to be able to take part in those discussions. I am told by customs staff that I may be the first minister for customs in its long history to have actually gone through such a process of meeting so many staff members. Overall, I think we have the basis to get a good outcome on the report, because it is leading to the acceptance by customs staff that the reform process has to be driven as much from the bottom up as from the top down.

I am aware that with regard to a number of ministers there have been security arrangements made, and that is not unusual. It is not a new practice; it has been a practice for as long as I am aware of Australian governments and state governments—all the Liberal state governments do the same—and so they should. All security arrangements of which I have ever been aware have been made on the basis of recommendations by the Australian Protective Service and as a result of security assessments made by it, as they should be.

         Certainly, when ministers who are in the middle of controversial matters about which there is public notoriety have their address and a photograph of their house printed in the newspaper, they are entitled to be concerned about their security. It was an entirely unreasonable and improper thing for that newspaper to do. I do not blame Mrs Kelly, although I understand that took place after this incident, but I do think there are serious security issues that need properly to be addressed. I make no apology whatsoever for the fact that the government has taken steps from time to time—whether it is my portfolio responsibility or not—to protect the security of ministers and others. To the best of my knowledge, there has never been, in all the time that it has been done under Liberal and Labor governments, anything taken out because—

         —There are three questions here, and the short answers to all three of them are: yes, yes and yes. In order that justice be done to this important question, I should say that this is a good example of the partnerships for development program working. This is a strategic alliance that is being formed between an international company and a domestic Australian company that enhances the capacity of both—and particularly enhances the capacity of the domestic Australian company, Exicom, which is by any test a best practice company, a world standard company, a company that Australia should be proud of, but a company that by forming this strategic alliance has increased its reach into the export market, particularly in Asia and the Persian Gulf. This is exactly what this partnership program sets about to do.

         In the last week we sat I mentioned that ERG and the  Nokia telecommunications company are doing exactly the same as Exicom and NorTel, and of course NCR, Datacraft and Stallion Technology are other examples of some companies in Australia forming a strategic alliance with an international company, this time in the field of computing. The partnerships program is about expanding Australian-based research and development and manufacturing, it is about boosting information technology in Australia and creating exports in that very important field, and it is about integrating Australian-based information technology into the telecommunications global network.

         I conclude my answer by giving some fairly salutary figures about what all this means in real dollars for an Australian company, and thus in jobs for Australian workers. In 1992-93 Exicom's turnover and exports grew on the previous year. Turnover grew from $133 million to $156 million while exports increased from $19 million to $26 million. Nearly 70 per cent of Exicom's Villawood exports increase went to Asian markets: China, Pakistan and Taiwan. New markets for Exicom include an order from NorTel for P-phone handsets worth $US30 million in the first year, and they will be distributed in Canada and the United States. It has cracked, from Australia, what is a high technology market.

         Exicom's Villawood plant now employs nearly 650 Australians. During next year 50 new jobs will be created because of this new contract. NorTel has established a significant research and development facility at Wollongong University. By 1997, under this program, NorTel expects to spend $20 million on local research and development for high technology in telecommunications in Australia. Its exports are up as a consequence. It is a good example of a government program working and bringing good quality, high technology jobs to Australia.

         As I stated in my preliminary comments on this matter, the principle which applies for all DAS businesses in competing with private sector providers for private sector work is the principle of competitive neutrality. This entails the application of all statutory charges, and equivalent taxes to DAS businesses in order to put them on an even footing with their private sector competitors and it is a principle endorsed in the Hilmer Report. The commercialisation of DAS has given the private sector access to potential income in excess of $800m annually, which was not available before commercialisation and for which DAS businesses now compete in open competition.

          —During and after question time on 3 March 1994, three matters were raised with me by honourable senators. Senator Robert Ray asked that I look at questions which referred to individuals in pejorative terms, such as `discredited', `notorious' and so forth. Such terms in referring to members of this parliament or those of a state or territory parliament or to other protected office holders may be out of order under standing order 193 and the chair may rule accordingly. That standing order, however, does not protect persons other than the office holders listed in the standing order. The question which gave rise to Senator Ray's intervention referred to a person not protected by the standing order. I again refer honourable senators, as I did on 10 February 1994, to the Senate's privilege resolution No. 9, which enjoins honourable senators to exercise their privilege of freedom of speech responsibly and with regard to the rights of others.

          Senator Panizza asked me to examine certain remarks made by Senator McKiernan which Senator Panizza claims could be interpreted as a threat against other senators. Senator McKiernan, in effect, indicated that he would make damaging remarks about other persons, including members of the Western Australian parliament, if opposition senators continue to make certain remarks about members of the government. Senator McKiernan's remarks were not out of order as he did not threaten to do anything other than exercise his right of speech in a certain way. Senators Panizza and McKiernan and all senators would do well, however, to have regard to the Senate's privilege resolution No. 9, to which I have previously referred.

          Senator Ian Macdonald sought information about the office of the caucus secretariat, which occupies offices in the Senate wing of Parliament House. In 1978 the government members committee support secretariat was established within the Department of Administrative Services. At that time it was part of the staff allocation of the then Liberal-National Party government. After the 1983 general election, the secretariat became known as the caucus secretariat. The five staff of the secretariat are employed under the provisions of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984. These staff are part of the staff allocation of the government party under the scheme introduced in 1978.

          The secretariat initially occupied offices in the former Hotel Kurrajong. In 1981 the Department of the House of Representatives agreed to supply office facilities to the secretariat, which continued to be housed in the Hotel Kurrajong, then controlled by the parliamentary departments. The secretariat was given offices in the House of Representatives wing when the parliament moved to the new Parliament House in 1988.

          The first Keating ministry in 1993 increased the number of ministers in the Senate and reduced the number of ministers in the House of Representatives. With the greater need for offices in the House of Representatives, my predecessor agreed to the secretariat occupying a vacant senator's suite. Office facilities and equipment for the secretariat are provided by the Department of the House of Representatives generally from stores which are surplus to the department's requirements. Telephone and facsimile charges are met by the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff.

Accordingly, a motion to take note of an answer is a debate that does take place as part of the 30 minutes allocated each day for debates of this kind. In that sense, Senator Baume is right in concluding, as he did, that this is cutting into that time.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Tambling this day, relating to informal voting in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission election.

       <para>
        Perhaps I should indicate that it was a non-answer, as the minister has had to take the question on notice and seek the information that is required. I remind the Senate and Senator Collins that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission elections were held on Saturday, 4 December 1993. We are now addressing this issue some 3 1/2 months later. The election to which I referred, the ward of Nhulunbuy South, was declared on 14 January 1994. I would have anticipated that ATSIC would have precipitated some action in this regard. This issue was raised with me at Nhulunbuy on 25 January this year. I discussed it with officers of ATSIC at Nhulunbuy and was informed at that time that it was likely that a new election would be called. Therefore, I was appalled today when Senator Collins was not able to acknowledge any information on this issue.

         —The question I put to Senator Collins today was very much his portfolio. It related to what ATSIC initiatives were now being taken on this issue. Last week the Australian Electoral Commission issued an electoral news file, No. 39, dated February 1994. That news file summarised the various ATSIC elections all around Australia. In it were the Northern Territory results, which included the three wards of Nhulunbuy—Nhulunbuy East, Nhulunbuy South and Nhulunbuy West.

         In respect of the ward that I raised during question time today—Nhulunbuy South—four people were named as the successful candidates: Timothy Lalara, Nancy (Burgoyne) Lalara, Samuel Numamurdirdi and Lindsay Joshua. Let me indicate that I take no particular offence at any of those people being named. But what I do take offence at is the way in which this matter has been allowed to drag on, given that it was well known to the Electoral Commission and ATSIC well before the declaration of the poll.

         I have been able to ascertain that the problems arose because the ballot papers were not put in the required declaration envelopes but inserted straight into the ballot box. Despite the fact that the Electoral Commission team that visited Nhulunbuy had been trained, for some time it chose not to carry out this important procedure. At some date before 14 January it was known to the Electoral Commission that this procedure was to be adopted. In fact, it was incorrectly not adopted.

         —is a very important omission of an important fundamental electoral principle. It is staggering that this matter has been allowed to drag on. As I said earlier, this matter was known to ATSIC. It was certainly conveyed to me on 25 January by staff at Nhulunbuy. I am, therefore, alarmed that the minister was not able to react today during question time. I would have thought Mr Tickner would have provided Senator Collins with an appropriate brief and response on this issue. It is not good enough for the government to now camouflage very important points of principle with regard to an election—the fact that there are over 800 people eligible to vote in this particular ward.

         I note from the detailed news file that the turnout in that electorate was 57.87 per cent and that the actual number of voters was 489. However, 477 votes were rejected. That meant that 10 formal votes and two informal votes were recorded. There was, therefore, a quota of three for the election. But, of course, the quota was not used—the names were picked out of a hat.

         I remind the Senate that the form shows that, whilst there were four vacancies in this ward, there were 10 nominations. This makes a mockery of Australia's election procedures. I would have thought a Labor government, with its high principles in this area, would have determined this matter well in advance of this time.

         —No-one is trying to camouflage anything. I suspect that the question should have been directed to Senator McMullan, the minister who is responsible for the Australian Electoral Commission—the body which conducted and was responsible for the conduct of the elections. The Electoral Commission conducts elections on behalf of a number of organisations. While listening to Senator Tambling's question, I recalled, if my memory is correct, that it had actually conducted the election on behalf of ATSIC. I sought information and discovered that that is the case, and that the electoral difficulties that did occur at Nhulunbuy, which are acknowledged, were officially the responsibility of the AEC. The AEC is answerable to this chamber through Senator McMullan, not me.

         But I sought this advice. I have been advised that the Australian Electoral Commission has acknowledged that there were serious difficulties with the ATSIC elections at Nhulunbuy. The AEC has reported to ATSIC that its staff at the polling stations—mainly locally engaged people—had misunderstood the voting procedures and had, on the face of it, consequently misdirected voters, leading to a large number of informal votes. I am also advised that the 97 per cent informal vote figure has not yet been confirmed by the AEC, although the informal vote is known to be very high.

In addition, a provision in Meat Inspection Orders No. 3 of 1993 provides for the secretary to determine matters about quality assurance, which may be an invalid subdelegation of power.

The committee is concerned about whether there is independent review of these discretions, the exercise of which could have important effects upon individuals.

        Mr Deputy President, all honourable senators have to remember that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, owes his leadership to a commitment to the ALP Left and to some members of the Centre Left not to increase the health tax take for Australians in the form of a co-payment. I am interested to see that the minister in the chamber, who is presumably going to defend the real health minister, is Senator Crowley. She would be proud, I think, to take credit for having swung the numbers behind the Prime Minister in delivering the Prime Ministership to him. The numbers apparently seem to depend upon the co-payment which has been introduced being overturned.

        We all know that the facts of that statement were borne out because as soon as Mr Keating became Prime Minister, he abolished the co-payments. So it is true to say that the price of the leadership, getting the votes to overturn Bob Hawke, was that the co-payment decision be overturned. Now Mr Keating is refusing to rule out an increase in the health tax through the Medicare levy. They are all taxes by one name or the other. Yet on 13 January 1992, in an article quoting the former health minister, Mr Howe, the

         "What the Commonwealth is doing is saying for the next five years we will guarantee a significant increase in terms of funding . . . so I think that means there probably wouldn't be a need for a rise in the Medicare levy because effectively we would have covered the major area.

        It was clearly spelt out prior to the election that Medicare is working. On 5 March, the Prime of Australia Mr Keating, said:

        The funding in Medicare is working.

       <para>
        Nothing could be clearer than that. There was no suggestion then that Medicare was not working, so they needed more money to honour the promises of the new health minister and the need, which was already self-evident at the time of the election, to deal with Medicare and improve it. No, at that time it was concealed from the voters, just as it has been concealed from those who will vote in by-elections in the weeks ahead and those who voted in a by-election last Saturday. They were not told that there was going to be an increase in the Medicare levy. Once again, this Prime Minister was dancing around like a cat on a hot tin roof concealing the truth from the people who would pass judgement on him. I remind the Senate that Mr Hawke, when asked questions about increasing the Medicare levy in August 1991, said:

        This is the mob that got rid of the co-payments arrangements as part of the price for giving the Prime Minister the Prime Ministership. What are they going to do now? They are going to hit the low income people even more than they would have been hit with the previous arrangement for co-payments. That was confirmed by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke.

         These proposed reforms will increase the cost of private health insurance premiums by increasing the costs both to the funds and the hospitals. By that I am talking about the proposals that Senator Richardson put on the table a couple of months ago. He said that the changes will improve our health system by helping private health insurance. But they will not. They will simply add to the exodus from private health insurance. Last year 300,000 people got out of private health insurance, 80,000 in the last three months of the year. The proposals that Senator Richardson has put up will make that exodus a rush.

         Only today a man rang my office and told me that he lives in Baulkham Hills, has three children and is just a battler. He has been onto the Prime Minister's office and he has been onto Senator Richardson's office, telling them that if this increase in the Medicare levy goes ahead he will be forced, despite his wishes, to get out of private health insurance because it will be the last straw that breaks the camel's back—he will have to rely totally on the public health system. It is essentially simply another tax. People like the battler from Baulkham Hills, the elderly, the self-funded retirees who are in such desperate difficulty at present as a result of this government's policies, against their wishes, will end up finding that they cannot afford to pay any kind of an increased levy and private health insurance.

         The levy is symptomatic of the government's cowardice and total failure to realistically attack the problems of private health insurance and that is because it has no other solutions. The logical step would be to boost the numbers going into private health insurance by using financial support measures, but the opposition within the ALP to making private health insurance more attractive will not allow Senator Richardson to even consider such an option. The Medicare levy hike is even more desperate. Those who are hanging onto private insurance will decide that they can no longer afford insurance, a higher Medicare levy, their contribution through their general taxes and the gap payments. They will have to say enough is enough.

         We had the Prime Minister and Senator Richardson going around the country last week spouting contradictory messages about this possible increase. It is certain, as day follows night, that it will be increased in the May budget in some form or other. The last time Senator Richardson increased the levy, which was only July last year—he increased it to 1.4 per cent—he said that it would reduce waiting times at hospitals. That has not happened. There are now about 112,000 people waiting for elective surgery, with more than 30 per cent of these people waiting on those lists for six months. Yet over and over again we have heard the minister dismiss these people waiting in pain as being `only three per cent'. Let me tell the government this: three per cent in pain is three per cent too many.

         The levy rose from one per cent in February 1984 to 1.2 per cent in December 1986 to 1.4 per cent in July last year. The last time the minister said that he had no plans to increase the levy. On the

         The minister to me is very much like a rat in a trap—he is going round and round trying to find solutions to the insoluble. His government will not wear a co-payment. He has been increasingly rationing health care. We have had the queues, I have mentioned, for so-called elective surgery. We have had delays in getting MRI scans; delays in getting the reports on the MRIs; delays in X-rays; delays in CAT scans; and refusal to allow certain important drugs onto the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in an attempt to contain costs. We have seen the attempt to cut out the opticians' tests and the refusal to allow the testing for osteoporosis for women as a diagnostic tool. These are all rationing measures, although the government will not admit them as such.

         So the only other way for this rat in the trap is to break the election promises, do a U-turn on his own May 1993 statement and jack up the Medicare tax. He has spent his year promising more money for Aboriginal health, medical research, mental health and breast cancer—all extremely important issues—but now his day of reckoning is upon him. Where is the money coming from? There is no other solution to get more money into Australia's health system than to take some of the burden off the public sector. By giving financial support to low to middle income earners, only then can these queues be reduced, the rationing of services be reduced and some of the minister's promises at least be honoured.

         The minister is to be pitied, although I guess he would reject the pity. He reminds me of a rat in a trap. He has had to admit that he has lost the support of his Prime Minister. He has been rejected by the Prime Minister publicly on two occasions in recent months for his so-called reform. The so-called power broker of the Labor Party is moving aside for a new entrant to his portfolio.

         I do not think whatever the Prime Minister and I did in the course of the last week did a lot of harm because the swing to the government in the by-election was absolutely unprecedented and says volumes about the opposition and the paucity of its policies. I was asked by some journalists on Friday morning about what the Prime Minister had to say and what I had to say and whether there was a conflict. I said exactly, `I agree with whatever the Prime Minister said'. I support my leader absolutely. I wonder whether any of those opposite would be prepared to say that about their leader.

I note from Senator Newman's utterances that we are getting to the stage where a Liberal Party policy on health might be produced. There is no document that we can point to. All Senator Newman's spokesperson could say is that Mrs Bishop's contribution has been `a collection of our press releases'. We get opposition health policy only through press releases. Every now and again Senator Newman will trot one out. If we look at a press release, we have to discern whether it is a policy.

         The spokesperson for Senator Newman said that what Mrs Bishop had said over the weekend was opposition health policy. That is very disappointing, because this is again in disagreement with Dr Hewson. I have to believe Dr Hewson—he is the leader—not Mrs Bishop, yet, and not Senator Newman, ever.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well, again, we will not be taking the same health policy to the next election. Bulk-billing was a policy. The abolition of bulk-billing was designed to deal with the problem of over-servicing. We will not be proposing that at the next election. We will be maintaining bulk-billing.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not what Mrs Bishop said. She said that it was only for the poor. Dr Hewson also said:

        I think it was fair to say, at the last election, our health policy was pretty much an economic policy, if you like a health funding policy. I want a health care policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Want it he may; but get it he may not. Senator Newman and a whole host of others, now joined by Senator Woods, are not going to cop that health care aspect of it for a moment—not on your nelly; no fear. They do not want anything to do with health care; they want to go back to this hardline economics. But even Senator Newman was, I thought, at one point earlier this year getting close to adopting bulk-billing. She did try. She said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Bulk-billing is not necessarily such a problem if it is truly an effective law that has been introduced. That was one of the big concerns we had, that bulk-billing led to over-servicing.

       <para>
        On 7 January, her spokesperson, who works overtime—this spokesperson gives it a hell of a go—said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The message she is getting is that the policy certainly needs to be reviewed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amen to that. We all have to say absolutely that the policy needs to be reviewed. I am glad Senator Newman is getting that message; I am delighted. Senator Herron has not got that message; he thinks it is perfect as it is. But Senator Newman is getting the message, and that is good. The spokesperson continued:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But the decision to drop the policy is firmly a matter for the party room.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it is firmly a matter for the party room, I suggest that Senator Newman takes it there because all of us would like to know what the policy will be. Will bulk-billing be retained for the poor only or will bulk-billing stay as it is now? We cannot tell from the quotes that I have just read out what the policy will be. I do not think Australians would mind knowing.

The difficulty is that this morning Senator Newman's spokesperson—the one who works all the overtime—said Mrs Bishop was basically right `in line with opposition policy'—in line, but against it, apparently. I do not know who to believe. I find this very perplexing. Here we are trying to discern what the opposition's policy is. Senator Newman says that Dr Hewson is right; she says that Mrs Bishop is right; and then she says that Mrs Bishop is wrong and that Dr Hewson is right. I do not know where to go from there.

         I suspect the truth is, as usual, that the opposition still does not have a health policy and it is not going to get one. Therefore, when people such as Senator Newman get up to have a go at what the government has done on the question of health policy, the difficulty she faces is that she has no basis on which to comment—the opposition has no policy. Dr Woods' policy got thrown out; only Senator Herron still believes in it. Senator Newman does not, but she is not even sure how much of it she does not believe. The only thing about opposition members is that they are never sure what to believe in; they are never sure who to believe; and they are certainly not sure who should lead them. Yet we are supposed to take seriously comments on health policy.

On the other hand, the government that created Medicare has it as the basis of health policy, and we are proud of it. The only thing that I would seek to do, would be to add to it. Certainly, after 10 years, I am not saying that everything is perfect. If there are something like 30,000 Australians waiting for longer than six months, I think that is inappropriate and it is something that we should work on. It is worth acknowledging that that is something the whole of government in Australia—the federal government, the state governments, which run the hospitals, and the Commonwealth government—should address. Next week when there is a meeting of health ministers in Perth, we will be addressing some of the issues.

         As I said in question time, we need to address the numbers, distribution and training of surgeons because that, at least in part, does it. We will be spending $25 million a year over the next four years, which we will be directing to making sure that the numbers on waiting lists go down and that some patients, who were not going to be dealt with otherwise, are dealt with now in a hurry. That is tangible evidence of what we are doing. But in the opposition's case, it cannot even agree on whether or not to abolish bulk-billing or how much of it. No-one has a clue what Senator Newman is talking about because she does not have a clue herself. If she does not have a clue, what she ought to do is get one and get one fast.

         The opposition is basically arguing that the private health system is the way to go. The Australian Democrats argue, `Yes, we have a private system and it has a place'. Many of the needs that have now been identified will not be met by private health insurance, but some of them need the cooperation of the private health insurance industry.

         Moving on, we can see the needs, which have already been talked about today by the two previous speakers, of the public hospital system. Increasing some coverage by the private health insurance industry—and even the minister's own package—will do little but put a floor under the number of people leaving private health insurance. It will do nothing for the unmet needs that already exist, particularly in the areas of infrastructure spending, the provision of new pieces of equipment, the upgrading of existing hospitals and the provision of hospital beds to the outlying suburbs in our larger cities.

         I go back again to some of Senator Newman's earlier arguments that somehow by supporting the private health insurance industry everything will be fixed. I suggest to Senator Newman that what we really should be fixing is the private health insurance industry itself. We have just had a period in this country where industry after industry has been encouraged to modernise and to reform. Micro-economic reform was one of catchcries and one of the common terms we heard. The private health insurance industry somehow seems to have missed out. If we look at its profit performance we see a steadily increasing level of profit and virtually no effort whatsoever at more efficient, effective practices; no effort to be more accountable; and, if we listen to some of the private hospitals, no real effort to meet their changing needs to ensure different procedures are carried out in different ways to ensure shorter periods of stay in hospital. This applies right across the board in a variety of private hospitals. I refer particularly to the need to change insurance practices for mental health.

         Senator Newman's urgency motion today referred to `causing even greater damage to private health insurance'. I want to stress that I believe it is the private health insurance industry itself that is damaging private health insurance. People and families are actually voting with their feet now. They have done their sums. They see that if they put that money in the bank then they have a chance each year to afford quite a number of days in a private hospital—and indeed if their condition were any more serious they would end up in a public hospital anyway. So they are actually making a quite rational decision to leave private health insurance.

It should become more competitive. It should be offering a far wider variety of insurance options. It should be listening not just to members of the public who are voting with their feet but to doctors and particularly the private hospitals which are asking for different types of cover and different types of support.

Perhaps in that way pressure would come from members of the public for the government to be a little more accountable in terms of where their money is going. I think, if the community realised how much it is already paying for Medicare through the tax system, we would have a number of areas that the government would need to check again, to be a little more open and a little more public about.

What exactly is the minister doing? Is he preparing the way for somebody else to take over the portfolio?

         Senator Richardson did not reply to one point raised—not one. He did not even attempt to, because he would have been defending the indefensible. It was his usual puffed up, self-important arrogance that he goes on with when trying to defend something. His best defence is attack. The reality is that we know what has occurred in relation to this country with regard to the health system: there has been a deliberate policy of rationing. No more money as a percentage of gross domestic product has been spent on health care in the last 13 years—no more at all. We have rationing in the community, and he talks about the small percentage on waiting lists. Of course there is a small percentage on waiting lists because doctors are so busy doing the acute work that has to be done—anybody who develops a cancer in this country gets precedence.

I would cringe when I was there and have to say to a poor pensioner, `I am sorry, you have to wait 18 months for your operation'. Does anyone know what the pensioner would say? The pensioner would say, `Thank you, doctor'. Some were so grateful to have something done that they did not question the system. They thought that was their lot. I got angry when that happened.

Nothing—not a single thing. I was appalled when I saw the burns unit at the Royal Brisbane Hospital the other day. It was there when I was a resident 30 years ago.

Look at what has happened in relation to the Aboriginal community in that regard: 257,000 people in the country have gone backwards because more money has been thrown at them—over $1,000 million a year. There needs to be fundamental reform, which is our policy. Senator Richardson said that we do not have a policy.

        The intention of the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, to increase the Medicare levy, thereby breaking yet another of the Government's election promises, and causing even greater damage to private health insurance and the health care of all Australians.

        The motion immediately triggers the question: is it the intention of the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to raise the levy? I think the wording of the motion betrays the lack of knowledge of the opposition—possibly including Senator Newman—about how decisions are made in the government. This decision would be part of the budget, so it must be a part of a cabinet decision—as all decisions are—based on discussion with cabinet subcommittees and with caucus, and informed by discussions and consultations with and feedback from the community.

         The feedback that I am getting in my office and as I travel around Victoria, which I am passing on, is that most people have no argument with raising the levy, as long as it is applied progressively to income; in other words, it is not necessarily hitting the poor, as Senator Herron and others have suggested it would. Such a rise, indeed, might lessen the need for private health insurance. But would that necessarily be a negative? People do not have to have private insurance. I, like many Australians, choose not to have private health cover, although I do have cover for services not covered by Medicare, such as dental care. I would hope that some of the health services which are at present outside Medicare might be able to be included if funding were increased.

         It was accepted by a review of Medicare benefits undertaken in the mid-1980s that services covered should be expanded if the funding were available. I will mention one such service—and Senator Lees has already referred to it—and that is clinical psychology. As a counselling psychologist before I entered parliament, I often unwillingly had to refer patients for psychiatric treatment when their needs would have been better met by a clinical psychologist—but then they would have had to pay the full charge.

         If we want to cut hospital waiting lists and improve service provision, particularly in states like Victoria, where the present state government is cutting services, there is a need to give greater support to service provision for all Australians, not just those who can afford to take out private insurance. So I am much more concerned about possible damage to the health care of Australians than I am about possible damage to private health insurance.

         The aim of our government is to improve the health care of all Australians. In my view, this is more likely to be enhanced by the maintenance of the services available to all Australians, whether or not they can afford it and/or whether or not they choose to have private health cover. If that maintenance necessitates an increase in the Medicare levy, that is surely preferable to the alternative which seems to be implied in this motion; that is, that people should pay for private insurance rather than pay more for Medicare.

I personally would have no problems with an increased levy on higher income earners, such as all of us in this chamber, should a decision be made to raise the income ceiling so that the percentage of income going to the levy becomes more equitable by increasing it as income increases.

         It is precisely because we are keeping our election promises that there may be a need for some increase in the levy for some of us. Some of those promises now being implemented are the inclusion in Medicare of bone densitometry for people at risk of osteoporosis, a dental program for health card holders and an additional $57.7 million over the next four years for palliative care, to cite just a few examples. This is in stark contrast to opposition policies at the time of the election, exactly one year ago, as Senator Richardson has said.

         It was my experience during that campaign, particularly in opposition held country electorates, that it was the opposition health policies, including its Medicare policies, which together with the GST were turning voters away from it in droves. These were often voters from its own traditional base. I speak of country Victoria. This was particularly so in relatively isolated rural areas without access to community health centres, an initiative of a previous Labor government in the 1970s, or public hospital facilities. These facilities, of course, are shrinking rapidly in Victoria under the Kennett government.

         From talking to people when I have been overseas, to overseas visitors in this country and particularly to migrants coming from overseas, it is continually emphasised to me that we are the envy of most other countries for the security of health cover available to us through Medicare. The standards of health care provision are also impressive, particularly in the public hospital system, but the big difference between the Australian system and the systems in most other countries is that it is available universally and available on the basis of need.

         —I rise to support my colleagues Senator Newman and Senator Herron in this urgency motion. I would have thought the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, besides needing to be in the chamber for this important debate, would have been far more measured in his boast at question time that we have the best health system going, considering his most public embarrassment about and condemnation of the health system with regard to Aboriginal health. His parading on the national media hardly led the public of Australia to believe that the minister at least thought we have the best health system. Clearly, the minister was trying to get the message across that we do not.

         As a nation we may be able to do better, but it is startling to say the least that this government has just woken up to the fact that we have a problem with Aboriginal health services. Senator Richardson is trying to tell us that, after 11 years with the portfolio, the government has just woken up to this problem, as properly outlined by Senator Herron. Amongst Aborigines, infant mortality is 3 1/2 times higher than the average, female life expectancy is some 15 years fewer than the average, there are problems with sanitary living conditions and with the personnel needed to support this particular community. Moreover, there is concern about maladministration and about the resources being directed to and arriving for Aboriginal people's needs.

         These matters are political irrelevancies. It was very easy for Senator Richardson to do that, but he failed to address in his responsible position one of the most basic and serious needs of Australian families. To that end, Australian families have every reason to be concerned about the upcoming May budget and what tax increases lie ahead for them, considering it has only been some nine months since the last budget was brought down with its new array of taxes visited upon Australian households. Not content with those tax increases which directly influence those households, the minister is now suggesting that in the May budget the Medicare levy should be increased from 1.4 per cent to two per cent—a 40 per cent increase.

         Senator Richardson has set this issue running. If it were not for the string of by-elections we are now facing, it would be all but policy in the May budget. However, with the array of by-elections before us, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has felt somewhat obliged to deny such an increase. As unconvincing as it is, it has set the stage for an increase in the Medicare levy. That is nothing short of another slug for the Australian people. It is a regressive tax upon the lower and middle income families of Australia. Simply notching up the Medicare levy to meet the country's health crisis is no solution.

        Tasmania has a proud record, yet successive Labor governments have cut Commonwealth funding to Tasmania on a per capita basis by over 30 per cent in the past decade compared with the Australian average of a 16.4 per cent reduction. That slashing of funds is unfair, inappropriate and has caused great budgetary difficulties to successive Tasmanian governments. The honourable member for Blaxland, the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said in his maiden speech:

        What I have just referred to is often passed over as dull economics, and I agree to a certain extent that it is. Whilst the figures are important for the welfare of our state and our nation, we as parliamentarians need to focus beyond the figures. We need to focus on the impact of changing trends. My state's zinc workers have declined in number. Woolgrowers have been devastated. And within each of these industries there are families, mothers, fathers and children with hopes and aspirations of their own that are thwarted, if not completely shattered.

Of late, federally, we have not performed so well, but that does not deny us as Liberals, on this side of the house, the right to proclaim in our 50th year that all amendments to our great constitution have been ones that we have supported and initiated, that the vast majority of social reforms have been introduced by us, that the golden era of Australia's history was under the guidance of the Liberal Party and that we hold state and territory government in all but two places—Queensland and the ACT.

        Unlike some who bleat `social justice' and point the finger at everyone other than themselves I, like so many other Liberals, have made a real and personal contribution in this area. The reason for that is a belief in personal responsibility. My involvement with the Jireh House Women's Shelter, Youth Accommodation Services of Tasmania and a host of other community welfare organisations is, I believe, a prouder and more sincere record than that of those who simply utter the words `social justice' and then ask government to somehow magically fix it.

        Educated in the state school system and the University of Tasmania, I decided very early that the philosophy of the Liberal Party was the one for me. Within days of starting at university, I received my bill for compulsory student union membership. Inquiries told me that failure to pay would lead to the withholding of results. What a blot on the life of our academic institutions. The vice-chancellors and the university administrations stand condemned. The very institutions that allegedly foster individual thought force all students, like sheep, into compulsory student union membership under the threat of being denied the fruit of their labours. I found that abhorrent. I still find it abhorrent. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Court government in Western Australia for its initiative and trust that other states will soon follow by abolishing compulsory student unionism.

        To succeed, we all need dreams, goals, aspirations—a vision for the future. At the last election I believe my party lost its focus from the dream and concentrated on the detail. Our dream was real and it remains with me, as I am sure it remains with all my colleagues. To use an analogy: we tried to sell a house to our fellow Australians, a house that would have gone a long way to fulfilling their aspirations, but we got bogged down in telling the people why our mortar was stronger and better than Labor's.

         —Mr President, since my announcement on 15 February last that Australia would recognise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, there has been a significant increase in community tension between Australian citizens and residents of, respectively, Greek and FYROM origins. Demonstrations have been held; many provocative and inflammatory things have been said, including by some politicians; several physical clashes have occurred; and a number of vicious attacks have been made—by persons so far unidentified—on churches, parliamentary offices and other property seen to be associated with one side or the other.

It is time for calmer and cooler heads to prevail. It is time for the words to be heeded of those community leaders on both sides who have been trying so hard in recent days to defuse the tensions.

Almost universal acceptance of these principles has for many years encouraged good sense to prevail, even during some very harrowing periods for Australians with links to particular countries overseas, and it is crucial that that commitment be maintained.

         In strict Australian foreign policy terms, that recognition had already been too long delayed. Certainly the price of further delay would have been a significant loss of foreign policy consistency and credibility. Since 1988, Australia has recognised states, not governments, and has done so on the basis not of approval or disapproval, but of four essentially objective criteria: clearly defined territorial boundaries, a permanent population, an established government, and a capacity to conduct international relations. In the case of the FYROM, these objective conditions had been satisfied more or less from the outset. Now we have formally announced recognition, delayed though that decision may have been, that recognition is irreversible as long as the state exists in its current form.

         On the question of territorial aspirations, we believe that argument based on the language of the FYROM constitution should reasonably have been put fully to rest by the amendment formally adopted in 1992, which proclaimed that the country `has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states'. But to the extent that there are some continuing Greek concerns based on references in the preamble to forebears of the present state, and references in article 49 to dealings with people of FYROM-origin living outside the state, the Australian government does believe it would be helpful for the FYROM government to address these concerns. Here as elsewhere, suspicions which might otherwise have been muted have been fuelled by the continued proliferation of what can only be described as offensive irredentist propaganda, especially maps of Greater Macedonia, and the most helpful step of all would be for the spreading of that propaganda to be curbed.

         Most of the criticism of the Australian government has focused on our moving to recognition in circumstances where the name issue has manifestly not been resolved to Greece's current satisfaction. But it needs to be remembered what the precise terms of the commitment made by the Prime Minister were: that Australia would not proceed to recognition without `the use of the word "Macedonia" being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece'. When Greece itself has been prepared to accept the name FYROM, at least for the purposes of admission to the United Nations, and when some 46 other countries had recognised the state using this name and without incurring more than purely formal expressions of displeasure from Athens, it was difficult to believe, in our judgment, that our act of recognition would `cause further tension' with Greece. I came away from my own ministerial consultations in Athens in January reinforced in that belief, and nothing that has happened since has given me grounds to change it.

         It is a logical consequence of recognising the state under the temporary name of the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia' or `FYROM' that Australian government departments and agencies should—unless and until present circumstances change—use that name for the state, and we will so direct them. A slightly more difficult and sensitive problem arises when it comes to identifying an appropriate name for people who live in, or originate from, the FYROM. When the Australian government does not accept the name `Republic of Macedonia' as an appropriate one for the country itself, it is simply not appropriate to refer to its people as `Macedonians', even though many of them would certainly much prefer this terminology.

         We propose, accordingly, that Australian government departments and agencies use the description `Slav-Macedonians' when referring to people who live in, or originate from, the FYROM. `Slav-Macedonians' is in quite common descriptive usage, and should not have any offensive connotations—other than for those to whom any qualification of the word `Macedonian' is unacceptable. It is the case that some FYROM people—including most obviously the Albanian minority—are of non-Slav ethnic origin, but `Slav' in the present context should be taken not so much as an ethnic reference but simply as shorthand for the country's name, the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.

         It is not proposed that any legislation be enacted to compel any particular usage by government departments and agencies or anyone else. How ordinary members of the respective communities choose to describe themselves, and in particular how they choose to describe their ethnicity, in the census or anywhere else, will remain up to those individuals and communities themselves. We recognise, for example, that there are Australian citizens of Greek geographic origin, but not of Greek ethnic background, who may choose to identify themselves as Macedonians.

         But in relation to those departments and agencies which the government has a capacity to direct, directions will be given to refer, for the time being, to the country as the `FYROM', and to people living in or originating from that country as `Slav-Macedonians'. In relation to the ABC and SBS, and other statutory authorities which the government has little or no capacity to direct, we can only express the hope that, in the interests of balanced community relations, they will choose to apply the same guidelines. I emphasise that all these questions of nomenclature will, of course, have to be revisited when the name issue is finally resolved, as we all hope it soon will be, in negotiations between the FYROM and Greece.

According to the practice of many of those co-sponsors, recognition of the FYROM flowed automatically from support for its admission to the UN; for Australia, recognition required a separate formal act, and that step has now been taken.

        As I assured the Greek Government during my visit to Athens last month, in recognising the FYROM, Australia makes no presumption as to the final outcome of the "name" issue, or any other issue involved in negotiations between Greece and the Republic.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We do believe those negotiations would be much assisted by the Government in Skopje ceasing to use the "Star of Vergina" symbol on the FYROM's flag; forebearing from using the name "Republic of Macedonia" until a mutually acceptable final resolution of the name issue is achieved; addressing the provisions of FYROM's Constitution which continue to cause concern in Greece; and taking all possible steps to curb the proliferation, at home and abroad, of offensive irredentist propaganda. We urge the Government of the FYROM to act accordingly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Government also stands ready to enter into diplomatic relations with the FYROM, joining, among many others in this respect, all of Greece's major European partners. We will consider a request from the authorities in Skopje to open a Consulate in Australia which will be able to provide a full range of needed consular services to the local community (some 75,000 people) in Australia.

        I have instructed the Australian Embassy in Belgrade to pursue the necessary practical arrangements. Our agreement to the opening of a FYROM Consulate in Australia would be subject to the conditions that it describe itself appropriately (as the Consulate of the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", not as the "Republic of Macedonia"), and that no contentious flag or other symbol be displayed pending final resolution of relevant outstanding issues. Our early agreement to the opening of a Consulate would be much assisted by a statement on the public record by the Government of the FYROM that it is prepared to act immediately, or at least as soon as the necessary legislative majority is achievable, to change the country's flag.

        On 3 March 1992, Prime Minister Keating identified three matters about which Australia would need to be satisfied before proceeding to recognition. We believe, in the light of the course of events since then and our discussions with relevant governments, that these conditions are now met.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As to the first of these matters—"the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in the way that does not cause further tension with Greece"—the situation is that while the name issue has still not been finally resolved, it has been satisfactorily settled for the time being by the international community (including Greece itself) accepting for various purposes the temporary name "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As to the second matter—"Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met"—the amendment to the FYROM's Constitution in July 1992 (spelling out that the country "has no territorial pretentions towards any neighbouring states"), together with President Gligorov's restatements (most recently on 10 February 1994) of Skopje's acceptance of existing boundaries between the two countries, has reinforced the earlier conclusion of the Badinter Commission that FYROM had no territorial aspirations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        And as to the third matter—"the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied"—the recognition action now taken by so many European and other countries has signified acceptance of the Badinter Commission's findings that FYROM's constitutional guarantees on human rights are comparable with the rest of Europe and satisfy recognition standards.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Government is pleased to note the calmer and more constructive atmosphere that has been apparent, in recent times, in discussion of the issues which remain outstanding between Greece and the FYROM. The fact that the two states are geographical neighbours makes it necessary that they be able to deal with each other on a daily basis with mutual respect and confidence. We hope and expect that it will be possible for the outstanding issues to be amicably resolved in the not too distant future.

         Having said that, I turn to the minister's statement. There is no doubt that the government has made an awful mess of this issue, complex though it is. On reading the last few sentences of the minister's statement, which states in part, `governments can only do so much', one could only reflect on the errors that this government—particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Foreign Minister—has made that required a ministerial statement today.

         When the government made the decision a few weeks ago to recognise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia it did not bring down a ministerial statement in this place; it simply did it by press release. The government just announced to the press what would happen; apparently without any understanding—one would hope this is giving the government the benefit of the doubt—of the degree of sensitivity to the issue within the Greek community and within the former Yugoslav community. One would have expected that if the government had understood the very deep and passionate concern that so many have, there would have been a full process of consultation with both sides of the now Australian community involved, to minimise any misunderstandings.

         One would have expected many of the things we heard in this statement today to come out as a result of that process of consultation—before the government took any action of recognition. But, in a way that is so typical of this government, that did not occur. It simply dictated an outcome to the Australian community—whether it be to the Greek community or to the community of former Yugoslavia—and they had to cop it and the consequences. I think it is that lack of consultation and understanding of the sensitivity of the issue that has led to so much distress regarding this matter in the Australian community.

         Let us make no mistake: Greek Australians feel that they have been betrayed. Their trust has been betrayed by this government, and in particular by Mr Keating and Senator Evans. They feel betrayed because of the specific undertakings given to them by Mr Keating and reiterated by Senator Evans in this chamber, which were conveniently forgotten at the time the government made the decision to recognise the FYROM.

         The government has now compounded its error by, in effect, also betraying the trust of the former Yugoslavs. To designate them now for political purposes with this convenient tag of Slav-Macedonian whether or not they are racially or ethnically Slav people is highly offensive. Was there a process of consultation with these people before the government decided to name them in such terms and before it in an unprecedented way informed government departments that this was the way in which they were to be referred in future? No, in fact, this seems to have come out of the consultation, which occurred after the event, with the Greek community last week.

         We on this side of the chamber acknowledge that there are difficult sets of issues that arise out of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. They have been there now for some years. What is the appropriate time to recognise new states? I remember when Salvinia seemed to fulfil the four termed preconditions to recognition, which Senator Gareth Evans referred to, as required in international law. But the Australian government paused for a little while because it had to also consider whether recognition at that time enhanced a process of building stability within a very difficult region or whether in fact it could be detrimental. The Australian government presumably addressed the issue of recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an independent state in the same light—not simply considering whether it met the four international law criteria but whether a decision to that effect would enhance the stability or whether it could provide further problems.

         That is why I am giving Mr Keating the benefit of the doubt. He said back in 1992 that the government would not recognise the new state until basically issues with Greece over the question of the name had been settled because he, presumably, did not want to inflame further tension. He said on 3 March 1992 that the first of the preconditions was `the use of the word "Macedonia" being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece'.

         So giving him the benefit of the doubt, that is what he had in mind when he put down that precondition. If I was not to give him the benefit of that doubt, I would have said that it was a precondition and that the three preconditions were simply put on at that time to suit the political needs of the moment. If I can recall correctly that was in the period in the lead up to the Victorian state election when there was community debate on this issue of recognition and Mr Keating wanted to put down a position that reassured Greek Australians that the Australian government would not act unless certain preconditions, three in particular, were met.

         But, as I said, giving him that benefit of the doubt, if that was the reason then it is equally true today. It is probably why Canada has not yet acted to recognise. Some states have, some states have not. I think only about a third of the states of the United Nations have so acted.

Probably one of the principal responsibilities of the Australian government is that it must have concern as to how its actions will be interpreted and acted upon in turn within the Australian community.

         It is no secret that that is one of the reasons why the Australian forces are not contributing to certain UN involvements in the former Yugoslavia. It is very difficult for Australia to do that when it has such large communities of Croats, of Serbs, of those from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and so on. The government quite rightly has to ask itself not only whether it will be constructively contributing to the resolution of a conflict in that area of the world—the Balkans—but also how it will affect communal relations in Australia. That latter consideration, which we suggest is absolutely vital to this chamber, was overlooked by the Australian government when it decided to move on this issue without any adequate consultation.

         So we have a situation where the Australian government today tries to rescue itself politically. That is really what this statement is all about. The government is simply trying to rescue itself from a difficult political mess that is of its own making; a mess that I would suggest has been worsened by the decisions that have come out of the meetings of last week.

         Let us take one other example. A further reason that the minister gave for acting last month on the recognition was that there were some 75,000 Australians formerly of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia who deserved consular representation. Yet the minister now tells us that, because of the conditions to be imposed, consular representation is not likely to be afforded. Conditions have been imposed that will not be accepted by the government of the state that Australia now recognises. I would have thought that that is inconsistent; we cannot have it both ways. I understand the argument for the restraints that the minister has included. I do not mind his putting that argument on the usage of names and symbols and so forth, because their use also inflames the communities within Australia. But he cannot at the same time say that he is doing it in order that a consulate might be open to afford these people facilities that they do not currently have. That would seem to be simply an argument of convenience—and when one examines it, it is found to be false.

         So we have this situation where the government has acted for domestic political purposes. It has sought to rescue a situation that is unnecessary and of its making. It has, rather sadly, simply further inflamed communal tensions within our society as a result of this statement. Therefore, there is very little positive that we can say about what is before us today. We issued today through our foreign affairs spokesman a statement deploring this reference to those who are of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia simply as Slav-Macedonians, and rejecting the explanation that was given by Senator Evans in his statement that `Slav' in this context should simply be taken as shorthand for the country's name, not so much as an ethnic reference.

         It is not a question of how Senator Evans says they should interpret it; it is a question of how they interpret it themselves. Normally when one changes one's name in this country, it is with consent. But the people concerned were given no opportunity for consent. In typical fashion, Senator Evans simply said, `This will be how you are to be described, but don't take offence because we are not intending that you should take offence'. That is simply not good enough. It demonstrates how little the government has learnt throughout this whole sad sequence of events.

         This will go down as one of the saddest chapters in history in terms of a contribution by an Australian government towards communal harmony. We boast about this country's multicultural society. But we say to Senator Evans that if we encourage a multicultural society—in other words, if we encourage and facilitate the people who come to this country in maintaining their traditional cultures and beliefs; I support that—we have to recognise the dangers in doing so. The old tensions and rivalries and passions will come with it. When we as governments deal with people in those circumstances and make decisions that affect and inflame those passions, we should be sensitive to the likely consequences. We should ensure that the decisions we make minimise the potential damage and the potential communal stress rather than build upon them.

         —I support very strongly the words of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill. The statement delivered today by Senator Gareth Evans was a rather crude and disingenuous attempt on the part of the government to get itself off a very dangerous hook which I remind the Senate, as did Senator Hill, is entirely of the government's own making. In particular, it is a hook which was baited by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) two years ago on 3 March 1992 for purely cynical, opportunistic vote-buying reasons. That hook was swallowed and the government was caught on the line of its own opportunism and ineptitude with Senator Evans's statement one month ago on 15 February:

        Senator Evans might also have added that Australia is one of the most tolerant, law-abiding and peace loving nations on earth. The minister rightly calls for calm and cool heads to prevail. He rightly demands the cessation of attacks on churches and property by whoever are the perpetrators, including those who for their own ugly reasons may be seeking to ignite ethnic tensions—again to use the words of Senator Evans. He says that those actions and those people are contemptible, cowardly and utterly un-Australian. Senator Evans rightly asks that all of us who make our permanent homes in this country—and, I interpose, whatever our country of origin, whether we are fifth generation, first generation or overseas born Australians—to quote Senator Evans, `have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia first and foremost'.

         Let me emphasise unequivocally that the root of this problem is not the taking of sides between Greece on the one hand and FYROM on the other. It is not about supporting in Australia either Australians of Greek origin or Australians of FYROM origin. It is not about whether Australia recognises states rather than governments. It is not about whether, in the case of FYROM, the four internationally accepted objective criteria for recognition of states—namely, clearly defined territorial boundaries; a permanent population; an established government; and a capacity to conduct international relations—have been satisfied as I believe they have. The central issue is not about those things. The central issue is the fact that the Keating government, through the statement of Senator Evans on 15 February, broke a solemn promise that it made two years ago to the Australian community as a whole but directed particularly to the Australian community of Greek background that Australia would recognise FYROM only if three additional preconditions were met.

         Those preconditions were laid down in writing by the then relatively new Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on 3 March 1992. Those three conditions, I remind the Senate, were, firstly, the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece; secondly, Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met; and, thirdly, the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied.

         The Prime Minister had no compelling reason to lay down these additional preconditions for recognition other than the base political reason that he was seeking to shore up the vote of the Greek Australian community.

        Senator Evans is correct; that is the responsibility of the government. The only problem is that in this government's hands those fine sentiments are just so many hollow words. To the government's great shame and to Australia's great misfortune, those words are observed in the breach by this government. `Say one thing, do the opposite'.

         In the end, governments that act in this way get caught out. That is precisely what has happened to this government over its promised preconditions to recognition of FYROM. The government on 15 February 1994 recognised FYROM, despite the fact that the Prime Minister's three absolutely self-imposed preconditions had not been met—certainly not in their entirety and arguably not at all.

         Senator Evans has been at pains today and on previous occasions to attempt to defend the indefensible by asserting that those three preconditions have actually been fulfilled. I will not insult the Senate by repeating these patent falsehoods. My colleague Senator Hill has already refuted them admirably and comprehensively. But I draw the Senate's attention to one or two aspects of Senator Evans's attempted defence of the government's actions. On page 4 of the statement, on the question of territorial aspirations, the minister said:

        Senator Evans goes on in the next sentence of his statement to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But to the extent that there are some continuing Greek concerns based on references in the Preamble to forebears of the present state, and references in Article 49 to dealings with people of FYROM-origin living outside the state, the Australian Government does believe it would be helpful for the FYROM Government to address these concerns. Here as elsewhere, suspicions which might otherwise have been muted have been fuelled by the continued proliferation of offensive irredentist propaganda, especially maps of "Greater Macedonia", and the most helpful step of all would be for the spreading of that propaganda to be curbed.

         —My friends Senator Teague and Senator Knowles pointed out what I was about to point out. There is a basic internal contradiction. He has contradicted himself. There is a tacit acceptance in what Senator Evans has said that this precondition on the question of territorial aspirations has not been met. Yet day in and day out the Prime Minister and Senator Evans assert baldly that all the preconditions have been met and therefore there were no broken promises on the government's part. The minister in his own statement contradicts that view. The following paragraph in his statement deals with the name issue. He says:

        Again, there seems to me to be a monumental internal inconsistency in what the minister is saying. He goes on to justify the argument by saying we have not heard `more than purely formal expressions of displeasure from Athens'. What weasel words are they? They are designed to deliberately mislead the Australian community as to what the actual situation is. It is quite clear that the first precondition of the Prime Minister, namely, that the name situation not cause further tensions for Greece, has not been met. He accepts here that that has not been met.

         One can go on finding similar internal inconsistencies in what the minister has said. But not only has the government broken its promises to the Australian community of Greek origin; it has also now deeply offended many Australians whose background lies in FYROM. Both the Australian community of Greek origin and the Australian community of FYROM origin are understandably dismayed and hurt—and rightly so—that this arrogant government went ahead with its recognition of FYROM on 15 February without any meaningful prior consultation at all with either community. It then took more than three weeks before the Prime Minister, Senator Evans and Senator Bolkus condescended even to meet with the representatives of the Greek-Australian community, and it took another week, until this morning, to meet with representatives of the Australian community of FYROM background.

         There are other comments in the minister's statement which I will refer to briefly. Senator Evans is either quite off the rails or he is telling less than the full truth. For example, on page 3 under the sub-heading, `The Act of Recognition' he says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia moved to recognise the FYROM only after 58 other countries had done so, including every member of the European Union and the United States. Moreover, we acted only after the state had been admitted to the UN, with Greece itself one of the 63 co-sponsors, and Greece itself prepared to accept the name "FYROM" as appropriate for this purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        At best, that is a half truth. For a start, as Senator Hill rightly said, it ignores something like two-thirds of the members of the United Nations who have not accepted or recognised FYROM, including particularly Canada. It also omits to say that the present Papandreou Greek government, which was not in office at the time Greece jointly co-sponsored admission to the UN, is violently opposed to the situation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At the very least, Senator Evans should do this chamber the courtesy of making that clear. To pick up another statement, Senator Evans also went on to say:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia, like many other countries, delayed recognition primarily because it was thought this would encourage early resolution of the outstanding matters in dispute between the FYROM and Greece. But by 15 February this year, so many countries had recognised the state—including effectively all those with any influence on the situation—that it was impossible to pretend that Australia's withholding recognition could amount to any form of effective leverage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know whether that is right or not—it may be—but whether it is is quite irrelevant because the Prime Minister and the government should have thought of that point before it laid down its three self-imposed preconditions two years ago. If that was going to be one of the key factors in the government's thinking, then either it was very foolish when it laid down those preconditions in March 1992, or it should have had the honesty to spell out its motivations at the same time.

         I will not take up the time of the Senate much longer, but I want to stress two other points from the document. On page 6, under the heading of `Diplomatic Relations', the minister says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia has no present intention to enter into diplomatic relations with FYROM: although (as made clear in my statement on 15 February) we have indicated our willingness to enter into discussions about such relations, it would be premature to address this issue until the consular question is resolved.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not what the 15 February statement said. The first sentence said, `We have decided today, No. 1, to recognise FYROM, and No. 2, to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with FYROM'. I repeat: to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with FYROM.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is a world of difference between that and what the minister said today. Today he was saying that we have no present intention of entering into diplomatic relations with FYROM. That is the same as saying that we have no present intention to enter into discussions. Surely that is the only reasonable interpretation that one could make.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So I do not know whether the minister had a mental block about what he said on 15 February, two months ago, when he started this whole dreadful situation, but it is totally misleading to make such a statement today. I am absolutely amazed, and I deplore the fact that he has made such a gross misrepresentation—for whatever reason he may have done it.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The only other comment about his statement that I would pick up is his remark on page 7, under the sub-heading of `Community Relations Activity'. In the course of his words there he says that Senator Bolkus:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . is in the process of developing some community relations initiatives aimed generally at getting a better understanding on all sides of the issues and principles involved . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        And so it goes on. For that we should read that Senator Bolkus is developing some initiatives that are basically designed to be straight Labor propaganda to win back the Greek Australian vote and the vote of Australians of FYROM background that its deplorable handling of this situation over the last month and more must surely have lost.

         So, in summary, as a result of the government's opportunistic, totally politically driven approach to this issue of the recognition of FYROM, going back to the Prime Minister's statement of 3 March 1992, the government has effectively let down the Australian community of Greek background; it has let down in an equally offensive way—indeed in some ways more offensively—the Australian community whose background is in the region of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It has let down the whole Australian community, because the whole Australian community is vitally interested in this matter.

         This is not a matter that just affects certain sections of the Australian community; it is a matter that affects the whole of the Australian community. It goes to the core of our unity as a nation, and it goes to the whole core of Australia as a truly multicultural society. The government's handling of this matter has put a very grave dent in community perceptions and the reality of our multicultural society—a society for which the government continually seeks to claim the credit, despite the fact, I might point out, that it was the former Liberal-National Party governments, and particularly the Fraser government, to which much of that credit is due.

It will be resolved back there by the people that it affects. I do believe that this particular issue will not be resolved in Australia. Despite all the heat and the political opportunism that is being engendered about this issue, it will not be resolved in Australia. After sitting in the chamber for nearly an hour and listening to two opposition speakers, I am not sure whether I better understand the difficulties, the problems that beset that part of the world, that part of Europe, or whether there is a solution to it.

         I waited in vain for an opposition spokesperson to tell me, to tell the chamber, to tell the Australian public what the opposition would do were it in government. I hope that Senator Teague will take up the challenge and tell us what the opposition would do. I note that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has indicated in recent times that the present Australian government's decision to recognise FYROM will not be overturned by the opposition if it attained government. I hope I have not misrepresented him in saying that. To the best of my knowledge, no other leader or opposition spokesperson who has spoken on this matter has indicated that the opposition will overturn the decision to recognise FYROM. I waited in vain for somebody to say that. Yet we heard the Australian government being criticised for an hour for being pro-active in this situation. In my ignorance, I still cannot understand what Australia has done wrong in recognising FYROM, as Greece itself had already done so. I am aware from documents—I have not heard this refuted—that Greece was one of the co-sponsors to the United Nations of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

         The next question is: does Australian foreign policy change each and every time there is an election in another country? Do we immediately drop everything that we have on our books and change it merely because there is an election over there and things have changed? Are we going to allow Athens to set our foreign policy? Are we going to allow it to be set by Skopje? Or should we set our foreign policy in Canberra? I think we should, rather than it being set in Athens or in any other place. Australia has to have a say in any other very delicate difficult foreign policy issue.

         We did not break any new ground in the recognition of FYROM. As I understand it, 58 other countries beat us to the punch. Very important countries beat us to it. A lot has been said about the United States, but I think more important than the recognition of FYROM was the recognition by other European countries that FYROM was indeed a state. As I understand it, all of the countries in the European Union, formerly the European Community, have recognised the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. That is infinitely more important than the decision by the United States to recognise FYROM and infinitely more important than the recognition Australia has recently given to it.

They will not be resorting to violent acts because they know that the problem besetting the very troubled island of Ireland will not be resolved here in Australia and that it will not be resolved by violent actions, as unfortunately continue to occur back in Ireland and in other places very close to the wonderful green island of Ireland.

         —I also want to add to this debate on the ministerial statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) which deals with the recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I take up some of Senator McKiernan's points in terms of the language that has been used by some in this debate, but more importantly, the way that has been reported. I was disgusted last week at the total and utter irresponsibility of the media saying—in their effort to protect the Labor government from by-election damage—that using the words `betrayal of the Greek community' is inflaming violence. As I say, that is totally and utterly disgusting of any media.

         As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill, has said here tonight, it is not now just the Greek community who have been betrayed by this government; it is also the community of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The commitments given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) back on 3 March 1992 were not fulfilled. If it is somehow disgraceful to say in today's political language that communities have been betrayed, if a hysterical media with another agenda says that that is inciting violence, then we have to seriously question the role of the media in this country and the way the media is inflaming a situation that is not inflammatory.

         The coalition has always urged restraint by all players. It has never encouraged any violence and would never seek to do so. We, as the founders of multiculturalism in this country, firmly believe that there is a responsibility on every person who comes to the country not only to be a law-abiding citizen, but also to benefit from the wealth this country has to offer. Therefore, it is wrong and untruthful for the media, or anybody else for that matter, to suggest or imply that the coalition is trying to incite violence of any type.

         It is a shame that this ministerial statement today  still does not answer many of the questions that are uppermost in the minds of the Greek and the FYROM communities. It is a shame that those of the FYROM community were not consulted until this morning. Let us face it: a statement was put out by Senator Evans as a consequence of the Greek community's consultations on 10 March which is identical in every way, shape and form to the statement that has been made here today. Therefore, what input has the FYROM community had, and what input prior to 10 March has the Greek community had? As I said, not just one community has been betrayed by this government; both have.

         Quite clearly, on 3 March 1992, the Prime Minister—as has already been said by Senators Hill and Short—made the conditions for purely political reasons. Yet he knew that he had no desire whatsoever to fulfil those conditions in the long term. I will quote again the exact words that he used in describing these conditions. He said that the first condition was:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece
       </para>
       <para>
        The second was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met
       </para>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a shame that those conditions were laid down for purely political reasons and that the Prime Minister had no intention whatsoever of fulfilling them. Until 15 February both communities felt that there was going to be a full and comprehensive debate on these conditions prior to any recognition, and they had a complete and utter right to think that way.

         Sadly, as has been said by me and others before me, their hopes and aspirations were betrayed. It is quite improper to state, as both the minister and other people have, that the Greek government has been part of the agreement. The Prime Minister has made factual errors in his interpretation of what has happened and what has been agreed to by other governments. Senator Gareth Evans's statement of 15 February made no reference to the core criteria—on the contrary, his statement clearly alleged that Australia had recognised the FYROM because the Prime Minister's own conditions had then been met. In 1992 the Prime Minister said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was the intention of that state to recognise itself as the Republic of Macedonia. It now recognises itself as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is simply wrong. On 9 February, President Gligorov used the name Republic of Macedonia, without any modification, three times in the opening paragraph of his statement on the US recognition of the FYROM. The Prime Minister was telling only part of the story when he said that Greece had co-sponsored the entry of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, under that name, to the United Nations. He failed to say that Greece did so as a temporary measure on the understanding that it would be of limited duration and, also, he failed to say that it now vehemently rejects it.

       <para first-indent="16">

         When the FYROM was admitted to the UN in April 1993 there was an expectation that it and Greece would be able to report by September 1993 to the UN Secretary-General that they had resolved their differences over the name issue. No such resolution has been forthcoming. The Greek government continues to refer, including in the United Nations context, to the FYROM of Skopje.

         What we need to look at is who is telling the truth. There is a constant blind of both communities and the government hoping that no-one will see through what they are doing. Quite frankly, with Senator Evans further confusing the situation today, it is clear that the government does not know where it is going. I find it absolutely fascinating that Senator Evans, in his statement today said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the question of territorial aspirations, we believe that argument based on the language of the FYROM Constitution should reasonably have been put fully to rest by the amendment formally adopted in 1992, which proclaimed that the country "has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states".
       </para>
       <para>
        But then he contradicts himself. As Senator Short said earlier, the contradiction is just stunning because in this statement Senator Evans went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But to the extent that there are some continuing Greek concerns based on references in the Preamble to forebears of the present state, and references in Article 49 to dealings with the people of FYROM-origin living outside the state, the Australian Government does believe it would be helpful for the FYROM Government to address these concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is that not a contradiction of what Senator Evans is trying to tell these communities; that the situation has been resolved? I will repeat condition No. 1. It states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . "the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece".
       </para>

        On page 4 he made a statement in this context. He said:

       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para>
        and it goes on. What he is still neglecting to say is that that is a former government, not the current government; and the situation is not as he is portraying it here—and there has been no such acceptance.

         Further confusion is then caused by calling those of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, `Slav-Macedonians'. The minister recognises that there is a difficulty with that and yet he is saying that this should be so. How can the minister quite responsibly say that this is what people must be called, when he recognises that there are difficulties? How objectionable is it to the minorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to be called Slav-Macedonians? That is not what they want. So why is this government yet again forcing its opinion—without agreement—on a community?

         We need to recognise the fact that there has been no agreement on symbols, for example. The Star of Vergina is a very sacred symbol to the Greek community and it has requested, for as long as I have been part of this debate and longer, that that star not be used. Therefore, the Greek community, along with the FYROM community, is entitled to think that there would be some resolution to that question before a decision is made.

         Senator Evans in his typical bombastic way is simply saying that the claim to the Star of Vergina as a national symbol is untenable and should be dropped; that some compromise should be accepted on the name issue; and that there are many potential formulae which would retain some reference to Macedonia without appropriating that name in its entirety. Once again, there is a further degree of uncertainty between these two communities.

         I agree with one other thing that Senator McKiernan said, that there are leaders of both communities who have shown extreme responsibility and restraint over this entire issue. I too, like Senator McKiernan, am from Western Australia and I have to say that the leaders in Western Australia have just been outstanding in ensuring that there is no violence and that sanity prevails, because those leaders in the communities not only in Western Australia but right throughout Australia recognise the importance of being Australians first.

         When those people recognise that they are Australians first, that is a very significant factor to the rest of Australians from wherever they come because they too do not want to see any violence that originates in another land. I want to ensure that those leaders of both communities who have acted in such a responsible way to ensure that this situation is resolved properly are not disappointed. They are fully entitled to feel disappointed to the extreme at the moment. I hope that they will not be ignored in the future, that they will not be betrayed again by a government which makes commitments that it simply has no intention of keeping. Those leaders need to be congratulated, and I hope that they can now pull in the reins on a few of their dissidents who are causing some terror in certain parts of Australia. Australians will not tolerate that and I know those from these two communities who are part of Australia will also not tolerate that and that they also seek to have those people brought to justice.

The government has been in discussions quite recently with leaders of various communities in this country.

         I do not intend going into the diplomatic aspects of the matter. However, I must point out that this government has failed Australia and failed ethnic Australians in the manner in which it has managed multiculturalism. It has turned multiculturalism into a divisive issue instead of a unifying issue. When I was at school and the Fraser government announced multiculturalism, it was presented in a completely different fashion—a fashion which sought to embrace rather than to divide. There is so much division because this government plays, and has played, favourites in the ethnic community. The 1992 statement is an example of that. There is every reason why Greek Australians should be outraged at what has happened.

There was some backtracking, but he did not give a coherent explanation of the position of discord that was engendered because of the government's statement on 15 February. He referred to the government statement at that time. I seek leave to incorporate the statement made by the spokesman for the opposition, Andrew Peacock, on 15 February.

        PRESS RELEASE BY HON. ANDREW PEACOCK, MP SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

       <para font-size="-=2">
        GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO "FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA" FLAWED
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Andrew Peacock, today acknowledged that Australia's decision to recognise the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an independent state was consistent with that state's membership of the United Nations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But Mr Peacock said the Government's approach was nevertheless flawed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Peacock said he has reservations about the Government's formal diplomatic use, even on a temporary basis, of the name "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Peacock said he does not accept the Government's claim that all three of the conditions for recognition laid down by Prime Minister Keating on 3 March 1992 have been met. He said that Government has effectively broken the Prime Minister's undertaking not to proceed to recognition until basic outstanding questions are resolved.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Prime Minister's first condition was that "the use of the word "Macedonia" be settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In fact, the use of the word "Macedonia" is by no means settled. Mr Peacock noted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou, had reiterated on 18 January that Greece would not accept the inclusion of "Macedonia" or any derivative in the "neighbouring state's name".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Formal diplomatic use of this name by Australia could cause further tension with Greece, Mr Peacock said. This was clearly demonstrated by Greek Foreign Minister Venizelos' sharply negative reaction on 10 February to the US decision to recognise "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Peacock considers, despite the Government's protestations to the contrary, that even temporary use of the word "Macedonia" is necessary presumptive of the outcome of any negotiations on the issue between Athens and Skopje.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Nor has Mr Keating's second condition been met. The Greek Government's approach to the issue has been more constructive in recent weeks, Mr Peacock said. But the fact is that when speaking in the Greek Parliament on 24 January, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou made it quite clear that Greece's concerns have not yet been fully met and for this reason, Athens has not yet resumed UN sponsored talks with Skopje.

         When they met in Cyprus last year, the Commonwealth Heads of Government recognised the important part which sport plays in our development both as individuals and as nations. We may be the citizens of a small or little-known country but, if our country stars in a sport, we too have our place on the world stage. If we strive to improve ourselves, if we aim for ever more difficult goals in the discipline of physical and mental endeavour, we are the gainers. If we play as members of a team, we learn to make the most of each other's strengths and minimise each other's weaknesses. We find out what it is to win and to lose and the part that luck can play. Any one of us may be born with an outstanding god-given talent whether we come from a privileged or underprivileged environment. We admire those who develop that talent to the highest level of achievement. They set an example of dedication and determination to us all.

         Competition is hard and not everyone is able to cope. Not everyone has what they need for even basic survival let alone the spare resources, including time, for any kind of sport. But sport is not only about excellence; it is perhaps the best way in which people of different nationalities and languages can communicate with each other. Sport can build bridges and break down barriers; it is also about relaxation, enjoyment and companionship, with something in common to talk about.

         —I rise to speak on the issue of quality assurance in universities. Last week the Wilson committee reported on quality assurances across Australia's 37 universities. Tonight I want to discuss the inadequacies of this process. Quality assurance was set up by this government, I believe, as a cover to the measures that it has undertaken since the 1987 Dawkinisation of universities and the very rapid expansion of universities without the adequate provision of resources.

         Year after year we hear about the number of students that were turned away; we hear about universities bursting at the seams; we hear about overcrowded lectures; we hear about inadequate or insufficient tutorials; and we hear about libraries that have insufficient resources. The government's answer was to set up a quality assurance mechanism where it would distribute $76 million to the winners of the universities with the best quality.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government set out in this process to assess the teaching, research, community service, quality management processes, planning and international links of the universities. That sounds fine on the surface, but this whole process is conceptually flawed basically for two reasons. One is that the measures of management that the government set up would not stand up to the test of any competent piece of academic research because they were not reliable or valid. In the end, each university was asked to submit its own portfolio—to prove its excellence. Teams of people went around universities for one-day visits. Imagine trying to assess the ANU on one day! But that is what the government did—and it had different teams doing it. How can one set of criteria developed by one university be compared with that developed by another? The whole process was flawed from the start in the way it was devised.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The reason for the process being devised was also flawed, because the government is giving money to universities that show excellence. One would have thought that if out of our 37 universities one group demonstrates excellence and another group is not quite up to scratch, the money should be given to those universities so they can come up to scratch, particularly the newer universities in this country. But the government has set up a process which is biased towards the older, larger and better endowed universities—and which very seriously damages the newer universities. The rich universities get richer and the poorer universities get poorer. What an amazing thing for a Labor government to be doing. But it has done it. Let us hear some comments from some of the senior academics on this process. Professor Brian Smith, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Money had gone to those who least needed it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . process flawed because it had looked at outcomes without comparing them to the base from which each university was starting.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, again, the whole research process of quality assurance is completely flawed. It also seems that the distribution of money has been influenced by geographic factors. The universities that got into the top bracket are the Australian National University, which is in the ACT; the University of New South Wales, which is in New South Wales; the University of Melbourne, which is in Victoria; Adelaide University, which is in South Australia; the University of Western Australia, which is in Western Australia; and the University of Queensland, which is in Queensland. Do honourable senators note anything about that? It does not take much to work out that each state has one university, with the exception of Tasmania—Senator Abetz, who made his maiden speech tonight, would not be very impressed with this fact—whose University of Tasmania totally missed out.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The amazing thing is that the University of Sydney, one of my old alma maters and the top university in this country, did not even get a top ranking. The reason it did not get a top ranking was that it did not want to play DEET's silly games. It had excellence, and it was not prepared to go through all the silly paperwork. It probably wanted to get on with teaching and research, which is what it should be doing, instead of jumping through the hoops of DEET. The whole process has been summed up by Professor Di Yerbury, the Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie University, in this way:

         Three of the senior staff of Macquarie University, including the Vice-Chancellor, wrote an article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         setting out exactly how they should change or improve this system. They stated that universities are already the most accountable and publicly scrutinised organisations in Australia; the current approach should be evaluated and reformulated before the next round begins; they need safeguards like full publication of rationale for decisions and training of assessors; the terms of reference need to be clear and consistent from beginning to end, unlike this year's; and there was too much changing of the rules with focus moving from excellence of outcomes to quality assurance processes.

         This shows the ridiculousness of the whole system. In the end they were not focusing on outcomes of excellence; they were really focusing on how well the universities filled out the forms. So the ludicrous result is that some of the top universities in this country, including the University of Sydney, missed out on getting into the top ranking. That example shows the absurd nature of this process. I call on the Department of Employment, Education and Training to scrap this stupid system and to let universities get on with what they do best—which is not paper work, but teaching and research.

         That victory by the Liberal Party in South Australia was so overwhelming that only 10 Labor candidates were elected to the state parliament. Among those 10 was one candidate who was running as an endorsed Labor candidate for the first time—none other than Martyn Evans, who had for several terms been successful in being elected as the state member for Elizabeth as an independent Labor candidate. Having been offered a ministry to ensure that he supported the Bannon Labor government in its last months in office, to ensure that it was not thrown out of office early, he rejoined the Labor Party—having not been a member of the party for many years—and then ran as a Labor candidate in the state seat of Elizabeth.

         I put it to the Senate that Mr Evans has been nothing other than entirely opportunistic in this situation. Just three months ago he was elected to a four-year term in the state parliament and at that time he gave a commitment that he would see out that term. In fact, at a public meeting that was held at a school in the Elizabeth electorate during the last state election campaign Mr Evans was asked that very question by a constituent. He made a definite commitment to stay as the member for Elizabeth until the next state election four years hence. In particular, he replied to that question that was asked of him, `I will stay until the next election'; a firm commitment that Mr Evans would serve out his four-year term as a member of the state parliament.

         Not only did he make a commitment to the people of Elizabeth that he would serve out a four-year term for them but he also made a commitment to another member of the Labor Party that he would support that person for the seat of Bonython when it became available. He was again heard to say to this person in relation to the candidacy for Bonython, `Don't worry about it; I will hand it to you on a plate in six months'. Not only has he broken a commitment to the people of Elizabeth by jumping ship and seeking to enter the federal parliament; he has broken a commitment he made to one of his own Labor Party people that he would support that person as the candidate for Bonython.

         The federal seat of Bonython has long been regarded as a safe Labor seat—as has Elizabeth—and indeed the voting figures show this. But the people of Bonython are simply being taken for granted, simply being treated as playthings, for the convenience of the Labor Party, and in particular for the convenience of Mr Martyn Evans, who is seeking to use the people of Bonython—the people that live in the suburbs of Elizabeth and Salisbury and those other areas that make up the seat of Bonython—to further his own career. He has no real consideration for those people. He has no consideration for the commitment that he made to them only three months ago that he would serve out his term in state parliament. Those people are simply being used now as cannon fodder to promote his career in federal parliament, where he obviously believes he has some personal future which he does not see available to him in the state parliament now that Labor has no chance of being in government there for many years.

         The people of Bonython ought to be aware of this intention. It is the sort of thing they ought to take into account when they very carefully consider their vote at the by-election this coming Saturday. They have for too long been taken for granted in what has been a safe Labor seat. The only way that this Labor government—the Labor Party and people like Martyn Evans—will take notice of them is if they stand up and vote for the Liberal candidate, Andy Markwell, on Saturday and reduce this seat to a marginal seat. Then they might get some attention—the sort of attention that seats like Adelaide and Hindmarsh got before the last federal election in the sports rorts affair, when hundreds of thousands of dollars were allocated to those seats and virtually nothing was given to Bonython. I simply ask the people of Bonython to consider the way in which they are being used in this by-election, to not succumb to that, and to vote Liberal on Saturday.

         —I want to address tonight the serious issue of superannuation, a matter which I have monitored for some time, and in particular certain superannuation funds in Queensland. The new Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 provides the legislative framework for prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. It is designed to increase the prudential control and protection of superannuation funds and strengthen the security of superannuation savings. An important aspect of these prudential controls is disclosure of information about individual funds. It is information disclosure, or more precisely the lack of information disclosure, under existing and proposed regulation that is the issue I wish to address.

         , the committee acknowledges the importance of information disclosure in prudential supervision. It suggests that, while the information disclosure requirements under OSSA have improved, information disclosure could be further improved by increasing the amount of information publicly available.

         Under the current OSSA regulations, trustees are required to disclose financial and other information to their members and beneficiaries but have no obligation to disclose any information to third parties, with the exception of regulatory bodies. While the ISC is permitted to publish statistical information relating to superannuation funds, it is expressly prohibited from identifying individual funds and disclosing information about those funds. Thus under OSSA, information about individual funds is not publicly available.

         In its first report, the Senate committee suggests that greater investor protection and public awareness of superannuation will be facilitated by requiring disclosure of funds' investment strategies and financial statements to the public at large. Such disclosure would enable analyses by industry experts, the financial community and the media. The committee therefore recommended that the ISC create and maintain a database so that financial press and industry experts could report independently on superannuation funds with arms-length members.

         The government's response to recommendation 4.13 is to accept it with modification. The response indicates that access to information could be achieved by extending accessibility to the public access database already being developed by the ISC in the context of the superannuation guarantee arrangements. Such accessibility is, however, qualified by the statement that:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the provision of detailed information as recommended by the Committee may need to be restricted to large funds on the basis of efficiency and cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a very serious problem. The intention to restrict public access to information relating to large funds would work directly against the very reason for the committee recommending public disclosure, which was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        evidence presented to the Committee indicates that problems are more likely to arise in small funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be expected that the reason for the tendency of small funds to have more problems is that they have a lower public profile and that their members have limited expertise and resources to assess the performance of their fund. Large funds are more likely to already be under public scrutiny and their members and members' representatives are more likely to have more resources and greater access to expert superannuation advice. It is therefore important that the information be available without restriction, provided that information about individual fund members is not disclosed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The puzzling question is: how does the government propose to give effect to this recommendation, with or without modification, when the SIS act specifically precludes the ISC from disclosing any information which will individually identify a superannuation fund? That is, section 348 of the SIS act is basically the same as section 19 of OSSA in that the ISC is prohibited from publishing any statistical information which would identify an individual superannuation fund and disclose information about it. The SIS act is clearly restrictive and inadequate by excluding third parties from accessing information about individual superannuation funds via the ISC.

         The government acknowledges that increased scrutiny of funds is an important safeguard for members. During the public information seminars on the proposed SIS bills held last year, the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Gary Johns, stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Greater member participation means wider scrutiny of a fund's operations, consistent with the notion that the greater the number of watchful eyes, the smaller the risk of undetected fraud or negligence.
       </para>
       <para>
        While Mr Johns was referring to the SIS bills' requirements for equal representation on the funds' board of trustees, the idea that wider scrutiny equates with greater member protection means that, with public disclosure of information, even more eyes are watching, including expert eyes, thus significantly strengthening the safeguards of members' assets against negligent loss or fraud.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Disclosure to the public at large will go a long way towards enhancing prudential control of superannuation funds which will, in turn, benefit members in at least three ways. Firstly, although industry, financial experts and the media cannot possibly scrutinise the operation of every fund, analyses of the performance of samples of funds by various industry groupings will provide members of all funds with some benchmarks against which to evaluate the performance of their own fund and assess how successful or otherwise their fund has been in comparison with industry standards. In the absence of publication of funds' financial information, no such comparisons are possible. Secondly, if fund trustees know that the financial statements and other information about the operation of their funds are open to public scrutiny, they have an added incentive to ensure that the fund is operating efficiently and effectively. Improved efficiency flows on as a cost saving to members. Thirdly, the knowledge that they are under public scrutiny will also provide trustees with a disincentive to neglect their fiduciary duties or act dishonestly to the detriment of fund members.

         An argument against additional disclosure is the associated cost. However, the evidence presented to the Senate committee clearly indicates that there is a need for wider disclosure, and the benefits that members will derive from such disclosure will outweigh the costs. The requirement for public disclosure of information may also help to overcome the reluctance of some fund trustees to disclose information to members under existing rules; that is, both under OSSA regulations and the forthcoming SIS regulations.

         A case in point is the current situation with former members of the Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund. The Senate select committee held an inquiry into the QPOASF and presented its findings in the committee's 8th annual report in August 1993. The inquiry centred around the extraordinary payments made in early 1987 to Messrs Martindale—who was also a trustee at that time—Daly, Rutherford and Buchanan and Ms Kinder. Given that these extraordinary payments were contrary to the terms of the fund's trust deed, the committee found that the trustees had possibly breached trust laws.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Towers Perrin, who were engaged by the QPOA to investigate the extraordinary withdrawals, reported that the fund had suffered a detriment of $34,304 due to the extraordinary withdrawals. To overcome this detriment, one of the sponsoring employers, the QPOA, has made a payment to a special fund to make good the shortfall. Although the committee's inquiry was hindered by the inability of the QPOASF, National Mutual, the funds' administrator or relevant Queensland authorities to produce the original documents which authorised the extraordinary payments, it is clear that the payments were outside the terms of the trust deed and the funds suffered a detriment as a result. The committee also found that fund members had insufficient notice or knowledge of the funds, accounts and trustees' decisions.

         The outcome of the inquiry has no doubt raised questions in the minds of past and present members of the fund about their entitlements and benefits, including such questions as: were my superannuation benefits affected by the detriment, and, if so, how; am I entitled to my portion of the additional funds contributed by the QPOA? These are important questions.

         Difficulties experienced by some former QPOASF members in their attempts to get answers to questions demonstrates the inadequacy of the disclosure rules governing superannuation funds in the past and present under OSSA regulations and possibly in the future under the new SIS regime. One individual who was a member of this fund from 1985 to 1990 was concerned whether the benefits paid to him were correct and whether he had any further entitlement. Under the provisions of OSSA regulation 17(1)(i), he requested the present trustees and National Mutual—the fund administrator—to provide him with copies of any actuary reports, auditor reports, financial statements and ISC documents relating to the fund for the relevant years and details of any surpluses that were distributed to him during his period of fund membership.

         The individual first wrote to the QPOASF trustees and then National Mutual in June 1993. National Mutual responded by stating that it could not release the information without the authorisation of the trustees. The QPOASF trustees' response was that they were seeking guidance from the ISC. So it went round in circles.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In September 1993, having had no further response, the individual again wrote to the fund trustees advising that he would lodge a complaint with the ISC if the requested information were not received within a few weeks. The trustees' response was that they were still waiting for advice from the ISC. The member lodged a complaint with the ISC in November 1993. Two weeks later, the ISC wrote to the member advising that it had written to the fund seeking its help in obtaining copies of the member's yearly statements—no reference to the information which he had requested. Honourable senators would probably not be surprised if I told them that the member is still waiting.

         This continued stonewalling by the fund's trustees leaves the individual in an invidious position with nowhere to go. The ISC seems powerless to help. Can we be confident that the sanctions against trustees encompassed in the new legislation will prevent recurrence of such blatant disregard of members' rights?

         Another former member wrote to the same fund requesting that, in light of the detriment suffered by the fund in 1987 and the additional contributions by the QPOA to make up the shortfall, the benefits of all former members be re-examined to ensure that the distribution be made fairly and equitably to all past and present members. The QPOA passed the request to National Mutual and its response stated that, in accordance with the Towers Perrin findings, the detriment arising from the 1987 extraordinary payments was suffered by members who had participated in the 1991 surplus distribution.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As that individual ceased to be a member in 1989, supposedly he was not affected. However, National Mutual does not attempt to explain why it is the members who participated in the 1991 surplus distribution who suffered the detriment and not the members who participated in the 1988 distribution. It seems logical that, if a detriment has occurred because of extraordinary payments out of the fund in 1987, this detriment would affect the very next distribution made by the fund, which was in 1988. In a letter of 27 May 1993 from National Mutual to the committee, Mr Peter Grace states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Reserve Accumulation was distributed in accordance with the trust deed following the annual review of the Fund in 1988 and under the terms of the Deed was to be reviewed again within three years i.e. following the 1991 annual review.
       </para>
       <para>
        So if there was a detriment at the time of the 1991 distribution, did that detriment also not exist at the time of the 1988 distribution? Or has the detriment skipped one distribution to appear in the next by some actuarial sleight of hand? Perhaps the information from National Mutual is incorrect and there was no distribution in 1988. It is quite a puzzle indeed.

         The problems that these two individuals are experiencing raise a number of questions which need answers. Unfortunately, the QPOASF trustees and their advisers appear unwilling to provide answers or the information that the members need to help them answer the questions for themselves. The only way that these former members have any hope of satisfying themselves that they have not been financially disadvantaged is to obtain copies of the fund's financial statements, actuarial reports and other relevant documentation and seek professional assistance in unravelling what has transpired in the administration of the fund between 1987 and 1991.

         At the time that they were members of the fund they were entitled to have access to that information under the disclosure rules of the OSSA regulations. When they were members, however, they had no inkling of what had occurred in 1987 and thus had no cause to seek out the information. Several years later they now suspect that they have been financially disadvantaged but are unable to gain access to information to which they clearly have a legal and moral right. So we can see the problem which is faced.

         These circumstances give rise to a fundamental question that the government needs to address. Are the information disclosure rules under the forthcoming SIS regulations adequate to ensure that individuals who have a legitimate interest in the operation of a superannuation fund have access to such information?

I will be closely scrutinising the regulations, which I understand will be tabled in the Senate during the next few months. If they do not come up to scratch, I will not rule out moving that they be referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that Permissible Unserviceabilities are approved under Civil Aviation Regulation 37 and do not require a concession application. The CAA is not aware of any other concession application around this time. The request was made on Monarch Aviation Group letterhead dated 14 May 1993 and was signed by Mr R W McLean.

        (2) Assuming the honourable senator is referring to the application for the extension of the Permissible Unserviceability, a further Permissible Unserviceability for the inoperative autopilot on aircraft VH-NDU was issued on 14 May 1993. That approval merely gave approval to continuing to operate that aircraft with an `Inoperative Autopilot'. That approval did not authorise or otherwise permit the deactivation of `associated equipment', nor did it authorise operation of VH-NDU with any items of equipment, including the autopilot, being removed from the aircraft. If approval to operate with deactivated `associated equipment' was required by Monarch, a separate application for a Permissible Unserviceability in those cases would have to have been made. No such application was made and no such approval was granted. If Monarch had wished to operate with equipment removed, they would have had to apply pursuant to Civil Aviation Regulation 42U for approval by the Authority and be authorised pursuant to Civil Aviation Regulation 35 to operate with that equipment removed. No such application was made to the Authority and no such approval was granted.

        (3) (a) Investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) revealed that the main standby inverter had been removed from the incident aircraft for fitment to another aircraft. This occurred at the end of a shift and the maintenance crew did not document the action nor give a formal handover to the oncoming shift to ensure that a replacement standby inverter was fitted. The lack of the inverter was not detected during flight crew pre-flight checks in Sydney, but was detected  during those checks prior to departure from Los Angeles. Safety deficiencies concerning both the shift handover procedures and flight deck checklist procedures have been identified and safety recommendations made to rectify them.

        (5) There have been no changes to the training requirements for Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AMEs) in the past five years. However, prior to 1988, AMEs were required to complete a Schedule of Experience (SOE) which was specified by the then Department. In 1988, the Civil Aviation Orders were amended to permit operators of high capacity Regular Public Transport (RPT) aircraft to produce their own SOEs for their LAMEs.

        These SOEs were subject to approval by the CAA.

The new CAA SOE was made available to the industry in early November 1993.

        (6) Around 10,000 accidents and incidents were reported in the three year period from 1991 to November 1993. Therefore, it was not considered practical to provide a description of each occurrence, even for those considered as serious. However, BASI's data on accidents and incidents are presented in a manner that provides information on the relative seriousness of occurrences.

For example, a Category 1 occurrence would be an accident involving a major passenger aircraft killing all onboard (this type of occurrence would be a full International Civil Aviation Organisation team investigation given the highest priority). An accident involving a regional airline with multiple fatalities would be a Category 2 investigation. A Category 5 occurrence is one that has such little safety value that all BASI does is register the fact that it was reported.

Many recipients of the catalogue have said that it has been an asset.

        (4) As I advised the honourable Senator in answer to part 1 of his question, the furniture catalogue is a promotional tool which assists buyers in selecting furniture items to meet their requirements. When buyers select the furniture item(s) that are required from the catalogue, they then refer to the Buyers' Guide mentioned in the catalogue for details about placing orders with that particular supplier. Orders are placed under the relevant common use arrangement and not against the catalogue.

        (5) The furniture catalogue covers twenty five (25) Buyers' Guides. The items are predominantly made in Australia. In the Audit Report No 7, 1992-93, Efficiency Audit, "Saving Time and Money with Common Use Contracts" the Australian National Audit Office estimated that, by value, 80% of goods and services provided through the common use arrangements were sourced in Australia and New Zealand. The report indicated that the furniture common use arrangements have a high local content.

        (6) No revenue is raised from the catalogues themselves. The Furniture Catalogue was issued during May and June 1993. Turnover from furniture common use arrangements in 1992-93 exceeded $45m. For 1993-94, turnover to the start of February 1994 has exceeded $25m which is on target to meet or exceed the 1992-93 turnover. The Furniture Catalogue is one of the factors contributing to this good result.

        (1) AUSLIG is establishing a GPS base station in Hobart as part of a national network of Global Positioning System (GPS) stations. This network serves two primary functions—geodetic and integrity monitoring and will be used by Commonwealth agencies such as the Civil Aviation Authority, Defence and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. These primary functions are part of AUSLIG's national and international public interest activities. They provide significant benefits to the Australian community including more efficient and accurate surveying and mapping, and information for crustal motion and greenhouse monitoring. As a secondary function, AUSLIG can provide positioning data for GPS users. The AUSLIG station will provide a more accurate service and a broader capability to state government, local government and industry users in Tasmania than is available from other base station operations.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (2) Because the geodetic and integrity monitoring services are being undertaken as part of AUSLIG's public interest obligations, there was no need for a market survey with regard to these services and none was undertaken. While a market survey for the positioning services has not been conducted yet, AUSLIG generally prefers to operate with private sector partners for the provision of such services. Accordingly, AUSLIG and the Tasmanian Department of Environment Land and Planning have held preliminary discussions with a private base station operator in northern Tasmania with a view to establishing an agreement for joint distribution of GPS positioning information.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        (3) Existing local base stations could not support AUSLIG's geodetic and integrity monitoring requirements. Local base stations operate on single frequency whereas dual frequency operation is essential for the level of accuracy required for those functions. The location of existing base stations and the inability to allow dedicated access to equipment were other reasons for their unsuitability.

The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs advises that, prior to February 1991, visas/entry permits for all students were issued for the duration of the course, to a maximum period of twelve months, plus one month. Since then, with the introduction of Category A and B courses, visas/entry permits for students enrolled in Category B courses, such as ELICOS, are issued for a maximum period of twelve months at any one time while those for Category A courses are issued for the duration of the course. Therefore, all ELICOS students have, since 1986, been issued with visas or entry permits for no longer than thirteen months at one time.
