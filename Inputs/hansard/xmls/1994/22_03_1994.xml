        Was any attempt made by the minister to explain to the Senate why it was necessary to have this meeting on a day in which the parliament is sitting? A little bit of planning and effort clearly could have avoided that. But those opposite do not care two hoots because it suits the Prime Minister, with the attitude he has towards the parliament. We know his attitude towards the Senate. That is reinforced by both ministers, in the same area, not attending the chamber today, when one of the most critical issues on the national agenda is the intention of the government to increase the Medicare tax. The government intends to do that. The first minister in the area is absent from the Senate today. The second minister, in the area of family services, is absent as well. That is an irresponsible attitude for the government to have towards this issue.

         Mr Morris in South Australia told us the other day that stories about the Liberal leadership were all pure press speculation—the skunks locked in a room smelling each other's whiffs, I think was the expression that was utilised. The opposition was telling us that that was pure speculation; there was no substance in that. What is the opposition's position on speculation that comes from the press? It cannot have it both ways. If the opposition conducts its approach to the affairs of this nation on the basis of chasing down every rumour and innuendo that it thinks it can discern somewhere, it will not just be Fremantle that it will be losing, it will not just be Bonython that it will be losing; it will be every by-election that might arise from here into the hereafter until the turn of the century and every general election as well.

         In answer to the question that I was asked about North Korean nuclear capability and the current situation that exists there, the situation is this: the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, met yesterday, 21 March, under Australian chairmanship and adopted a resolution on the DPRK nuclear issue. The resolution, which we co-sponsored, expresses grave concern at North Korea's  failure to allow the IAEA to conduct essential safeguard activities at its most sensitive declared nuclear sites and calls upon the DPRK immediately to cooperate with the IAEA to implement its safeguard obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The resolution also importantly asks the IAEA director-general to report to the UN Security Council on North Korea's non-compliance, which the board has an obligation to do under the terms of its statute.

         Referring the issue to the UN Security Council does not necessarily mean an immediate move to impose economic or any other sanctions on North Korea. The fact that the security council will again simply consider this issue should itself be a further significant signal to the DPRK. Certainly, unless the DPRK takes a more cooperative approach and fulfils its undertakings, we are likely to see measured and gradual moves in the council towards punitive action, while every attempt is made at the same time to seek a resolution through dialogue and negotiation.

         As I have said on a number of other occasions, it is our hope here in Australia that a long-term solution to this problem can still be found through negotiation. We sent a message to North Korea ourselves last Friday urging it to allow IAEA inspections to be completed as a means of restarting the dialogue process. Regrettably, the DPRK has not so far seen its interests as apparently being best served by proceeding in this fashion. But we hope that, with the pressure that is being mounted and the attitude of the international community being made clear, North Korea will—as it has on previous occasions—consider its position. The government will be following developments closely and, of course, we will support any action that is considered necessary by the security council.

         —It is the case that Japan's prototype fast breeder reactor, Monju, is due to reach criticality in April this year. That is not news; I think that has been anticipated for some time. I am surprised that Senator Coulter has suddenly decided to get excited about it. Japan's nuclear energy program has for some time provided Japan with access to separated plutonium. The point about that plutonium, and any new plutonium that might be generated by this particular addition to Japan's energy capability, is that it is strictly safeguarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with Japan's obligations as a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Those safeguards provide very strict controls to ensure that all nuclear material is used exclusively for peaceful non-explosive purposes and is fully accounted for. All Australian supplied uranium to Japan is also, of course, subject to the stringent conditions of Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement with Japan. As to the second group of questions asked by Senator Coulter, Japan is a party in good standing to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty under which non-nuclear weapon states, parties to the NPT, renounce any intention to acquire nuclear weapons. Japan announced last year its support for the treaty's indefinite extension beyond 1995. A particular attribute of the NPT, as the central pillar of the international nonproliferation regime, is that countries which have attained sufficient scientific and technological competence to develop nuclear weapons—certainly Japan is in that category—nonetheless forswear that option through internationally, legally binding commitments. The Australian government accepts Japan's clear and frequent statements that, as a fundamental principle, it will not possess plutonium in excess of the amount required for its nuclear fuel recycling power program.

         In actual fact, Commonwealth funding for early intervention in New South Wales has increased. It has risen to more than $5 million. As all senators would know, constitutional responsibility for education of all children lies with the states and territories. Under the national equity program, the Commonwealth provides supplementary funding to schools to improve the educational performance and outcomes of children with disabilities, including early intervention, in the case of children not yet attending school.

         For 1994 distribution arrangements will vary from state to state. In New South Wales the education minister will distribute funds based on the recommendations of a representative advisory committee. At this stage, the organisations have been advised of in-principle amounts. The Commonwealth, I emphasise, is not involved in this decision-making process. It is the New South Wales education minister who has the responsibility for deciding which applicants shall receive funding, and any complaints from the people of New South Wales about that allocation have to go to the New South Wales government.

Newspaper articles that have been around in abundance, suggesting that the government is about to compel people to take out all or most of their superannuation payments in the form of income streams rather than lump sums, are merely pre-budget speculations. The multi-party Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has prepared a paper for the Minister for Social Security which outlines a number of options with regard to the tax treatment of lump sum commutations of allocated pensions. However, the paper makes no recommendations. It has been submitted to the Minister for Social Security for consideration in the context of the treatment of allocated pensions under the age pension assets test. The issue is currently under review by a consultant, who will report to the Department of Social Security in September this year.

The Australians exercising in Indonesia are undergoing weapons practice, parachuting, navigation and communications training. The exercise allows Australian troops to train in environmental conditions not commonly found in Australia. The Indonesian troops in Australia are using special-purpose Australian training facilities in Perth to undertake aircraft counter-hijacking training.

Issues such as the impact of world population growth on the quality of human life and the environment and how Australia can contribute to solving such problems as population growth will be canvassed by the conference and, I am sure, will be the focus of the essay competition.

Surely Senator Bolkus, when wearing his other hat as the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs, should be the first to recognise the insensitivity of raising the spectre of the Jewish Holocaust to score his cheap, crass political points. Since Senator Bolkus obviously does not realise that, and as the question sought the daily rates paid to defence counsel in the war crimes trials as a first step in assessing whether he gave both the defence and the prosecution a fair go in the conduct of those trials, will he now tell the Senate what is wrong with wanting to make a comparison between the daily rate paid to defence counsel and the daily rate paid to prosecuting counsel? Why does he insist on protecting the details of payments to counsel when hardly anyone else in the community who has access to taxpayers' funds gets that protection?

This process involved pursuing those who may have been involved in war crimes related to the Holocaust. That is the connection. That is why I felt very insulted this morning by the degree of snide questioning about this. We have made it very clear that the government has provided information with respect to the costs, but daily rates have been kept in confidence because, to do otherwise, would damage the bargaining position of government when we do go out and buy legal services. That has been made very clear, as has been the fact that by adopting this process we achieve at least a 20 per cent to 30 per cent reduction in rates available to government.

         The other aspect of confidentiality is one that has been recognised in the past by this place: the recognition of privacy of individuals involved. By releasing this information, the government is of the view that we undermine the government's bargaining position and the cost to the taxpayer is increased. That is an important factor.

         It is understood that there are no further developments planned for the Salisbury Campus and that the consolidation of faculties would eventually lead to a move from the Salisbury Campus to the Levels Campus. I point out as a South Australian senator that the distance from Salisbury Campus to the Levels Campus is only a few kilometres, so it is not a great distance. It is on the major transport route in Main North Road through the northern suburbs of Adelaide. So it is not as though it is going from one side of Adelaide to the other. This rationalisation will substantially reduce operating costs. This is part of a long-term strategic planning exercise for the university, and it would be unlikely to be fully implemented before the year 2000.

         In relation to the particular aspect about equity, I am further advised that all institutions are required to have an equity strategy within their educational profile. The Commonwealth would expect the University of South Australia to have regard to that strategy in any proposed redevelopment of its campus. The Commonwealth would want to be assured by the institution that these students would not be disadvantaged, and as a result DEET will seek advice from the South Australian university that the students would not be disadvantaged.

         This study was into electricity generation and supply. It found that prices for electricity in Australia affect all businesses right across the board. Some are more intensive than others, but if we can reduce the cost of electricity tariffs we make a major input saving to Australian business and hence improve its competitiveness worldwide. Roughly three to five per cent of all industry costs in Australia are incurred by the purchase of electricity.

         It found as well that Australian industry on a world scale pays much less for its electricity than just about every other country—only two beat us in the OECD. They were New Zealand and Canada, both of whom generate their electricity mostly by hydro-electricity generation, which is the cheapest and most efficient way of producing electricity. I might say, inter-alia, that the Scandinavians, who do the same, have more expensive electricity than Australia, despite the fact that they have a higher percentage of hydro-electricity power generation.

         It was found overall in this country that there are pockets in New South Wales and Western Australia where there are low volume customers who do pay higher prices than some of our more significant international competitors. It found that the price mix between industry and householder consumers favoured households in Australia over industry, although that gap was closing slightly in 1991-92.

         The study found that on the scale of productivity of our power utilities, if benchmarked against investor-owned US power utilities, there was still a gap in favour of the United States. The most efficient generators in Australia are in Queensland and the least efficient are in Victoria. It is a worthwhile study. It is an auditor's report on the efficiency of this important industry sector. Obviously it begs the question of what is being done about it.

As a result of those discussions Mr Kelly resigned as comptroller-general. Further discussions took place with appropriate officials in the Commonwealth Public Service, which led to Mr Kelly being offered a job commensurate with his skill. I have explained on many occasions that even the Conroy review said that customs is to be congratulated for what it has been doing on an international level, in the introduction of electronic systems, paperless systems, and international customs harmonisation, in which Mr Kelly has played a leading role. Therefore, it was quite appropriate that Mr Kelly be offered the job of consultant to DITARD for a couple of years as we develop those processes.

         The MRC is jointly funded to around $50 million a year by the government and meat industry levy payers. The MRC approached the government in late 1991 proposing to develop a fund to invest in rural innovations. The government supported the proposal. Following consultation with the meat and livestock peak industry councils, it was decided to set up the agribusiness trust fund. The agribusiness trust account is a subsidiary of the MRC and is managed by Hambro-Grantham Ltd. It will invest in companies which commercialise the results of research and development to the benefit of the meat and livestock industry.

         The trust will hold less than 50 per cent equity in each of its investments. It will operate on a strictly commercial profit objective and decisions will be based on stringent commercial and financial criteria. The MRC has set aside around $5 million for the trust fund over the next three years and this could leverage to over $15 million for commercialisation of new technologies. The actual size of the fund will depend upon the availability of investment opportunities.

         The announcement of the trust coincides with the trust's first investment which is in a food processing software company, Sastek Pty Ltd, which will commercialise video imaging analysis technology that has been developed by the MRC. The investment involves the progressive acquisition of up to 25 per cent of Sastek, which is an $11 million company specialising in the design, manufacture and supply of management information systems for food processing industries. The government welcomes the establishment of the agribusiness development trust account. It is  an approach that should help increase the adoption of new technologies and innovations by our extremely important beef export industry. This is yet another demonstration of the success of government working with industry to build on their competitive strength and develop a greater value added export base for the future.

I am not surprised that he attempted to make some political defence for the action he took this morning, but I was amazed that he was not even prepared to acknowledge that it was an inappropriate remark for a minister to make; that it was insensitive and offensive; and that any minister wanting to maintain a reasonable standard of conduct would recognise it as such, withdraw it, and apologise to those who were offended.

If my comments caused offence to anybody then I truly apologise. My motivation on this matter is not to insult those victims or children of the victims, but to ensure that we, as a nation, can stand up in the international community and say quite clearly and fairly that we did everything within our capacity to track down those who might have been responsible for these horrendous crimes. That has been my consistent point of view. My motivation was that, having been frustrated by this unreasonable pursuance of this information by the other side, I felt offended. I apologise if, for some people, the comments were distasteful—I imagine that they may well have been, and I regret having used them. But, my motivation has always been to ensure that these crimes can be recognised as distasteful, both officially and unofficially, by our nation.

         Repeating what I said earlier in respect of information, I point out that people in this place consistently seek it, and we provide it to the extent that we can. But there have been a number of occasions where the government has asserted that the information being sought has been commercial-in-confidence. In those circumstances there has always been a mechanism—people have decided not to pursue it keenly in order to make political points, but have been prepared to sit down with the government and accept that in some circumstances the information can be commercial-in-confidence. That mechanism was available this morning, and is now. If members of the opposition are serious about this, they should sit down with us and accept that information.

         It is important for people to understand what the situation is—otherwise they cannot understand the urgency with which we want to consider this matter. Time and again the question was put—I think it was six times, but it might have been eight—to the minister asking him to provide the daily rates paid to defence counsel in the war crimes trials. The argument was put that when one knows the daily rate paid to a counsel one can get some idea, but not a complete one, of the level of competence of that counsel. Then, at the next estimates committee one can get the daily rate paid to the prosecuting counsel in this matter, and get an idea whether this legislation has been administered fairly. I do not believe that those questions are in any way inconsistent with the sentiments expressed by Senator Bolkus. If he genuinely believes what he said—which I think he does—that these people ought to be dealt with and that we should play our part internationally, he must agree that we have to play that part fairly. He must agree that the prosecution should have an equal chance with the defence, and that the defence should have an equal chance with the prosecution. One should not be inhibited in any way as opposed to the other.

         The minister says he is happy to make public the total amounts paid to the separate counsel. But that is no help, because someone who is paid $5,000 a day and works for 10 days gets $50,000; but someone might get $50,000 for 20 days work and only be paid $2,500 a day. The daily rate of $2,500 versus $5,000 does not tell us that one lawyer is twice as good as another, but it does give us an indication of the level of counsel that the government sought to give each side. Surely, to conduct these trials as fairly as possible, we would want to have counsel of roughly equal competence, and I do not think that is an unfair question to pursue.

We have the cost of justice inquiry being run by a committee of this chamber, which acknowledges that the government is an extraordinarily large user of legal services. It should be using its power to reduce those services, and one way it could do that is by having an open market in this matter and releasing the daily fees. At the last estimates we were told by Mr Rose from the department that all bars know there is this hefty discount; all bars in Australia work for the Commonwealth for hefty discounts.

I was simply astounded. It is the most tasteless remark I have heard from anybody since I have been in parliament. I do not think, if I stayed here another 20 years, I would hear a more tasteless remark. Senator Short was there and he was equally flabbergasted.

         Senator McKiernan makes the point that no point of order was taken. The chairman might not have asked the minister to withdraw, but the minister was asked. He was given another opportunity here today to withdraw, and still sought—until wiser counsel probably advised him—to stick by those tasteless and insensitive remarks. It is the most appalling way for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and multiculturalism to behave, and he deserves to be condemned for doing so.

The motion moved by Senator Hill to suspend standing orders to censure the minister for the remarks he has made is, on the face of it, appropriate. However, the minister has apologised, and the Australian Democrats accept his apology that he has offered to the Senate in this chamber. In our view, there is therefore no need to waste the Senate's time for a full half hour on a motion when the minister has acknowledged that his remarks were offensive—I certainly found them offensive—and I believe that that is where the matter should rest.

         On the face of it the context was really pretty clear. What was happening was a series of questions being asked, apparently following an earlier course of questioning in other contexts, about the conduct of the War Crimes Tribunal. It is a highly sensitive issue about which the government has felt very strongly. It was only with the utmost reluctance that we wound up our own commitment to prosecuting war crimes in this country.

To have suggestions made of that kind, if indeed they were made, as Senator Bolkus says they were, is to create an environment in which one can readily understand someone responding emotionally and saying, `Well, you have really just missed the whole point as to what these war crimes proceedings were about'.

This afternoon his explanation to the Senate for his extreme sensitivity seemed to me to be quite patently inadequate. Surely other things must have contributed to his view. As a result his whole approach was totally obstructive and was very provocative indeed. His statement, to which the coalition takes such great offence, really came out of the blue. To accuse a member of parliament of either house by saying that the pursuit of legitimate questions was like arguing about the tariff on gas at Auschwitz is a totally unacceptable statement, almost regardless of the provocation.

In the Senate this afternoon we again asked him to withdraw. Again, he refused. Senator Bolkus, by his refusal to withdraw in the Senate this afternoon, has quite clearly contravened standing order 193(3) which says that a senator shall not use offensive words against any member of either house and that all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those members shall be considered highly disorderly.

It could hardly be described as a placid meeting—and that was only the start of it. We then talked about the questions put on notice at the estimates committee by the relevant senators.

We may be pleased that we were not being broadcast directly to Western Australia. The matters that were the subject of the questions at the estimates committee meeting this morning have been raised previously. They were certainly raised over an extended period at the last round of Estimates Committee F.

         —If the Senate will allow me to steer this debate back to some relevance, let us look at standing order 209 which talks of urgent necessity. The issue that we have before us is the conduct of Senator Bolkus at an estimates committee meeting earlier today. The question of behaviour at Senate standing committees and otherwise is pertinent today and it certainly requires some urgent attention. It is a topical matter and, therefore, one which should be disposed of today, and that is the reason for the urgent necessity.

         We had the legitimate line of questioning by Senator Vanstone in relation to the hourly rates of solicitors as paid by the government. In reply to that we got from Senator Bolkus the statement that her questions were `like arguing about the tariff of the gas at Auschwitz'. That sort of reply is entirely inappropriate. It is not conducive to the carrying out of proper affairs in Senate committees. I think that it is appropriate for this chamber to express its opinion firmly in relation to how senators conduct themselves in Senate standing committees and estimates committees. After all, we are there for the good government of this country and the people of Australia should be able to place their trust in us that we will carry out our affairs in a proper and appropriate fashion in accordance with standing order 193 without resorting to such—I would submit—offensive language.

         Senator Vanstone's inquiry is a proper one. It deals with the hourly rates applicable to solicitors. I can tell honourable senators that if a solicitor works for the Legal Aid Commission there is a public rate of pay. There is no commercial confidentiality about that at all. I do not think it would place the government in a lesser bargaining position if this were to be made public. In fact, I think it would increase the government's position, allow some sort of competition between practitioners and give a greater deduction to the Commonwealth and, indirectly, to the people of Australia.

         I rarely vote against the suspension of standing orders in a matter such as this. I agree with the opposition that this is a very serious matter. From what I have heard, Senator Bolkus now agrees that it is a very serious matter. There have been calls for him to apologise, and he has done so. I heard him a moment ago apologising for using the words that he used in the context that he used them. Now there are calls for him to withdraw. There is a scale of severity and humiliation—to withdraw is one thing; to apologise is another. To apologise, as Senator Bolkus has done, is to imply that the comment that has caused such offence, and rightly caused such offence, has indeed been withdrawn.

         The Greens believe that estimates committees should not be treated with contempt by anybody and that they have a legitimate role to play. The disclosure of information is a recurrent problem. The government has failed many times to demonstrate true openness to scrutiny; so we certainly believe that the opposition has a point. However, the censure motion seems to be focussing on the minister's tasteless remarks. The minister has apologised for those remarks, as it was appropriate and necessary to have done so.

         It is important to stress that estimates committees fall into disrepute when exchanges focus on party political point scoring or when committee members or ministers cast aspersions on each other. When, as Senator Ellison pointed out, we have set such a high standard for the way in which the Senate should conduct itself, we should bear in mind the saying that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones.

        I wish to briefly address that motion, and I understand that there may be some debate on it. I do not have any pleasure in moving this motion, but the need for it has arisen because of the very small amount of legislation that the Senate was able to debate last week. Honourable senators will recall that last Monday there was no time for government business. On that day there was an MPI, a first speech and a ministerial statement on Macedonia which took considerable time. On Tuesday, all available time was taken up with debating three disallowance motions. On Wednesday and Thursday there was a continuation of the disallowance debate and also considerable interest and involvement in the question of the disclosure of the pecuniary interests of senators. Consequently, at this stage, we have a backlog of legislation.

         It is not a serious backlog but we do have 10 packages of bills to debate, four of which are in the committee stage, and we have three messages to receive from the House of Representatives. I estimate, and I have told Senator Hill this privately, that we need nine to 10 hours of government business time to complete the program. If we get a reasonable amount of time today, including the additional two hours tonight which are sought in this motion, we may not need further late night sittings this week.

         It is always difficult—as I think all honourable senators know—to make any hard and fast predictions about what is going to occur with the Senate's business timetable. I do not intend to make those predictions, but as a precaution I would be proposing tomorrow to look at the issue of the Senate either negating or perhaps curtailing to some extent its general business debate on Thursday, if that is agreed amongst the parties in the Senate. There is the less palatable option of finishing our program on Friday. However, I believe that there will be no need for the Senate to negate tomorrow. I think we can see our program completed with a little more increase in government business time and, I hope, cooperation from all senators—opposition, minor parties and Independents.

         Let me make it clear that it is not the government's intention to negate the adjournment tomorrow night but to make an assessment by the close of play tomorrow about how we are travelling with our program.

         I do not want to second guess any contribution that Senator Hill may make in this debate. However, I predict that he may claim that this motion indicates some lack of success, or failure, in the new timetable. I do not think that that would be a fair conclusion to draw in any sense. In fact, I would strongly disagree with that. The new timetable of sittings and routine of business have meant that the Senate, throughout this particular session, has been able to rise by 8 o'clock each day and even the extra sitting hours proposed in this motion will mean that the Senate will rise at what used to be its normal finishing time. That clearly is a preferable arrangement to the previous situation when, at the end of the normal parliamentary session, there was a negation of the adjournment at 10.30 p.m. and we worked into the wee small hours of the morning. This is a responsible approach by the government—sensible, given the constraints of our legislative program—of which notice has been given for a substantial period of time. I urge all senators to support this motion.

We voted against this not very long ago when we were told that late night sittings were unhealthy and, therefore, would not be imposed upon the Senate in the future. There was great determination on the part of the government, the Democrats and the Greens that the Senate would not sit later than 8.00 p.m. Here we are, on the first occasion when that is put to the test, and we find the government getting together with the Greens and the Democrats—the team, as we tend to refer to them these days—and deciding that they will breach their own determination.

         The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has made a concession—which I recognise—in that he is now prepared to undertake that he and the minority parties will not seek to impose the longer hours on the Senate tomorrow night. I respond positively to that; it is more of a concession than we had earlier today. He has acknowledged that he may well be seeking a further late night extension on Thursday, which is scheduled to be the last sitting day of this session. The point is that with proper planning this should have been unnecessary. The Senate sat a lot earlier this year than it has in the past—coming back near the beginning of February—to enable the government to better plan its program within a time frame that, according to the government, would not require night sittings. At its first test, it has failed.

         The government has sought today to pass blame for that to us, which is its usual practice, but it was not our decision last week to bring upon the Senate the debate on senators' interests. It was the government's determination to get that through the Senate last week pursuant to another arrangement that it had made with the Australian Democrats and the Greens—another team effort. It was an item of business to take precedence ahead of all government legislation, notwithstanding that the government for 10 years has played around with the issue. It has brought it on occasionally and dropped it—in some instances, for up to two years—before bringing it back again. But last week it had to be the item that took precedence over all other items, including government business.

         The minister said that last week the government got a bit behind in its schedule. The problem is not made any better by the fact that government members failed to attend the chamber, were counted out, and therefore lost time. One might ask the question: why does the Senate now have to suffer a night sitting—which we were told it was so important to avoid—simply because government members failed to attend during the scheduled time? It does seem incredible that when the government fails to keep its own quorum the Australian Democrats and the Greens say, `Never mind. We will join with you to extend the Senate into a night sitting' so shortly after the Democrats and the Greens told us it was critical to avoid night sittings.

         I guess the good faith of the government in this matter was tested, and a lack of good faith was demonstrated, in relation to the estimates committees. Apparently sitting late at night on an estimates committee does not harm our health, but sitting late at night in this chamber does. Again, with the first test we found that the new sitting hours, in the government's eyes, did not apply to estimates committees. If those committees sat late, that was too bad, notwithstanding the health consequences. So we have had late night sittings of estimates committees.

         Whilst we are debating this change to the timetable, I put on the record a couple of extra protests. We said at the time of the changes to the timetable that we were concerned about the changes being made to the adjournment debate. We conceded that often there is not an adjournment debate, and sometimes it is a short one, but argued that on some occasions there are issues of significance that will take longer than the maximum 40 minutes allowed. That has been demonstrated to be the case. The problem with that is if the government, the Democrats and the Greens, come in and want to participate in that 40 minutes then we, not being a majority, but certainly the largest group in this chamber, are lucky to get in one small contribution during that debate. That has been demonstrated not to work satisfactorily—certainly not from our perspective. It suits the government and the minority parties, but it is the opposition that is being restricted. For the next session, I register my protest at what is occurring in that regard.

         Similarly, the government conceded during the debate on setting a new procedural structure for the Senate that the ability to take note of matters that arise during question time should become a right and not require leave. Its purpose is basically to enable opposition and minor parties to take note of matters that arise out of government answers because question time is clearly stacked against an opposition. We have just one minute to ask the question; ministers have four minutes to answer it. We argued that it should be three, but again the Democrats joined with the government to make it four. As it is televised, it is again biased against an opposition's interests.

         The concession was generously made that we should have the right to take note of those matters after question time. What is happening now is that government members are coming in and participating in that process, again stacking the debate so that that right is, in effect, being lost. That is an abuse of the spirit in which that compromise was reached, and I therefore put on notice my protest.

         In summary, whilst the minister has said that the new framework is working satisfactorily, on this side of the chamber that is not our view. Therefore, no case has been made out for the need to vary this timetable today to enable this later night sitting tonight. As the minister said, there is now not a lot of legislation before the chamber, and some of that is non-controversial and not expected to take a long time. In fact, the one I am involved in later today I doubt will take more than a few minutes. But, that has not been put to the test because before we get towards the end of the program the government joins with the minor parties to extend the sitting of the Senate. It may well be found by Thursday that this later night sitting tonight, in breach of the government's undertakings given at the beginning of this session, was unnecessary. But that will never be put to the test because the government cannot wait. It is determined to come in here and extend tonight's sitting.

         I regret that we have not seen much improvement by the government in managing its program as we have moved along this path under the new timetable. If there were one or two bills that could not be dealt with it would not matter much because we are back here in just over a month, and there is very little legislation on the program that could not have waited to be dealt with at that time. In fact, that is how the new system was supposed to work—there would be a flow-over if the time for debate expired within the time frames that the government and the minor parties had set for this Senate.

In the normal course of events, had we sat yesterday and had the usual two lots of four sittings, we would probably have come in on time and not been placed in a position where Senator Faulkner had to move this motion.

There was no absolute undertaking that we would never sit past 8 o'clock, otherwise we would not have put that clause in.

         The final issue that I have not covered is the question of when estimates committees meet, and how long they meet. If they are meeting at the times that people have told me about, we might have to look at that. There are some difficulties. My estimates committee adjourned at 10 past 12 on the first night. We were delayed in starting because of this chamber. I have to say that when there are four departments in a night, and two have been gone through and there are just two smaller ones left, to adjourn at 11 o'clock and come back at another time is inconvenient. I think that my whole committee was pleased to bat on for an extra 70 minutes and finish before departing.

         This is an exceptional year. We have six estimates committee rounds this year. That is unusual; it is an unprecedented right of opposition supervision. We have this round and a supplementary, we have further rounds in May and June, and further ones in November this year. This is the first time a government has had to go through three rounds. It is catch as catch can this time round. Certainly rational hours for estimates committees, as for this chamber, should be discussed in future. I am sure we can resolve something in that regard.

         I want to illustrate that by an example of where things have got out of hand. In Estimates Committee C on Tuesday, 1 March this year—I remind the chamber that that is three weeks ago today—I raised a series of questions with regard to an $8 million allocation of funds for the Subiaco Oval in Western Australia. I made some very important points and addressed a number of fundamental questions with regard to both the bureaucratic and the political decision-making process of that $8 million allocation.

         Naturally, there were political overtones. There were links to Mr Dawkins, the then Treasurer; there were links to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe; there were links to Dr Carmen Lawrence who, at the time we were inquiring into, was the Labor Premier of Western Australia. Maybe for government reasons, and because an election involving Dr Lawrence was coming up in Western Australia in the intervening period, the government would not provide any of that information to Estimates Committee C. I was seeking in particular—and I refer to page C166 and onwards of the

         for 1 March—a lot of information that required the minister, and I think it was Senator Crowley on that occasion, and the chairman of the committee, Senator Reynolds, to pursue with Minister Howe access to ministerial correspondence.

         When the estimates committee again met on Thursday, 17 March, none of that information had been provided. I sought it again in more detail. It was very obvious from the information that was given to us by departmental officers that the information had been tendered to Mr Howe's office. All of the correspondence that I was seeking between Mr Howe, Mr Dawkins and Dr Lawrence had very important overtones and, as it turned out from some other departmental information that flowed, an implication that also linked the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to this area. It became obvious that there was probably a good deal of correspondence. This is a fundamental issue of an $8 million expenditure where the books were obviously cooked between Mr Dawkins, Mr Howe, the Prime Minister and Dr Lawrence.

         Now, three weeks later, Senator Reynolds and I are trying to reach an accord with regard to a meeting time for Estimates Committee C. It was canvassed that we would have to meet early tomorrow morning or late tomorrow night. Then I heard through the secretary of the committee that we could not possibly have it on Thursday morning because that would conflict with the Labor Party Caucus. I find it insulting when instructions come telling us that we cannot have a meeting because it might just happen to coincide with the Labor Party Caucus.

The accusation has been made that this all relates to a new job for Mr Dawkins on the Western Australian Football Commission. Naturally, therefore, the government wants to spin all of this out until Thursday at the latest. This parliament will rise for another five or six weeks, the issue will not surface, and it will not receive proper consideration through the appropriate forum of this Senate.

But they are not giving proper consideration to the issues that should be evolving.

         As I said in the committee the other night, there is obviously camouflage and subterfuge with regard to this very important project. It smells. We want to deal with it, but we are being forced off to other estimates committee meetings at dawn tomorrow morning. As Senator Patterson said, there was a request for one committee to meet this morning at 6.30. How ridiculous! That is then compounded in other areas of the committee. It proves that government management is totally out of control. When it comes to a cover-up, the government is the supreme expert at trying to rig the agenda and at trying to control the flow of information.

A heap of legislation was introduced into the Senate and into the House of Representatives after our final party meeting last year. We could not be expected to have done it before we came back here.

         Senator Robert Ray said that members of the government should take turn in taking note of answers. He and a few others on the government side of the chamber must have a short memory. The concept of taking note of answers was introduced to let the opposition have its say following question time. Question time is loaded in favour of the government, even with the time limits. Senator Jones knows that; he took part in the deliberations when this half-hour was introduced.

         I simply say this: all that these changes of rules have achieved is that the coalition has been restricted in the opportunities it has to debate very important matters. Certainly we have not had any restriction in the time that the Senate sits. Sure, we finish at 8 o'clock sometimes but, when it suits the government, we go back to 10.30 p.m. When we finish early there are meetings of joint committees, estimates committees and Senate committees which carry on and on. So none of these pious promises we got during the debate have in any way helped. We heard the expressions—the insincere expressions, I might say—of concern as to the health of senators. All that is just rubbish. The whole purpose of these changes was so that the Labor Party could restrict us, and it has done it.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The report of a preliminary study of Defence's procedures associated with the closure of the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong has commented on Defence's expenditure of some $26m on facilities to produce nitroester and rocket motor propellants, and on procedures to clear and decontaminate the factory site for future development. The report notes that remediation of the site will be expensive and that it will be many years before a suitable use for the site can be determined.
        </para>
        <para>
         This has turned into quite a saga. I think the Senate will be concerned about several aspects of this matter. In the first place, I refer to the contamination of the site. This is of major significance. As the Auditor-General reports:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Department valued the disposal properties at market value of $231m.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         That is the market value of that Maribyrnong site. The Auditor-General continued:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Market value represents the amount the Department would expect to receive on disposal less selling costs including those costs associated with making the property saleable.
        </para>
        <para>
         Information was not available to the Auditor-General, however, which would allow these costs of making this site saleable to be quantified. However, the Auditor-General says it is possible that these costs could exceed the reported property values. As I said, the reported property value is $231 million, but the costs of decontaminating this land could, according to the Auditor-General, exceed that property value. That is an incredible cost. The cost to decontaminate this land could exceed $231 million. The audit report continued:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANAO considered that the value of these properties reported by the Department did not reflect the true market value as it did not make allowance for decontamination costs of those properties. The Department advised it did not provide an estimate of the likely costs because relevant information had not been obtained or the uncertainties involved precluded a reliable estimate being formulated. Accordingly, the ANAO was unable to determine the extent of the costs not reflected in the financial statement.
        </para>
        <para>
         This kind of cost is, to my mind, absolutely incredible. In fact, the whole question of the Maribyrnong explosives factory astounds me because quite apart from the question of decontamination is the question of some extraordinary expenditures just before the factory moved. To complete the matter of site clearance and contamination, I note that the Auditor-General's report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . At the time of closing the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong—
        </para>
        <para>
         which was in December 1990, as I recall—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         there were some 500 building on the 92 hectare site. The site and buildings were contaminated by chemicals after many years of explosives production. The objective was to clear the site of contaminated buildings that presented a hazard. Preliminary studies have given some indication of site contamination. Demolition work has had to take account of this and heritage considerations. Buildings assessed as having heritage value will be examined for their level of contamination. Some 200 buildings have been demolished, and more will be demolished in 1994.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . The extent of contamination of the ground is still not known but qualitative studies are under way. The Department said that studies so far indicate that the site does not present a danger externally and is unlikely to present a human or ecological health risk to its surroundings.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . A proposed second stage of studies will investigate the drainage system and assess the extent of contamination of the rest of the site quantitatively to help in estimating the remediation cost. It is not yet possible to estimate this cost or when remediation will be complete. It seems, however, that remediation will be expensive and that it will be many years before a suitable future use for the site can be determined.
        </para>
        <para>
         This is quite extraordinary. Not only does the government not know how much it is going to cost to fix up this contaminated site, but it also does not know how long it is going to take and what the ultimate outcome of those attempts to fix up the site will be. The fact that it could cost more than the estimated value of $230 million is quite extraordinary.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is also extraordinary to note that early in 1993 the audit office made a preliminary study of the procedures of the Department of Defence associated with the closure of the explosives factory in Maribyrnong in Melbourne. The Auditor-General's report states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . Explosives had been manufactured at the site since 1912 but by 1989 the facilities were regarded as out of date and too close to residential areas. Production capability was moved to facilities at Salisbury and elsewhere.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . Two issues arose during the preliminary study. One was the expenditure of some $26m on facilities to produce nitroester and rocket motor propellants that has provided little value. The other was the delay in action to clear and decontaminate the factory site.
        </para>
        <para>
         This production of nitroester was an extraordinary waste of money. The Auditor-General's report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . .  Plant to produce nitroester was ordered in 1987. (Nitroester is used in the production of rocket propellants, Otto fuel for torpedoes, etc.) In February 1989 the then Minister for Defence announced that the factory would close before December 1990 and that the buildings would be demolished. After the Minister's announcement the Department continued with the acquisition of the nitroester plant, which was delivered in May 1989 . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         I remind honourable senators that the decision was made in February 1989 to close the factory but the department went on with the delivery of the nitroester plant in May 1989 and installed it not in the new facility at Salisbury but in the old factory at Maribyrnong that was going to be closed down. The report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . After operating the plant for only three months, the Department transferred it in February 1991 to Salisbury where it was operated for only six months (September 1991-March 1992). The plant has since been scrapped. The cost of the purchase, installation and transfer of the plant was $5.2m.
        </para>
        <para>
         That was absolutely and totally wasted. The report continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . The Salisbury facility was established to accommodate the Nulka Project, which had been developed at the Maribyrnong factory. (Nulka is a naval rocket-powered hovering decoy.) Between 1987 and 1992 the Department outlaid $22.3m through the Maribyrnong factory to establish the Salisbury facility. Of this amount some $10.8 million was spent from 1987 to 1990 on cast composite rocket propellant facilities for the Nulka Project and $11.5m was spent from 1990 to 1992 to establish a cast double base propellant facility for rocket motors in Ikara and Seacat missiles.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . It was announced in mid-1992 that the Salisbury facility would be closed. There was no demand for the rocket motors. Although the Navy decided in March 1991 to stop using Ikara missiles, the Department continued to transfer rocket production facilities to Salisbury. Interest in Nulka declined; the Department will relocate the Nulka capability to Mulwala at further cost.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General says that it seemed to the ANAO:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the expenditure on plant to produce nitroester and facilities to produce rocket propellants provided little value to the Commonwealth and could have been avoided, at least partly, with forethought and better planning and coordination . . .
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . The Department said that in hindsight it might be seen as unnecessary to have purchased and installed the nitroester plant.
        </para>
        <para>
         The department responded to the Auditor-General and has stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The decisions taken by Defence in relation to establishing production facilities for nitroester and rocket motor propellants were based on the best information available at the time. Subsequent changes in operational requirements which resulted in the withdrawal from service of the Ikara and Seacat weapons systems significantly reduced the need for the facilities but it was not possible to foresee this at the time of the original decisions. Nor was it practicable to alter the course of action in progress to establish facilities at the stage the change in operational requirements became known.
        </para>
        <para>
         I must say that that looks quite extraordinary. It seems to me that the Auditor-General has uncovered once again in his particularly useful way some curious decisions within the bureaucratic structure. I commend him for doing so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There are just a couple of other remarks I would like to make briefly about the Auditor-General's report. One of them relates to the Australian Pork Corporation. I give notice that I will be paying more attention to this matter at an appropriate time. The Auditor-General's report on the audit of the accounts and records of the corporation referred to the fact that:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . During the year the corporation incurred approximately $40 000 for legal costs in relation to the industry's appeal to the Federal Court in respect to findings regarding imports of Canadian pigmeat. Of this expense, an amount of almost $28 000 was in breach of the Pig Industry Act as it was a variance from the expenses included in the annual operational plan approved by the Minister.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . The Corporation has since been advised by the Minister that he is unable to sanction the Corporation funding the Federal Court action. The Corporation is continuing to seek Ministerial approval for the expense.
        </para>
        <para>
         I must say that I hope, if that requires a cabinet decision, that a declaration of interest will be made on the matter by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The final matter I would like to raise relates to the audit of the Australian Taxation Office, which I would like to deal with at length at another time. I want to mention in passing that it is curious to note that one of the matters that the audit office found to be unsatisfactory was the use by members of the tax office of the Australian Government credit card. The Auditor-General has said:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There was a number of unsatisfactory matters relating to credit cards including:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          inadequate descriptions on sales vouchers which prevented verification of items purchased and no supporting documentation that goods and services had been received; and
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          monthly reconciliations of the credit card settlement account which were not always completed.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         There may be some taxpayers who would be very interested to know that in its own administration the tax office, which takes such a strong position on the verification of credit card accounts that it will not regard monthly credit card statements as evidence of expenditure and requires the little yellow slips, has not satisfied the Auditor-General in respect of descriptions on sale vouchers and unsatisfactory reconciliation of the credit card settlement account. This is perhaps a whimsy that might appeal to those taxpayers who have found their deductions denied simply because they provided credit card monthly statements. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

          Report 330, Review of Auditor-General's Reports, May 1991—September 1992

         details the Committee's review of 72 audit reports.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The review was conducted in accordance with the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, which requires the Committee to examine all reports of the Auditor-General.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As well as representing the fulfilment of a statutory obligation, the review on which this report is based has given the Committee an opportunity to re-visit a series of audits which had been conducted some years ago. With the perspective of time, the Committee has been able to identify issues which have not, in the intervening years, been properly addressed by the audited agency.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee has not canvassed in detail all of the issues raised in the audit reports: to have done so would have gone over ground already well covered by the Auditor-General, and would have delayed considerably the tabling of this report.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Instead, the Committee has focused on the recommendations contained in the audit reports. We have surveyed and checked the responses given by each of the audited agencies.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the vast majority of cases the audited agencies have agreed with the recommendations contained in the audit reports, and have taken appropriate, timely and effective remedial action. In these cases the Committee has made no comment.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee has commented only in those cases where the agency response has been inappropriate, tardy or ineffective. Most of the recommendations therefore are aimed at encouraging agencies to complete actions taken in response to a particular audit report. However, I wish to draw attention to two recommendations which have wider implications.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The first concerns internal audit. The Auditor-General had recommended that the Department of Finance should develop better in-house knowledge and expertise in the area of internal audit so that it could help to improve standards in public sector internal auditing.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Department of Finance disagrees, maintaining that, in a devolved environment, it is inappropriate for it to have a broad role in assisting agencies to develop expertise in internal audit.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee supports the view expressed by the Auditor-General and has recommended that the Department of Finance take a broader and more active role in improving internal audit standards in Commonwealth agencies. The Committee believes this role fits squarely with Finance's policy and program responsibilities.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A second recommendation I wish to draw attention to, concerns the mandate of the Auditor-General. The Committee notes that the Auditor-General has for some time sought to have himself appointed as the auditor for ANUTECH, a wholly owned subsidiary company of the ANU.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This is consistent with recommendations contained in the Committee's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Report 296, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament,
         </emphasis>
         which called for the Auditor-General to be the auditor for all statutory authorities, government owned companies and government business enterprises. Moreover, in December 1990, the Government announced its agreement to this principle.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee endorses the Auditor-General's view that full public accountability to the Parliament of ANUTECH is not assured under the current auditing arrangements. Accordingly, we have recommended that the Auditor-General be appointed as ANUTECH's auditor.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Although
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Report 330
         </emphasis>
         is necessarily brief in the consideration it gives to the audit reports, the process of checking agency responses has been valuable in itself. Many agencies have been required to report to the Committee, in some cases more than once, on their progress in implementing the Auditor-General's recommendations.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee regards its review of reports of the Auditor-General as an important part of its work and intends to table the results of its examinations on a regular basis. On occasions this will result in compilation reports, like

It is anticipated that, at times, this examination will show that another committee has reviewed or is reviewing the major issues identified in the audit report. At other times, the Committee may decide that further review is needed.

         —We return to the debate on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which is essentially a machinery bill and which allows a couple of alterations, keeping in mind the government's nomination of a particular person, namely, Justice Deirdre O'Connor to be appointed as President of the Industrial Relations Commission. This legislation is particularly related to that appointment. As such, it allows a current judge of a court created by parliament to be president, and not, as the legislation presently allows, just a person who has previously been a judge. It ensures that a judge's salary and conditions are not reduced or affected by such an appointment as president. The legislation allows the first president, Deirdre O'Connor, to be appointed after its passage. It allows that first president to be appointed for just five years, with subsequent appointments to age 65 as before.

         The matter of a five-year appointment would normally be of considerable concern because it raises the potential for governments to undermine the president's independence and thereby the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission itself. I say that it would normally be of great concern, but that concern is alleviated entirely by the fact that it will be applicable to the first president to be appointed and therefore it does not establish a precedent.

Full parliamentary scrutiny is what is required for the amendment of any legislation.

The government's professed aim is to make senior appointments from outside what is known as the industrial relations club and we welcome that move. Regardless of which interest group in society the appointee comes from, in a body such as the Industrial Relations Commission all new appointees will need to work extremely hard to gain the confidence not only of their colleagues but also of those on whose behalf they are passing judgment. That would apply no matter who was appointed.

An independent point of view is the most important characteristic here, and that has been displayed in former appointments. They are the sorts of qualities that the President of the Industrial Relations Commission will need to display.

I would even use the word `balanced', now that it has been introduced into the argument. But it does not refer only to former employer representatives or former employee representatives, but also, for example, to gender balance. Taking into account all the considerations, the appointments that have been made by Minister Brereton are a step in the right direction. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. To make assertions and assumptions now is not only naive but, I suggest, ignores the precedents of decisions that have been made by the commission—and the criticisms of them.

         What matters ultimately is not the make-up of the commission but the decisions. The time to criticise will be when the decisions are before us. The late Justice Madden may once have been an employer advocate but his last national wage case decision, when handed down, quite properly gave priority to social justice considerations. We expect the new commission to bring the same wisdom and independence to bear in the ground-breaking work before it. We oppose the amendment to the second reading; and we support the bill.

At present she is a judge in the Federal Court and President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. She was also chair of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for a time. However, there is nothing in her record to suggest that she has had any significant experience in the complex and difficult area of industrial relations. Honourable senators may be aware that the Industrial Relations Act specifically indicates that the appointee to the position of president should have `skills and experience in the field of industrial relations'.

         As far as I can ascertain, Justice Deirdre O'Connor's experience in the area of industrial relations is extremely limited. It is confined essentially to workers' compensation where the issues involved inevitably do not deal with the collective relations between employers and employees. It is a measure of the arrogance of this government that whereas we are passing this legislation through the parliament purely to assist the appointment of Justice O'Connor, the government is unwilling to acknowledge in this bill that by the standards of the current act—its own act which it has previously passed through this parliament—it appears that Justice O'Connor is not qualified for this task.

         Presumably the Governor-General is going to be advised that Justice Deirdre O'Connor has a high level of experience in industrial relations. The government will have to advise him that. The government should change the act to allow the appointment of someone like Justice O'Connor, without the necessary experience—if that is the way the government wishes to go—or the Governor-General should press the executive council for further information on her industrial relations experience.

         This is not just a debating point. By not amending the legislation this way the government exposes Justice O'Connor to being disqualified from office at a future date, possibly by the High Court. One can easily contemplate that in a bitter industrial relations dispute where emotions are running very high a declaration could be sought by parties to this dispute, who may believe they will be in receipt of an unfavourable determination, claiming to the High Court that Justice Deirdre O'Connor has not been properly appointed. I also draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the announcement of the appointment has been made before the legislation is through the parliament and before the Governor-General has had a chance to consider the recommendation of the government. This is but another example of an arrogant break with tradition, when the Governor-General announces the appointments of high government office.

         There are strong reasons for this protocol, not the least being that the appointees are seen to be independent. There are a number of people on the Federal Court who have a more detailed understanding and, hence, a far greater claim to this position than Justice O'Connor would appear to have. Such people include Justice Keely, Justice Gray, Justice Ryan or Justice Northrop. Possibly they were approached by Minister Brereton—I do not know. However, it has to be said that there was no press speculation encouraged by the minister's office about possible offers to these and other distinguished judges.

         In industrial relations circles there is widespread criticism of the government for its failure to consult about this appointment. I am sorry that this point was not picked up by Senator Bell in his remarks. The last three presidents of the commission—Sir Richard Kirby, Sir John Moore and Barry Maddern—had a wealth of experience to bring to the institution. Maddern struggled hard and manfully to maintain the independence of the institution but, as we all know, he was treated shabbily by Mr Kelty and the government for his efforts.

         Justice O'Connor—I heard Senator Bell's remarks and the hopes that he expressed—may turn out to be a great president of the commission. I wish her well. But I would be less than frank if I did not state that at present, based on her level of experience, she is clearly the odd president out—and I am referring to the other three presidents. There is an argument put to me by people involved in this area that industrial relations is a jurisdiction where subtlety and a deep knowledge of industrial relations history is important in the often highly charged atmosphere in which cases are heard. I certainly hope that Justice O'Connor has these skills.

         All previous appointments saw the post of President of the Industrial Relations Commission as the pinnacle of their careers. This bill makes it a comparatively short-term assignment. Justice O'Connor has been appointed for a fixed period only. Why? The presidency of the commission is not a life sentence. Justice O'Connor could leave at any time—in two, five or 10 years. The government has not explained why  it is necessary to create this special arrangement. Senator Faulkner is smiling. I am interested to hear his remarks. Perhaps he could answer the question about the five-year term and what is so special about it.

         As is usual with this government, there was no consultation with employers prior to the announcement. I am sorry that Senator Bell did not make that comment. It is important in this area that the commission enjoys the confidence of all parties. When employers and their views are not only ignored, which is bad enough, but are not even given the courtesy of an opportunity to consult with the government, it is a very poor start indeed.

         Justice O'Connor will have a mighty task to convince employers in this country that the court will provide industrial relations justice without fear or favour. The plain fact of the matter—I again listened very carefully to Senator Bell's comments—is that the presidential members of the commission have been stacked with ACTU operatives: Jan Marsh, Alan Boulton, Ian Watson and Jenny Acton are already presidential members; Iain Ross, as has been mentioned, has just been appointed. All these individuals come directly from the office of Bill Kelty. If it is not so important whether these people have a union background or an employer's background, why are all these major appointments coming straight out of the ACTU? Frankly, the government and the unions feel it is important and we in this Senate should express concern about it.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, with your interest in industrial relations you will remember that Jenny Acton got her position by deciding not to contest the ALP preselection for the seat of Hotham. Honourable senators will recall that that seat was given to Simon Crean. What a small world it is. Of course, that is not to say that these appointees are precluded from carrying out their tasks in a thoroughly professional fashion. I understand that Alan Boulton, for example, has established a reputation for impartiality and is eminently well qualified for the position he currently holds. I point out to Senator Bell that I am not opposed to the appointment of union people, but we need union people of quality and union people who are prepared to establish their independence. Even Phil Gude, the Victorian industrial relations minister, observed that Boulton had served as President of the Victorian Industrial Relations Commission with integrity and professionalism.

         By the standards of the Labor cronies act—the overriding law which governs the activities of the Keating administration—it has to be said that Iain Ross, the new vice-president in charge of enterprise agreements, is superbly qualified, having worked with both Mr Keating and Mr Kelty. He has the double. Indeed, a number of commentators consider the vice-presidential role to be more powerful and influential in the commission than even the presidential position, to which Justice O'Connor has been appointed. The result of the government's legislation in this area is to force work into the bargaining division, which Iain Ross, late of the ACTU, controls.

         The AIRC should not be in a position, as the ACTU is, where the secretary makes the running and the president is the mouthpiece. Justice O'Connor has the ultimate responsibility  for the commission, but she will have no direct control over one of the key areas. Hence, this vice-presidential appointment greatly adds to the problems that Justice O'Connor now has in restoring the credibility of the commission.

         There are approximately 17 presidential members of the commission in all. I point out to Senator Bell that only two members come from business backgrounds and two from government backgrounds. As I have said, the preponderance of federal government appointees to the commission comes from trade union backgrounds. Senator Bell—given his often expressed concern for small business, which I do not dispute—would have served the community better if he had drawn the attention of his particular concern to this stacking of the commission.

         Under previous administrations, Liberal and Labor, there was a genuine attempt to establish a balanced commission that could attract widespread support from the community and, indeed, all sides of politics. Under the Hawke and Keating governments, this tradition has been cast aside. The commission, through appointments and the Industrial Relations Reform Act, has in effect been converted to an arm of government and of the ACTU in an attempt to make it do Keating and Kelty's bidding. I therefore stress that Justice O'Connor and her other commission members have a truly mighty task to demonstrate independence from the government and the ACTU. Their efforts will be closely watched by the coalition.

         As I said, neither business nor the states were consulted in this appointment. The changes to industrial relations make it essential that the states be consulted on appointments. There is no doubt that the commission's role has been greatly strengthened by the recent change to the Industrial Relations Act, giving the commission power to set minimum terms and conditions of employment for all Australian workers, not just those covered by federal awards. There will be increasing importance attached to test cases run in the commission on such matters as parental leave, termination and redundancy.

The Commonwealth, as the dominant player, must exercise considerable care and restraint in making further changes to the system and in making appointments to the commission. In this context, the failure to consult with the states prior to making a present appointment is not a welcome development. If the Commonwealth wishes to establish its bona fides in relation to a more coordinated and cooperative national set of arrangements governing industrial relations, it must take the initiative in promoting greater trust and confidence in those parts of the national system over which it has exclusive control.

         It also needs to be remembered that this government and the present ACTU leadership have done more to damage the standing and reputation of the AIRC than any other government in our history. Honourable senators will recall the Staples affair, the controversy over commission pay, a tax on the commission by Keating and Kelty after the 1991 national wage case, and the stacking of trade union people onto the commission. And who could forget the resignation of the former trade union leader and commissioner, Ken Turbet, who said that he had had a gutful of government and ACTU attacks on the commission.

         There is no doubt that in the not too distant future Justice O'Connor will have the opportunity to demonstrate that the commission over which she now presides is one that will maintain its independence and integrity and will judge cases on their merits and not simply endorse government-ACTU proposals. She would do a great deal to restore confidence in the commission if she gave a clear message to the government that what she wanted was a balanced and independent commission.

         The government changes to the AIRC are an attempt to bend this institution to union and government dictates. The government, forever proving that it is the industrial arm of the trade union movement, has met all of Kelty's demands over the last decade or so to extend union power and privilege within the Australian community. Just think of the list: compulsory amalgamations; compulsory superannuation; overriding state government laws through the aggressive use of ILO conventions; huge amounts of government grants to trade unions; and of course a vast range of jobs in strategic positions being given to union representatives.

         In relation to the AIRC, the government has been more than happy to follow Mr Kelty's bidding. Yet the paradox remains: every effort to buttress the power and privilege of unions only seems to make them feel more insecure. I point out to Labor senators that the ultimate security of the union movement lies not within the laws which this parliament or any other parliament may pass; nor does it lie in the ability of Bill Kelty to stack key institutions. The security of the union movement lies in the hearts and minds of Australians. And the plain fact of the matter is that increasing numbers of Australians are refusing to join trade unions.

         After a decade in power, all the ALP-ACTU government has delivered is massive unemployment. Of course, having prevented major reforms to the economy, Kelty and Keating have left Australian workers exposed to further economic adversity. Kelty has treated other players—key institutions and state governments—with contempt. I wonder whether he is worried that other governments in other times may make use of the precedence that he has established. Mr Kelty's attitude reminds me of the East Germans: they constructed the Berlin Wall and for decades worked hard to make it more secure and more impregnable; yet in 1989 the whole structure came tumbling down.

         In 1994 the attitudes of Mr Kelty seem more and more irrelevant. If the AIRC as it is presently constructed turns out to be simply another arm of the Kelty machine and the government, we can be assured that public support and respect, which are essential to any key institution, will collapse. Justice O'Connor and her colleagues must now establish their independence. If they do not, I make this prediction: this parliament will be debating industrial relations reform bills relating to the AIRC in the years to come.

         The point I want to make this afternoon is that, even though this is just a minor machinery bill to amend the substantive bill which went through the parliament in December, it does not encourage people to invest in Australia. In fact, it is another minor irritant on the investment scene here. I have said in the Senate several times that there is an investment crisis here right now. The level of investment in Australia for the last two years has been the lowest ever by business for over 30 years, and the investment in plant and equipment is the lowest ever since World War II—over 40 years.

         Just as importantly, the industrial relations bill that went through the parliament in December was also an absolute positive deterrent to investment because it increased the uncertainty of the business world—of investors—about their people. With this bill, the government is signalling further ACTU involvement in the industrial relations scene and, again, the perception will be that the government does not want us to invest in Australia. Yet it is known by all advisers and commentators in the investment world that freeing up the labour market and not constraining it is the first priority for sustained economic growth in the long-term future.

         —As I am informed, the savings are administrative. The infrastructure for the administration scheme is already in place and will not require major enhancement to deal with an expected gradual increase in workload. It may be necessary to transfer some resources from the DVA to Defence as the number of beneficiaries under each scheme changes. There will be a decline in the overall workload of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is already a system in place in Defence for safety, rehabilitation and compensation and this system will result in administrative savings. Overall there will be minimal augmentation which will generally result in savings that are difficult to quantify precisely. Because of those administrative changes, we believe there will be an overall decline in costs.

         —I take it from that that Senator Sherry is saying that no member of the ADF will be penalised in any way at all by a narrow interpretation of what is time on duty when travelling. I understand that there have already been cases taken to the AAT by defence personnel because SRCA has proved not able to take the unique travelling situation of the ADF into account. I ask the parliamentary secretary for his view on those cases, and whether they should have been covered, and, in the light of that, does he still stand by the answer he has given me?

         —Take the case of a reserve officer or a senior NCO who lives in a capital city and who has to travel maybe 200 miles to an Army Reserve unit outside the capital city. That is not an infrequent practice. There are officers who are required to leave at about three in the afternoon, do three or four hours driving, take a parade, do the paperwork and drive back after midnight. Is Senator Sherry telling me that when they are driving back at midnight the 200 miles to the capital city when the parade is over, that they are no longer on duty,  therefore they are not covered?

Clearly they would not have been in the exercise area if they had not been on duty. To argue that they were on some sort of leave at the time seems to take a narrow view that I would find unacceptable.

         Secondly, on the issue of costs, if a claimant is successful in having decisions varied by the AAT, the Commonwealth meets his or her costs. I also understand that, even if the claimant is unsuccessful, only rarely does the government press recovery of government costs in those circumstances.

But, under the new provisions of the MCS, much greater consideration is given to rehabilitation. Defence will integrate its administration of the scheme and ensure that it fulfils its responsibilities in the way that employers in other industries are increasingly doing in the rehabilitation area.

         A separate MCS, which is administered by Defence, brings that employer's responsibility into sharper focus. The responsibility for occupational health and safety, compensation and rehabilitation are all closely aligned. The MCS will allow Defence to integrate all of the aspects of this important area. Although the Department of Veterans' Affairs has a long history of administering veterans' benefits, it has had little experience in managing the type of rehabilitation and vocational retraining that is the hallmark of modern compensation legislation, such as the MCS. Defence is now fulfilling its rehabilitation and vocational training responsibilities under the SRCA and is well positioned to continue this for the MCS.

         Much rehabilitation work is now carried out by the Defence Force's medical services and through a highly effective system of schools and training courses. The MCS allows the co-location of medical, occupational health and safety, compensation, rehabilitation and defence administration in the regional defence centres. This arrangement will help to ensure that an injured serviceman or servicewoman is provided with continuous support for a process of treatment and rehabilitation both within and without the service. It is important to keep the MCS separate from the VEA. Although both schemes provide excellent benefits, they are different schemes with a different focus.

         —I am informed that there is no budget limit for an individual. If it is believed that education at a university or a TAFE college is a relevant form of training and is the way for that individual to go then in those circumstances fees would be paid. There are not arbitrary figures provided for retraining or re-education costs, and I think that is to the advantage of the individual. There is a limit to which a person can retrain or re-educate, and that would have to be assessed. In those circumstances, after counselling, it may not be appropriate for a person to continue in that scheme or schemes in which he has been involved in. It is very hard to set an arbitrary limit whilst at the same time being fair in all the circumstances.

         —There are two forms of compensation. Dealing firstly with the lump sum payment for disability: it is possible for a person who has received a lump sum in recognition of a disability to return at a later date. Having already received a payment following the initial assessment, if deterioration occurs that is determined—I would assume it is the medical practitioner who would determine this—to be greater than 10 per cent of the person's initial assessed impairment, there is the capacity to receive an additional lump sum in recognition of that continuing deterioration. A similar principle would apply with regard to income that is paid in recognition of the loss of income.

         In relation to hearing, all the circumstances involving a continuing hearing loss have to be examined. I understand that, generally, human beings' sight and hearing deteriorates naturally over life. There may be other factors involved in alternative employment which lead to a deterioration in people's hearing or loss of sight—or whatever the particular deterioration is. So those factors would also have to be assessed in any revisiting of the disability and the initial payments made.

         I suggest that under the precedents of the VEA, a gunner would have no difficulty in showing that his deterioration in auditory acuity was greater than that for his age group and that his occupation as a gunner was the prime contributing factor. At that point, having been separated from the ADF for 10 or 12 years, can he make a claim under the MCS? If he can make a claim, what can he expect—both a lump sum and income support or just a lump sum?

To answer Senator MacGibbon's question, in general people would be evaluated in the same way under the MCS as they would under the VEA. Dealing with the specific matter of hearing, the national hearing centre would determine whether the hearing loss is related to noise exposure and, if so and if there are no other aggravating factors, a lump sum would be paid. If income loss has also eventuated, income support payments will also be paid up to the age of 65. So a person should not suffer any disadvantage either generally or specifically relating to the hearing loss matter that Senator MacGibbon raised under the MCS provisions.

         —I would have thought that the parliamentary secretary's advisers would have those figures to hand, because it is a very relevant question. The government is asking us to approve a bill that provides for a lump sum payment. We have established what that lump sum payment is. By the standards of the time, with respect to all the circumstances under which a claim might be made, I would have thought that that sum was considerably inadequate. I would have thought the other thing the parliamentary secretary would have is a case history experience. The MCS is based on a bill which has been running for six years. It is important for the parliament to be able to judge whether the provision of a lump sum in the case of major injury is attainable for someone, if that person is badly injured.

         —We do not have the figures. All I can add is that the figures are very low because the vast majority of cases do not reflect 100 per cent disability. The assessment of the extent of impairment is based on criteria used, as I understand it, by the American armed forces. If we consider the potential lump sum payment together with the possible pension entitlements and the increased emphasis in this legislation on ensuring rehabilitation of the servicewoman or serviceman involved through education, training and a range of other initiatives, I do not think that package is unreasonable.

I do not think that to date Senator Sherry has shown that the benefits are equal to those that are presently enjoyed by members of the ADF. Let us put that aside. If Senator Sherry cannot tell me the number of payments that have been made for 100 per cent compensation under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, can he tell me what the average payment has been? He said that there has been a large number of lesser payments.

Over 20 years, the payment is $104,112. What is the position of someone who qualifies for the equivalent of a 100 per cent disability pension at age 30? That person will presumably be in the work force, with the cut off at 65 years of age, for another 35 years.

But under the VEA provisions one would receive a disability pension, the amount of which depends upon the proportion of one's disability. The medical and other related expenses are covered under the VEA in the same way as they are in the MCS, but under the latter a lump sum is received and, in addition to that, an income support payment to age 65. We would not accept Senator MacGibbon's contention that entitlements under the VEA are superior.

         —Let us look at a real case—something which has happened within my personal experience. It is not fair to say that it is common but, tragically, it does happen. Take the case of a soldier in a truck going to an exercise in a training area. There is an accident and he is either killed or injured. Perhaps he becomes a paraplegic or quadriplegic. He is 22 years of age. Under the MCS he is on peacetime service. He will qualify for the lump sum payment. He will qualify for income support—presumably at the level of a private. What happens to that soldier when he reaches 65 years of age? At present he is covered under the VEA. He would be on a maximum rate TPI pension under the current VEA legislation which would not cut out at 65 years of age; it would see him through for the term of his natural life. What is the government doing for this soldier at 65 years of age? Is it putting him on the scrap heap? Has it got him out begging on social security? What happens to him?

Obviously the amount depends on the salary that person is receiving.

He simply cannot continue to serve as a soldier—he cannot serve in any capacity in the Australian Defence Force. He must be invalided out. At age 22 he would have served, at most, four years. He would not qualify for his MSBS pension or a DFRDB which is now out of date. So this person really does not have any expectation of qualifying for his military superannuation payment.

         —Let us look at another case where a disabled veteran, covered solely by the military compensation scheme, has a major disability and has received his lump sum compensation and income support. His wife clearly has a caring role. That role is recognised under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, particularly in the extreme disability case of the totally permanently incapacitated veteran, in various ways and benefits which the secretary knows very well. What is the comparable recognition for the role of that wife when the veteran is covered solely by the military compensation scheme?

The ADF has planned an education campaign to ensure that all serving members are made aware of their rights and responsibilities under the MCS. The ADF will initiate a long-term education strategy to improve the level of knowledge among service men and women about the compensation. This sort of change is not necessarily bad in the education context. Because the change is occurring—and I am not saying that this justifies the change—it does mean that there is a need to remind service men and women as to what their entitlements are under the new provisions. It is quite possibly a good thing that that education campaign will occur as a result of this change.

A major area of responsibility was removed from the Department of Veterans' Affairs by this government when it decided to get out of providing hospital care and either integrated within the state system or sold off the repatriation general hospitals. That takes a great deal of responsibility away from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. If we now move the responsibility for compensation and other entitlements away from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and transfer it, as will occur under this Military Compensation Act which will apply to all members of the ADF and certainly all peacetime members, these personnel will not have the right of a claim under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The government will then find that a great part of the responsibilities and duties of the Department of Veterans' Affairs will disappear.

An essential feature of the composition of the commission, after extensive consultations flowing from the Brown review of the Comcare program, was that it should represent employers, unions and government. An additional member to represent the veteran community would be inconsistent with this fundamental feature.

         Also, if the government were to concede to the opposition's amendment, other organisations or lobby groups, such as superannuated public servants, who are not presently members of the commission, could also seek representation. With the introduction of an ADF representative, the commission will consist of 10 members. There has to be a reasonable limit to the size of the commission. A commission larger than 10 runs the risk of being unwieldy and inefficient.

         The Defence Force member on the commission is charged with representing the interests of ADF members. It is important to note that members of the ADF are not represented by a registered trade union and, therefore, their interests are not represented by the ACTU on the SRC. A defence member on the SRC will give service personnel a voice in this important forum, which advises the government on occupational health and safety, rehabilitation and compensation matters as they relate to Australian government employees.

         It will also ensure that the nature of defence service is fully understood by the commission. Membership of this commission will provide advantages to the ADF through exposure to the policy context in which occupational health and safety, rehabilitation and compensation mesh. Membership of the commission will enhance the ADF's awareness of the operational issues in the overall administration of the scheme.

         —The opposition will be supporting the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill. It is very short; basically, it will facilitate the commission of inquiry that has been set up to inquire into ASIS. It will do so by ensuring that the inquiry has access to the information that is necessary to it. There being some doubt about that under the terms of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act, this amendment will ensure that such access can be provided. Therefore, we obviously support the spirit of what we find in this bill because we support the notion of the inquiry that the government has finally conceded to conduct.

         Having said that, aspects of this inquiry still concern us. I wish to take a minute of the Senate's time to mention some of those concerns because while they remain outstanding we fear that they will prejudice the final determinations of the inquiry. That is something we obviously do not wish to occur. Concern has been expressed—in particular, by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Peacock, who has opposition responsibility in this area—about the appointment of Mr Michael Codd and Mr Chris Maxwell in their respective positions under this inquiry. We do not question their capability or integrity but we do question whether their appointment was appropriate in light of their previous relationships. I mention in particular Mr Codd's functions in the area of intelligence and security services—he presided over the secretary's committee on intelligence and security and the Office of Security Intelligence Coordination.

         The concern, therefore, is that he is too close in his background. It would be better to have appointed someone to this task who can be seen publicly to be more at arms length from the issues that are being addressed by the commission. I stress that it is no criticism of Mr Codd's capacity or his integrity. If the findings of this commission are going to be accorded the sort of public support that we would like to see, it would have been more sensible for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to have kept the commission more at arms length from what it is charged to examine.

         Mr Maxwell concerns us because he was so close to Senator Evans; he worked in his office when Senator Evans was Attorney-General. It is bad judgment by Senator Evans. We regret that it has occurred. We have invited him to address it, but he has declined to do so. I guess that is not surprising, because that is the way that Senator Evans normally approaches these matters. But it will be seen to be a shortcoming of the process that is the subject matter of this debate.

         We have criticised—and I do again—the terms of reference of the inquiry, which seem to us to be too vague and narrow. The functional role and priorities of ASIS have been excluded. The inquiry is really only looking into how ASIS was run and not what it did.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, I remind you that the night before Senator Evans announced this inquiry he was assuring us that what he had in mind was a `root and branch inquiry' into ASIS. He told us that one of the motivating factors was that the Cold War was over and that we must re-examine ASIS in light of the new strategic environment. That can only be interpreted in one way: there is a need to examine the functions and priorities of ASIS in the new strategic environment. Yet by the following day he told us that that was unnecessary and that he did not intend to give the inquiry the breadth to examine such a fundamental question. We believe that that is a major shortcoming of this inquiry.

         We certainly do not accept the justification that Senator Evans gave for the revision of his thinking, which is that an internal inquiry had already taken place within the last few years. From memory, I think it occurred in 1992. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember, from the little you would have seen about it in the press, that it was purely an internal review.

         We believe that it is necessary to now look beyond the views of the Canberra bureaucracy. Therefore, what logically follows is that the minister has given us no justifiable explanation for his overnight change of mind. One can only assume that pressure was put on him from some direction; one knows not what. The legacy will be that this inquiry will take place and will be concluded without there being any outside examination of the objects and priorities of ASIS in this new strategic environment. That is a disappointing shortcoming. An opportunity has been lost by this government, and no satisfactory explanation has been given for it.

         We are concerned that some of the allegations that were made were operational allegations. It is hard to imagine how they can be examined without looking at the functional role and priorities of the body itself. We are also concerned about the threats that appeared in Senator Evans's press statement in relation to the ASIS officers whose public concern has led to this inquiry—a public concern that they voiced under very difficult circumstances.

         The government cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, the government cannot criticise them for voicing their concerns about an important, secret and, therefore, protected body within our bureaucracy and, on the other hand, acknowledge that there is sufficient justification arising out of their concerns to set up a commission of inquiry of this nature. If Senator Evans accepts that there is sufficient justification to set it up, then we believe that to finish his press release with threats to the individuals concerned is unsound, unhelpful and does not demonstrate from the minister the sort of good faith that we have a right to expect.

         We have to remember that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security validated at least some of the expressions of concern of these officers who made complaints when he found, in relation to issues concerning their labour relations, that they had been handled `improperly'—I think that was the word he used in one of his annual reports. Certainly, he said that they had been denied natural justice. In those circumstances where the Inspector-General gives credit to aspects of their complaint, their personal grievances, one wonders whether there might be some validity to the claims that they make on operational matters.

         I guess that is one of our fundamental concerns that we are pleased has resulted in an inquiry of this type. The fact that they have received some support from the Inspector-General into certain aspects of their complaints at least gives them sufficient basis to justify an inquiry into those which are much more difficult to explore: the operational questions. It also indicates that the people making complaints deserve to be treated with more respect in their expressions of concern than what they have received from Senator Evans to date.

         How these particular former ASIS officers are supported in this inquiry will, again, demonstrate how serious the government is in fairly addressing their concerns. The question of legal assistance is one that is still on the table. I will be interested to hear what support the government is prepared to give them to ensure that their case is put to this inquiry in a proper and professional way; certainly in a way that is at least as professional as that which is going to be put by others denying their claims.

         It is critical now that the government has gone down this path that it gets to the bottom of these very serious allegations so the public can be reassured in the future that ASIS conducts its business in a way that the public has a right to expect. I understand that the inquiry will look at the operation of ASIS within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and into the well-known public antagonism against ASIS that exists within parts of the foreign affairs bureaucracy. Without a sound working relationship between the two bodies under the same umbrella, the public obviously will suffer a loss of confidence and there will be a loss of efficiency. If, as I understand it, the inquiry is going to look at that issue, we will be pleased to see it.

         In summary, the case obviously was made out for an inquiry. We are pleased that it is occurring. We are very sceptical about Senator Evans's explanation that he had been giving this inquiry consideration for some time, firstly because he told us the same day as he said he was considering it that there was no need. Between question time during the day and estimates in the evening he apparently changed his mind. Secondly, he said that he had been considering it for some time and it needed to be root and branch, thus obviously raising the issue of objects and priorities. Yet the following day he decided that that was not necessary.

         Such confusion does not give us confidence that it had been well thought through by Senator Evans, but rather that he had been induced to go down this path by public embarrassment caused by the revelations made public by these officers. While not having great confidence in his planning for this process, we are nevertheless pleased that it is occurring. We wish only to record that we would have been happier if he had ensured that in the structure of both the commission and its counsel those with vested interests were to be kept more at arms length. We would also have been happier if he had gone as far as he indicated that he desired to go—and had a full inquiry, including an inquiry into the functions and objects.

         Honourable senators on my side of the chamber have been supportive of ASIS over the years. But when bodies are protected by secrecy, as this one needs to be, it places upon the government perhaps a greater responsibility than in relation to other parts of the bureaucracy to ensure that the body keeps to its charge and its objects, to ensure that it is efficiently managed to achieve those objects and, particularly, to ensure that staff who have less recourse to public avenues of support than staff in other areas are properly treated and do not get into difficulties with ASIS, eventually being told by an adjudicator that they were denied the principles of natural justice.

But in relation to this specific bill and the capacity of the commission therefore to get the material it needs from the Inspector-General, we obviously support it.

Under the circumstances, the Democrats are pleased to support these amendments as they will undoubtedly strengthen the inquiry's scope and enable the commission to examine ASIS operations in accordance with the government's terms of reference. As to those terms of reference, the Australian Democrats have a number of concerns which we have previously stated in relation to ASIS operations and about which we hope the commission of inquiry will deliver some positive recommendations.

         There should by now be no doubt that ASIS is, in all probability, an organisation operating out of control. The government's desire to have the commission of inquiry examine the current arrangements for the control and accountability of ASIS indicates that the government also has concerns. The recent ABC

         program on ASIS revealed remarkably disturbing aspects of the operations of this country's foreign intelligence services. We believe a great many people who saw that program were as alarmed as we were at the allegations contained in the program and, in particular, at claims that Australia was involved in illegal activities in other countries.

         It is worth repeating here that we believe the whole question of why Australia is involved in the foreign intelligence business at all should come within the scope of this commission of inquiry. The Democrats do not accept that a middle-sized power such as Australia has any real reason to be involved in foreign intelligence, and we sincerely doubt that there is any lasting benefit to this country by indulging in this sort of activity. For instance, why on earth is ASIS involving itself in intelligence operations being conducted by both the British and the US in third countries? How do these sorts of operations bring any benefit to our foreign policy?

         Against this background, the issue of oversight of ASIS is perhaps the most important aspect of the examination to be conducted by the commission of inquiry, and the terms of inquiry reflect this. As I said at the time this issue arose, it is an essential cornerstone of democracy that no body or group can be or should be above the law. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for any government instrumentality to effectively operate as a law unto itself, as ASIS now appears to be doing. We obviously cannot allow this to continue.

         Some time ago I asked the minister a series of questions about the accountability of ASIS and how similar foreign intelligence services, such as MI6 or the CIA, were monitored in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It is worth repeating that in those countries a process is in place whereby both intelligence agencies are scrutinised by their respective legislatures. In the UK, for instance, parliamentary oversight is now being put in place which will hold to account both the internal and the external intelligence agencies of that country. Perhaps we need to look at setting up a similar structure here. One option may be to expand the role and responsibility of the parliamentary committee currently overseeing the operations of ASIO so as to bring in ASIS as well. We will be awaiting with very keen interest the outcome of the commission's recommendations on this subject.

In all of this, the Democrats believe it is important that former officers of ASIS not be forgotten. In spite of all this, and in many ways because of all this, the Democrats support the bill.

         Because time will not allow me to dwell on all the relative merits and drawbacks of each measure, I will be fairly selective in my remarks. I deal firstly with the fringe benefits tax. The general exemption to employees for travel in foreign locations rectifies a problem that should never have existed or been created in the first place. The change in the fringe benefits tax is that the rate applicable to many non-profit organisations will extend to non-government schools under Commonwealth, state or territory legislation.

         The amendment rectifies a deficiency in the original legislation which the explanatory memorandum says was unintentional. Luckily for those potential casualties of the government's attempt to legislate, this deficiency has now been picked up and the amendment is supported by the National Council of Independent Schools Associations and will extend the grossing up rebate to a number of schools in Tasmania, including the Hutchins School, St Michaels Collegiate School, the Launceston Church Grammar School and Scotch Oakburn College.

         The final FBT change is aimed, I guess, to increase tax revenue by eliminating the loophole that employers had found with the FBT on car parking provisions. I draw the Senate's attention to how quickly the government often moves to rectify measures if there is an intended loss to revenue. Presently, employers must pay FBT on car parking benefits, mind you, provided to their employees. Naturally, some astute employers have minimised the FBT payable by selecting low reference rates—the fees charged at kerbside meters or the night-time fees set by commercial parking stations. The effect of this amendment is that fringe benefits tax will be calculated in relation to daytime rates from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. only, and that parking meters will not be considered `commercial parking stations'. I remind the Senate that, in effect, each car parking space may attract a double tax, especially where more than one car uses that space in any particular day. I also remind the Senate of the very high compliance costs associated with identifying cars coming in and going out of car parking spaces.

         In that light, I confidently predict that this amendment will not clarify the matter sufficiently. I forecast that problems will arise with the concept of `commercial parking rate' which could vary between locations. One way of eliminating this problem altogether would be to use a standard rate applicable to all employers, irrespective of location. If the Australian Taxation Office adopted a commonsense approach to interpreting the legislation as it currently stands, this amendment would not be necessary. However, instead, there have already been determinations as to the measurement of the one-kilometre radius, the form of valuation required, what is a commercial parking station, the valuation of car parking benefits and the valuation of benefits for a particular day—just to name a few.

         The difficulty is that the institute rightly emphasises that expenditure may be totally unconnected to any income earning activity of the taxpayer and argues that there is no policy for including the rebate within the tax system as it merely adds to its complexity. We have received representations from the Australian Council of National Trusts which are not all that complimentary to the rebate scheme. It, too, states that the rebate `represents a most important initiative for heritage conservation in Australia'. But the praise stops there and the criticisms commence. The council indicates that it and other heritage organisations have  lobbied for a considerable time for the introduction of the scheme which was first mooted in Australia by the Hope inquiry in the early 1970s.

This makes a significant change to when tax is payable. A `small' taxpayer pays tax in one instalment 18 months after the start of the financial year, whilst large taxpayers pay in four instalments with the first due nine months after the start of the financial year, being 25 per cent of the estimated liability payable for the first three months.

         As a consequence of this amendment, there is a substantial contraction of the time interval and a bunching effect during which returns must be prepared. The taxation environment in which companies operate today is constrictive. They must cope with initial tax, quarterly instalments and then extra taxes arising from changes to fringe benefits tax. This is due to the fact that previously certain expenses were not subject to FBT; they are now deductible but subject to FBT. This tax must also be paid during the year in which the benefit is paid to an employee. The whole tax scenario leads to a contraction in cash flow and additional payments by corporations in a contracted time interval.

I am pleased that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation will be examining this very matter through the taking of submissions and public hearings later this year and that it will be reporting to the Senate. Someone has clearly got to look at this massive problem. The government's promises in August of last year to give high priority to resolving the problems has unfortunately fallen by the wayside or its timetable has slipped.

Contractors' livelihoods will be adversely affected by this amendment. Accordingly, I call on the government to exempt contractors from the provisions of the superannuation guarantee legislation.

         I wind up by saying that the government placed at the last minute a series of amendments covering something like 16 pages of new taxation law affecting life assurance registered organisations. The intent is to limit the deductibility of expense in a range of scenarios. I have been assured that the amendments have been made following consultations with the respective industry parties involved. Since I have received no representation, I believe that there would be an acceptance of those most recent amendments. Accordingly, I move:

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is a series of specific proposals for changes in the taxation arrangements and regimes. My colleague Senator Watson dealt with many of the specifics of the bill in some detail, and he will be pursuing those aspects in the committee stage. I do not propose tonight to revisit that ground. I wish to talk more broadly about the government's taxation policy and the forthcoming budget. But first I want to raise what I consider to be a major concern about the government's handling of this bill, especially the amendments and requests to be moved to the bill by the government.

         This bill is classified as one which does not impose taxation. I should say at the outset that I appreciate the advice that has come to me and to other members on both sides of the chamber from the office of the Clerk of the Senate. Many of the government amendments to the bill, however, despite the fact that it is classified as a bill that does not impose taxation, are to be moved in the form of requests for amendments because the view is taken that they will increase the liability to taxation and therefore fall within the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution insofar as they would `increase any proposed charge or burden on the people'.

         It seems to me that a very important paradox is quite apparent here. How can an amendment increase a proposed charge or burden on the people when the bill to be amended is classified as a bill which does not impose taxation and, therefore, presumably, does not propose any charge or burden on the people? How can a bill which could be introduced in the Senate because it is not a bill imposing taxation then be amended in such a way as to increase the burden of taxation? Can the Senate introduce a bill which it cannot itself amend in that way? If the proposed amendments have to be requests because they would increase a charge or burden on the people, then does it not follow that the provisions in the amendments actually impose taxation?

         If the whole thing is reduced to a reductio ad absurdum as a result of the classification of these bills, I think it runs a real risk that, in due course, when the High Court comes to a judgment on the meaning of laws imposing taxation, we, through our actions here—or, more specifically, the government through its actions in terms of the classification of bills—will be seen to have been very destructive in terms of the end result that may well be achieved. I raise that at the outset of my remarks because I consider it to be a very important aspect indeed.

         Let us now look at the government's taxation policy and its approach to the forthcoming budget. We should never forget that last year's post-election budget was unequivocally a budget of deceit and betrayal. We got election promises, hype in the government's proposals and promises, and glad words before the election about no increases in taxation. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying just three months before the election, `What I am promising is not to put up tax. I do not think the incidence of tax should rise', and the then finance minister, now Treasurer (Mr Willis), just after the 1993 election saying that the government `does not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation'.

         Despite these statements we have had, as a result of the re-election of the Keating government a year ago, across-the-board rises in wholesale sales tax of up to 20 per cent and a massive 30 per cent hike in petrol excise—7c a litre. There has been a major reneging on the government's so-called One Nation income tax cuts which were to be worth something like $8.5 billion. Only $3 billion worth of tax cuts was delivered and the remaining $5.5 billion worth was pushed off to never-never land,  which means that they will never be introduced. Of course, the government never intended that these cuts would be introduced because the government never thought it would be in a position where it had to honour that promise as it did not think it was going to win the election.

         We are in a post-1993 budget and pre-1994 budget context where we have an electorate, a taxpaying community, which has seen all those promises shattered. In the current financial year, 1993-94, the taxation revenue was budgeted to equal 21.9 per cent of the gross domestic product. This year, on the estimates provided at the time of the last budget, and since revised, it rises to a whopping 22.8 per cent. On the government's own figures, that is an increase next year in real terms of 8.1 per cent. By 1996-97 it will, again on the government's own figures, have risen further to a figure of 23.5 per cent of gross domestic product. In other words, taxation revenue by 1996-97 will be not far short of one-quarter of total GDP.

         We have the situation where income tax, sales tax and petrol tax are higher and the fringe benefits tax burden is greater. It looks almost certain that we will have another hike in the Medicare levy this year—whether it rises from 1.25 per cent to the 2 per cent that the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) obviously wants or whether it is some figure in between, we will have to wait and see. What is quite certain is that there will be an increase in the Medicare levy. We look like having the prospect of another new tax in the form of a so-called jobs levy. Different words have been said about that, but it has not been ruled out yet.

         We are facing changes to the tax treatment of superannuation, which seems quite certain to result in another tax hike. So, we are, and have been for 12 months now, in an environment of high and rising taxes with no prospect of that turning around. Indeed, on the government's own expectations and forecasts publicly produced, far from any tax burden falling, the overall burden is forecast to increase.

         That brings me to this year's budget, which is now only six or seven weeks down the track. The Treasurer has announced in his fiscal framework that the government believes there is a starting point deficit for 1994-95 of around $13 billion. That compares with what is expected to be an outturn for this year of something of the order of $14.75 billion—a far too high and unacceptable budget outturn. Yet, we have a starting point for the year about to commence of a figure not much less than that. Heaven only knows where it will finish up by the time the government determines its spending program on the whole raft of things it has said it will spend on. I think this would be a convenient point for me to break.

The National Landcare Awards are organised by Landcare Australia Limited (LAL), a company established to encourage awareness and sponsorship of landcare. Acceptance of sponsorships by LAL should not be seen as endorsement of the sponsors' products, but rather as endorsement of landcare by the sponsoring companies.

        (1) The appointment of a member to the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee to represent consumers is made under paragraph 45(1)(d) of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 ("the Act"). The term "consumer" is not defined in the Act, but following advice received from the Attorney-General's Department in 1991, the term "consumer" was broadly interpreted to mean either any member of the public or a consumer of new varieties or a consumer that uses products derived from new varieties as raw materials. The selection criteria to be fulfilled by the consumer representative are that the person so nominated must have, in the opinion of the selection committee which advises the Minister, appropriate experience and qualifications to adequately fulfil the function of representative of one or more categories of consumer. Weight in the selection process is also given to the representational breadth of the nominee.

        (2) The first consumer representative was a solicitor with experience in public and administrative law nominated by the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. The second representative was an agricultural economist with qualifications and research experience in the nature and socio-economic impact of plant variety rights. The nomination of the third and current representative was supported by the Council of Australian Food Technology Associations. This person has qualifications and research and development experience in developing consumer products from new varieties of agricultural crops. In its formative stages the Australian Plant Variety Rights Scheme and the legislation on which it is based has gained appreciably from the cumulative advice received from the breadth of experience of the consumer representatives that have represented a wide spectrum of relevant consumer interests in plant variety rights.

        The $9,303,000 referred to in the Explanation of Additional Estimates 1993-94 is a net adjustment to the Appropriation for Division 815; it is made up of several components, some of which are deferrals of expenditure associated with major projects. In several cases there is no deferral of the associated works; the appropriation is being adjusted to align funds availability with the financial year in which expenditure will actually occur.

        After initial design and environmental planning studies were completed for the proposed tower in 1990, estimated costs were clearly prohibitive.

        Refurbishment of the Gore Hill tower is in progress and due for completion in July 1994.
