It is absolutely no wonder the country is in such a mess when the Labor Party cannot even keep this chamber going. For those who are listening to the broadcast, I say that it is the government's duty to keep this chamber operating. Yesterday, the Labor Party could not muster a quorum for this chamber. I suspect that Labor senators were having a farewell party for Senator Richardson, with his newly found interest in overseas travel, perhaps in an ambassadorial post somewhere. Certainly, they were not in the chamber. They were somewhere else and could not keep the chamber going.

        Before the lunch break yesterday, I was speaking on this matter of registration of senators' interests. I indicated that I have no objection to disclosing what little assets I have. In fact, I have already done that in the past. Like Senator Panizza and others on this side who have been members of local authorities, we have already done that. We have disclosed, to anyone who was interested to look, what our assets and interests were in our role in local government. I have no particular concern about that.

        The concern I do have with this motion by the Labor Party is that it is not a genuine attempt to disclose senators' interests. Senator Baume has mentioned on many occasions, and again today in a notice of motion, just how the Labor Party flouts these rules. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot even fill in the form correctly. It will be interesting to see whether there is any response to Senator Baume's notice of motion this morning in which he asked whether the Prime Minister complied with the guidelines in disclosing his interests as required.

        It is really just a stunt by the Labor Party. Members of the Labor Party are not genuine about disclosure of interests. I say this because I understand there was very little or no consultation with the Liberal Party on the form that the proposed resolution should take. One would think that if there were any genuine interest by the Labor Party in proper disclosure, it would have been done in a bipartisan way. There would have been some input from all parties—particularly the majority party in this chamber, the party that is favoured by a majority of Australians. One would have thought there might have been some consultation, but there was not.

        I also say there is a lack of genuineness in the fact that this motion has been around since 1983 and the government, the Labor Party, has chosen not to bring the motion on. I know some of the sycophants in the press who run around after the Labor Party are saying that it is the Liberal Party that has been delaying it. We have never delayed it. It is a very important matter which requires very intense debate and scrutiny. It is something that we have been debating, but the Labor Party keeps refusing to bring it on. It was only because it was forced to do so, on some other little grubby deal it was doing with one of the minor parties, that we are debating the matter now. The Labor Party is interested in the political point scoring of it, but there is no genuine attempt to disclose.

        During Senator Baume's speech on the motion today, he pointed out that Mr Keating did not disclose that he owed Mr Brown some $4 million, I think it was. I think that figure has since been altered to something else that Senator Baume has ascertained. How can we think that these rules are genuine when the Prime Minister cannot disclose those interests? At the time Mr Keating obtained a loan from the Commonwealth Bank he was either Treasurer or Prime Minister. It would be interesting to know whether the Prime Minister discloses his interests in the Commonwealth Bank or his loan dealings with the Commonwealth Bank when he makes decisions at the cabinet table on the Commonwealth Bank—the Commonwealth Bank being in the past wholly owned by the Commonwealth government, which is now a major shareholder. There is certainly a lack of genuineness in this.

        I said yesterday that if the Labor Party were serious about disclosure and conflict of interest, why is it not looking at disclosure for members of the press gallery, proprietors of the news media and journalists who report this parliament? I hate to say it, but on many occasions members of the press gallery and journalists have a greater influence on action the government takes than do members of parliament who are not in government. It would seem fair to ask why the Labor Party is not looking at some disclosure for them. I also asked why the Labor Party and the unions are not required to disclose their assets because decisions this government makes every day affect the very large land-holdings of the unions and the very big shareholdings that I know the ALP has in Queensland and, no doubt, elsewhere. I also question why departmental heads are not required to participate in some form of public disclosure.

        I am interested to see what the Democrats' amendment in relation to spouses is. There are fairly different proposals around. The government's proposal is that the assets of de facto spouses have to be disclosed if they are known. I want someone to tell me what a de facto spouse is. It seems to me to be a term which you can interpret as you want. If you are married, in a regular marriage, we know who your spouse is. But these days there are a number of people in the community who have relationships. Are they de facto spousal relationships? I understand that the current politically correct term used by the Labor Party for a husband, wife or the person you are closely associated with is `partner'. They are no longer a spouse but a `partner'. I wonder whether the de facto spouse spoken about in the Labor Party's proposal means partner. Just what does it mean? It might be interesting to hear some debate on that. I could not speak in this debate without referring to the sanctimonious claptrap that Senator Cook spoke on 19 August 1993, when this motion was first debated. Senator Cook said:

       We did not know much about that until Senator Baume and others started investigating that matter. Since August 1993 we have known a lot more about the piggery but not, of course, because of anything the Prime Minister has told us; we know simply because Senator Baume, very skilfully and persistently, has gone through and exposed for the Australian public the Prime Minister's huge conflict of interest. For Senator Cook to suggest that the Prime Minister is the fountain of all virtue in disclosure is absolutely ridiculous. I find that quite amazing.

        I understand the sensitivity of the Democrats to all this. In the press they have been blamed, along with us, for delaying this matter. I do not think they have; they are not in charge of the program of the Senate. It is a matter for the Labor Party, for the government of the day, to bring this motion on as and when required. The Labor Party has been messing around with this since 1983 simply because it did not want proper debate on and scrutiny of it. It knew in debate we would point out just how futile and how shallow these rules are.

        I might just have a look at some of the rules to see how some of the Labor Party members have complied with them in the registers of interests they have lodged.

        I congratulate Senator Colston on the way he filled in his form. I think he did so very truthfully and honestly. He has indicated that he has some shares in a private company, no doubt his own family company, and he then indicated that that family company has shares in a number of major listed public companies. It was very good of Senator Colston to disclose that. Under the rules he did not have to; all he had to do was say, `Yes, I have some shares in my private family company'. He did not have to disclose all the major companies he has shares in. From looking at this register I suspect that he invests in Australia, and good for Senator Colston. It looks as though he has a number of shares in different public companies. I would say he probably trades in them, and that is good to see.

In itself that suggests how stupid these rules are and how ineffective they will be.

We have since heard about the quite unusual arrangement where it is up to the borrower to decide whether to repay the debt to Mr Brown, a former Labor minister and current lobbyist. That detail, of course, was not in Mr Keating's registration of interests. Looking through the register I see that some people have disclosed debts owing. Some have said it is a debt to the bank for the purchase of their house; others have just said it is a debt. So what do we do?

        I would like to speak further on this matter but I suspect that some of my colleagues also want to speak on this debate—a debate that has been considerably shortened by the guillotine applied by the government in conjunction with the Democrats—so I will not proceed further. I simply reiterate that, if this were a proper disclosure provision, I am sure that the government would have the full and total support of senators on this side of the chamber. These mickey mouse regulations which mean nothing are just a farce, a sop by Labor Party members to pretend that they are interested in accountability. The regulations really mean absolutely nothing.

        —I rise to support my colleagues, in particular Senator Ian Macdonald, in speaking on this debate as to whether the Senate should establish a register of senators' interests. For a number of reasons, to support the proposal as it now stands would be an unwise thing to do. Perhaps the most obvious of those reasons are the top two. Firstly, we run a serious risk of creating a false sense of security in the community. It would be a case of, `We don't have to worry about whether people have a conflict of interests because they have had to establish their interests in this register; they have had to disclose them. So we don't have to worry'.

        We have seen in recent debates, as Senator Macdonald indicated, that the register is not drafted so that that is the case. It is not true that we do not have to worry. Any members of the community who bothered to look at the House of Representatives disclosure forms would have no idea of the extent and involvement of Mr Keating's companies in the piggery to be established, no idea of the values involved in loans and in assets and liabilities—no idea at all. Perhaps the piggery is the classic example of where looking something up in one of these registers is really no good to us at all.

        If we wanted to chase it up, we could go to the relevant registers and follow through all the companies and do an enormous amount of digging, which obviously has been done. In that sense, the register gives a clue as to where to go. But why bother to establish a register of interests which, on its face, is clearly useless? We establish a false sense of security in the community that we do not have to worry about people's interests because they are disclosed. That is the first point I make.

        The second point I make—I think history from time immemorial shows this to be the case—is that we cannot legislate for honesty. It is just not possible. Those who are minded to be dishonest spend their lives getting around the rules, figuring out how not to do what they ought to do—in this case how to disguise a financial interest, if that is what they wanted to do, such that on the face of this register they would not have to disclose it. One would not need to be much more than a second year law student to figure out how to do it. That just makes a farce of this.

        If we accept the proposition that we cannot legislate for honesty, that people who want to get around it will, we come back to the first point that I made that this is pretty useless. When people think they have some interest—I say interest there without adding the adjective `financial' because I want to come to that point—which ought to be disclosed we should rely on them to so disclose it.

        Plenty of people have a variety of assets or relationships that are well known and they do not bother every time to get up and say, `I have this and I have that and they are inconsequential'. We rely on people to disclose a consequential interest. By and large, I think that happens. If there is a case recently where that has not happened it would have to be Mr Keating's piggery.

        I take these things quite seriously. In 1987-88 I had responsibility in the shadow ministry for the status of women and, among other things, the Australian Capital Territory. Probably not many people know that a question came up as to whether we should agree that a casino be established here. At that time, my husband, not I, had some shares in a company—the name of which escapes me—which owned Federal Hotels, which had an obvious interest in whether or not Canberra should have a casino. At some substantial loss, about which I am constantly reminded by my husband, he sold the shares. The loss was in the thousands of dollars, so he still remembers it from 1988. We sold the shares because I did not want to be in the position of anyone being able to say, `Look, even though you are not in government, in opposition you can make a difference to these things, whether or not you agree, whether or not you create difficulty'. If a casino had gone through with our support and Federal Hotels had had the opportunity to run it, I would have been very uncomfortable. The sad thing was that only a couple of weeks after the shares were sold I was ditched from the shadow ministry and the decision was not mine anyway.

        —Senator Faulkner interjects, `Who had the good sense to do that?'. I am sure that is on the public record and he can chase that up if he wants. He might question his own judgment in describing it as `good sense', but that is another matter. Basically, I regard that story as nobody's business, but I tell honourable senators that story simply to indicate that I take matters of conflict of interest very seriously. If people have a responsible position, they should make sure that they do not have a conflict. I think people should get out of the conflict rather than simply declaring it. I think declaring it is going halfway.

        Nonetheless, there may be occasions when we could not be expected to dispose of a conflict of interest. For example, a family might come from a long line of families in the pastoral industry and they may be holding property which is run by a manager. When dealing with a bill which relates to, for example, disposal of wool, I do not think we could expect someone to dispose of that interest. That would clearly be ridiculous. I presume that no-one here would expect that. A declaration of that interest would be satisfactory.

        I just raise the point of these shares in the company, whatever its name, that held Federal Hotels: where it is reasonable to dispose of the interest, it should be disposed of. I say `the interest'. I made the point before that it is not just financial interest. That is another thing which is wrong with these sorts of things: people do not only vote in accordance with their decision as to what is substantively the best way to go simply because of financial interest. Day after day I see people on the other side of the chamber who, because of factional arrangements, have worked out in what particular way they are going to vote. The party on the opposite side of the chamber does not give people the opportunity to vote according to their consciences in a way different from their party view. They all have to sit over there—I do not say like dummies. That is the course they have chosen: collective responsibility for a collective decision. But individually they are not entitled to vote in a different way, and I am.

        Let us get to the point. We have just wasted a bit of time by intervention, and that is fine. I was talking about this well established, and now I think confirmed, rumour that a minister was having a relationship with someone in the press gallery. The members of the press gallery were very annoyed because somehow this person always had better stories about, and better access to, what was happening in that minister's portfolio. We, on this side, thought that minister was getting a better run in the media than the rest of the guys on the frontbench, and we did not think it was fair. All sorts of things can make a difference, including relationships. Because of relationships that do not need to be declared—not relationships between husbands and wives—people might make the same decision that this register suggests they would make if they or their wife had that financial interest.

I notice that one amendment seeks to have the register include the interests of de facto spouses. I am interested to know whether people will want to amend that to include putative spouses. Why could we not include putative spouses? If any men have fathered children, we would like to know about the interests of the women by whom they have fathered their children. They are putative spouses. At law a woman is entitled to a portion of the assets of the father of her children. For the purposes of a legal distribution of assets, the woman is as entitled as a spouse or a de facto spouse. So what about putative spouses? Why do we not just cast this net forever and a day?

Allegiances of friendships might occasion someone to not bother to cross the floor or to not bother to make the argument and run dead on a particular issue because one of that person's mates is owed a favour and wants this particular issue to go this way or that way. The point I make about people on the other side not being able to cross the floor only exemplifies, in their case, how pointless it is in some instances to disclose an interest. Even if the interest is disclosed, they are not entitled to vote differently on an issue anyway. So what are we worried about?

Senator Ian Macdonald said in another place that he would be a bit embarrassed about people knowing how little he owns. I am a bit embarrassed about people looking at the degree of liabilities that people might have. That is an interesting point. We have to disclose where the liabilities are but, as I understand it, not exactly how much they are. One has Buckley's of going to a bank and finding out what the degree of someone's indebtedness is. The hope is that, because people disclose that they have some sort of liability, it does not matter how big the liability is because their assets will reflect that. However, a simpleton's mind does not appreciate that their assets may well not reflect the reason for the debt at all and, therefore, not disclose what the genuine interest is.

        I have got a very small unit in Parkside in Adelaide. I have a first mortgage over a portion of that unit, which I am reminded of every month when I look at the bank statement. I have got a unit at Kingston. Finally, I am pleased to say that Westpac does not have an interest in that after 10 years; it seemed interminable. My husband and I have interests in two properties in the south-east of South Australia. With one of them, if I were simply to comply with this form, those opposite would understand what the interest was because we have got one undivided fifth share of some land. Anyone who saw where that was—the south-east—would assume it had some rural association. We, as husband and wife, are partners in a pastoral company. The title is `such and such a pastoral company', so it is quite clear on the face of it what that interest is. The pastoral company owns the stock, plant and equipment.

        The other property is owned through a different legal structure. A second- or third-year law student would be able to figure out ways to get around this register. That comes back to the original point, and the most important point I made, that one cannot legislate for people to be honest. That other property is owned in this way: shares in a company, which is itself a trustee of a unit trust, and holdings of units in the unit trust. People have got Buckley's of ascertaining what that interest is. I think that highlights just how futile this register is. The crucial point is that someone who wants to get around it will.

        I would have to fill in quite a bit under liabilities. Apart from the first mortgage over the small property in Parkside in Adelaide, the other liabilities are all with Westpac. I would be happy to fill that in. I am somewhat concerned as well, especially for the women in parliament, about the nature of the financial relationships they have with their spouses and what impact this might have. It is a social fact of our culture that, by and large, women do not hold the assets. So for the men in parliament to have to declare what they know about the assets of their spouses does not really mean much because, by and large, the women in this country still do not hold the assets; that is just a cultural and social fact. I believe that, pleasantly, it is changing. But, nonetheless, more often than not it is the case in any family unit that where assets are held individually more are held by the husband than by the wife.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        So, when we ask the women in parliament to disclose what they know about the interests of their spouses, necessarily they are being asked to disclose more. I would argue that what those opposite are doing is creating a disincentive for the male spouses to continue to enter into joint arrangements with their parliamentarian wives because the consequences necessarily are that that interest might need to be disclosed. It might not be an interest that can in any way be disguised and, for quite good and proper commercial reasons, the spouse might want them to be kept under wraps until a deal is finished, or whatever. One can easily foresee that happening if the assets of one's spouse change by nature of that person's interest and work and where that person is engaged in making a profit by virtue of exchanging large assets and turning them over regularly. This situation does create a difficulty. It does not create a difficulty for male spouses, but I think it potentially could create quite a significant difficulty for female spouses.

If there are any other Labor senators wanting to make a contribution, I would be interested to hear what they say as to how we deal with people who have decided not to be honest. In a sense, that is what the government wants to do here; it wants to make people be honest. I have an apprehension about that, because basically what it is saying is that it thinks there are lots of people here now who are not honest. I do not think that is so—even on the government side, or in the Greens or the Australian Democrats. I do not start from the premise that government people or my people or the Greens or the Democrats are in some way dishonest.

        We are debating a very important issue today. It is about the declaration of interests of senators, people who are elected to the parliament of Australia to represent the interests of the people of Australia. It is something that I personally believe is long overdue, although I would agree with some of the earlier speakers that the forms in which the declarations are made do need to have some work done on them. I am heartened to note that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), in moving this motion yesterday, indicated that the committee of senators' interests which is to be set up following the passage of this motion will look at that.

Clearly from that there is no conflict of interest in my part ownership or my former wife's part ownership of that home with anything that will be debated in this chamber. From Jean's point of view, it is an intrusion into her affairs. Certainly, I should be in a position to make declarations of that nature, but I do not see why a former spouse with a financial interest with the other former spouse should be subject to the sort of public scrutiny which we volunteered for on the last occasion.

        Senator Vanstone went on at some length about when she was on the front bench in 1989, I think it was. At that time her husband had an interest in a hotel chain that was bidding for the casino licence in Canberra. Her husband lost some money because the shares were disposed of—an honourable thing to do. I do not think the form, in its current form, would compel any individual in a similar circumstance to that of Senator Vanstone to do something similar in the future—to sell shares or interests in a company and make a loss on it. Senator Vanstone is to be commended for doing what she did at the time. I wonder how many of her colleagues on the opposition front bench are following the example.

        The Prime Minister also drew attention to the fact that another opposition spokesperson is involved with a legal company which sells advice to its clients—quite a legitimate occurrence. Unfortunately—and I am certainly not pointing the finger—there might be a conflict of interest in that that particular individual, who was named in the other place but will not be named by me, is the shadow spokesperson for industrial relations.

        —The motion before the Senate relates to a proposal to keep a registration of senators' interests. This proposal, put forward by the government, was first moved by Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in this chamber, but has been amended by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Manager of Government Business here, Senator Faulkner, to allow a committee to be set up to oversee the matter. The motion is opposed by the opposition.

        Fortunately and thankfully, Australia is a democracy. We are debating here fundamentally the right of citizens in this country to know the interests, including the financial interests, of members of parliament. The electors in this country know the financial interests of members of the House of Representatives. People know them because a register of interests is kept in which all members of the House of Representatives lodge a return stating what their interests are. That register is open for public inspection. Members of the opposition can inspect the financial interests of members of the government and members of the government have access to the financial interests of members of the opposition.

        There is scrutiny. If there is believed to be a conflict in ministers defending their private financial interests rather than taking on their public duty, they are exposed. That exposure can be publicly ventilated and the public can then make a judgment about those individuals. The same is true of the opposition. If the activities of opposition members is such that their actions are seen to serve their private financial interests and not their public duty, they can be exposed by virtue of the existence of this registration. The public can then form a judgment about those people as elected representatives.

        This motion comes forward in the Senate because there is no such registration of senators' interests. There is no such registration because it has been resisted consistently by the opposition in this chamber. That raises a question of motive. Why would an opposition, in a democracy, resist the registration of the financial interests of members of this chamber so that they can be open for public inspection and their actions can be judged either against—

        I return to the theme that I was warming to: the essential issue of public concern about this matter. The essential issue is that electors in this country, as in any democracy, are entitled to know what the financial interests of their elected representatives are so that they can judge whether those elected representatives serve their private financial interests in public office or do their duty by the country and the electors. I was making the point that there is, by dint of a government majority, such as a register in the House of Representatives, which is open for anyone to inspect. Anyone from the press gallery, anyone from the opposition or the government, and anyone from the public—any elector of an electorate—can inspect the financial interests of members. There is not such a register in the Senate, and that is because the opposition has consistently defeated the government's move to establish one.

        Senator Cook spoke for half an hour the first time round. He should not be permitted to speak on the same subject for another half hour. If he wants to speak about Mr Keating filing a grossly misleading declaration of interests then that is part of the debate on the amendment. But he should not be permitted to have another half hour—guillotined time, I might add—because it stops us from being allowed to speak, and I guess that is what Senator Cook is all about. He is taking up another half hour of very limited time to rehash the arguments. He must confine himself, as a matter of relevance, to the amendment before the chamber.

Therefore, it is entirely relevant to talk about both the motion and the amendment because we are being asked to vote on whether we support that amendment or whether we do not support it but support the substantive motion. We cannot just talk about one; we have to talk about both in order to have a proper, sensible and intelligent debate.

        The amendment moved by Senator Baume is aimed at the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); it is an amendment which alleges certain things of the Prime Minister, which are not true. On that basis alone the amendment should fail. But it should fail on a wider basis too. It should fail on the basis that the Prime Minister has declared his interests on the public record; they are open for inspection. His interests, as far as his part shareholding in a piggery is concerned, are a matter of public notoriety—they are a matter of public debate. They have been the subject of a smear campaign against the Prime Minister, which is continuing. It is a smear campaign judged not by the government—although we are, of course, annoyed by it—but by the independent commentators in the press gallery who have followed the intricacies of the smear as to have no substance whatsoever.

        The smear campaign continues on the well-known principle that if enough dirt is thrown some of it might stick, or on the Goebbels principle that if a big lie is repeated some people might believe it—repetition being the key element in effective propaganda. We have an attempt at repetition as a tool of propaganda by virtue of the motion moved by Senator Baume. It repeats essentially the big lie idea that something here is wrong when it is not. This is an amendment which, as I said, should fail on the grounds that it is not true. It is also an amendment which should fail on the grounds of the principle at issue here. The Prime Minister has declared his interests publicly. Senator Baume has not declared his interests publicly. He hides behind the vote of the opposition, resisting the agreement of this chamber to impose on all its members an open declaration of their pecuniary interests.

        I return to the central point: the opposition has voted down the idea of a register of pecuniary interests, hiding behind the allegation that it does not go far enough and it is not complete enough. If ever there were a logical fallacy, the fallacy would be, `We will not adopt a measure which is in the public interest, which is fundamental to democracy and which is a right of the citizens of this country to know, simply because we are unhappy with the regulations and terms of the register'.

        I would have thought that since the Fremantle by-election there would have been an understanding in the opposition that the politics of the low blow, the politics of the personal smear, the politics of the denigration of individuals and the destruction of their reputations were not politics the Australian electorate particularly applauds. They see that as the worst feature of politics. They resent it, they reject it and they do not like it. Certainly the people have a right to and do expect that duplicity and hypocrisy be exposed. This continuing smearing of politicians simply reduces the reputation of politicians as a whole and demeans the reputation and standing of the parliament.

        What he has done by his contribution this morning is confirm the view we have taken in relation to this matter that it is meaningless in its present form.

There may be others, similarly, that have not been looked at in such great detail.

The government is trying to get bits of paper on the public record so that it can say that there is disclosure of members' and senators' interests. But, having looked through them, it is very clear that there is no disclosure of members' and senators' interests for a large number of people; the disclosure is quite meaningless.

        He also failed to reveal that the companies were also indebted to Mr John Brown, a former minister, to the tune of millions of dollars. What we have here is Mr Brown who now acts as a lobbyist, and a Prime Minister who has interests in a company indebted to Mr Brown. I would have thought that that presents obvious conflicts of interest, but that information—that indebtedness to Mr Brown—is not included in the statements lodged by Mr Keating in the other place. What one has to do is search through the various company records to ascertain that information. The minister will say that we would get a hint, because once we were given the company name we would be able to conduct those searches.

The Prime Minister's example demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the regime that this government is seeking to set up, and the false confidence it raises in the community.

        That is why Senator Baume has moved this amendment. It will give the Senate the opportunity to criticise the Prime Minister for the misleading aspects of his own statement but, perhaps even more importantly, require of him to disclose sufficient information for the public to make a real assessment as to the extent of actual or potential conflicts of interest. I trust that the Senate will support the motion and send a clear message to the Prime Minister that a disclosure regime which is just a sham is insufficient, and that if he seeks to impose it upon the parliament through his will, then he should be prepared to disclose in a meaningful form which achieves the objective which he is claiming of this scheme but which is clearly not achieved by the scheme as it is presented today to the Senate.

        There is some confusion. We actually support disclosure, and that is why one of our foreshadowed amendments specifically requires senators in debate to disclose interests that might amount to a conflict of interest, and to disclose on a vote in this place. They will make that judgement in each and every circumstance, and each and every circumstance will differ, demonstrating the shortcoming of trying to codify this in the way the government has done—taking the lowest common denominator, and, in effect, ending up with a form that provides the public with no real information and basis for confidence in the system. The system as it is, is ineffective, and that is one of the two major reasons why we have expressed objection to what the government is doing.

       families. We still have to be convinced that that intrusion into the privacy of those other than members of parliament is warranted. I concede that there has been some improvement in the wording, but it is only a nominal improvement—the disclosure is now only of interests of which the senator is aware. It still does not address the fundamental question that those who happen to be married to us, or our children, are now going to have their affairs disclosed in circumstances to which they may well object. If the senator does not comply with that under the terms of this regime, the senator, himself or herself, commits a serious contempt of the Senate. We retain those reservations and concerns about this intrusion into the private affairs of spouses and families.

        I have mentioned one of the amendments that I intend to move after Senator Baume's amendment has been dealt with. The other amendments, which I will run through, have been circulated in the chamber. The first one is that we think it is not appropriate that the committee of senators' interests, which will have the responsibility of overseeing the register, is an appropriate committee to also conduct investigations. We believe that, if investigations of alleged breaches are necessary, they should be conducted by a separate body; we suggest the privileges committee, and I will move an amendment to that effect.

        We also seek to increase the figure in relation to a declaration regarding sponsored travel or hospitality to something that is more realistic, and we propose to increase it to $500. Similarly, we say that gifts that are made should be disclosed, if they are going to be disclosed, when they amount to something in excess of $500. We think that the current figure of $100 is ridiculously low.

        My fourth amendment is to ensure that the disclosure regime is limited to pecuniary interests. There may well be interests which raise issues of moral conflict, religious beliefs and so forth. As it is at the moment, it is ambiguous. I do not think it was ever intended that that type of interest was to be covered. Therefore, the fourth amendment I propose to move will restrict it to pecuniary interests, which I think is in accordance with the government's objective in any event.

        My fifth amendment is the one that I mentioned a little while ago, specifically requiring senators to make declarations at the beginning of a speech and also after a division. I understand, from what the minister told me yesterday, the government will support that, and I am pleased it has come to the party on that and recognises that that is important. My sixth amendment is to define `spouses' to include `de facto spouses'. I will move those amendments after the vote on Senator Baume's amendment.

        —Much has been said today and yesterday about the futility of this whole debate. Senator Baume's amendment that the disclosure form should be completed properly if it is going to be completed at all should be taken into account. I have been sitting here for the last 15 minutes or so glancing through these much touted declarations of senators' interests that were put in voluntarily by the Labor Party last year. The President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, put in one last year. While most pages remain blank—other than a few little contributions—the back page, where it requests the membership of any organisation, clearly shows that he is not even a member of the Labor Party.

        —Senator Beahan. Therefore, the President of the Senate is not even a member of the Labor party. But worse than that, the form is unsigned; the whole thing is unsigned. If we are going to get down to the nitty-gritty of this whole exercise, surely someone who professes to be the caretaker of the entire operation of the Senate should be able to fill out a form correctly. It begs the question: how many others have left out critical pieces of information and hope not to be caught? Presumably Senator Beahan is a member of the Labor Party and could well be a member of other organisations. But he did not see fit to fill out the form completely and nor did he see fit to sign it. The Labor Party cannot trumpet this system as being the be-all and end-all in getting everyone to confess everything when they, voluntarily, have not completed these forms properly.

I simply acknowledge the reality that any system of pecuniary interests registration that we adopt is bound to represent some kind of balance between the public interest in disclosure on the one hand and legitimate claims to privacy on the other. There will always be arguments as to whether the balance has been sufficiently struck one way or the other.

        Most of the contribution we have heard from the opposition side has not been so much directed against the principle of pecuniary interest disclosure, but rather against the alleged inadequacies of the present scheme. I can understand a number of those points. The answer that I would make to that is that those on the opposition side who think that they can design better forms or an approach to this in terms of the actual presentation of data better than the form now proposed will have an opportunity, through their participation in the committee on senators' interests, to have an ongoing input into this process as it evolves over the years ahead. We have quite an open mind as to how best to advance the cause here when it comes to the actual detail—consistently, of course, with the terms of this motion—and we will be happy to respond to and discuss suggestions of a detailed kind that might be made to make the system work better.

        Where we do not have an open mind—where we have a thoroughly closed mind—is on the virtues of this particular system being put in place. It is just unconscionable that we have sat here in the Senate since 1986 while the House of Representatives has had its system in place. It is unconscionable that it has taken us something like 11 or 12 hours of debate spread over seven or eight different occasions in those intervening years to finally get to the point that we will get to in the next few minutes of a vote on this matter. It is quite intolerable in terms of any basic commitment to democratic accountability principles that that should be so. It has nothing to do with the management of this place. It has everything to do with filibustering and squirming by the opposition.

As to the second proposed amendment, to set a threshold on declarable sponsored travel or hospitality, we initially preferred to set no limit at all on what was disclosable there. We think the threshold figure of $500 that the opposition is proposing is too high.

We would not wish to limit it in that way. There may well be other non-pecuniary interests which could conceivably give rise to conflict of interest and be against the public interest as a result.

        As to the requirement for honourable senators to declare their interests in the course of debate, this is an amendment which we readily accept. I was always puzzled about why it was taken out of the system as applied in the House of Representatives. I am advised that the House of Representatives removed it from its system in 1988 on the recommendation of its own Committee of Members' Interests with the support of not only the government but also the opposition. It was a bipartisan recommendation that came up to remove that particular requirement.

        The committee apparently felt that the requirement was so broad it was probably being honoured more regularly in the breach than in the observance, and that it was largely made redundant by the register. Personally, I do not agree with that. I think it is appropriate that interests that conspicuously involve a potential conflict of interest ought to be disclosed at the time that people get to their feet in the chamber. That is the traditional Westminster practice. If we have not been honouring it in the observance as much as we should have in practice in the past I think we should honour it in the future, and maybe this will draw that to people's attention to accept it in this way.

        As to the final amendment on definition of spouse and de facto spouse, what is basically involved here is putting on the register—not only because of the way the definitions are here drawn—not only immediate family but also extending the obligation to declare interests on the register to those people who are recipients of travel privileges under the present scheme whereby people in appropriate circumstances can nominate a mother, sister or some other person, maybe not a relative at all, to be the recipient of the travel privilege. That is a system that has evolved to cope with particular personal circumstances that vary from individual to individual. It has been a good system in that context. There is no problem about it. But to take the further step of requiring people who satisfy that criterion to be on the pecuniary interest register generally seems to us to be a case of overkill. Accordingly, we will vote against that.

This responsibility could well be given to another appropriate body when a code of conduct is considered in due course. As to the other two amendments, we do not think that they are appropriate and we will oppose them.

That was because I was speaking to the amendment in the form in which it had previously been circulated, not in its present form. The particular matter to which we objected about persons with ordinary travel entitlements being brought within the scope of this has now been removed from the amendment in this form. It is no longer controversial. It simply articulates what is the system prevailing in Social Security and elsewhere so far as definitions are concerned. We will support it accordingly.

        I will speak very briefly to this motion as I do believe that many senators who made a contribution to the previous debate also canvassed their views on the question of the establishment of a committee of senators' interests. This motion formalises the government's proposal to put in place a committee of senators' interests which will mirror the similar committee in the House of Representatives.

         The government would regard the provisions relating to the composition of the committee and election of the chair of the committee as being subject to revision in light of the outcome of the inquiry that is currently being undertaken by the procedure committee into the committee system for the Senate. This matter finally puts to rest the issue of pecuniary interests for honourable senators. I think this is an appropriate committee to be established. It will fulfil and perform a very important function. I commend this motion to the Senate.

        The amendments were foreshadowed a little while ago. The government's motion logically follows the one that the Senate has just carried. Our concerns are not so much in the setting up of the committee but in the composition of the committee. The first amendment, which is on a slightly different matter, omits the reference to a non-existent code of conduct. As I understood Senator Gareth Evans, the government is prepared to support that. So the two amendments in contention are our amendments Nos 2 and 3. They relate to our desire to have this committee reflect the numbers in the chamber rather than the numbers as put in the government's motion and also to the election of the chairman.

         Not surprisingly, the government has stated in its motion that the chairman shall be nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. There is no reason why that should be so. In fact, I suggest that, in the circumstances of this particular committee's responsibilities, it is quite inappropriate. Notwithstanding the incredible vote a few minutes ago by the minority parties, by which they refused to admonish the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for lodging a statement of his interests in the House of Representatives which is misleading and also fails to give sufficient information upon which any member of the public can make a judgment as to a potential conflict of interest between public responsibility and personal business interests—notwithstanding the fact that they voted in effect to sanction the Prime Minister in this way—it seems to us on this side of the chamber that the Prime Minister's personal failure in the application of the disclosure regime is reason in itself for the government not to be permitted to chair this particular committee.

Clearly, on evidence that is already before the chamber, there is a potential conflict of interest. Why was that indebtedness not included in the Prime Minister's statement of disclosure? If the Prime Minister himself will not meet the requirements that he sets out and the House of Representatives committee, which through the numbers in the House is under the control of the Labor Party, is not prepared to take action on it, surely that is evidence in itself that this committee being set up by the Senate should not be controlled by the government either in numbers or in its chairmanship.

         So we have moved amendments, which we trust in this instance will be supported by the minority parties, which will enable the composition of the committee to more accurately reflect the numbers in the Senate and enable the committee to elect its own chair rather than have a chair imposed upon it by the government. I trust that the minority parties will support us in this instance. If they do not, it is just a further demonstration of the sham that has been demonstrated by the Prime Minister in failing to meet the standard that he says he requires of the parliament. Mr Acting Deputy President, if it is of any help to you, I indicate at this stage that we will be dividing on those amendments.

         In other words, the Prime Minister's financial investment of almost half a million dollars depends for its viability, for its capacity to survive, on getting approvals. From the federal government, FIRB approval is required. From state governments, environmental approval is required. From local governments, planning approval is required. Three sets of approvals are required for the Prime Minister's investment to be viable. In addition, the Prime Minister has a potential for conflict of interest in the fact that he owes $4 1/2 million in a subordinated loan to a lobbyist and in the fact that, when he was Treasurer and when he bought his interest in this company, the Commonwealth Bank was owed more money than the assets of this venture were worth.

As Senator Evans said, for the Prime Minister's investment to be viable, it needs this project to proceed. For this project to proceed, there needs to be approvals from the federal government, the state government and local government. Yet, what does the Prime Minister say in his declaration of interests—

We do not want to have a situation where a Labor dominated committee can allow the same sort of situation to exist in the Senate which now exists in the House of Representatives where the Prime Minister was able to say `no' to those questions when the evidence clearly demonstrated that a conflict with a member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise.

That demonstrates why we must not have a Labor dominated committee. If Senator Collins reflects the thinking—to use the word very loosely—of the Labor Party about what is a potential for conflict of interest, then it would be disastrous to have a committee made up of people like Senator Collins determining for the Senate what is a proper answer to those questions.

         If ever we needed a solid case to demonstrate why the Labor Party must not be allowed to dominate this committee—it is demonstrated quite clearly—it is the interjections of Senator Collins right now. Even if the 14th point did not exist, on the grounds already demonstrated by my leader, Senator Hill, it would be wrong and foolish to allow the minority party in this chamber—that is, the Labor Party—to dominate this committee.

         As I said before, much has been said about the righteousness of people on the Labor Party side filling out these forms without any compulsion. A further illustration as to why this committee must be formed in the way that is proposed by the opposition's amendment is that the minister at the table, the President of the Senate and Senator Childs are unable to complete this form properly.

Therefore it begs the question: what else has the galah forgotten? I do not know what he has forgotten but I do know that two other Labor Party senators cannot sign their names—or they forgot to sign their names. That is why this particular amendment is vital to enable this matter to run properly; if it is going to be run at all.

An unsigned return is worthless. If a person has a bill to pay and is a bit short for the month, in order to buy a bit of time, it is an old trick to say, `A cheque is in the mail', then send the cheque but forget to sign it.

Then the person really gets into action, signing the cheque and sending it, having bought a bit of time. The declarations of Senator Beahan and Senator Childs are worthless because they forgot to sign them. I put on record the fact that Senator Cook said twice in his speech that the opposition voted down the last motion of this kind. My information from the clerks is that until about 10 minutes ago there has never been a vote on this matter.

         —I open this debate on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994 by saying that the bill clearly demonstrates the mess which this Labor government is making of industrial relations in Australia. Although the Liberal and National parties will not oppose this amending bill, we do believe it is unnecessary. Because of the way in which the government is mishandling industrial relations, we will be moving a second reading amendment, which I will move at the end of my remarks. It will add at the end of the motion for the second reading of this bill that the Senate, first, deplores the government's incompetent management of the industrial relations portfolio—incompetence which has again forced it to bring in hasty amendments to the Industrial Relations Act—and, second, condemns the submissive attitude the government continues to demonstrate towards the ACTU, which is reflected in the commission's unduly expanded responsibility and in the disproportionately large number of senior commission personnel who have been drawn from the trade union movement.

         As I have said, this legislation is unnecessary. It is unnecessary in the first instance because the Industrial Relations Court itself is unnecessary. When the Industrial Relations Court was established in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which became an act at the end of last year, it was strongly opposed by the Liberal and National parties. We opposed it for very good reason. The government made absolutely no case at all as to why there was a need to establish a specialist industrial relations court when industrial relations matters could be handled quite adequately by the existing industrial relations division of the Federal Court. No justification or rationale was provided for the establishment of that court.

         In addition, the establishment and continuing operation of this new court means an unjustified extra cost to taxpayers. There is also grave concern in the community, which has been expressed by the Law Council and others, of the potential lack of independence of this new Industrial Relations Court. The Federal Court, with its industrial relations division, has the absolute independence that any court ought to have. But with the potential for the Industrial Relations Court not to be at arms length from the Industrial Relations Commission, there is the capacity for that very necessary independence that ought to apply to any court to be lost.

         We also were concerned about the relationship of this court to the government's specific industrial relations program and policies. Again, a body with the status of a court ought not relate to a particular program of a government. Because of the nature of courts, as I have just said, they should have independence, they should be above and beyond any particular policy or program of a government. But that is not the case with the Industrial Relations Court.

         There was also the problem of who in fact would constitute this new Industrial Relations Court. Of course, this legislation that we are debating today is the very consequence of the fact that the government itself was uncertain as to who was going to constitute that court when it put the legislation through last year. The Law Council of Australia was opposed to the establishment of this court, and we in fact mirrored the concerns of the Law Council in that debate last year because those concerns were quite legitimate and quite important.

         Finally, a court which is established in this way, and which relates to a particular segment of a government's policy or program, is obviously vulnerable to a change of government. A government which comes in with a different program in that field, a different set of policies, can abolish such a court. Indeed, the coalition at the time of the debate last year indicated that when in government it would abolish the Industrial Relations Court, which simply highlights the fact that the court is vulnerable to the programs of a particular government. So that court ought not to have been established and therefore this legislation relating to that court is, as I said, unnecessary.

         It is unnecessary in the second instance because, if the government really knew what it was doing as far as industrial relations is concerned, it would have included the provisions of this amending bill in that original legislation. After all, we had a very lengthy debate on that legislation in December last year, and the committee stage itself went for three or four days. Winston Crane, my Liberal Senate colleague from Western Australia, and I debated the issues of the legislation, the clauses of that legislation, quite extensively. Indeed, the government introduced and had passed, with the support of the Democrats, 170 amendments to its own bill. So the bill it introduced was not good enough; it had to put through 170 amendments. Yet now it is coming back with further amendments to that legislation. As I said, surely if the government had really known what it was doing it could have included among those 170-odd amendments the amendments that it is proposing today.

         The amendments are clear evidence that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, debated and passed at the end of last year, was ill conceived. It is clear that the government had completely failed to properly consider and plan for the operation of that legislation. Of course, we know what that legislation was really about: it was nothing more than a pay-off to the trade union movement for the unbridled support which it gave to the Labor government in the 1993 federal election.

         I remind honourable senators that that legislation which was passed last year had the grand title of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. It was the government's major overhaul of industrial relations in this country. According to the government there would be no more changes necessary to industrial relations legislation in the near future. Yet here we are today, just a few sitting weeks later, debating this amending bill. Do we need any clearer demonstration that the government did not have a clue what it was doing in establishing the Industrial Relations Court?

         This bill is not only unnecessary, it is also being introduced into and passed through this parliament with undue haste. The Liberal and National parties have not had adequate opportunity to scrutinise this legislation. It has been given to us for debate this week—a week in which the House of Representatives is not sitting. There has been no opportunity for the opposition shadow cabinet to meet and consider this legislation. There has been no opportunity for a full meeting of the Liberal and National parliamentary parties—both the House of Representatives and the Senate—to meet and consider this legislation. We simply have not had adequate opportunity to consider all the ramifications of the legislation. It is unnecessary haste on the part of this government, again demonstrating its incompetent administration.

         The reason for this haste is that the government has been casting around trying to find someone willing to be president of its unwanted Industrial Relations Court. Eventually, it found Justice Deirdre O'Connor, who is already a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. To move Justice O'Connor from the Federal Court to the new Industrial Relations Court required her agreement to a special deal to take the job. The government now wants to set this deal in cement through this legislation before the new Industrial Relations Act commences operation in a couple of weeks.

         As I said, this legislation is a special deal for Justice Deirdre O'Connor. The amendments in this legislation allow her to remain a judge of the Federal Court of Australia during her presidency of the Industrial Relations Court and allow her also to be a president for a fixed term. As I said, the first amendment allows her to remain a judge of the Federal Court; the second amendment ensures that her tenure as a judge is not affected by her taking on this presidential role; the third amendment allows her to be appointed for a fixed term; the fourth amendment allows her to receive a presidential allowance on top of the judge's salary. More specifically, clause 3 of the amending legislation amends section 10(1)(a) of the existing act to add the words `is or'. That will therefore allow a person who either is currently a judge or was a judge of a court created by the parliament to become President of the Industrial Relations Court. The current act, as it was drafted and passed at the end of last year, allows only a past judge of the Federal Court to become president.

         It is interesting to note that, while this government is changing the act to allow a person who is currently a judge of a court created by this federal parliament to take up the presidency, it has not made the same change for a judge of a state or territory court. It is not giving the same rights to judges of states or territories that it is giving to judges of the Federal Court or other courts created by the federal parliament. This is another example of the centralist attitude of this government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The original bill in many respects rode roughshod over state jurisdiction on industrial relations and this amending bill simply reinforces the way in which this government gives no consideration to states rights at all.

         Clause 4 of the bill ensures that someone taking up the position of President of the Industrial Relations Court retains full tenure rights, titles and so on of his or her position as a judge of the Federal Court. Clause 5 provides for the appointment of the president for a fixed term of tenure and, as I understand it, it has been agreed that Deirdre O'Connor's tenure will be for five years.

         We should consider whether acts of parliament ought to be changed at the whim of one person. While we would agree that there ought to be flexibility on agreements—even agreements for the appointment of the judiciary, which is consistent with the approach the Liberal and National parties adopt—legislation relating to flexibility in industrial relations and flexibility in employment relations ought to have general application; it ought to apply to everyone. It should not be drafted simply to suit the whim of an individual. That is contrary to natural justice and contrary to the rule of law.

         Clause 6 ensures that Deirdre O'Connor will retain the salary of a judge. If the president's salary is higher than that, the difference will be made up by the payment of an allowance. It will be interesting to note in that context whether that allowance is to be taxed at the same rate as the equivalent salary or whether it is to be taxed differently because, of course, some allowances are taxed at lower rates and some allowances are not taxed at all. They are particular issues that are raised by the specific amendments that are incorporated in this legislation.

         One of the particular issues addressed in the amendment which I will move at the end of my remarks is the unduly expanded responsibility of the Industrial Relations Commission. It relates specifically to what we regard as the nonsense of the commission being given the task of reviewing all awards and enterprise agreements, as it is directed in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993, and the increased role and authority of the commission, albeit with the unions having a de facto veto power.

         We believe that, very clearly, individual employees and employers ought to be given the right to establish their own enterprise and workplace agreements without the interference of the commission or unions, or anyone else for that matter, unless either the employee or the employer requests such an intervention. So, despite all the trumpeting we had from the government about this legislation at the end of last year, this does not make enterprise agreements any easier to achieve and in fact heads us away from that ideal and back to a system of industrial relations which is much more centralised and much more controlled.

         In the last couple of days we have had examples of the way in which it is much more difficult to obtain enterprise agreements. A coalmining operation in central Queensland is becoming the focus of a major national row with regard to the move to 12-hour shifts in the black coal industry. This is despite the fact that the employees at this coalmine and two of the unions involved—the Automotive, Food and Engineering Union and the Electronic and Plumbing Union—have supported this move to 12-hour shifts, which would involve workers at the mine working 12-hour shifts on a seven-day on, seven-day off arrangement.

         The reason they have come to that agreement is that it will give them more time with their families.

A number of them live on the coast and a roster of seven days on and seven days off means that they can work their seven days and then go back to their homes on the coast, some distance away from the mine, and spend time with their families. Yet we find the United Mine Workers Union taking action to prevent this agreement from being put in place.

It will be opposed by not only the union directly involved but also the ACTU in a campaign to prevent that enterprise agreement coming to fruition.

With those who have been announced as appointees to the Industrial Relations Court we find, apart from Justice Dierdre O'Connor, to whom this legislation relates, two vice-presidents but then nine senior deputy presidents: Elizabeth Evatt, who is currently on leave but is on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission payroll; Mr Keogh, who is a government employee; Alan Boulton, an ACTU legal officer; Joe Riordan, a union official and a minister in the Whitlam Labor government and the New South Wales Labor government; Paul Munro, Federal Secretary of the ACOA, a public service union; Keith Hancock, a Labor-linked academic who is very supportive of the Labor Party's industrial relations policies; Jan Marsh, formerly the ACTU research officer; John McBean from the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council; and one from the employer side of industrial relations, Colin Polites, a solicitor who has acted for employers.

The first is that we do not need a bill like this—a separate bill which deals with compensation and rehabilitation and administered by the Department of Defence. The second point I make is that, apart from widening the net and covering more people, this bill brings few, if any, benefits to members of the peacetime ADF beyond what members of the Public Service enjoy.

         Finally, by so doing, it builds further on the government's aim to make the ADF just another branch of the Public Service, and denies its unique status.

         Let me now expand on those statements. I have thought about this bill a lot, and the more I think about it, the more the force of the argument drives me inexorably to the conclusion that it should be part of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. It logically belongs nowhere else. The DVA has a very long history of caring for the needs of ex-service men and women. Everything is in place for them. While this bill will primarily relate to serving members of the ADF, not veterans, the services that they require could be delivered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Department of Defence, the authority which will administer these services under this bill, does not have the full resources to deliver the services to the level that veterans and defence force personnel are used to and they will have to be expanded and developed at considerable cost.

         There is a very good argument to be made to revise and rewrite the Veterans' Entitlement Act, even though it only passed through the parliament in 1986. Its origin and philosophy go back through the various repatriation acts to the First World War. It is far too long and complex, containing many hundreds of pages. Even the plain English version of the bill is complex in itself, and needs to be clarified and reduced. While a new VEA should retain all the benefits in it at present, it should also include compensation for injury, rehabilitation and re-education that the MC bill provides.

         The Veterans' Entitlement Act was born as a consequence of the two greatest military conflicts in history: World War I and World War II. The new bill should be expanded to better accommodate the fact that most members of the ADF today, thankfully, will have seen only peacetime service. Increasingly, a number of those will have only served for a period of five to eight years, not the 20 or more years that will qualify them for a DFRDB or MSBS pension.

         My next point is that while people such as cadets, service, welfare and philanthropic personnel and honorary members are covered—and that is a good thing—there are few benefits beyond what public servants acquire. The only argument that the government can resort to to defend this position is that, for example, the loss of an arm or a leg is the same for a soldier as it is for a clerk in an office. In one sense that is perfectly true, but it will almost certainly mean the end of a career for a soldier, and at an early age, with low rank and commensurate low pay. It would deny him or her a chosen career in life, while the clerk may well progress to higher things. On that basis, there is a case for a different scale of benefits from those awarded to the Public Service.

         The larger issue here, of course, is the age-old problem of a Labor government being unable to see the difference between the ADF and the Public Service. The Australian Defence Force is trained for wartime operations. Its members do not have unions, awards or overtime and are subject to continuous and strict discipline. They can be required to work 24 hours a day with little or no notice and be sent anywhere. They have to train as realistically as possible to do the violent and dangerous tasks required of them in war.

         The combination of that training and the introduction of this new scheme must lead to a rethink in defence, particularly in two areas—namely, training standards and the need for preventative actions, and the development of a high standard of incident reporting. The ADF needs to look very closely at the standard of fitness of its personnel. Training injuries are bound to occur during exercises and in any vigorous training session if personnel are not at peak fitness.

         This leads to my next point concerning incident reporting. If the new scheme is to work, and to work in favour of the members of the ADF, there will need to be substantial education of the troops to encourage the reporting of incidents. There will need to be a change from the collective view that only major injuries are reported and recorded. A change which recognises that a small, apparently insignificant injury and its cause needs to be recorded, will mean that, down the track, such records will be available when a compensation claim is made.

         The final point I would like to make in this area is that for the first time members of the ADF will actually lose some of their benefits. This will happen because the great majority of members will only ever have peacetime service. Therefore, the benefits of the Veterans' Entitlements Act which they at present have will be withdrawn and they will be left only with the military compensation scheme.

         Originally, repatriation benefits were only awarded to those who had been on active service in wartime. In 1972, to counter the massive resignation rate under the Whitlam Labor government, coverage was extended under the Repatriation Act to those on peacetime service. In 1986, when the Veterans' Entitlements Act came in, the opposition moved that coverage be maintained until the new Military Compensation Bill was enacted. So, for a variety of reasons, for the last 20 years members of the ADF on peacetime service have been covered by the VEA.

         If it is accepted that the nature of peacetime training required in the ADF is far removed from the civilian norm, it must also be accepted that it is reasonable to provide a different compensation scheme from that available for civilians. There is, however, a world of difference between peacetime training, even at its most realistic, and being on a battlefield where an enemy is trying to kill you. It is important that distinction is maintained with respect to compensatory benefits for those two cases. The answer to that problem, from a compensation point of view, may be to maintain the difference which exists under the VEA in terms of the standard of evidence required between the two cases, and not restrict the VEA only to those who have had operational, hazardous or peacekeeping service.

It is to establish a compensation scheme covering injuries and disabilities suffered in the course of the full range of military activities. At the same time, Australian Defence Force personnel injured during operational, peacekeeping or hazardous service will retain the option of coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.

         The military compensation scheme will operate, in effect, as a specialised extension of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act of 1988, otherwise known as the SRC Act. It will be administered by staff dedicated to the new scheme—the same arrangement as now applies with the SRC Act—and will feature a number of additional benefits which recognise the unique demands and hazards of military service. That is, the unintended consequences of Commonwealth supplied medical treatment will again be covered. This restores a benefit which applied, as I understand it, prior to 1988.

         The Democrats have some sympathy for the proposal that all benefits should be put under the one legislative roof. The government maintains that this option was looked at but was found to be impractical. The argument put to us was that because the SRC Act is about income support during rehabilitation, while the Veterans' Entitlements Act is concerned with pensions and ongoing medical treatment, it would be a major headache to put them together. In our view, what matters at the end of the day is whether the benefits provided by the military compensation scheme and the Veterans' Entitlements Act together are fair, comprehensive and tailored to the unique demands of defence service.

The question is whether there are any gaps in coverage which need to be filled. During our briefing by the department on this bill—and I must compliment those who came because it was, perhaps, one of the best briefings I have received; very comprehensive and certainly backed up with very helpful notes—we asked why coverage for the unintended consequences of Commonwealth funded medical treatment had not been backdated to 1988 when it was struck down. The government has indicated that it is looking at whether this hole can be plugged administratively. Surely it would be more straightforward to move an amendment which puts the issue beyond doubt.

However, we ask the government whether it has considered introducing a form of words which would unambiguously cover the military situation and allay the fears of the defence community. I urge the minister to look again at that. The need for an independent appeal mechanism has also been raised with us.

This is because the current Commonwealth compensation legislation, the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, cannot be applied to those on operational service.

         Although the MCS has been designed primarily for ADF members rendering peacetime service, it is recognised that the scheme may also be attractive for those undertaking operational, hazardous or peacekeeping duties. As an example, the MCS provides for lump sum payments and significant rehabilitation benefits that are not available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. For this reason, the legislation includes the provision for those rendering peacekeeping, hazardous or operational service to be given the choice of electing benefits under either the MCS or the VEA for injuries or diseases arising out of that service.

         During the development of the MCS, consideration was given to the option of providing the scheme as an amendment under the VEA. However, for a number of very sound reasons, this option was not adopted. At the heart of the matter, Defence was already administering the SRCA. As the MCS was to be based on the SRCA, it was logical to retain that administration with Defence. It was also important that Defence be retained as the administrator of the scheme to ensure that it fulfilled its responsibilities as an employer. It is no longer acceptable for an employer to take no interest in the rehabilitation of those individuals who are injured through work. A separate MCS, administered by Defence, brings this employer responsibility into sharp focus.

         Much has been said during consultations, as part of the preparation of this bill, about the role currently filled by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Although the Department of Veterans' Affairs has a long and excellent history of administering veterans' benefits over 70 years, it has little experience in managing the type of rehabilitation and vocational retraining that is the hallmark of modern compensation legislation such as the MCS.

         Effective rehabilitation is at the core of modern compensation legislation. It is Defence, not Veterans' Affairs, that currently fulfils this rehabilitation and vocational training responsibility under the SRCA. The MCS will allow Defence to continue to fulfil this responsibility and to develop and improve it into the future.

         Much rehabilitation work is carried out now by the defence forces' medical services and through a highly effective system of schools and training courses. The MCS allows the coordination of medical, occupational health and safety, compensation, rehabilitation and defence administration in an efficient and effective manner. The government is committed to keeping the MCS separate from the VEA. Although both schemes provide excellent benefits, they are different schemes and they do have a different focus.

         The benefits available under the MCS are those of a modern compensation scheme. The package has been specifically designed for the serving member of the Defence Force. It is based on a well tested, high quality package which is widely recognised as one of the best schemes in Australia. Administration of the MCS has been deleted from the Defence commercial support program. This means that the MCS will not be commercialised and administration of the scheme will remain with Defence.

         Members of my staff, officers of the ADF and the departments of defence and veterans' affairs have undertaken an extensive round of briefings and consultations with interest groups as part of the development of this legislation. I do appreciate that Senator Woodley indicated that the briefings he had received on this piece of legislation were as good as, if not better than, any other he had received since he became a senator. I think that is true of the nature of the briefings on this legislation that have been given more broadly to other interest groups.

         But these consultations did raise a number of areas of concern amongst interest groups. The government has been able to address a number of these issues through changes in legislation or by administrative action. For example, as a result of consultations with the RSL, the bill has been amended to provide for a Defence Force representative on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. This inclusion will ensure that the Defence point of view on these important matters will be clearly represented in advice to government. The ADF will undertake a program to educate its members to ensure that the full benefits of compensation are available to all of its members.

         As indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, Mr Punch, during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, the government is working to improve the cover for the unintended consequences of medical treatment to include those injured from 1 December 1988. Members who have suffered an injury or disease as an unintended consequence of medical treatment for a non-compensable condition are provided with cover under the MCS. This cover was also available before the introduction of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988. The government has recognised that some individuals might be unintentionally disadvantaged by the five-year gap in cover between the introduction of the SRCA and the introduction of the MCS. The government has directed that this matter be addressed as quickly as possible.

         Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that the new provision for coverage of the unintended consequences of medical treatment does not apply to events which occur before its commencement; that is, it does not give retrospective cover. The government will bring forward an amendment in the winter sittings to provide any coverage that is necessary in this respect. This, and a range of other lesser matters that are under development, demonstrates very clearly that the government is committed to effective consultation, to meaningful action and a cooperative approach to ensure that the service men and women of this country receive the best possible support from the wider community.

         Finally, compensation is one of the most complex areas of legislation. The package presented today has been carefully crafted, carefully considered and adjusted to ensure that it will function well within the constraints of other legislation, Australian Defence Force and defence structures, financial limitations, the expectations of the community and the culture of the ADF. The MCS is a practical and workable response to this situation. It will serve the ADF very well for years into the future. I commend this bill to the Senate.

The new memorandum of understanding is aimed at enhancing the capability of both countries' defence industries and builds upon the existing relationship developed through the Collins class submarine project. It encourages the industries of both countries to identify new cooperative activities and work together in pursuing opportunities for joint marketing and sales of defence materiel in selected third countries. To achieve these aims, the MOU specifically addresses technology transfer; the exchange of information concerning third country markets; intellectual property rights; transparency in export control arrangements; and the removal of barriers to bilateral defence trade, subject to each country's laws.

The MOU represents something of a first. I understand that this is the first time Sweden has entered into any cooperative arrangement with any other country for the marketing of defence equipment.

         In the past eight months there has been a 32 per cent increase in apprenticeship numbers in South Australia. If traineeships are added to the new apprenticeships, there has been a staggering 55 per cent increase in the number of places registered to February this year compared with February of last year as the improvement in the economy in South Australia and the rest of Australia has taken place in recent months. Training numbers have grown steadily in the past two years in South Australia with 2,792 commencements in the eight months to February of this year.

         These are very good figures and reflect the fact that South Australia, being a manufacturing-based state, is reliant on a strong economy in the rest of Australia which buys the manufactures from South Australia. Of course, it also relies upon good export markets. In both those areas the macro-economic policies of this government have created the environment for confidence and growth—growth that those opposite despair of because every upward notch as a percentage point means that their chance of winning the next election goes down several percentage points, irrespective of who happens to be the leader of the Liberal Party.

My question relates to an answer given by the minister yesterday in which he gave a brief overview of the December quarter national accounts. Could the minister advise the Senate what the response of leading commentators has been to the latest figures? Noting that the Treasurer indicated that the figures showed the economy was `on track for sustained recovery with low inflation and low interest rates', is there any reason, in view of media commentary, why the government should change its description of the national accounts figures?

         However, I am asked in this question to comment on what the commentators have said. I am sad to report that one commentator, who is frequently reported, has panned the outcome, describing it as `threatening a boom-bust cycle in Australia'. That commentator is the shadow Treasurer, Alexander Downer. It seems that his commentary is the only one that is out of step with the huge body of opinion that welcomes these figures and recognises the importance of them. Mr Downer, in one of his speeches, said:

       <para>
        All of these commentators have said that the inflation stick has been broken and that the skittishness that we have seen in the markets is apparently not justified in anticipating interest rates. This is a negative comment. It reflects the view of the opposition that good news for Australia is bad news for the opposition. It is consistent of Mr Downer. On the eve of the Fremantle by-election he tried to scare the markets with irresponsible comment, and on the eve of the Bonython by-election he is trying to do exactly the same.

Last Friday I became aware of reports that two clinical trials of RU486 were to be carried out in Australia. The clinical trials, under the auspices of the World Health Organisation, are being conducted under the clinical trial notification scheme, CTN, which was announced by the minister in February 1991, with necessary regulations made in May 1991.

         Under the scheme, sponsors may proceed with trials, provided they have the endorsement of the relevant institutional ethics committee and they notify the TGA. TGA approval is not actually required for the trial to take place. The TGA was notified of the trial last week, in accordance with these arrangements, and approved the importation of the drug for the trials. I doubt that a refusal to allow importation of the drug would have been sustainable, given that the trial was legitimate under the CTN arrangements.

         The drug RU486 has been made available on a number of occasions since 1991 under the special access scheme. Applications have been approved for its use eight times: five for cancer—meningioma brain cancer and adrenal cancer—and three for the expulsion of dead foetuses. The present clinical trials are for both termination of pregnancy and post-coital contraception—the so-called morning-after pill. I am advised that an increased dosage of the standard oral contraceptive pill has been used for this purpose for some time by family planning associations. It is important to understand that the current trials, which are limited to 300 patients, are being conducted under the auspices of the World Health Organisation, and the drug is being supplied by that organisation.

Senator Crowley's office—Senator Crowley is the minister responsible for the TGA—was notified on Friday, two days later. The reason is that, since the undertaking was given to Senator Harradine, there have been changes to those clinical trial arrangements. I have discussed this with Senator Crowley briefly, because an undertaking was given to Senator Harradine that clearly has been breached—I do not try to run away from that—obviously because none of us knew about it; it was some years ago with different ministers and different public servants.

A working party is now being formed to investigate the role that science and engineering in Australia can play in developing an efficient and high quality food export industry in Australia. The working party will be made up of representatives from industry, export marketing, research and agricultural production and will present its paper to the Prime Minister's committee in the middle of this year. These two initiatives, together with the growing recognition in the industry of the great potential for Australia in Asia, will result in the expansion of food exports towards the Agri-Food Council goal of $7 billion by the end of this decade.

While there was no contribution to growth from total business investment in the December quarter, plant and equipment investment did record modest growth.

         There is a range of economic fundamentals which continue to produce a favourable environment for a pick up in plant and equipment investment over the course of 1994. Let me mention some of those fundamentals. Cash flows and corporate profits have been improving steadily since mid-1991. The ABS measure of profit share of GDP has risen to 17.7 per cent in the December quarter—the highest since the September quarter 1985. The constraint imposed by balance sheet restructuring for major corporations appears to have eased substantially over the past year, with gearing ratios having returned to more normal levels. Inflation, of course, still remains low and capacity utilisation picked up sharply in the December quarter. Add to that business confidence—

         This is a serious and disturbing development which again calls into question North Korea's commitment to peace and stability in North-East Asia, to a nuclear weapons free Korean peninsula, and to defining a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue. We regret particularly that the DPRK chose to obstruct the IAEA's inspection activities after earlier having agreed in detail with the agency on the range of activities that inspectors would be allowed to conduct. This agreement had been reached as part of an initial package of steps leading to the resumption of high level talks with the United States.

         The DPRK has been well aware that such obstruction would require action by the IAEA board of governors. That board will consider the matter at a full special session on 21 March under Australian chairmanship.

         In this environment we hope that Pyongyang will reconsider its position and allow IAEA inspectors to return to North Korea to complete the agreed schedule of activities. Completion of the inspections and progress in North Korea's dialogue with the South were the two conditions set down by the US for holding the third round of its own high level talks with the DPRK. Without progress on these fronts, there seems to be little prospect of dialogue proceeding constructively in the near future. As a result of these developments, the DPRK is likely to face stronger international action, including the possibility of action by the UN Security Council.

The secretary has agreed to do this as quickly as possible and he will be reporting back to me.

         As background for Senator MacGibbon, who obviously has a very limited understanding of this matter, the tax file number enables accurate matching of data across agencies such as Social Security to ensure that people are receiving correct payments and to eliminate duplicate or other unlawful payments. I think a number of people, including some senators, have obviously overlooked that the DVA disability pension is considered as income for pension purposes by the Department of Social Security. The tax file number is used in the data matching process to ensure the correct identification of those in receipt of both payments. It could be possible, for instance, for a person with a similar name to the disability pensioner to be unnecessarily inconvenienced by the need to provide further information to prove that he or she is not that person and is not receiving dual payments.

         The use of the tax file number eliminates that problem. More than 250 cases have been detected to date where people had not disclosed their disability pension payments to the Department of Social Security and, as a result, were overpaid DSS pensions. Savings of $110 million from data matching across all agencies were reported to this parliament in 1993. The actual gross savings in program outlays achieved for the first half of the financial year by the Department of Veterans' Affairs are some $2 million.

         —Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Overlooking the fact that the minister committed suicide with his own tongue when he admitted that the contents of his press release were correct as I quoted them, that he directed the secretary to review the conditions under which tax file numbers led to the restriction of the disability pension, and given the great distress this has caused disabled veterans in Australia, some of whom have been denied a pension they are entitled to for over 12 months, why was it not proceeded with earlier? Why were other authorities, like the Department of Social Security, not required to obtain the tax file number when granting an age pension or one of those other benefits? Why were they not tasked with getting the tax file number when the disability pension is a right for a pensioner who has served this country and disabled himself in the service of the country with respect to the normal enjoyment of his life? Once he qualifies for that pension he is entitled to have it. He is not entitled to be harassed and treated as a criminal.

         —I do not know what Senator MacGibbon had for lunch but it has obviously affected him very badly indeed. Under the legislation, it is up to the secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to make decisions about any extra exemptions—and there are many now. It would be improper for me to try to pre-empt the advice that he will give me. I have asked him to sympathetically look at the representations that have been made and give full consideration to all the issues that are involved. It seems to me that where disability pensioners have proof that their other income—for example, from DSS pensions—would rule them out, those may be examples of appropriate cases for exemption.

          The Government's general policy on disposal of any surplus Commonwealth property is that it is sold on the open market. In relation to rifle ranges, however, because of the historical relationship between shooting clubs and the Commonwealth the individual cases are considered prior to a decision being taken on the appropriate method of disposal. Arrangements have varied in individual cases from direct sale to a club, sale to a State Government which has allowed the continuation of shooting and sale on the open market. If the Senator has a particular property in mind I am happy to take the details and seek a response from the Department of Administrative Services.

         Senator Herron was aware of how the money would, in fact, be spent when he asked his question. In estimates on Tuesday he heard Senator Newman ask a series of questions on this matter. A moment later at that hearing he referred to my answer to Senator Lees and asked about the $2 million of the $9 million which was to be spent on studying costings for DRGs. His next question led to an admission by a departmental officer that some of the consultancies cannot be let until after the working party has reported, yet he still asked a question on how we are spending $9 million on the working party.

         One can work on the simple basis that it is impossible for a chairman to do a press conference by way of the doorstop upstairs without talking in some detail about what happened immediately prior to his arrival. That is what happened last night, and I will be interested in his response as to why it happened like that.

         Before this committee is finished, we will see it labelled, without fear of contradiction, the worst select committee ever created by the Australian Senate. This, of course, is in a circumstance where the government does not have the numbers, where the chair is held by a member of the opposition. And here he is: `Senator casting vote'. The casting vote is required for absolutely everything: it is required for suppression; it is required to keep you in existence. Senator Alston ought to become Senator cast-off rather than Senator casting vote.

The circumstances were that the chairman then waltzed off to do his press conference. It was quite remarkable. The coalition has brought this committee to the point of absolute laughability.

There has been no divulgence by the chairman of the content of the meeting. The honourable senator should take note that my question did not touch on the content of last night's meeting, which was a private meeting. My question touched on the activities of Senator Loosley, and prior activity. It is Senator Loosley who has upped the ante and wants to talk about the content of last night's meeting. It is Senator Loosley who asked, `Where is the legal advice? Why is it not published?'.

They do not want the report of this committee to see the light of day. We all know that there are very good reasons for it. Senator Loosley himself has referred to this committee as a witch-hunt.

I can only conclude from his acquiescence that he must be agreeing with me. When one asks a challenging question of that sort, one expects an answer or some sort of vigorous denial.

         Firstly, there is a clear distinction between Senator Loosley's actions and the actions of the chair. Senator Loosley was on an inspection of the plant. There is a world of difference between Senator Loosley inspecting a plant to talk to staff, and Senator Alston, who is chair of the committee and who is also responsible for opposition media policy, ringing up an editor and attempting to silence a journalist by putting pressure on that journalist through the editor. There is a significant difference. It is a very different case.

         Secondly, we have had some reference to the casting vote being exercised last night because one of the senators was away. Last night when the meeting began we waited for 25 minutes. All four Labor members were there at the beginning of the meeting. The other, opposition, members dribbled in late. Out of courtesy and recognition of the balance on the committee, we waited until every opposition member, and Senator Kernot, could be there so that the debate could take place properly. We did not take advantage of our majority, which was a significant majority for a significant period of time. Also, on a number of occasions, or one occasion at least, Senator Alston had to leave the room to talk on the telephone—probably to the media, knowing Senator Alston—and again the government senators extended him the courtesy of allowing the committee to adjourn.

         We did have skulduggery from the opposition when it suppressed the legal advice. I have that advice here. If those opposite want to get further legal advice, why would they not release this legal advice? The answer is simple: they do not like what is in it. When this advice is released to the public it will show that the reasons they sought this legal advice have blown up in their faces. The advice does not provide them with the answer they wanted, so they have suppressed it—at a cost of about $6,000, with an additional cost for further legal advice. That is what the legal advice will show, and that is why those opposite want to continue to suppress it.

         The question we asked was: why should Senator Loosley, in committee meetings and here in the chamber, spend so much time accusing Senator Alston of using his position as the committee chair in a way which reflects unfairly on the committee and its dealings with the terms of reference at the same time as he, Senator Loosley, as a member of that committee, is acknowledged by Fairfax editors to have been a visitor to the Fairfax building just prior to this committee inquiry? The double standard there is that Senator Loosley is on the record as having discussed the inquiry. The editors say the inquiry came up. In Senator Alston's case, the discussion was about the Liberal leadership.

With regard to some of the questions and views that have been expressed here today about some of the decisions that were taken by the committee, these matters have not been accurately reflected in the media, particularly the issue of legal advice that was sought in a motion which I think was initially put forward by Senator Sandy Macdonald.

         Legal advice was obtained. Whether it suited some members of the committee and not others is not the matter in point. The government members of the committee sought to have that advice published so that people could make a judgment on it one way or another. But that was not to be. I think the decision taken by the committee was that Senator Kernot move a motion to issue a public statement with regard to a decision of the committee to seek further advice. This motion was carried by a majority vote. But that was not reported in the press. The government members of the committee have had great concern about this matter.

          —Senator Panizza, in part, is right. We did decide that in certain circumstances the half-hour rule would not apply. I do point out that we have some business to get through before 4.30 p.m. because then general business automatically cuts in. I would be quite happy for this to go another 20 minutes, but if we do not complete the business listed to be dealt with—committee reports and a few other things—then at 4.30 p.m. we will seek to go a few more minutes to finish that. It seems to me a fair thing and it will not cut into too much of the general business time. If that is agreed, I am quite happy for the debate to be extended for 20 minutes.

The Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is an evenly balanced committee. It has dealt with quite a number of contentious issues—obviously the sorts of contentious issues which are being considered by the print media inquiry. On occasions on Fridays I have had business in Perth and Senator Loosley has had business in Sydney. Whenever anything contentious was coming up, Senator Loosley and I would always make sure that, if he were not going to be there, I would be there and vice-versa. It was a very sensible, gentlemanly agreement to pair with each other. That is a sensible arrangement to make—as with the contentious issue last night over the chairmanship of Senator Alston—when it is known that one member of the opposition will be absent on parliamentary business overseas.

That is terrific, but that is not a democratic way to behave. In a democratic country, it is not appropriate to say that senators in this country have more power than those in the American Senate but Australian citizens have fewer rights than the American citizens.

         I would expect nothing better from those opposite. That is the way they behave. They believe that they are born to rule. Because of their frustration with and embarrassment by the existence of a Labor government, they have to use the Senate to try to even up the score. People say that we are a bit upset because we do not have the numbers. This is the nature of the Senate. It is essentially based on an undemocratic electoral system. Those opposite are benefiting from the fact that they won the 1990 election in the Senate, but they lost the 1993 election in the Senate. They are making clear their advantage in a partisan, political way. If that is the way they want to play it, that is okay. But they should not expect the Labor Party to say, `Well, that's fine. That's all right. You can do whatever you like. You can abuse the powers of the Senate in any way you like'. Those opposite should not expect us to say that we will accept that as an appropriate form of political behaviour, because we will not.

         Every time that the Medicare tax has been increased the number of people privately insured has decreased. Prior to the introduction of Medicare, 70 per cent of the population were insured. When the Medicare tax came in at one per cent the number insured went down to 54 per cent. In 1986 the tax was increased by 25 per cent to 1.25 per cent and the number of privately insured went down to 48 per cent. Last year the tax was increased to 1.4 per cent and the number of privately insured went down to 40 per cent. It does not sound very much—1.4 per cent of taxable income—but it takes in $2,885 million. So we are talking about a sizeable sum of money.

         I challenge the minister to tell us why the numbers of the privately insured will not decrease on the next occasion, because it occurred over that period—and in that time health insurance premiums have risen by over 100 per cent. So it is a matter of cause and effect. He does not seem to understand that. He does not seem to understand the connection which has occurred in the past and which will occur again in the future. It is fairly straightforward. But somehow or other it escapes him. Yet in October last year, he said:

        The Australian Private Hospitals Association has cooperated with the minister since December last year in looking at his package of changes, which he calls reforms but which I call further destruction. Today it made the following statement:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The most bewildering aspect of the discussion paper is that it has correctly identified the major problems in the hospital system, that is, the high and . . . rising cost of private health insurance which causes Australians to opt out of private insurance which in turn leads to increased pressure on the public system, and those most affected are low income earners and the aged.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Having identified these problems, it has totally ignored them. There is nothing in the proposed reform package that provides any hope of a reduction in the price of private health insurance premiums.
       </para>

        He cannot have it both ways. On three occasions he refused to deny that there was going to be an increase in the Medicare tax and yet at the same time he is saying that he is going to encourage people into private insurance.

         The other point I want to make in relation to that aspect is the $8.9 million going to consultancies that are in the process of being let, before the ACTU caucus working party has presented its report. The minister is going ahead—once again, we have the expenditure of taxpayers' money, over $9 million on this occasion—before he has got the report. He has prejudged what is going to occur. The money is to be spent in this taxation year. If any other report is brought in that money will be wasted because it is going on consultancies. Over $8 million is to be spent on consultancies.

         As I mentioned in my question to the minister the other day, over a three-year period less than $4 million was spent on the Macklin national health strategy. The minister has already put off the report. I think the report is now due on 20 April. Regardless of that report, those consultancies are being let. This is another example of throwing money away on consultancies which may well be scrapped, and nothing may occur as a result. He keeps hiding behind this barrage of words that he uses.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) this day, to a question without notice asked by Senator Chamarette on 16 March 1994, relating to the McArthur River mine project.

       <para>
        The minister completed answering this question today. I asked the minister yesterday whether he was aware that the mine proponent had substantially altered the location and design of the facility. I asked, among other things: why has the government allowed the construction of the project to commence before the environment management plans have been completed? I believe the answer I was given today indicates that it is not a mere disregard for the invaluable and unique environmental features of the area that has led to this haste in moving ahead with the mining project.

         The seagrass beds, the major significant breeding sites for the dugong and the turtle in the Southern Hemisphere, are also Aboriginal dreaming, turtle dreaming and dugong dreaming areas. Something else underlies the government's haste: in the answer I was given today, Senator Richardson assured me that the validation and regranting of the McArthur River leases and exploration licence, including the lease at Bing Bong under the McArthur River Project Agreement Ratification Amendment Act 1993, in no way impairs the Yanyuwa's ability to claim native title. However, he did not say that, while it does not impair their ability to claim native title, it also puts them in the category of having their native title extinguished by the Native Title Act that was passed in 1993. It is an example of the reason the Greens had serious concerns about supporting the bill in the first place.

         He also says, `I am advised that dredging associated with the barge loading facility will all be within the mining lease area at the Bing Bong facility. No dredging is required outside the lease area'. It becomes apparent that the lease area has been designed so that the dredging required will have a dramatic environmental impact and will also be immune to any significant native title claims regarding its Aboriginal significance.

         This will not be the last mention of this matter. But I mention it here to place on the public record that this is the first instance where the native title legislation, introduced with such fine rhetoric of protecting Aboriginal interests, is now exposed in its real motivation and may well be the first application where the Native Title Act 1993 is used for the extinguishment of native title. Following debate on the Native Title Bill, the Greens have not forgotten all the undertakings the government gave and all the arguments presented. There was no definite instance where pastoral or other leases would extinguish native title. The government now needs to show the Senate that it did not know that the Bing Bong station was one of the stations that would be found to be invalid by way of native title and, therefore, that it would be validated and then native title extinguished under the Native Title Act 1993.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner), to a question without notice asked by Senator MacGibbon this day, relating to the provision of tax file numbers by veterans on disability pensions.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        The question I asked Senator Faulkner related to tax file numbers and disability pensions. A disability pension is paid to Australian men or women who served in the defence forces and suffered an impairment in either their physical or mental capacities as a consequence of that service. It is paid, therefore, to those who qualify with respect to the diminution in the quality of life that they can enjoy compared to others of the same age group who did not go to war. It therefore means that it is not an income support pension. It is paid in a way that is not means or assets tested. It is almost never withdrawn. It is not taxed in the hands of the recipient. It is very much a pension to compensate these veterans for the impairment in their ability to live a normal life.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government has demanded that they provide a tax file number before they can qualify or receive a pension. They qualify if they meet the standards required under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. A large number of veterans have refused to supply a tax file number because they believe that it is a gross invasion of their personal privacy. They allege that they have been treated as criminals. If they refuse to provide a tax file number, various people in the Department of Veterans' Affairs accuse them of having something to hide. It has caused enormous distress to veterans. A number of them have refused absolutely to provide it and, as a consequence, they have had their pensions withdrawn and they have suffered financial loss.

         Since I asked that question, my phone has run hot. An example of this is the case of a war widow who was on a 100 per cent disability pension and whose husband was on a disability pension. When he died, recently, the Department of Veterans' Affairs—in her own words—`coerced and blackmailed' her, in the depth of her despair at the loss of her husband, to provide a tax file number; otherwise she would not get the payment of her war widow pension. I argue that people who qualify for a pension under the act—and, God knows, it is hard enough to qualify for one—ought to get it. It is not taxed, assets tested or means tested—unlike most pensions that the government provides. The obligation is on the other departments—such as the Department of Social Security, if it is going to provide an age pension—to do a tax file check to make sure there is no fraud. The obligation to do it should not be on the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

         Senator Faulkner accused me of being ignorant of the act. It was because I understood the act that I encouraged those people to come forward in recent days to talk about the great injustice that had been done to them. In the minister's own press release, he said:

        That is exactly the point I put to Senator Faulkner. What he did, in legal terms, is known as dissembling. The other thing he did was confirm that the tax file number is being used for cross-checking purposes right across all government departments. When the tax file number was brought before this chamber, the government argued and argued that it was for the Australian Taxation Office and was not to be used as a fingerprint, as an Australia Card substitute—for which Senator Faulkner has admitted that it is now being used.

         Senator Faulkner was acutely embarrassed by my question, because it caught him red-handed. It showed him to be totally insensitive and uncaring. This matter has been going on for years. I know veterans who lost their disability pensions in February last year. He has been shown to be totally unresponsive to the demands made on him. That provision was always in the act. He has not acted on it. He sat on it for years. It is absolutely inexcusable, as he realised when public pressure was building up yesterday. Six hours after Mr Leonard Teale appeared on the front page of the

Similarly, pre-litigation conciliation is required by new section 166A of the IR Act (which is  inserted by section 40 of the Reform Act) where a tort action is to be taken against a federally registered trade union or its officers, members or employees in respect of an industrial dispute which is within the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.

          It is important to consider the task given to the Committee in context. When the Commonwealth, States and Territories agreed in 1990 to the Interim Planning Target to reduce greenhouse emissions, they also agreed to work jointly to develop a National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS). Policy options for possible incorporation in this Strategy were developed through 1991 in a series of reports, notably those of the Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) Working Groups. These in turn built on earlier reports, including the Senate Committee's previous complementary work on the greenhouse effect and energy use,

           Rescue the Future: reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect

          The rationale for the Committee's focus on electricity and gas was twofold. Firstly, these sectors are major contributors to Australia's greenhouse emissions. As noted in the ESD reports, emission reduction strategies will need to focus on options available within the energy production and energy use sectors because they are the most easily quantified and the most readily controlled. The electricity and gas sectors have been estimated to account for nearly 34% of Australian greenhouse gas emissions.

          Secondly, gas and electricity are key elements of the micro-economic reform initiatives being pursued by governments.

          In this respect, the Committee has not accepted the thrust of certain micro-economic reforms proposed by the Government, particularly in the electricity sector, which are regarded as being inconsistent with environmental goals. The Government does not believe that this is the case. The rationale for many of these important structural and operational reforms rejected by the Committee have since been embraced by Heads of Government.

The Government is firmly of the view that the micro-economic reform will be beneficial not only economically but environmentally as well. Those areas where the Government believes specific micro-economic reform initiatives in the electricity and gas sectors can deliver real environmental benefits has been spelt out in the response to the Committee's recommendations.

          In general, and as already indicated, one of the primary objectives of the current program of micro-economic reform is to remove any excessive or unnecessary costs to Australian industry, and thus to raise Australia's trade competitiveness and general prosperity. A more prosperous Australia will be better able to afford any future costs that may be associated with emissions limitations measures. The reforms proposed by the Government, for the electricity sector in particular, are likely to achieve a number of the results the Committee is looking for. A more competitive electricity market, allied with commercially oriented suppliers, will produce incentives to promote electricity conservation, where such measures are more cost-effective than building additional capacity. The expansion of the interstate electricity grid will enable existing capacity to be better and more efficiently utilised, new generating capacity will be deferred and no new capacity will be developed unless commercially feasible and only where it is more cost effective than demand management. The gradual removal of existing capital subsidies and cross-subsidies will lead to more efficient and rational patterns of energy use and promote the greater use of renewables, particularly in remote localities where they are already cost competitive.

         The Government has a comprehensive energy policy which interacts with economic and social sectors to foster the more efficient use of energy in an environmentally benign manner. The policy is effected principally through a National Energy Management Program. The program not only utilises information dissemination but also provides financial incentives and is involved principally with the States in the development of national energy standards and codes of practice. An important component of the program is the energy efficiency of Commonwealth operations, particularly of buildings and motor vehicles.

         In July 1992, a Commonwealth buildings energy audit program was initiated which applies to non-residential buildings occupied by Commonwealth departments and agencies. This program operated for the 1992-93 Financial Year and individual audits conducted for departments and agencies were paid for in full out of the program funds. A similar program operates for the industrial and commercial sector for which Government Business Enterprises are eligible. A number of other measures complement building audits within the Commonwealth sector.

         The Commonwealth buildings energy audit program requires that the audits be undertaken by accredited energy auditors.

         Agencies have been given both the means and incentive to implement energy audit findings.

Once property resource agreements are signed, agencies will be able to allocate, or bring forward from later years, funds from their running costs to implement viable energy efficiency measures identified from energy audits. Net savings in energy expenditure identified by initial energy audits will be shared equally between the agency and the Budget. Whilst there is no compulsion on agencies to implement the findings of the audit report, as recommended by the Committee, the Government believes that these measures taken in totality meet the intent of this recommendation.

         Another Commonwealth/State forum, the NGMC, has responded to this recommendation stating that it considered the approach to be too simplistic. The NGMC pointed out that the apparent justification for the recommendation was difficulties associated with objectively assessing whether all opportunities for cogeneration and energy savings through efficiency which can be realised at a lower cost than installing new capacity had been fully exploited. The NGMC accepted that there remain difficulties with making competitive assessments of demand and supply measures. Nevertheless, it was suggested that it would be more appropriate to seek to overcome such difficulties rather than imposing a somewhat arbitrary moratorium, particularly where a clear need for new capacity is demonstrated.

         The Commonwealth suggests that the Committee's recommendation implies a vertically integrated electricity supply industry in which governments are able to dictate the timing and nature of new electricity generation capacity. Under the micro-economic reforms, agreed to by Heads of Government, a competitive market structure is to be implemented by 1 July 1995. This structure will provide for open access for new generation, including from the private sector. The need for any new generation capacity should be reduced with the implementation of micro-economic reform.

It is proposed that all expressions of interest and bids submitted under the competitive sourcing process would be subject to independent review. This approach, if successfully implemented, should provide an effective means by which alternatives for new generation capacity, such as cogeneration, energy efficiency and demand management will be fully explored. This, essentially, is the objective of the Committee's proposed moratorium.

         Initiatives being pursued by the NGMC which make more efficient use of existing capacity, including new and upgraded interstate transmission links and the greater use of demand side options, have the potential to delay the need for new generation capacity in the southern and eastern States until after the turn of the century. Generally, any increase in demand in this period in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland can be met by newly constructed generation units such as Loy Yang B, Mt Piper and Stanwell. Demand projections for Queensland, however, indicate that 300 MW of new capacity will be required each year from 1998 to 2001. The Queensland Government is currently examining options for meeting this demand. The need for the first increments in new capacity could be considerably delayed should the New South Wales and Queensland Governments agree to the construction of a transmission link between their States.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The RRT facilitates the full commercial development of economic petroleum (oil and gas) resources. This is achieved because the RRT is based on profits rather than on levels of production. The RRT is therefore sensitive to changes in prices and costs. As a result a project does not pay RRT until it has covered its costs including a return for risk. In addition, the RRT's responsiveness removes the threat of premature closure of production when oil prices are low.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Following the introduction of the more efficient RRT, significant investment is now taking place in offshore Commonwealth waters. This is expected to provide incentives for the recovery of oil and gas that otherwise would not have been produced. New developments are under way in Bass Strait and off the coast of Western Australia while recent gas discoveries in the Otway Basin are encouraging. The outcome is that markets can be assured that long term stable supplies of petroleum will not be impeded or distorted by secondary taxation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The strong linkage between the RRT and natural gas prices assumed in the recommendation cannot be substantiated. A number of factors intervene between the RRT and the consumer to determine gas prices. These factors, which differ from one region to another, include the availability of gas, the presence of alternative energy supplies, production costs and the policies of State Governments.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For example, in Victoria a prime factor influencing natural gas prices to end consumers is the State Government's levy on the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria—the Public Authority Contribution Charge (PAC). The PAC, which collected $265 million in 1991-92, is three to four times the RRT attributed to natural gas if passed on. The Victorian Government has the option of reducing this charge. Currently the average city gate gas price in Melbourne before the PAC is applied is about one third of the price in other cities.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In light of these factors, the application of the RRT to petroleum production, including gas, will not inhibit the application of natural gas for cogeneration.

         In relation to gas price instability, gas prices will continue to be determined by market forces. The Government has limited scope to influence pricing and it has no desire to formally regulate gas prices which in itself can lead to inefficiencies.

         One of the tasks given to the NGMC by Heads of Governments is to examine the scope for upgrading the existing links between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and for new links between Victoria and Tasmania (Basslink) and between New South Wales and Queensland (Northlink). Although the feasibility studies for these various projects are being pursued by relevant States, the NGMC has been given a coordinating role.

         The NGMC has already reported to Heads of Government with regard to upgrading of the New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia interconnections.

         </emphasis>
         issued in May 1992. The Commonwealth in that paper argued that the adoption of certain structural reforms was the key to the establishment of a competitive generation sector. In this regard, it proposed the separation of transmission into a National Grid Corporation, independent of generation and distribution interests, as the first essential step in the development of a competitive market. The need for structural separation is clearly argued in the

It is worth reiterating that the Commonwealth considers that structural separation is a necessary prerequisite to ensure that there is open and fair competition between generation and transparency of charging for access to the transmission grid. It also removes potential conflicts of interest and the potential for cross subsidies between different sectors of the industry and provides the greatest level of certainty for new entrants.

         As early as the 11 May 1992 Council of Australian Governments' Meeting, Heads of Government accepted the principle of separate generation and transmission elements in the electricity sector. This was reaffirmed at the 7 December 1992 CoAG meeting. It was made clear, in a subsequent letter from the Prime Minister to State and Territory leaders that separation went beyond mere ring fencing. It appears that this latter position was arrived at too late for the Committee to take into account in its report.

         More recently, at the 8-9 June 1993 meeting of CoAG, in considering a report prepared by the NGMC on the structure of the transmission network, participating Heads of Government agreed to the establishment of the interstate transmission network through adoption of the Multiple Network Corporation model. This will effectively separate the transmission, generation and distribution functions. Governments have further agreed to work to have the Multiple Network Corporation structure in place by 1 July 1995, consistent with the NGMC timetable for the introduction of a competitive electricity market. Only South Australia and Tasmania have, at this stage, reserved their position pending further examination of the appropriateness of this structure for them.

In May 1993, the Queensland Government announced a restructuring of its electricity supply industry. The vertically integrated Queensland Electricity Commission is to be split into two Government owned corporations. One corporation will contain generation activities and the other transmission and distribution. The corporatisation process is due to be completed by 1 January 1995.

         The concern expressed by the Committee that a competitive market will be detrimental to the achievement of environmental objectives appears misplaced.

Demand management has hitherto received only minor support from electricity authorities. Implementation of the Protocol principles should encourage the development of energy service companies providing demand side measures on a commercial basis. The competitive sourcing process, whether demand or supply side, will ensure least cost long-term solutions.

Regulation needs to be cost effective, transparent, and with a uniform and independent national approach to be adopted. Electricity supply arrangements in the States already involve substantial regulation in various forms. The implementation of a competitive national electricity market is a complex process which will require underpinning by a regulatory framework which will be particularly important in regard to the natural monopoly sectors of the industry. Regulation will be required in a number of areas. These include technical regulation to ensure reliability of system operation; appropriate safety standards to ensure adequate public and workplace safety; environmental regulation to minimise environmental impacts; regulation of market access and market behaviour to sustain and foster competition, including from renewables, and to provide an alternative to competition through determination of arrangements and pricing in the monopoly areas of the industry; and regulation over the financial transfers between market participants.

         At its meeting on 8-9 June 1993, Heads of Government called for the NGMC to prepare, for consideration by CoAG at its next meeting, a report on demand management opportunities. This was welcomed by the Government. The Government will, through its membership of the NGMC, be pressing for more attention to be given to how demand management can be encouraged within the national grid system to satisfactorily meet economic and environmental objectives.

         of July 1993. One of the Commonwealth's main objectives is to ensure satisfactory arrangements for demand side bidding which provides the scope for reductions in present levels of power consumption. It is important, nevertheless, that demand bidding be an economic decision. Grid participants, in meeting their need for power should be able to take into account the bids of both generators and companies providing demand side services. The objective is that the proposed spot market should be able to accommodate demand side bidding.

         The Government acknowledges that a number of State utilities have developed significant demand management programs in recent years and that these programs have proved quite successful. One of the reasons for this is that demand management programs can postpone the very significant capital investment needed to increase generating capacity in order to meet future demand projections. In this way economic and environmental incentives can work in the same direction.

         The proposed separation of generation, transmission and distribution may see further increases in the adoption of demand management. Responsibility for demand management appears to fall most naturally to distributors, which, as part of a least cost planning approach to supplying customers, would be able to sell both supply and demand services. Distributors would no longer be constrained by broader corporate goals. Indeed, moves in this direction have already commenced. Sydney Electricity, the largest distribution authority in New South Wales recently announced it has established a new business venture, Sydney Electricity Energy Services, in partnership with energy management consultant Enman Pty Ltd, to provide demand management services, covering all forms of energy, not just electricity.

         The rationale for the Committee's recommendation flows from its view that there is a need for greater transparency and accountability for utility operations. This recommendation is essentially a matter for State Government consideration. The Government has a broad interest in the micro-economic reform of the electricity supply and gas industries as well as specific interests with respect to the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the Pipeline Authority.

         The Commonwealth policy in regard to its own Government Business Enterprises (GBE) is clear and generally consistent with the Committee's views. Each GBE should have a clear mandate and set of objectives which include any requirements to meet explicitly stated Government social and economic objectives. Community Service Obligations should be specified and met at minimum cost. The cost of all CSOs must be transparent, and new CSOs normally met from the Budget. CSOs are discussed further in relation to Recommendation 15.

         The Commonwealth has a policy of removing when practical special advantages and disadvantages that apply to its business enterprises by virtue of government ownership.

         In regard to the operation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, this has been the subject of a tripartite review by the relevant governments. Significant progress has already been made in the reform progress. All three governments recognise that the current legislative and other arrangements governing operation of the Scheme are unsatisfactory and outdated and stand in the way of maximising efficiency. The intention is that the Scheme be corporatised to improve its overall performance and efficiency and to improve competition in the south east Australian electricity market. At the June 1993 CoAG meeting, senior officials were asked to report back to Heads of Government on progress in the resolution of reform arrangements for the Scheme, underlining the importance attached to this task.

         At the present time, all public electricity authorities, and the Snowy Mountains Authority, provide comprehensive annual reports on their activities which are actively scrutinised in the normal course of government business. From time to time, the utilities also prepare more specialised reports on specific aspects of their activities.

         All governments, as part of their participation in the NGMC process, are being required to actively consider the implications for their electricity supply industries of the introduction of a competitive market in eastern and southern Australia. This has meant that the utilities have come under public and political scrutiny to an unparalleled extent. All governments, as part of broad structural and efficiency reform initiatives, have either completed or are in the process of comprehensively reviewing the future structure, function and operating parameters of their electricity supply industries. Even Western Australia, which is not a participant on the NGMC process, has recently undertaken a review of its electricity supply industry. The individual reviews being conducted by the States complements the work being done by the NGMC.

         In addition, the electricity supply industry, having been identified as a target for micro-economic reform, has been the subject of extensive performance monitoring in the recent past. For instance, the Industry Commission report
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Energy Generation and Distribution
         </emphasis>
         was released in May 1991, this was followed by a research report by the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) International Performance Indicators: Electricity in February 1992. A contribution to the BIE study was made by the Business Council of Australia which commissioned a study by Swan Consultants

         The utilities will not escape from the need for comprehensive performance monitoring and reporting after the establishment of the competitive electricity market. The Protocol indicates that a monitoring and reporting system will be established in order to provide the national and international comparisons needed to assess the effectiveness of the organisational arrangements. The reporting system is to provide appropriate measures of grid performance. The precise performance indicators are yet to be fully developed by the NGMC. It is appropriate that, with the development of a national market, the reporting requirements are developed on a consistent national basis, for both private and public participants in the grid, to ensure competitive neutrality and a common basis for comparison to enable appropriate bench-marking.

          Recommendation 15:

         Pricing policies of utilities are often designed by governments to meet objectives other than efficiency. These policies require utilities to fund a range of community service obligations (CSOs), which frequently involve the subsidisation of particular classes of consumers, and this leads to inappropriate tariff structures. In general in Australia, industrial and small commercial consumers tend to cross subsidise domestic consumers. The imposition of uniform customer tariffs across customer classes also results in urban consumers subsidising rural consumers. As a consequence, energy prices may not reflect the full cost of production and supply. This has hindered the development of alternative energy technologies, for example stand-alone remote area systems, especially those based on renewables. An alternative approach for utilities might be the provision of serviced stand-alone remote area power systems to meet the needs of customers in these areas. Such stand alone power systems may be more cost effective than new transmission line extensions and as well as reducing the cost of meeting CSOs to these customers.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As part of the process of micro-economic reform, governments need to examine ways to remove impediments to the development of alternative energy sources so that energy prices can more fully reflect costs of supply, for example by eliminating cross-subsidies on remote area grid connections and removing any requirement for uniform state-wide electricity prices. If social objectives are considered essential, the associated costs could be met by way of direct appropriations from governments rather than indirectly through utilities: moreover such an approach has the advantage of being more transparent. Alternatively, the cost of CSOs could be explicitly identified in balance sheets, with returns to Governments being reduced by an equivalent amount. Regardless of the methodology adopted for meeting the cost of CSOs, they should be explicitly and transparently identified.

          —The Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation's mission includes the term `sustainability'. In practice, this is rarely interpreted as `ecologically sustainable'. In fact, the chairperson's report does not mention the word, and I heard on the grapevine that he actually does not like his staff mentioning it either. So we have a report that is supposed to be dealing with research on the environment that does not seem to believe in ecological sustainability. It would be good to have the mission amended so that it has a greater ecological base. The water programs have a greater ecological component than the land programs, which tend to be more about stability of productivity rather than ecological sustainability.

          The corporation interprets its scope under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act as being supportive of existing primary industry. There is rarely acknowledgment of the need to examine whether such industries can be sustainable, let alone assumptions that changing practices will make them sustainable regardless of climatic, geographical, economic or biological constraints—that is, there is no questioning of the dominant production-based paradigm.

          The corporation recognises the need for research and development in sociological and economic aspects of primary production, but has not necessarily translated this into research dollars. There is still a tendency for the technological fix. The corporation recognises the need for integrated, multi-disciplinary and multi-regional approaches. Unfortunately, this tends to be difficult in practice given the cultural barriers between nature conservation and primary production agencies, the institutional barriers between states and so on. The corporation is doing a reasonable job of forcing agencies and people together, but there are external constraints that are difficult to overcome.

          An amount of $10.4 million from the Commonwealth government is not all that much to address research and development in all areas of ecological sustainability across the nation. While there has been considerable success in levying money in other areas, a number of other rural research and development corporations are not paying sufficient attention to ecological sustainability. Some additional funds may be gained through a direct levy on producers, which would be of great assistance.

          There are still difficulties in coordinating research with the extension and adoption of programs, especially given the new delivery mechanisms for the national landcare program. The corporation considers research priorities, programs and projects well in advance to assist institutional planning. It requires that all research projects have an adoption component and is willing to find some or all of this. However, researchers have no way of ensuring that research priorities will have their adoption or extension components recommended for funding by regional or state based processes. This has been looked at, but not at the state level.

          The corporation has done a reasonable job at ensuring that all projects and programs funded have a well thought out adoption and communication plan included and implemented. Some areas of research and development that tend to fall through the cracks are weeds, alternative land management, and inland rivers and waterways. But some of these are considered marginal issues. There is a long way to go and perhaps the major complaint that the Greens would have is that it is time we took the potential that we have with such a research and development corporation and translated it into action based on real ecological sustainability. It is also time to accept that we need to take action soon.

          The government and the Law Reform Commission are to be congratulated, firstly, for the reference and, secondly, for this report. Significant problems have been identified by the report. Primarily, the report identifies the difficulty of women obtaining access to justice. There are structural problems embedded in the system of justice in Australia which militate against women obtaining due and proper access. For example, the paradigm for self-defence is based on a bar-room brawl, which is not appropriate for women endeavouring to protect themselves and their children. Similarly, premeditation as a factor that aggravates an offence is one that has a gender bias in its interpretation.

          Even when there is formal equality, the lacunae in the legal system often result in women suffering. This is most apparent in the area of domestic violence. Traditional legal mechanisms have not afforded protection against domestic  violence. From the material in this interim report it is clear that more needs to be done, both in the law and the mechanisms of access to and enforcement of the law. The Greens (WA) support the recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission that a national women's justice program be established. We see this as a priority and call on the government to ensure that funds are made available in this budget.

       Recent statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about his wish to abolish the proportional representation system in the Senate is the talk of a would-be emperor determined to achieve absolute power. However, he has been careful to dress up this grab for power in the trappings of democracy, claiming that this house was historically conceived solely as a states' house, that it is unrepresentative and that it is driven by the ambition to usurp the responsibilities of the executive. These are accusations he made on 3 March of this year when he answered a question from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), who asked whether it was his desire to alter the proportional voting system—no doubt a very handy dorothy dixer at the time.

        When we go behind the rhetoric and look at the historic facts, we see that the Prime Minister is quite obviously wrong. This house was not conceived solely as a states' house. With regard to his claim that the Senate is undemocratic, he would do well to look at the facts. Far from usurping the rights of the executive, this house and my party, the Australian Democrats, are committed to ensuring that the executive remains accountable. This is, of course, the nub of the question. What really irks Mr Keating and what motivates all his utterances on the proportional representation issue is the Senate's determination to hold this government accountable.

I am sure he would like a less powerful Auditor-General's office. I am sure he would like to prepare his budget without proper consultation.

        As a house of review, the Senate has a record of which it can be justly proud. The figures are revealing. Mr John Uhr, a senior lecturer at the ANU, has done some interesting analysis of the way legislation has been dealt with in this house. Of the 1,850 bills which have been passed by both houses in the 10 years between 1983 and 1993, around 20 per cent have been amended by the Senate. Some 5,000 amendments have been moved; some 1,055 were successful.

        The contributions to the formulation of policy made by the Senate committee system is also evidence of the constructive role played by the Senate in the legislative system.

        Eliminating the Australian Democrats and Independents will have one of two results: either a rubber stamp Senate, which is controlled by the government, or a Senate dominated by the opposition, causing confrontational stand-offs and constitutional instability, as in 1975. Indeed, members of the Liberal Party have not excluded supporting Mr Keating, obviously in the hope that they will enjoy the spoils of absolute power when their turn comes. I was present at the meeting with Mr Downer when he suggested that if we do not support the opposition on budget legislation, this might indeed be the course of action that the opposition parties will take.

        Mr Keating's analysis of the history of the Senate is typically ideologically driven. It is well known that the design of the Senate repeatedly gave rise to some of the most bitter disputes during the 1890s conventions. However, it is a misrepresentation that those debates were simply about how to entrench state powers in the Senate. It is more accurate to say that they were directed at three things: setting up a house of review in a federal structure; ensuring accountability of the executive; and providing for a system of proportional representation that would reflect popular political sentiment.

        It should be noted that the first Commonwealth electoral bill introduced in 1902 provided for proportional representation for Senate elections and optional preferential voting for the House of Representatives. It was only after the first of the political deals that have characterised the history of proportional representation was done that a system of simple majority was adopted for both houses.

        I mention briefly a possible amendment foreshadowed by Senator Kemp which would suggest that my motion would include the statement that the representation of all states should be equal. We know that this is anchored in the constitution; we also know that the Senate does not operate as a states' house any more. While we do not suggest that this particular provision should be overturned, we are somewhat reluctant to accept it as a principle that should be enshrined forever. The Australian Democrats believe that there may be scope in the future to move towards regional government, for instance. Therefore, while we strongly believe that the Senate should always be elected by proportional representation, the representation of each state need not at all times in the future be equal, and certainly we should not commit ourselves at this point in time to that position.

        It is interesting to note the absurdity of the results that the defeat of the framers' intentions has achieved. For example, in 1934 a united Australia Party-Country Party coalition and the ALP divided the Senate by 33 to three. In 1946 the ALP government and the Liberal-Country Party divided the Senate in reverse order. It should be remembered that it was the ALP which, in 1948, saw the light and changed the system back to that envisaged by the framers of the constitution and introduced proportional representation. I do not say that it was done for elevated political reasons—the government was facing defeat at the polls—but what I do say is that it introduced a system the framers of the constitution always envisaged.

        However, the main issue in this debate remains that the Senate should be preserved as a democratic check on government. Even people who do not always agree with our policies might oppose Mr Keating's push to get rid of the Democrats and turn the Senate into a rubber stamp. If they do, they should make it clear to Mr Keating that accountability to the community is essential for democratic government.

The bad part of the curate's egg was in the last part where he threw doubt on the current method of election of senators.

I think this whole system of electing the Senate depends on these two principles. Senator Spindler strongly supported one; he has not given support to the other. I would have to say that even if he had agreed to support this amendment, it is not enshrined in concrete forever, as he seemed to imply. The motions that we pass in this chamber do not have the weight of constitutional amendment.

        Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you that this is not an obstructionist Senate. I believe that quite the reverse argument applies. For example, there is the contentious issue of sports rorts. There was a proposal before this chamber to have an inquiry into that. Again, the minor parties joined with the government and prevented that inquiry. The government was able to achieve an historic victory for the trade unions. I think it was a bad victory from our perspective and the perspective of employers and future employment in this country. After 10 years of trying, the government, with the cooperation of the Democrats and the Greens, managed to remove sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act. Despite all  its attempts in the previous decade, it was not able to achieve this.

        The argument can be mounted—it is the argument that I am mounting—that this chamber has been exceedingly cooperative with the government. Yet despite this, Mr Keating cannot brook any challenge at all to his authority. He is not only the most abusive Prime Minister in Australian history; he is probably the most thin-skinned as well. The mere fact that the Senate wishes to debate the legislation he brings forward, the mere fact that the Senate wishes to hold the government more accountable, has led to the spleen Mr Keating has shown against the Senate and to the abuse he has heaped on the Senate. His latest proposal is to change the voting pattern in the Senate to remove any impediment to his capacity to impose his will on the Australian people.

Maybe the Australian people, with their great history of democracy, simply do not wish to give untrammelled power to this Prime Minister or to any Prime Minister.

In another time in another place the great Winston Churchill warned about `a handful of men getting hold of the state machine, having the right to make people do what suits their party, their personal interests or doctrines'. Churchill may well have been speaking this day in this country about this Labor Party. There is no question that Mr Keating and his senior colleagues would like to embark on a constitutional upheaval without parallel in Australian history. The aim of the Keating government is to remove any capacity of our institutions to effectively query or challenge his ambitions.

        The first item on his agenda is the abolition of the constitutional monarchy. Mr Keating does not want an independent Governor-General; he wants a compliant president. The second item on his agenda, which he has largely achieved, is to strip the House of Representatives of its few remaining powers to force government accountability. He has largely  achieved this goal. Mr Keating is the first Prime Minister in 93 years who does not feel that he has to attend question time. All the Prime Ministers that have gone before him have assumed, as we have all assumed, that question time was a vital part of the institution of parliament in which the government could be questioned. Mr Keating has stripped, in large part, the House of Representatives of that capacity. He has shown a remarkable capacity to humiliate the current Speaker of the House of Representatives and to destroy that particular institution as one which can lay claim to any independence whatsoever.

The Democrats, not surprisingly, want their role in our democracy to be protected. I address these remarks particularly to Senator Spindler, who is with us in the chamber.

        To have the Senate acting as a house of review in which government measures are scrutinised closely, may be sent to a committee, and legislative measures which are seen as impacting too harshly on particular groups in the community may be modified, is indeed a central part of the Australian system of government. To change the present role of the Senate and to introduce measures such as those which have been indicated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that is, to have single-member Senate-type electorates in each state, would indeed change the whole notion of the Senate.

In rural areas in particular this would mean that the members or senators would then become inexorably tied to the regional interests of their electorate and would be unable to take a wider interest in areas such as foreign affairs, international trade and other global matters.

        The Prime Minister, in his remarks of 3 March in the House of Representatives, referred to the essential, robust element of our democracy as being the representative nature of the Australian ballot. Under the present system, the minor parties hold a number of seats allocated to them under the proportional representation system. So we have with us the Greens (WA) and the Australian Democrats because that is the way the Australian people have chosen to vote. Those two parties bring to the Senate a reflection of the way many people in Australia think. As I have said, although I may not agree with the points of view of the minority parties, I nevertheless uphold their right to be represented in the Senate because they have achieved a certain proportion of the Australian vote.

        The importance of the Senate was underlined by the changes made to the budget last year. As Senator Kemp indicated, although the budget was not thrown out and not dismantled, through the presence in the Senate of minority parties and the coalition we were able to achieve modifications to that budget which made it impact less harshly on some members of the community. Mr Keating simply wants to push legislation through the Senate, regardless of the feelings of minority groups about issues such as the republic and changing the flag.

        For this reason, on 3 March the Prime Minister also referred to the Senate as `a spoiling chamber'. That is indeed an extremely derogatory remark about an institution that has certainly stood the test of time. Mr Keating has called senators `paragons of democratic virtue', when what senators are doing is representing their states' and their constituents' interests. In that never to be forgotten phrase, the Prime Minister also called senators `unrepresentative swill'. On the same day, he referred to this house as holding any government to ransom over budget measures.

        As I have said, this house acts as a house of review. It enables legislation to be scrutinised very closely. In any democratic country there must be a mechanism for review. All Australian states except Queensland have retained their upper house. Even in Victoria during the excesses of the Kirner-Carr government in the 10 years between 1982 and 1992, the fact that the upper house—the Legislative Council—was not government dominated meant that those excesses were at least restrained and that there was some brake on the economic mismanagement which the Labor government brought to Victoria during that time.

I make it very clear at the outset that the government has made no such decision. We have no current plans to do anything of the kind. But I should also say that we are certainly considering whether the place might not be made to work better by a change in electoral arrangements which would ensure that the government of the day, properly elected, is able to govern. What kind of electoral arrangements might guarantee that outcome is a matter for very considerable debate and quite a deal of uncertainty.

If the Senate were a states house, as it was intended by the founding fathers to be, there would be something to be said for equal numbers of senators coming from each state with that being translated into the way in which the place is conducted. Once the Senate loses any rationale as a states house—which it really did in its very first session at the beginning of this century—immediately there is a much less obvious rationale for equality of numbers from each state. That is a constitutional matter; it is not something that could be changed by legislation. It is certainly not something that I am expressing any view about. I just make the point that, once we accept the reality that this is a party house and always has been a party house, there is infinitely less justification for the threshold requirements of the constitution applying in the way that they do and introducing the electoral biases they do than would otherwise be the case if this were genuinely a states house.

        The second point to make about the way in which the Senate numbers are operating at the moment is that the proportional representation system viewed constituency by constituency or, in this case, state by state tends to create overall a greater approximation between the number of votes a party or group gets on the one hand and the number of seats into which that is translated on the other. That just follows arithmetically from the reality of a proportional representation system. To that extent it is sometimes argued that the PR system is more democratic in a way than a system of single member constituencies. The way in which the PR system operates in Australia and the way in which things work out when we look at the voting returns as a whole all over the country demonstrate some very great idiosyncrasies indeed and a very conspicuous failure to match the notion that numbers of votes are translated into numbers of seats.

        Taking into account the 4.6 million votes the Labor Party received at the last Senate election, with 43 1/2 per cent of the vote, also taking into account the effect of the earlier election, and similarly taking into account the 4.5 million votes that the coalition parties received, each of us has got roughly the kind of percentage of seats that follows from that sort of percentage of the vote. I do not contest that analysis. It is complicated by the fact that the present Senate is the product of two elections, not one, so that we in the government are sitting in here with reduced numbers as compared with the numbers on the other side, with a situation where we have only 30 people in the Senate as compared with the opposition's 36.

        The real point that I want to make is that at the last election—if we leave aside the impact of the earlier vote—we got a higher percentage of the votes, 43 1/2 per cent, than did the opposition with around 43 per cent. Yet, we are sitting in here, as a result of the staggered system of election, with considerably fewer seats than the opposition. On the last occasion the electorate had to reflect its views of who should be governing the country, that was not translated into the number of seats that presently exist here. That is just a point made in passing, with no great portentous significance attached to it.

The balance of power for all practical purposes is being exercised by three people whom the opposition needs to join with to constitute a majority—the two Greens and Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine comes in here with 32,000 votes—one-third of one per cent of the total number of people voting in the last Senate election. He is occupying a very pivotal seat. The Greens have the grand total between them, in terms of direct primary votes for the Western Australian Greens at the last election, of 53,000, although I know that Senator Chamarette inherited Senator Vallentine's seat and Senator Vallentine, let it be acknowledged, had 76,000 primary votes when she was elected.

That is true in terms of creating a majority inside this place but, in terms of representing a majority of votes in the population at large through the transmission belt of this representation, it works very differently indeed. The opposition with its 43 per cent of the vote nationally at the last election needs only to link up with these 160,000 votes or so—in effect, this scarcely more than one per cent—to determine the fate of governments, the fate of legislation and the effectiveness of public administration when, between them, they represent very much less than 50 per cent of the primary votes in this country.

         Another point I want to make goes to the powers of the Senate. We are talking not about any old upper house but the most powerful upper house constitutionally in the Westminster world. There are no ifs, buts or maybes about that. The opposition does have the power to knock off budgets and money bills. It does have the power not just to delay legislation but to overturn legislation. It does have the power in this place to do more than any other upper house in the Westminster world—anywhere in the world.

        Moreover, the opposition has a demonstrated willingness to exercise that power. Not only in 1975 was the power to block supply exercised, but right now a majority of votes in this chamber is made up from people who have not denied themselves the capacity or the right to use the power to knock off governments. I do not think I am doing either the Greens or Senator Harradine an injustice when I say that I am not aware of them having committed themselves to never voting against blocking supply. I know the Democrats have, and I applaud them for that. But that is certainly not a position that has been adopted by the coalition or, to my knowledge, by the Greens or Senator Harradine.

        So at any time at any budget we could confront the situation once again that we confronted in 1975—that power not of review but of destruction. What is involved when we are talking about the operation of this particular chamber at the moment is the capacity to destroy; the demonstrated willingness to do that in the historical past, in 1975; and a demonstrated willingness to do it again at any time the mood so strikes those opposite. That is a pretty unhealthy state of affairs, I believe, and one that does not fit any rational conception of the way the Westminster system should work—which is that the government should be allowed to get on with the business of governing and should be rewarded or punished at the end of its term of office, depending on how well it has done.

I have talked in many places about the legitimate role of the committee system when it does work: to scrutinise legitimately governments; to operate to keep them accountable in terms of finance and administration; and, when it operates, to generate policy ideas, particularly in new areas of application.

We have, I think, all the elements of a deteriorating situation so far as the quality of democracy in this country is concerned. Look at it first from the point of view of the budget. Okay, we got through one way or another the budgetary process last year, but what a nerve-racking process that was. Of course, all of the things I am talking about are a product of the opposition acting in a thoroughly negative, obstructive, bloody-minded and unprincipled way as a result of its deep, very considerable distress—perfectly understandable distress, might I say—at losing the last election and a determination to destroy the capacity of the government to govern in every conceivable way it can at every step along the way.

We can only sit and keep our fingers crossed and hope and pray that that will occur. But we have a situation emerging where, unless people do take a cold shower and a deep breath and think about the way in which Westminster systems work and operate, our budgetary process could very rapidly disintegrate, descend down that spiral staircase and get us into the budgetary process that is all too unhappily familiar in the United States.

        In the United States, every annual budget is the product of an extended negotiation, a mercilessly protracted negotiation, between the executive arm of government and the Congress, with results that are all too readily apparent in terms of total fiscal irresponsibility as the executive, year after year, has to do deals left, right and centre in order to attract the necessary congressional majority. It has produced a desperately irresponsible budgetary process in the United States, which has worked to the economic disadvantage of not only the United States but indeed the whole world economy as a result of the blow-outs that have occurred and the inability to exercise any kind of discipline. That is the problem we face and there are all sorts of signs of that happening.

It has a direct and immediate impact on the bond market and a direct and immediate impact on the exchange rate, for God's sake, just because, with the utmost respect to Senator Margetts—I am not wanting to get personal about this—someone whose latest date with the last electorate produced precisely 53,000 votes for her party, for her in particular, is able, by uttering a little bit of a whinge or a grumble of a fairly innocuous kind, to send tremors and shivers through the financial market because of the potential impact this was seen as having on the budgetary process and a responsible set of outcomes.

In 1993, of the 432 amendments moved in the Senate, 182—nearly half—of those amendments were moved by the government itself. For God's sake, the government had to amend its own bills!

They finished in the Senate chamber. In the ornate, gilded hall, the parishioner asked the chaplain what he did every morning by way of saying prayers. He said, `I expect you stand up at the rostrum, think about your responsibilities, and pray for the senators'.

        The Labor government subjected the Senate to reform in 1948; there is no reason why a reform proposal cannot be entertained now. People are saying the Senate is the only body in the country that really ought not to be subject to review and reform. But is it not a simple proposition to entertain; could not the Australian Senate actually work better than it does now? Could it not be more effective? Could it not be more deliberative? Could it not be more able to represent opinion and aspirations? I think it could. There is no doubt that it has a role as a house of review and in examining legislation.

        The simple fact is that it is very easy to be in opposition. Those opposite have 36 negative votes on just about everything: everything they choose by way of exercising a negative vote they can see realised. That means in reality, even with the best will in the world, the government has to put together a coalition of interests on every measure that comes into the chamber to guarantee its passage. By and large, with the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine, I think there is a degree of cooperation, and people understand that. But we see creeping into our processes the same problems of the United States Senate where the American Congress cannot balance or put together a budget, because the painful measures are removed and eliminated.

The United States Congress has been chronically incapable of balancing its budget for at least a decade. It takes the painful elements out of the legislation all the time because it is concerned about the constituency, the electoral reaction. So the painful measures are taken out. Over the past few weeks we have seen a similar process creeping into the Australian Senate—$15 million removed here in a measure; $20 million added there.

        Many coalition senators would prefer in the Westminster system a House of Lords where its members simply sit there and pass judgment. The coalition will not exercise governmental power in the foreseeable future, so it is easy to fall back on being negative, on being obstructive. We saw that at the end of last year with Mabo. The performance opposite really was a sad chapter in this place. I acknowledge that three National Party of Australia senators, including from memory Senator McGauran, crossed the floor on one or two occasions endeavouring to represent part of their constituency. It is a great shame there was not more of that. It is a great shame that more people were not prepared to negotiate and to discuss the issues instead of simply exercise the block 36 negative votes. It is very difficult, even with goodwill involving the Greens, the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine, to put together a coalition of interests on everything.

        Let us look at the Senate's performance over the last political generation or two. The years 1974 and 1975 do not bear repeating. They were acts of constitutional vandalism. Australian history judges the opposition for that; I do not even have to make the argument. It has been a spoiling chamber. The 1993 budget process ought never to be repeated. The budget is now becoming an accounting function. Proposals are going in other directions and, in that respect, we will see what happens with the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on employment, industry and the regions at the end of April and the proposals that emerge from that. We will see whether the same agonising process of trading has to be gone through again in the Senate. It would be a great shame were that process to characterise what happens with serious policy issues. It ought not to occur. Heaven help us if further attempts are made in this chamber through the exercise of 36 negative coalition votes in perpetual opposition. The effort to gut the Prime Minister's statement may well be the objective again.

Centuries later the debate still continues. Cicero's statement is as appropriate today as it was then.

        Bicameralism is the division of a legislature into two parallel but separate political bodies which must act in agreement for legislation to be enacted into law. In supporting a bicameral system of national legislature, the overriding argument in favour of such a system is the role of the upper house in providing a check and balance on the operations of the lower house and the political executive. No lesser person than Winston Churchill said:

       The Australian upper house, the Senate, has the power to  review, amend and ultimately reject any legislation presented to it from the House of Representatives, making it one of the most powerful upper houses in the world.

        Some argue that the Australian Senate, the states house, was established as the price of federation. However, in an era of new federalism, where the states are gaining greater autonomy, the need for a forum for state issues may be seen as even more important, particularly in light of the declining control individual states have in premiers conferences and the Loan Council. Thus, in a federal system, the upper house's role may be seen as far more effective than in unitary systems. Under conditions where members of the upper house are democratically elected, the presence of such a chamber is just as important to the democratic process of government as the lower house. In the extreme, one commentator even suggests that, if unicameralism is to be considered in Australia, the lower house should be the one abolished.

        The inherently conservative and unrepresentative upper houses were abolished by drafting new constitutions.

It was abolished in order to establish a more functional second chamber. These examples of functioning unicameral legislatures do not justify adopting unicameralism in federal systems as their relatively small size does not require strong regionally representative houses such as the Australian and American senates.

While there is no room for complacency and arrogance, there is a need for the Senate to look at the way it conducts its business to see how it reflects the community. However, my usual motto, `Look at the criticism and see how it applies to the criticiser', indicates that perhaps some people are getting too big for their boots.

        It is very disappointing that the parliamentary accountability provided by the bicameral system is not understood or, if it is understood, is not valued by either the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). It indicates, as I mentioned before, a lack of respect for parliamentary democracy and accountability. A three-year term is not a mechanism for keeping a government honest or accountable, particularly when the modern Western equivalent of bribery for votes is the traditional pork-barrelling exercise that happens every three years regardless of which party is trying to determine the outcome.

        in which I said I regarded the threat by the government to change the Senate voting method as a compliment. It means the Senate is doing its job. For the first time since Federation the Senate is properly scrutinising legislation and overseeing the operations of the executive. As a result, the government wants to change the rules and make the Senate less representative. The Prime Minister called members of the Senate `unrepresentative swill'. However, the membership of the Senate is determined by the votes of over 85 per cent of the electorate. Control of the House of Representatives can be obtained, as at the last election, by a vote of 40 per cent of the electorate.

        The proposals of Senator Evans and the Prime Minister would result in the Senate becoming as unrepresentative as the House of Representatives. Any change in the manner proposed by them would also give rise to either a tame Senate or a rubber stamp, as people have mentioned earlier, or a perpetually hung parliament because of different parties controlling the two Houses. Only retention of the current system or an improvement for even greater representation can ensure that the people of Australia receive the representation they need and deserve. Perhaps we ought to, as I believe one of my colleagues said earlier, be recommending the proportional representation system to the House of Representatives.

        I refer to Senator Kemp's amendment. Senator Kemp suggested that there should be an additional statement based on equal representation for each state within the federation. The Greens do not support that amendment because we believe that it is already in the constitution and it does not require change. However, we feel it is contradictory to the motion as presented. We do not feel that it actually aids the argument to insist that the Senate is a states house or that that is its primary raison d'etre. It is actually the Senate as a house of review and consideration that is important. If it were a states house alone—and I think that would serve the Prime Minister's arguments very well—it would have been initially called a states assembly and not a Senate.

        Nevertheless, I have considerable sympathy with those wanting to refrain from moving over to the Prime Minister's rather radical proposal. He thinks it is unfair that the states have equal representation in spite of unequal populations. What would he want, I wonder? That we have 12 times the number of senators from New South Wales than we have from Tasmania? I am sure he might like that, but I am sure we would not. No, thank you; we have quite enough representation from the New South Wales Right—and perhaps that does not mean that we should be encouraging this kind of thinking by the Prime Minister. I will not talk about the quantity of votes because I actually think this is more than a numbers game; it is an opportunity to reflect community views in our country and do justice to the issues that are raised.

        The Senate is more representative, as I said before, than the House of Representatives. It reflects community views, and those who support the Greens, the Democrats and currently minority views are very grateful for that. The Senate is valuable to the major parties also because it is a way of signalling the way in which the community is thinking about the important issues like the environment, social justice, peace and disarmament, and participatory democracy. It is ignored by the major parties at their peril.

        The Senate is extremely valuable to the House of Representatives and to the government as a mechanism for addressing its accountability to the people of Australia, not to the parliament. That is our role as a Senate: to keep the government and the executive from becoming arrogant or refraining from respecting the views of the people, and to keep them accountable within the three-year electoral periods that they submit themselves to. The Senate is important in that respect. It is also important for us to reflect on the fact that we have quite a long way to go in respecting the views of the Australian people. Any mechanism that diminishes our accountability and our representation of the views in the community is a very damaging one and we should actually be going in the opposite direction.

        —It gives me great pleasure to speak in this debate because it is a very different sort of debate from those we normally have in this place. We are often so concerned with the nitty-gritty of legislation that we rarely have an opportunity to stand back and look at the whole system of government that we have in this country. Preparing for this debate, and standing back and looking at the whole system, really made me appreciate what we have in terms of parliamentary democracy, why what we have created is so precious, and why we should not let the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who has ulterior motives on this matter, to tinker with what is probably the best system of government in the world.

        If we look back in history, we can really appreciate how new the system of government we have is. With that, we can really appreciate how fragile this system of government is. Australia, which was settled by Europeans 200 years ago and which has had a federal system for only 93 years, is the sixth oldest democracy in the world. That shows us how fragile the system is. We created, I believe, a unique amalgam of the civilisation from which we had sprung in terms of the American and the British systems of government. I believe we have a superior system to the British and American systems because we took the best of both worlds. This is best exemplified, I believe, in the creation of the Senate. We created one of the most powerful upper houses, if not the most powerful upper house, in the world. When creating that upper house we gave it the opportunity not only to review the legislation of the government but also to represent the very diverse and vast regions of this country.

        When I came into this place I really came to appreciate the role, power and responsibility that the Senate had in keeping government in this country on track. The fact that there was a check on government was probably one of the Senate's strongest features. I was absolutely amazed not only at the amount of legislation that went through the parliament but also at how often the government got it wrong. I was also amazed at the number of amendments introduced. Senator Loosley talked about the Mabo debate. How many amendments were there to the Mabo bill? I think there were about 270 in the end. If we had a unicameral system, how many amendments would there have been to that bill? I suspect none.

        This was brought home very strongly to me when I first got here with the Education Export Bill. It was the first bill I worked on in committee. The government brought in a piece of legislation hastily prepared and poorly drafted and, by the end of the process, we had successfully introduced 32 amendments to this bill and totally reversed its direction from overregulation to deregulation. Since that bill came in, the educational export sector has grown from $800 million to $1,200 million. This sort of framework we set up allowed our education and our exports to expand. It was because of the role of this house of review and the creation of more sensible legislation that this took place.

        Now the Prime Minister wants to tinker with this. He wants to tinker with a lot of things: the flag, the constitution and constitutional democracy, and now he wants to tinker with the way in which the Senate is elected. We have to ask why. The basic answer is that this Senate stands, like those other things stand, as a bulwark against the untrammelled power of an elected lower house. That is our unique position in keeping that under control. The Prime Minister is not saying that he is going to abolish the Senate—

        One interesting reform he is suggesting is to change the system of election of the Senate, from the excellent system set up by a Labor leader, Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, who, on introducing and putting forward the ALP arguments for the current system of proportional representation, stated:

       For many years there has been a demand that the Parliament should provide a system of electing senators which would give more equitable results and enable the electorate to be more truly represented in the Senate. The Government has given careful consideration to the matter and had closely examined alternative methods. It has decided that, in relation to the election of Senators, where each State votes as one electorate, the fairest system and the one most likely to enhance the status of the Senate is that of proportional representation.

       Dr Evatt did not get much right in his life but he certainly got that right. He created an excellent system. Why does Mr Keating want to change it? We can see the reason when we look at my state's results in the lower house and the upper house. In the lower house, the government controls 34 of the 50 seats—68 per cent.

        What happens in the Senate? In the last election we on this side won three out of six seats—50 per cent. That represents the true feeling of the people of the country. The state boundaries of this country cannot be rorted and the Senate is elected on state boundaries. The Prime Minister cannot change that. The government can fiddle around with the lower house boundaries and produce distorted results, in some cases ones that Governor Gerry of Massachusetts—who invented the original gerrymander—would have been proud of, but the Prime Minister cannot change the Senate boundaries.

        In this country, Labor has won the last five elections, having only 30 seats to the coalition's 36. This, accumulated over the last two elections, shows the real balance of power, the real reflection of the people's will in this country. That is why it is absolutely vital that this system stay as a bulwark against this government. We have created a unique system of checks and balances in this country. The Senate is one of the most important of these checks against the unbridled power of government and we tamper with it at our peril.

        —This debate has been conducted on the basis of the Senate being in the same form now as it was when the rules were developed in the 1890s, in a situation where separate colonies had their own customs systems and their own defence responsibilities and were connected directly to the United Kingdom—or Britain as it was then called. The only way those colonies were prepared to come together, obviously, was by some representation which safeguarded, as they saw it, their own particular interests. For that reason, the first constitution contained the right for the states to have equal representation in the Senate.

As has already been agreed here today and on other occasions by people on this side of the house, suggestions by people on the other side to improve legislation have often been picked up.

        People are saying that proportional representation is the be all and end all, that it is a great way in which to elect people and that it gives true representation. If that is the case, it follows that the method of election in the House of Representatives should be changed—which I do not agree should occur. I believe the House of Representatives is the way to go. Even if one were to accept proportional representation as the way to elect people to this chamber, it does not necessarily mean that we need 12 senators to represent each state to have a proper review process operate and to get quality legislation.

        I am sure that many intelligent people say to themselves, `Here we are in the federal sphere where we spend quite a lot of money on elections to elect members of the House of Representatives; we pay them reasonably well; it costs us a lot of money to support them in terms of the work they do. But then we merrily go on and elect a group of other people who then reject the legislation of the House of Representatives'. That does not make a lot of sense, even though I agree with the question of review—and some people might say the total right of the single house process—but to me the constitution can contain those sorts of prohibitions, and also the High Court can prevent any excesses that might occur in a federal government which was a single house operation.

        The Prime Minister's attacks on the Senate with comments like, `unrepresentative swill' are a disgrace, and reflect especially poorly on someone who claims that he is the `all Australian person'. If anything can be said about the Senate, it is that it is uniquely Australian. It did not come from the House of Lords, it does not reflect the requirement to have a peerage or, as in other upper houses, some landed qualification. It is not purely a states' house as in Canada or Germany. The equality of state representation does not, of itself, make it unrepresentative. It needs to be remembered that but for the equality of the representation of the states there would never have been the federal compact which has made this great nation.

Yes, it is frustrating in government, but government senators should try being in opposition and see how frustrating that is.

        —Tonight I want to address the issue of the Senate as a states house. When I go round to schools in Victoria talking to students of politics about the role of the Senate, I ask them: `Can you tell me what you know about the role of Senate?'. They will say, `It is a house of review and it is a states house, but it is not a states house because you do not vote on state lines'. My answer to that is, `It is very sad that many of your textbooks are written by teachers who are not actually practitioners, who maybe have not spent time sitting in the galleries or who have not been members of parliament'. From the outside it would appear to many that the Senate is not a states house. Obviously, Senator Burns, who hardly every speaks in this chamber, does not think about the issue of the Senate as a states house.

        But let me tell the Senate some of the things I say to the students. One of the major issues is that as a states house—and I do not know what goes on in the caucus room, but I know what goes on in our party room, although I will not disclose the things that go on—if an issue comes up about transport, I can bet my bottom dollar that the Tasmanians will be on their feet. If an issue comes up about gold tax, I know that the Western Australians and some of the Victorians will be on their feet. I know that if it is an issue about some other area that relates particularly to a state, those senators will support the House of Representatives members from those states and argue vehemently in the party room. I do not know what they do over there on that side of the chamber, but on this side I know that those senators represent their states in the party room. So in one of the major parties the states are represented in the party room. That is one of the benefits of the Senate; it gives the smaller states representation that they would not have in the major party rooms.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I also say to the students that one of the things that happens because we have a Senate is that the many thousands of people who vote in their electorates and who do not happen to win—Liberal supporters who vote and do not win or Labor supporters who vote and do not win—in their senators have direct representation in the federal parliament. If they are Liberal voters living in a Labor electorate they can go to a senator who they know shares similar views to theirs. If this were a single-house parliament they would not have that access.

        One of the other things that can happen is, for example, between 1990 and 1993 we had no Labor seats in rural Victoria, except if we took Burke, an electorate on the edge of the city which had some city-based towns and some rural area—not very much. This meant that between 1990 and 1993 there was not one member of parliament representing the views of rural Victoria.

        Let me tell honourable senators what happened during that period. There was an issue. The then Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, in his wisdom decided that one of the ways the government could rationalise things was to merge all small rural nursing homes in Victoria that were less than 250 kilometres apart. That was the sensitive, caring thing the government was going to do. So, if a nursing home in a little town in Victoria had fewer than 20 beds, the government was going to merge it with a nursing home less than 250 kilometres away. So a person 85 years of age living in a nursing home in a rural town could be shifted to some other nursing home in Bullamakanka or wherever in Victoria. That person's spouse, who might be 83, would then have to travel all that distance to visit.

        When I heard about this decision I went into orbit. I could not believe it. I could not believe that this caring Labor government, as part of this wonderful economic rationalisation, was going to merge these small rural nursing homes. I talked to my colleagues from the other states about it. Guess what? They were not concerned. Why were they not concerned? The answer is that there are hardly any small rural nursing homes in the other states. In fact, almost none were going to be affected by this decision. It was going to affect Victoria in particular. I got that message from across the state.

        When there is an issue, such as small rural nursing homes, people go to their representative in the House of Representatives. All they know is that it is an electorate issue. But, as senators, we get the overview of the whole state. We begin to see that it is not only happening in Bourke, Wannon or McEwen; it is happening in every electorate in the state. So, with that overview, we can raise the issues that affect our states in the party room. It is a nonsense to say that the Senate is not a states house. It may not be a states house in the traditional sense that our forefathers, who set down the constitution, believed it was going to be. We know that.

He has not learnt his history because he said the Senate—I do not want to misquote him but I think he implied this—had never voted along state lines. That is not correct; it has in the past. But, as I said before, in the party room the smaller states are heard very loudly and are supported because they have five or six senators in each of the major parties who can put their views. They are in addition to the very small number of members of the House of Representatives from states like Western Australia and Tasmania.

        Because of a quirk of fate which lasted from 1990 to 1993, not one member of the House of Representatives came from rural Victoria.

        One of the other valuable roles that a senator can play is to look at issues on a state-wide basis. People can legitimately come to us. I can understand that a member of the House of Representatives may be very busy when somebody from an electorate far away rings them up and says, `I have a concern'. If small rural nursing homes are not their big beef, they will do what they can for the small rural nursing homes in their own electorates. But they are not going to be terribly concerned, because something that happens in another electorate is not going to win votes for them. If they are concerned about people, they might see them, but they will not have the same commitment that a senator has because these people are the senator's constituents. That is the issue. The major point that I want to make today is that it may appear from the outside that the Senate is not a states house but, when we look at its function, we find that it is in fact a states house.

        —I rise to support Senator Spindler's motion. We are debating the wider notion of Senate electoral reform. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others have attacked the Senate as unrepresentative because states of vastly different sizes have the same number of senators. We have heard a lot about that this evening. Perhaps one way to remedy that is to have equal numbers of senators from electorates of equal size. That is an option for discussion that I think we should talk about. That remedy would require a constitutional referendum—not a joint sitting and a vote of both houses. Most of us know that the history of constitutional referenda is that a referendum would probably fail, but there is no harm in discussing options.

        The simple fact is that, despite the different sizes of the states, the composition of the Senate very closely follows the national vote for each party. That is because proportional representation does tend to compensate for electorates of different sizes. This means that the Senate is much more representative of voter intention than the House of Representatives. In 1990, Labor won control of the House of Representatives with 39.4 per cent of the primary vote. That could not happen in the Senate. Only a few per cent of Senate primary votes do not go to a winning candidate. This compares with more than 50 per cent of House of Representatives votes which go to losing candidates.

        Any move to strip Australians of an effective vote will further alienate the voting public from the parliament which is supposed to represent them. It is ironic that, just at a time when New Zealand is introducing mixed member proportional representation to remedy precisely the problem we are talking about, this government is toying with the idea of sending our electoral system back to the 19th century.

        There has been a lot of propaganda about the way in which the Senate was only ever supposed to be a states house, yet it has failed to play that role. The Senate was established with two roles in mind: one was as a states house and the other as a house of review. That is why many of our constitution framers, including some of its most distinguished, favoured electing the Senate by proportional representation. That is also why the first ever Commonwealth electoral bill, tabled in 1902, provided for the Senate to be elected by proportional representation. The bill was defeated, but it showed beyond doubt that the Senate was widely seen from the outset as a house of review.

        The Prime Minister believes that this Senate has failed to act as a house of review and that it has tried to usurp the role of executive government. The Democrats agree that the machinations of this chamber have been pretty hair-raising at times and occasionally we have put a toe over the line. For example, we disagreed with the double deadline motion and the way in which debates over the budget and native title were unnecessarily drawn out.

        But, looking beyond the theatre and at the actual outcomes, what has the Senate done to upset the government so much? We made the budget fairer, with the overwhelming support of the Australian public, while leaving the government's deficit targets intact. We passed native title and industrial relations reforms with significant improvements. We have insisted on uncovering the circumstances surrounding the sale of large slabs of the Fairfax press to Conrad Black. We pressured the House of Representatives to take a proper look at Mrs Kelly's ministerial performance and we won agreement for a range of accountability reforms. It is the outcomes which ultimately matter. These outcomes have been responsible, constructive and democratic.

        One reason the Senate is able to function as a house of review is that we are elected by proportional representation. The Australian people have used proportional representation strategically. They have ensured that no single major party controls this chamber and that a more diverse range of views is heard than in the House of Representatives. The result is that legislation cannot be rammed through and, equally, oppositions cannot easily obstruct. That means that negotiation is required and negotiation is often a good thing because it forces us to focus on the merits of the issues.

        Our decision making processes are more open and more accessible than those in the House of Representatives, and this imposes a greater discipline on us to act in the public interest.

        We all know that any electoral change is motivated in part by self-interest. Labor's introduction of proportional representation for the Senate in 1948 was no exception. Labor calculated that it would give it control of the Senate if it lost government in 1949, and it was right, if only for two years. But the bill passed with bipartisan support because there was also a higher principle at stake.

        The preferential bloc voting system was a joke. It had been recognised since before Federation that proportional representation would strengthen the Senate's house of review function. This Prime Minister's threat to change the Senate voting system has no such redeeming features. It is motivated by nothing more than a contempt for the important role the Senate plays and for the views of the Australian public. The government cannot avoid facing voters at election time, but it would dearly love to avoid accounting to them between elections.

        I think the difference between the view of the Democrats on the role of the Senate and the need for change and the view of the government is the weight of historical and contemporary argument in favour of our view. We can point all the way back to the constitution's framers. We can point to John Stuart Mill's argument that second houses of parliament should be elected by a system which allows minority views to be represented and allows the chamber to act as a check on executive government. We can point to the WA Inc. royal commission, which argued for a house of review elected by proportional representation, and we can point to the worldwide trend—including just across the Tasman—to more representative electoral systems.

        I have yet to see one considered opinion in favour of single member electorates for the Senate, but I have seen numerous editorials and opinion pieces which range from the sceptical to the hostile. The most interesting comment was by Crispin Hull in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Canberra Times
        </emphasis>
        of 7 March. Mr Hull points out in his article that if the government legislated to establish 12 single-member electorates in each state then it could be argued that half of the voters of each state would be deprived of a vote at each half-Senate election. This may be constitutionally unsound. It certainly would be very unpopular as well.

        An alternative would be to divide the state into six electorates. There would be two senators per electorate, one of whom would go to the polls at each half-Senate election. But a problem arises in the event of a double dissolution, where two senators would have to be chosen per electorate. This is what happens now in the ACT and the Northern Territory, and the result would probably be the same—a hung Senate with 38 senators on each side.

        I think our focusing on this motion is timely, because maybe the government needs to be reminded that this Senate is not a factional brawl and that this parliament is not the sole possession of the Labor tribe; it is the property of the Australian people, and it deserves a lot more respect than it has been shown of late. The Senate's present system of proportional representation is a pillar of our democracy. It is what makes this chamber a house of review. It gives almost all Australians a primary vote which counts, and that is important.

        The Senate is the only house which is prepared to stand up to an arrogant government and hold it to account. In discussing this motion, I guess what we are saying is if we undermine proportional representation, we undermine democracy. If that does not worry the government, then maybe the fact that it would almost certainly lose control of both houses just might. Perhaps the thought of a double dissolution focusing on the role of the Senate and the constructive role of minority parties within that Senate would be the ideal issue on which to go to an election.

The best example of that is Victoria with its unique aspect of the bush nursing homes, which require direct representation by the Victorian senators.

        In the light of our wishing to take this matter to a vote, I just make the point that we would have thought that the government would have known the attitude of the Australian public in this debate. There is enough modern day evidence for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to realise this. We have only to hark back to the 1984 and 1988 referenda. On both occasions, people were asked whether there should be change to the voting patterns of the Senate and the rotation of senators and the Labor Party got a resounding, thumping no. One single point more: I cannot let Senator Loosley's Irish day logic go by; I cannot let him quickly rewrite history and walk out of the chamber in relation to 1975. The people spoke in 1975, and what they said is still true today.

           Asylum, border control and detention
          </emphasis>
          is a mixed bag of goods. The report does not recommend, as it should have, a scrapping of the detention system in favour of releasing asylum seekers into community care while their cases are being decided. There are, however, a number of other recommendations which are an advance. The committee's main recommendation was that unauthorised border arrivals who claim refugee status be held in detention while their cases are assessed but that, if they are held for more than six months as a result of lack of action or error by the department, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs should consider releasing them with a bridging visa. The introduction of the bridging visa is an advance on the previous system.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The report also recommends that the minister have regard to any special needs based on age, health or previous experience of torture or trauma, whether applicants are likely to abscond and whether there are adequate community support arrangements. Other positive recommendations are that priority should be given to the processing of claims by refugees, that an advisory committee should be established on the conditions and services in detention centres, that children in detention centres should be allowed to attend local schools and that medical personnel should be provided to detainees who can speak the language of the detainees.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          However, perhaps the most negative and most deplorable aspect of the report is that it also recommends that moves be made to curtail legal challenges to decisions on refugee claims by amending legislation to limit the opportunity for making such challenges in the Federal Court. This would move us further in the totally unacceptable direction of creating a class of people who appear before Australian courts but who do not have equal rights with other people in Australia. This principle of equal rights is one we should not relinquish. It is a principle to which every civilised society should subscribe.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Australian Democrats did make a submission to the inquiry. We said in that submission that the system as it stands contravenes our obligations under international human rights law. It is economically inequitable, causes undue hardship on detainees and compounds their emotional, psychological and physical ill health. As I have indicated, the recommendations in this report do not adequately address these particular shortcomings. The preamble to the universal declaration on human rights declares:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         "no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."
        </para>
        <para>
         Yet, as I said, the recommendations in that report do not go as far as to put an end to the shameful provisions of detention that we have practised for quite a number of years. While there are some improvements, they certainly do not go far enough. Article 22 of the international convention on the rights of the child says that children are entitled to:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of . . . rights set forth in the Convention and in other international human rights or humanitarian instruments to which the state is a party.
        </para>
        <para>
         Very clearly, what we are continuing to do does not meet the standards set in that convention which Australia has both signed and ratified. I turn to the international convention relating to the status of refugees which provides:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         States shall not impose penalties, on account of the illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory. . . where their life or freedom was threatened . . . are present in their territory without authorisation, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         States shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status is regularised or until they obtain admission to another country. The contracting states shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission to another country.
        </para>
        <para>
         I express regret that the committee has not seen fit to address these standards to which we as a nation should aspire. I return to what I consider to be the most deplorable situation. Twice now we have passed legislation in this parliament which denies a particular class of people equal rights before Australian courts. We have passed legislation which limits grounds for appeal. It is difficult to believe but we in this parliament have excluded, as a ground for appeal, bias by the tribunal in the decision on refugee status. Despite the strenuous opposition of the Australian Democrats, this parliament does not think that if somebody shows bias that should be sufficient grounds for appeal. This chamber has also excluded natural justice as a ground for appeal, over the strenuous opposition of the Australian Democrats.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is deplorable that the committee has not seen fit to be critical of those decisions and to recommend that they be reversed. On the contrary, the committee has suggested that further restrictions be imposed on the legal rights of asylum seekers. I think it is worth remembering that these things are contrary to the basic legal rights that every citizen should have. We are saying, `We are entitled to guard our borders. We are entitled to ensure that some 500 people who come here by boat do not enter and do not jeopardise our security and our immigration policy, which admits migrants, immigrants and refugees of the order of 80,000 or 90,000'. For the sake of imposing restrictions and guarding our borders against several hundred people, we are prepared to jettison a basic principle of human rights and legal safeguards. I think that is a great matter of regret and continues to be a blot on the record of this parliament.

The then President, having considered the matter, referred it to the privileges committee and its report has been tabled in the Senate.

         I agree that in the minister's case there was no possible benefit or motive. In fact, it would have been positively stupid for the minister to knowingly mislead an estimates committee, but there were also senior customs officers involved in this incident, and I suggest that in their case the question the minister asked was the wrong question.

          The question that should have been asked is: when faced with two separate opportunities on the evening of 26 August to provide the correct information to Estimates Committee E about the legislation required to implement the tax, why would senior customs officers, including Mr Frank Kelly, the then comptroller-general, and Ms Virginia Stretton, the national manager of inland revenue, fail to provide that information? What logical explanation can there be for this failure?

          To my mind, there can be only two explanations. First, these senior officers—despite their seniority and expertise, despite their attendance at briefings on budget related matters, despite discussions that must have taken place within Customs about the need for legislation, despite drafting instructions having been issued by Mr Stephen Holloway of Customs on 17 August, a full week before the hearing on 26 August, and despite a draft bill being in existence and present in Customs on 24 August, two days before the hearing—were so vague, so unsure and so unprofessional that they simply could not recall any details whatsoever that might have led them to have suggested to the minister at the very least that legislation might be required, let alone the fact that it was required and a draft bill was already in existence.

          I simply cannot accept this explanation. It defies all logical explanation, and I reject it completely. The privileges committee also had great difficulty with this concept. The committee stated, quite generously, that it `had difficulty understanding the collective lapse in memory amongst a number of officers'. The committee also stated that it was sceptical of the reason given by Mr Kelly as to why other officers did not even bring the possibility of legislation to the minister's attention. The reason given was that these officers thought the minister knew something that they did not. This would have to be some sort of record. It would be one of the few times that public servants thought their minister knew something that they did not.

          As for the collective lapse in memory, as I have already stated, it is simply not believable that this took place. I do not accept that not one of the senior officers, including Ms Stretton, who is the manager of the branch that would be responsible for collecting the tax, could recall any details that could be passed on to the minister. It leaves only this alternative explanation: the officers did not tell the minister all the information within their knowledge. The question I ask is: why?

          I accept that on 26 August, when I first asked questions about the possibility of legislation, the officers concerned were perhaps a little uncertain. After all, Mr Stephen Holloway, the legal officer who issued the drafting instructions for the legislation, was not there. But what I cannot accept is that, during the 1 1/2-hour interval when customs officers left the hearing room to seek more information about the tax, it did not occur to them—any one of them—either that they knew drafting instructions had been issued and a draft bill was in existence or, at the very least, that there had been discussions about the new tax which the inland revenue branch would have to administer.

          Mr Kelly has suggested that his officers either did not recall or were so unsure that they decided not to mention to the minister even the possibility of this new legislation. Apart from this explanation not being believable, it simply does not tie in with what the minister advised me after the 1 1/2-hour interval. The minister said:

          It appears to me—maybe I am wrong—that the officer or officers who gave the advice to the minister gave him something in writing or told him verbally that it had been determined or decided, or words to that effect, that legislation was not necessary.

         —On 14 March I asked Senator Cook, the Minister representing the Treasurer, whether he acknowledged that the Australian Taxation Office's pre-consultative document on taxation of financial arrangements would add substantially to compliance costs and run counter to tax simplification. I referred to the government's commitment to tax simplification and contrasted that goal with the document whose effect is that, on a five-year debenture involving a partnership or a company, 1,826 separate calculations may be required in computing the daily internal rate of return.

         Firstly, I thank the Treasury officers for their very generous offer of a briefing on the paper. This may be necessary, given that Senator Cook's answer clearly avoided the central issues to which my question was directed—the increased compliance costs to corporations and the stark contrast of this document in the face of the promises of simplification of taxation laws. To bring in during question time a calculator with an internal rate of return button and wave it around as the simple answer to my question is to trivialise and attempt to simplify a matter of concern to many corporate taxpayers, particularly those who have thousands of transactions a month and have hundreds of investment products.

         The press of a button will not, I am sure, be sufficient documentation for the tax office in a tax return. It will require a spreadsheet, for example, to justify Senator Cook's calculation. Under the circumstances, particularly on a discounted security on maturity, it may well run to 14 or 15 pages of spreadsheet.

         Senator Cook's gesture also showed that he was unwilling to do the calculations involved in answering my question. This makes his trivialisation a major concern. Clearly, this is a further demonstration that quite frequently the Australian Public Service is not aware of the consequences of so many of its proposals. This gap, unfortunately, is one that is manifested, I believe, in the taxation of financial arrangements.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator Cook's answer unjustifiably downplayed the increased compliance costs using the compound accrual system. The daily compounding rate is not usually used by companies in calculating the spread of income or expenditure associated with financial transactions. To require companies to return their financial transactions using the daily compound accrual rate, therefore, will increase their compliance costs quite substantially. Naturally, compliance costs in the first year will be greater than those in latter years because the first year costs will include one-off items such as increased software, hardware upgrade and replacement and design costs.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In his answer Senator Cook also said that a company or partnership having to calculate the daily internal rate of return could use a standard calculator but that some further adjustment to this figure may be necessary depending on such factors as irregular spacing of coupon payments and the degree of precision required. Has he consulted with the Taxation Office on the degree of precision required? Was his calculator waving exercise a government assurance that the Taxation Office would accept a calculation based on a simple financial calculator? Let me also point out to Senator Cook that the consultative document, unlike his answer, concedes frequently throughout the publication:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . reflecting the economic substance of complex arrangements is likely to mean that some complexity in the law will be unavoidable.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is beyond my comprehension how time and time again this government can say that we are going to simplify the tax legislation and time and again seek to add more pages to an already complex tax system. The consultative document in itself is about 160 pages long, and I guess the legislation to implement the proposal would be at least as long as that, if not longer. The parliament has currently before it yet another example of the further complication of tax laws. The government added to its amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993 a number of other amendments, particularly in relation to superannuation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator Cook is right in saying that the straight-line method will involve one simple calculation. However, he misled us all by implying that many taxpayers could use the straight-line method. The document proposes that the accruals tax system will not cover financial transactions of natural persons except where there is an opportunity for significant tax referral. Even that exemption is qualified. The exemption will not apply if the taxpayer's holdings of financial arrangements exceed a specified minimum value threshold of $500,000. This will catch many small business transactions.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I concede that the document does state that if the straight-line system basically produces the same result as the daily pending accruals system, that sum can be used. But I wish to point out that a calculation will still be required to determine if both systems produce approximately equal results. So either way both methods still have to be calculated, which is quite time consuming, and under taxation law there has to be documentary proof to show those calculations—it could be a simple calculation that runs to something like 14 to 15 pages on a computer spreadsheet. My question was specifically aimed at partnerships and corporations, and the document says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . to reduce compliance difficulties in respect of relatively small and unsophisticated financial dealings, consideration will be given to the feasibility of extending to business the threshold that will apply to natural persons but subject to similar conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will now turn more generally to the taxation of financial arrangements. Does the government think that it has in fact made out a case for compound accrual accounting in any circumstances? I hope that Senator Sherry will be able to answer that. If he is unable to answer it, I believe that this matter should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration so we can get an answer. This is the matter that I put down for report earlier today. I do not believe that a case has been made out; in fact, there was no attempt to make out a case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Taxation Office's attitude appears to be that the implementation of this document is a foregone conclusion. But is this not a so-called pre-consultative document? Hence, there is all the more reason for Senate overview. I remind the Senate that the Coles Myer decision highlights the need to clarify the law in relation to this matter. The High Court in that case adopted a straight-line basis rather than a compound accrual basis. The problems that I have referred to here with respect to the application of the accrual system to debentures is equally applicable to foreign exchange gains and losses. This fact was highlighted by a letter written to the editor by Mr Robin Speed, which appeared in yesterday's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         , in which he states:

        If he purchases (equipment) under the proposed accruals tax system he will be taxed on any currency movement between the date of the order and year end, regardless of the fact that he has not received machinery let alone paid for it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, the compound accrual system will adversely affect a company that goes into insolvency before the financial transaction is complete. In that circumstance the company will not be able to recover the tax paid on the transaction at all, because we do not have such a system of recovery. Senator Cook's answer should be viewed as something of an embarrassment to the Treasurer's office. It clearly sought to trivialise a matter which warrants much more thought than he obviously gave it. Therefore, I would like to see Senator Cook waving a calculator at the tax office and claiming that his calculator justifies a figure in a tax return. I believe it would not.

          Honourable senators will recall that the other night I spoke about the nature of this mechanism. The government allocated $76 million—not of new money, but of money clawed back from universities—for redistribution in a most inequitable and unfair way. It has taken $76 million away from the 37 universities and given 65 per cent of it back to the top nine universities. The newer universities in particular, which need nurturing and encouragement, have actually been discriminated against, with the bias being towards the older, larger and—the most important point—better-endowed universities.

          It is amazing that this Labor government that speaks about equity has set up a system in higher education where the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. Probably the greatest tragedy of this process is the way in which the government allocates the money. It uses a totally unfair system. Honourable senators should remember that this is supposed to be a quality assurance mechanism, but only 40 per cent of the factors dealt with excellence. The other 60 per cent actually dealt with the process; in other words, whether universities had quality assurance mechanisms in place. It was not about quality; it was whether they had the mechanisms in place. It was all about how successfully they could fill out forms and how prepared they were to jump through bureaucratic hoops.

          The most ludicrous outcome of all was that the world-ranking University of Sydney achieved second ranking.

Everyone realises that the whole situation was ludicrous and that the University of Sydney is by far ahead of a number of the other universities in level one. The silly nature of what the government has done is demonstrated by the fact that it ranked the University of Sydney second.

The Senate will remember that two years ago we had very serious concerns about the invasion of autonomy of the universities. At that time the government proposed to take the John Curtin medical school from the ANU and to administer it through the department of health. Following that, the administration of the John Curtin school became very complex. At a dinner I attended at the ANU two weeks ago it was said that all the problems that were created by this separate mechanism are still there and that what they would dearly love is for the whole thing to come back under DEET.

          The funding is separate and therefore, when this quality assurance mechanism came about, the world-ranking John Curtin medical school certainly contributed to the assessment of the ANU as a first-class institution. The rub was that, having been part of the contribution to that, when the funding came back to the ANU there was nothing for the John Curtin medical school because it was administered through the department of health. Not only did the school lose, but the whole university lost because the amount of funding it got in total out of quality assurance was reduced proportionately.

         —I wish to refer tonight to the national parliament of Turkey and to the detention of some Kurdish members of the parliament this month. I have heard today that they are no longer detained and that their detention was to ask questions of them. But whenever in any country there is the apparent arrest or detention of members of parliament, and in particular when there are charges that may carry the death penalty, all members of parliaments around the world should be concerned. Senator Childs spoke about this matter in the adjournment debate two nights ago. I fundamentally disagree with his assessment of the situation that he described. Tonight I wish to set out where I differ from him.

         In his speech Senator Childs indicated that he was calling upon all senators to join with him `in calling on the Turkish government to immediately grant these members of parliament the rights and entitlements that they should enjoy'. On the face of it, those words seem innocent enough, but the petition that was circulated in the Senate at question time yesterday addressed these words to the Prime Minister of Turkey:

        The decision to lift the parliamentary immunity of the MPs as a result of expressing their opinions in order to fulfil their duties to their constituents causes deep anxiety and bewilderment to us. This will not make the solution of political problems easier. The Members of Parliament, as accepted universally are the representatives of their constituents. Hence any action taken against them is against the political rights of their constituents.

        We strongly call for the return of the parliamentary immunity of the Turkish Grand National Assembly members. Without this immunity Turkey lacks conditions where political parties can perform their activities in a democratic environment.

        When I read those words yesterday following Senator Childs's speech the night before, I immediately decided that I could not sign such a petition to the Turkish government because it was only half right at best; it was misleading; and it failed to give any account to a number of factors that I believe should be understood when we are making an address to a foreign government.

         In particular, I have five reasons why I would not urge senators to sign this controversial petition. First, the wording of the petition is derived from a lobby group within Australia. The structure and the words of the petition are not those of parliamentarians, but have the style of a lobbyist. There is an apparent logic about duty and about constituents and about rights, but that logic is superficial and misleading.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second reason is that I believe Senator Childs's assessment of the situation with regard to Kurdish terrorism within Turkey, as he has set out in his speech, misses the point and is not reliable. In particular he has not consulted the Turkish embassy here in Canberra to check the claims of those who have lobbied him. I had mentioned to Senator Childs that I would be speaking in this way this evening, but he must have another appointment as I see that he is not present in the chamber.

After the facts had been checked, then we could make claims or urge senators to action within the Australian parliament.

         In the last five years Turkey has become a close ally of Australia in many ways. There is a growing relationship—not only an economic relationship; an area of political understanding—and an alliance in a number of fields. I note, for example, the visit by the foreign minister of Turkey to this city earlier this month, which was a real success. It was hosted by the foreign minister of Australia, in the company of many members of the parliament from all parties.

         —I thank the Senate. The third reason why I would not sign the words in the petition is that it does not refer at all to Kurdish terrorism or to the secessionist war carried out by a small minority of Turkish citizens. The Kurds represent about 10 million of the total population of about 60 million in Turkey, but the great majority of the 10 million are living in the industrialised western part of Turkey. Only a minority of Kurds live in the south-east, and only a minority of them are represented in part by the Kurdish Workers Party, the PKK, which is waging a violent secessionist war in which there have been thousands of deaths. The failure to refer to that context, I believe, disqualifies the petition in its present form.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I also note a fourth reason for not signing the petition is that the seven Kurdish MPs who, it appears, were detained this month have been charged with acts of crime such as inciting to kill. One MP is charged with having given shelter to a PKK terrorist in his own house. The eighth MP is charged with defaming modern Turkey's founder, Ataturk, which is specifically prohibited by Turkish law. Such crimes are cited as grounds for the parliament to invoke articles 83, 84 and 85 of the Turkish constitution following a defined examination of the MPs by a parliamentary committee. MPs do retain their status during any trial. Any verdict is appealable from the State Security Court to the High Court of Appeals. Nothing of this legal context is reflected in the circulated petition.

         A fifth and final reason I draw the attention of honourable senators to is that, whilst it is always difficult to make international comparisons, the assessment of PKK secessionist terrorism in Turkey must bear some comparison with the IRA in the United Kingdom, the Tibetan splittists in China, the militant fundamentalists in Egypt, the recent parliamentary insurrection against the Russian government and other examples. It would be generally naive and unsound to encourage Australian parliamentarians to sign inadequate petitions that appear to signal support for one of the contending sides.

         However, Australian parliamentarians can only be concerned that it does appear that eight members of parliament in Turkey have been detained this month. I understand that two were almost immediately released and, as I have said, today's news is that all of them appear to be no longer in detention. It is also of concern that the parliament of Turkey appears to have voted, following constitutional procedures, to lift normal parliamentary immunity in respect of these eight MPs.

         I conclude by suggesting that the appropriate response would be to write to the ambassador for Turkey here in Australia in order to express our concern, to ask for an explanation, to request international observers at any trial and to insist on full accountability for the safety and fair trial of these parliamentarians. I now incorporate the document to which I referred earlier.

         1. Senator Childs is arguing that the deputies have had their parliamentary immunity lifted as a result of expressing their opinions in order to fulfil their duties to their constituents. This is totally wrong. The immunities are lifted because the MP's in question are accused of acts which constitute crimes with respect to laws in Turkey, such as inciting to kill, protect terrorist criminals and acts directed to the secular foundation of the State. 7 MP's have expressed views which were provoking terror and violence. The MP's openly supported the acts of terror and violence of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which is recognised as a terrorist organisation by many countries including Australia.

         On the other hand, this argument of Senator Childs ignores the fact that the constituents of these deputies which dwell in the southeast of Turkey are intimidated by the terrorist tactics of the PKK which are very similar to those employed by Pol-Pot in the past. In fact, the terrorist organisation PKK since 1984 has claimed mostly civilian 10,000 lives including Kurdish babies and women in this southeastern part of Turkey by engaging in cross-border operations from their sanctuaries in the neighbouring countries.

         It should also be kept in mind that in countries ruled by democracy, the lifting of Parliamentary  immunity is as much a constitutional right as is Parliamentary immunity. The immunity of Parliamentarians in France, for example, is limited to the sessions of Parliament. Apart from these periods French parliamentarians carry penal responsibility. In fact, on 7 December 1993, the immunity of the deputy of the Socialist Party from Bouches de Rhone, Bernard Tapie was lifted by the Parliament following the report of the Parliamentary Commission and the initiation of a suit by the Public Prosecutor on charges of financial corruption. Tapie is the 5th parliamentarian whose immunity has been lifted since 1958. In Germany, the immunities of 12 parliamentarians have been lifted since 1990.

         2. The argument that the European Parliament has formally criticised Turkish Government. The decision of the European Parliament is based on lack of information as well as misinformation. The decision to lift the immunities was reached as the result of the voting by the representatives of the Turkish nation at the Turkish Grand National Assembly (TGNA) in accordance with article 14 of the Turkish Constitution which stipulates the conditions under which basic rights and freedoms may be restricted.

         Therefore, the waiving of the immunity is an act of the legislative and not of the executive organs. In accordance with the principle of separation of powers, the executive organ has no say in this matter. In fact, the TGNA, in an effort to protect its respectability and credibility, asked the judiciary to render a verdict concerning the grave accusations directed at the deputies. With its decision the TGNA has only made it possible for the judiciary to take action. It will be the independent judicial organs that will give verdict on grave accusations. The decision of the TGNA allows commencement of the legal procedure.

         The Turkish Parliament has acted scrupulously in full awareness of its great responsibility in taking its decision.

         3. The argument that seven of these members of Parliament have campaigned for greater autonomy for Kurds in Turkey and the eighth has criticised the secular nature of the modern Turkish State ignores the fact that the accusations made by the TGNA against the deputies involve offences related to territorial integrity and the basic principles of the Sate, such as secularism as well as offences in the form of expression with the potential to acquire the form of actions such as to incite to commit crime through propaganda or give encouragement for crime. No freedom is unlimited. The European Convention on Human Rights foresees the limitation by law of the freedom of thought and expression for the sake of national security, territorial integrity and public safety.

         A parliamentarian cannot be expected to fulfil his/her duties under serious accusations. For this reason, the parliamentarians in question have been given an opportunity to prove themselves innocent through judiciary means. This was, in fact, necessary to enable the said parliamentarians as well as the Grand National Assembly to carry out their tasks effectively. This was also necessary for the people not to lose their belief in democracy and in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.

         4. The argument that these parliamentarians will be charged under article 125 of the anti-terror law: First of all, the article in question is not an article of the anti-terror law. It is an article of the Turkish Penal Code which deals with actions against the indivisibility of the State and nation. Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code itself is based on article 14 of the Turkish Constitution which stipulates that the basic rights and freedoms as indicated in the Constitution cannot be used against the integrity of the state and endanger its very existence.

         In fact, article 14 of the Turkish Constitution, like the constitutions of all civilised countries, reflect the universal principles included in the European Convention as explained above. The same Convention states that nothing in the said Convention may be interpreted as implying a freedom to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms stated. The Constitution of Federal Germany, for example, contains similar provision and the German Penal Code, in its articles 81 and 82, sanctions imprisonment ranging between 10 years and life for such crimes under the heading "Treason against the federal state." Furthermore the European Convention of Human Rights also makes clear distinction between the freedom of thought and freedom of expression, codifying that states may take necessary measures to prevent the abuse of the freedom of thought, as well as to protect the state against separatism.

         5. The argument that the death penalty will be requested is an oversimplification of the legal proceedings stated in the laws and the Constitution of Turkey. Indeed the violation of the State's territorial integrity involves the death penalty as the maximum penalty for those who are charged with this crime. Penalties, however, will be considerably reduced if no act within the meaning of article 125 is accomplished and if this act remains in the form of provocation or incitement. On the other hand, all acts and actions of the administration are subject to judicial appeal and review.

         6. The argument that the 7 Kurdish Parliamentarians represent a large minority 10 million people is wrong. The deputies in question elected from the south eastern provinces of Turkey do not represent the Kurdish origin people but the whole of the nation. In fact, article 80 of the Turkish Constitution stipulates that the MP's do not represent their constituency or their electors but the whole of the Turkish nation. Moreover, large number of the Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin live in the western provinces of Turkey. In fact Istanbul today is the province with the largest number of Kurdish origin people living in Turkey. In addition, in the parliament almost 150 MP's are of Kurdish origin. Many Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin occupy prominent positions in all areas of public life. We have had even ministers and prime ministers of Kurdish origins.

         7. The argument that since 1984 many of those died in the conflict between the Turkish military and Kurdish separatist have been civilians—neglects to mention that the main targets of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party-PKK are the civilians. The civilians who have died in the conflicts, in fact, are the victims of the PKK. The aim of the PKK is to intimidate the local population through employing terrorist tactics and thereby gain some degree of ostensible support. As a result of PKK's terrorist attacks since 1984 more than 3000 civilians have lost their lives and the majority of these are of Kurdish origin. The PKK also in an effort to deter the Turkish Government from bringing social and economic services to the region, attacks hospitals, trains, buses, touristic installations, development projects. In fact, the PKK is the greatest perpetrator of human rights. It is, therefore, basic duty of the government to guarantee the protection of its citizens lives and property against the PKK terror organisation.

In Townsville, where I have one of my offices, the Liberal Party has an excellent mayoral candidate in Barbara Hymus—a 40-year-old business woman and mother of five—and a complete Liberal team. This team includes the three incumbent Liberal councillors, Peter Lindsay, Jim Cathcart and John Francis, and seven motivated, community minded citizens who are running as candidates for the balance of the 10 wards.

         While Barbara Hymus and her Liberal team have been dealing with the issues that affect the people of Townsville, the Labor Party, running true to form, has been resorting to its normal dirty tricks campaign. It started a couple of weeks ago with the Labor mayor spending a whole day peddling the false beat up that the Liberals would be running as Independents. Legal advice from a leading Queensland QC has confirmed that what Mooney was saying is wrong, misleading, and probably defamatory.

No wonder there have been so many raw sewage spills in Townsville recently—the mayor is too busy dreaming up a new lie to help stop his inevitable election loss rather than having time to actually maintain basic ratepayers' services.

         —The Labor Party, of course, is always anxious to save its members from the truth being known about them. As I was saying, as if what he has been doing is not enough, his latest invention is to use blatant untruths and misleading statements in television advertising. He makes absolutely false claims—and if that is not lying, Senator Sherry can correct me—in his advertisements, saying, `The Liberals want you to pay more and more', and that water rates will rise by 70 per cent. They are absolute and unmitigated lies. The Labor council would probably raise rates, if Mayor Mooney's federal mate's—that is, Mr Keating's—track record on tax hikes is anything to go by. The Labor Mayor of Townsville could certainly relate to sports rorts, whiteboard accounting and the sandwich shop fiasco, as it has recently been revealed that his previous campaign received a substantial donation from a company doing developmental work in Townsville to which favours could be given, and the donation was conveniently not accounted for. Mayor Mooney and Mrs Kelly obviously went to the same corrupt accounting school. It is evident that Labor, at all levels of government, cannot be trusted with money. What other sly and underhanded deals has he done that we do not know about?

         The Barbara Hymus Liberal team will keep rates at or below inflation and provide better services and management. It is high time that Mayor Mooney started being accountable and honourable to the Townsville ratepayers. This seems to be a concept that is not understood. For 15 years, the Labor City Council has broken promise after promise in Townsville, just like its federal colleague Paul Keating.

         Year after year, we have heard the Labor Party say that Magnetic Quays would be completed, yet there is still a huge hole in the ground on Magnetic Island, almost as big as one of Tony Mooney's exaggerations and untruths. Now—surprise, surprise, just before the election—they are promising that they can almost guarantee that they think that maybe they have a developer lined up to complete Magnetic Quays.

         The Townsville people are not stupid, although Mayor Mooney treats them as such. They are sick and tired of Labor's negative campaign of distortion and sick and tired of Labor's lies. Mayor Mooney has ignored and neglected the basic services people need. As such, there is now a major sewerage problem in Townsville. Raw sewage is flowing into Ross Creek, onto the Strand and into the ocean. The beach has been closed and people have been instructed not to swim in the ocean. Crime has sky-rocketed, with a wave of burglaries, bashings and vandalism. It is so bad in Townsville at the moment that army personnel have been advised not to walk in the mall at night. If diggers cannot walk down the street in safety, what type of place is it? This man Mooney is clearly out of touch with crime in Townsville, as he dismisses it and says it is not true.

         Mayor Mooney has taken the people of Townsville for granted and will soon pay for his disregard. The simple fact is that Tony Mooney cannot tell the truth and is not fit to be a mayor. The Liberals are cleaning up the mess Labor has caused in five states. Soon, Barbara Hymus and her Liberal team will be doing the same in Townsville, North Queensland.

In the latter case, prices also varied according to whether this allowed the house to be re-located elsewhere, such as Emerald, or was being demolished for materials, such as at Beresfield.

        In summary it is AN's policy to dispose of houses in areas where alternative accommodation is available for AN staff. In general, tenants of houses are encouraged and have first option to purchase the house that they occupy. Where an interest is expressed to purchase, a valuation is carried out by a licensed valuer whose valuation is used to arrive at a selling price which reflects the current market rates and the condition of the property.

        (1) Australia has been offered and accepted the role of Partner Country at CeBIT'95, to be held in Hannover, Germany, 8-15 March 1995. Austrade sees the Partner Country status as a uniquely valuable opportunity to promote Australian Information Technology and Telecommunications capability on a global stage.

        (2) CeBIT is one of the world's largest trade fairs, and is by far the largest trade event for the Information Technology or the Telecommunications industries, as well as the most comprehensive in terms of the range of products covered. CeBIT'95 is expected to attract over 600,000 visitors from 100 countries, some 6,000 exhibitors from 50 countries, and 7,000 journalists. CeBIT has grown every year since it was started in 1986, and has become a global event with 100,000 visitors from outside Germany and 35,000 from the Asia Pacific region.

        (3) The cost of participation in CeBIT'95 is currently estimated at $A2.2 million. The Austrade Board has allocated $1,050,000 to Austrade's "InTelligent Australia" promotion at CeBIT. Austrade expects to receive financial contributions from the governments of NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, ACT together with space rental contributions from individual company exhibitors, and sponsorships.

        (4) In the short term, Austrade forecasts—conservatively—that Australian exhibitors will realise at least $150 million in orders resulting from CeBIT'94 and `95 (based on reports from exhibitors from 1986 to 1993). More importantly, CeBIT'95 should result in at least 50 leading-edge Australian IT companies being permanently established in overseas markets, through subsidiaries, joint ventures, distributors, or strategic partners. In the longer term, CeBIT'95 and the promotions, market research, planning and export activities that  precede and follow it, will help energise the Australian IT industry and help focus it on the international markets where it is competitive. Austrade's ultimate objective is to dramatically and permanently raise world-wide awareness of Australia as a source of technological excellence and a business and investment destination.
