         —Yesterday I did have the opportunity to address a forum of US pension fund managers whose investment funds collectively total something like $US4 trillion, so it was a group worth speaking to! In response to a question from some of them, I delivered a pretty simple and not at all subtle message about Australian tariff policy compared with the tariff policy of other countries, including the country from which they came. I am sure that all the professional fund managers in the audience fully understood the very clear message that I was giving them, but it does seem unfortunate that at least one journalist present did not understand it.

         Let me make it clear in perhaps shorter and simpler words in case he or she wishes to correct his or her perception, because the words that I used, I thought, were clear and had a clear and unequivocal message. Those words do not change in any way the position of the government on this issue, which has been articulated by my predecessors, nor do they change in any way government policy on this matter. The government's policy is that it remains committed to lowering Australia's general tariff rate to five per cent by 1996. The policy that we had already developed and implemented put us in a very strong position in the tariff negotiations around the Uruguay Round and was part of and a contributor to—I do not want to exaggerate the extent of the contribution—achieving tariff cuts of more than 50 per cent from our major trading partners. This provides enormous potential benefits for Australia.

         Although there are very big benefits to our primary industry sector from the Uruguay Round—for example, in the area of coal—it is also true to say there are big benefits for the manufacturing sector as a result of the major cuts in tariffs that were achieved. Australia is one of the few countries which is not having to make further adjustments to accommodate the requirements of the Uruguay Round, as our trading partners are, and from which we will benefit.

It is not an issue about which we have any intention, or feel under the slightest pressure, to move any further in terms of the reasonable response to the requirements of the Uruguay Round or the activities of our trading partners; and unless and until we get to a situation where the international community catches up with the position we have achieved, there is no likelihood we will go further.

         The only way anything could possibly have been interpreted as a qualification of what I thought was a very straightforward position—and what I thought was very clear, and I think as reported is clear, but for some reason the interpretation in the newspaper is not—was that if in some unforeseeable future circumstance in the next round of multilateral negotiations the whole trade debate has moved on to new parameters, that is something Australia will need to look at then.

As Senator Panizza knows full well, the wheat industry, along with dairying, beef and a number of other primary industries, is looking far more positive at the moment in terms of both the harvest and markets than it has for some significant time. I am in the happy position of being able to tell Senator Panizza something which, as one of many primary producers who are active members of the coalition in parliament today, he already knows, and that is that prospects for the wheat industry generally are looking positive.

         The report deals with relations with industry, the public and government agencies. The broad themes of the report are: the need for Customs to establish closer links with industry in Australia; the value of good public administration; and the better use of technology. I have already announced that I have accepted the broad thrust of the report, which can be best summed up as trying to achieve a cultural change in the operation of Customs. That would be well recognised by members on both sides of the parliament who have been involved with such issues as the Midford report. All of those reports dealt with the need for a change in the culture of Customs, its style of operation and how it relates to the community.

         —On Friday, 4 February the Security Council, in resolution 897, did adopt a resolution authorising a reduction in UNOSOM force levels to no more than 22,000 personnel. That is a reduction from the some 28,000 that have been there during the course of the UNOSOM operation. It does represent a significant draw down. I add that it may well be in practice that the draw down will be to rather fewer numbers than that, perhaps in the order of 16,000 rather than the 22,000 that is here provided for. In keeping with this reduced capacity, the resolution limits UNOSOM's security mandate to protecting major ports, airports and essential infrastructure, and safeguarding lines of communication for relief and reconstruction activities.

         The resolution abandons further attempts by UNOSOM to forcibly disarm the Somali factions, although there is still a retention of a chapter VII enforcement mandate as well as a chapter VI mandate to cope with the reality that if the UN forces are put under military pressure, they may well need to respond in a way that goes beyond just a simple chapter VI self-defence. That lesson has been learned in the initial UNOSOM operation, and it has been retained here in that form.

         I think it is a fair judgment that the UN resolution is at least partly a response to some of the financial pressure that is being experienced by the UN at the moment. Probably more than that, however, it is a response by donor countries to the perception that there is simply no necessity—or strong case any longer to be made—for a very strong, active, aggressive military presence to be sustained in Somalia on the scale that was there in the earlier stages of the UNOSOM operations.

         However, there is a question that does arise, particularly if the draw down is of the order of 15,000 or 16,000 rather than 22,000, as to whether the UN will have a sufficiently substantial presence in enough parts of the country other than Mogadishu, Kismayu and Baidoa—and two or three other areas of that kind—to be able to effectively perform its function. That is something that we have a pretty close interest in with Australian personnel still in the country and, as a result, we will be watching it very closely.

         One of the useful things about the resolution last week is that it does emphasise the need for the Somalis themselves to assume the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process. It underlines the importance to that political process of developing the fragile Somali police, judicial and penal systems, all of which are very important to the recreation of some kind of viable governmental infrastructure for the country. So I think the resolution is positive and forward looking in those ways. Moreover, it reaffirms quite explicitly the objective that the mission cease completely by March 1995. It is useful to set an end date in that way.

         As to the financial situation of the UN, 15 major contributors to the UN had amounts totalling $345 million owing to the regular budget at last count at the end of the year, including contributions outstanding from prior years. The United States, Japan, Germany, the Russian Federation, Italy, Spain, the Ukraine, Brazil and Belgium had amounts outstanding totalling $860 million for peacekeeping contributions.

         It is often speculated that the order of magnitude of the resources needed in Bosnia to do a military job properly on the ground would be between 400,000 and 500,000 personnel. The notion of being able to get there simply by air strikes is not one that has commended itself hitherto, anyway, to those who have been responsible for making judgments about the military outcome in that country.

         The growth of the Landcare movement in Australia is proof in itself of its success. In 1985 there were 75 Landcare groups around Australia. That has grown to 1,900 groups today. Indeed, I am sure that other senators would be familiar, as I am, with the valuable work that is being done by Landcare in their own states. In the  Northern Territory, for example, Landcare is directly involved in the elimination of mimosa pigra from coastal plains. It is involved in the difficult question of the supply of water to Aboriginal and remote communities in the Northern Territory, rangeland soil degradation and so on, and I am sure many similar projects are being conducted by Landcare elsewhere in Australia.

Last year the federal government provided $12.5 million to fund these groups across Australia. This year the program will again gain support for these projects to at least the same level.

         I have seen the perennial subject raised of establishing national coal boards and so on, but the principal reason behind the downturn in the price is the price that has been set by the Canadian suppliers of coking coal.

I would like to see a partnership between the Commonwealth and the states in tackling these very serious problems. I have said before that we can no longer look upon our industry base as focusing on a local market within our own region or, indeed, the domestic Australian market; we ought to look upon industry policy as focusing on the global marketplace because that is where Australian companies are benchmarking themselves. That is where their market and their measure of competitiveness is. I would hope to bring that approach to industry policy formulation as well and, as I say, continue in the tradition of restructuring and reform that has gone on in this government over the 11 years of office to ensure that our industry remains and becomes more competitive in the world marketplace.

I was even more pleased, indeed slightly stunned, to read that the AMA endorsed the federal government's national women's health policy. Let me read to the Senate the endorsement because it really marks a new era with the AMA:

        It was interesting to note that Brendan Nelson, who launched that paper, made the comment himself—very disparaging of the AMA—that it was very late for the AMA to have a view about women's health policy for the public arena. He said that 1994 was a very late year for this to happen. I was pleased to remind Brendan Nelson that 1994 is the centenary of the women's vote in South Australia, which I think means the AMA is about 100 years behind.

This government has had a far reaching commitment to women's health, and included in that was its promise at the last election to establish the first ever specific to women longitudinal study in women's health research.

         Today I have announced the advisory committee that will advise me on the design of that longitudinal study. It is the first ever, and I think we have a great opportunity to put in place very significant new research for Australian women. It is very important to note that that committee will be chaired by Dr Heather Mitchell, the Medical Director of the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry and the Victorian Breast Screening Program Registry. The committee, including representation from the nursing profession, from the Public Health Association, from the Consumer Health Forum and from the public health area, will be addressing questions such as deficiencies or gaps in current research and data, any gender bias in research allocation and the health implications in particular to women's social roles. We cannot possibly overlook the status of Aboriginal women's health as well as the health of women from non-English speaking backgrounds.

         I think the time has come for us to have health data and research data about women for women—not the adaptation of data about men. We know that we simply do not have a lot of basic data about women. We also do not have specific women's health data. Studies of men will provide no information about menopause or menstruation and, importantly, studies by men have actually ignored the evidence of women. So I am delighted that we now have established this advisory committee, and this is the first stage in establishing this longitudinal study. The importance of women's health research and women's health data cannot be overstated. Once that data is given to the government, we will be able to make sure our policies are targeted to most appropriately meet the continuing needs of women's health.

I understood there was bipartisan support for that organisation as representing Aboriginal interests. The minister sought advice from ATSIC. The minister has advised that documents from ATSIC provided him with advice and recommendations about this process. Acting on that advice, he made the declaration.

Should Australia be embarrassed by being the only signatory to the London Dumping Convention which will continue to dump industrial waste into the ocean after 1995 in contravention of the ban?

I think that has explained the basis of the government's decision. I am not concerned about the international ramifications of this because the particular extension for two years beyond the phase-out period of 1995 that we are seeking to enable Pasminco to continue to dump industrial waste at sea—as it has been doing for the last 20 years—is one that is provided for within the terms of the London Dumping Convention, of which we are an enthusiastic member.

         The convention enables parties to it to, within a 100-day period expiring on 18 February, make any declaration they wish about limiting the scope of the convention to them. Once such a declaration is made, it is absolutely binding and it cannot be amended so as to upgrade it or extend it in the future. The declaration that we propose to make is one that is quite narrow and finite in scope and operation; namely to extend the period to 1997 rather than meet the objective date of 1995.

         The reason why we sought that extension is that the industrial processes that are presently being developed to enable jarosite not to be produced at all as a waste residue from zinc production are not yet at a stage where we can be confident that the 1995 deadline would be met; in which case the only other alternative—apart from the company going out of business—would be for the company to adopt a landfill operation for some 200,000 tonnes of jarosite a year. This, of course, would raise its own environmental problems about which Tasmanians and others in the environmental movement have been equally upset. There are no easy options. It is either a matter of closing the plant and putting hundreds of people out of work in what is one of Tasmania's major industries, or creating another kind of environmental problem, or continuing for another two years what has been done for the last 20 years, and which has not caused any environmental damage at all.

         The truth of the matter is that, although it is desirable to avoid dumping industrial waste at sea, and although it is desirable to avoid dumping this particular iron compound, jarosite, with its very small amounts of lead, arsenic and cadmium that are associated with it, there is no evidence whatsoever that the dumping that has occurred over the last 20 years has caused any environmental damage at all, given the dispersion of the waste in question that is involved with this kind of dumping process, and the way in which it reduces to levels and amounts and quantities which are not a cause for serious alarm.

         As to other countries: we are only aware at this stage of one other country—Russia—that is likely to seek any kind of similar exemption, and that is not in relation to industrial waste, but radioactive waste. On any view, there is a very substantial difference in character between the kind of industrial waste we are talking about here and the radioactive waste which has generated so much concern from us and from other countries in the South Pacific and elsewhere around the world. It is a purely temporary extension of the dumping that is involved. It is squarely within the terms of the convention. Our position on this is well understood by the other parties to the convention. There is a heap of other problems facing us if we go down any other route but this one. For all these reasons, it is a decision that I think makes a great deal of sense, and I hope it will be understood as such.

         —A few minutes ago I said that over the past few weeks I had been speaking with a wide range of industry groups. One of the common threads in the representations those groups made to me, and indeed expressed very strongly at a recent meeting I had with the National Farmers Federation, was the great importance that all of those groups played in the direct benefits that are accruing to primary industry in Australia through the research and development commitments that this government has made.

         In question time yesterday, Senator Schacht drew the attention of the Senate to a major agreement reached between CSIRO, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and ICI to develop and market two new innovative and environmentally friendly wool processing technologies that will be of great benefit to the wool industry in Australia. The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation is one of 14 R&amp;D corporations within the primary industries portfolio. One of the most substantive achievements of John Kerin when he was minister in this portfolio was establishing that framework of R&amp;D operations.

         The arrangement is that the RDCs promote industry research by acting as a medium between the research providers and the industries which benefit from that research. The dollar for dollar funding arrangement between the government and industries across the sector has brought about a tripling of industry investment in R&amp;D from $31 million in 1985 to $93 million this year.

         Last Friday, I met with the chairs and chief executives of the 14 research development corporations and the five research councils to gain their impressions of the value of this mechanism. Whilst acknowledging scope for fine-tuning, they believed that the model was a source of advantage against our international competitors. It was described to me as being unique in the world in R&amp;D and primary industry. They also identified substantial benefits flowing from the research they had commissioned, and one particular survey of projects revealed benefit cost ratios of over 10 to one. I indicated at the meeting my keen interest in promoting research as a means of ensuring Australia fully exploits the emerging opportunities in international food and fibre markets. The RDCs can facilitate this process by gathering the best possible market intelligence to anticipate changing customer demands and tailoring their research programs to ensure that Australian rural industry can meet those demands.

         —Yesterday Senator Vanstone asked me a question in several parts regarding the Australian Federal Police investigation into matters involving the Hon. Alan Griffiths MP.

        Answer:The AFP response to solicitors for Mr Griffiths at the time was, and remains, that the AFP would prefer that any such actions not commence while there were further police enquiries to be conducted, but that AFP could not prevent commencement of civil action if they so desired.

        Answer:The commencement of civil proceedings concurrent with criminal investigations frequently arises during AFP investigations, particularly where compensation or reparation may be in issue.

The office of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has asked me to reiterate to the Senate those details which I outlined last week concerning the minister's knowledge of—and actions arising from—this matter. As the Senate will be aware, there has been a reference of the matter to the Australian Federal Police, an examination of the legislation, and a report from Telstra to the minister. I also remind the Senate that Austel has an ongoing investigation of these complaints. More to the point, I reiterate that which I said last week, which is that it would be inappropriate to make any further comments on details of the allegations while the matter is before the Federal Police. Therefore, neither the minister nor I will be giving specific details or responding to individual allegations as they arise.

         On the first question, the government had previously indicated that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was likely to be placed in Sydney because of its relative centrality compared with other capital cities. It was envisaged that a large part of the tribunal's business would be dealt with by correspondence in order to reduce to a minimum the cost involved in tribunal procedures. Although centrality is an important issue, it is not the only basis for determining the tribunal's location.

        I am interested to read from page 29 of the report by the Conroy committee, entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Review of the Australian Customs Service
        </emphasis>
        , where the committee comments upon the Midford report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Customs' response to it. It stated that the committee considered the logic of the proposition that Customs had asserted that it had implemented the Midford recommendations. It states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that implementation of Midford recommendations has not been completed until cultural change in Customs is seen to be well under way. Evidence before the Committee does not indicate this has occurred. That evidence includes discussions with senior officers and others in Customs on the degree of resistance and hostility the Midford case has engendered in the organisation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the Committee's view, Customs' implementation of Midford is far from complete, nor has Customs reported implementation in an accountable and meaningful process.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the light of this report and the press release put out by Senator Schacht today announcing that Mr Kelly, the then Comptroller-General, has in fact resigned but is to be rewarded with a consultancy to DITARD on APEC issues, earlier in the day I wished to ask Senator Schacht why was he making an announcement about Mr Kelly's appointment to DITARD? How much is Mr Kelly to be paid? Why is this man, who presided over the demise of the Australian Customs Service and is found in this report to be wanting, to be rewarded at taxpayers' expense with an appointment to APEC, an area in which he has no demonstrable expertise? Anyone who has listened to the evidence given by him again and again through estimates will see that there is no such expertise.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I am disappointed that I did not get the call earlier in question time to ask that question of Senator Schacht. The fact that this appointment has been made and the fact that Senator Schacht was the one chosen to make the announcement certainly does require answering. If I might say, I think that the report that has been brought down is very much in line with the sentiment of the public accounts committee. Read together, both reports will be most useful documents. The work that has been carried out in both cases will mean that perhaps we will finally get a renamed Customs Service with a different structure of personnel—of course, all the existing positions were to be declared vacant. Yet Mr Kelly, who has stood down, in the minister's terms—and quite properly so—is to be rewarded in this way.

         To say that that is going to make a lot of people very angry would be an understatement. The good people who were in the Customs Service and the many people who found the Customs Service wanting in so many ways are going to find the reward of Mr Kelly very hard to stomach. I think we do need to know why the minister is making the announcement of the appointment. How much is Mr Kelly being paid? Why is he being rewarded when he has presided over the demise of the Customs Service? Where is the apparent expertise that he has in this particular area?

These concerns include: the general quality of the performance by the Anti-Dumping Authority in administering the anti-dumping provisions; the time taken to see a complaint dealt with and brought to the stage where a countervailing duty may be imposed; the need for a more coherent relationship between Australian industry and the agencies administering these laws; and the difficulties experienced by customs, especially Australian customs representatives, when conducting anti-dumping inquiries overseas.

         I have one problem with the way in which the report deals with anti-dumping, and that is with regard to industry concerns—expressed by a range of witnesses—that the anti-dumping provisions should be interpreted by the department and by the authority in such a way that they assist Australian industries to resist the deleterious effect of the dumping of cheap goods. On page 166 of the report, the committee says that the commercial behaviour in industry is very complex. It points out that many products that are being brought in may be used by industry as components, or for resale, and benefit industry if they are cheaper, and therefore the interests of Australian industries are not clear.

         I reject that totally.

This section of the report does no service to the interests of Australian industry and Australian workers. I would like the minister to have another look at that section and clarify the way in which he believes this should be interpreted.

I am very pleased that amongst the first of the recommendations in this report is the abolition of the Australian Customs Service, because `Australian Customs' it might have been, but `service' it certainly has not been. Another recommendation was that the position of Comptroller-General and other senior executive positions be abolished. Today, on the very day that the Comptroller-General, Frank Kelly, resigned because of this damning report on the Customs Service, he has been rewarded with a senior adviser position in the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development.

Ms Christine Goode, who resigned her position, popped up somewhere else in a senior position in the Public Service. It seems that the more incompetent people are, the better their chances are of popping up somewhere else in a good job. Senator Richardson has come back from the dead after the Marshall Islands affair, and now Frank Kelly has been reincarnated in the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development.

When he resigned as Comptroller-General he still was a member of the Public Service. He has not been paid anything extra; he did not have to resign as a member of the Public Service. When he was appointed as an adviser to the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, it did not entail a new pay level; it was his existing pay level, because that is what he is entitled to as a member of the Public Service. He is an adviser to the department under an arrangement reached with the secretary to the department to advise in an area. Whatever honourable senators opposite may say about Mr Kelly and the service over the Midford Paramount affair, in my view, he has a very good record for the work he has done on international issues, harmonisation of customs rules, introducing electronic systems and so on—on which the Australian Customs Service is recognised around the world as one of the best services.

         In an interjection earlier today, Senator Bishop raised the matter of the appointment of Chris Doogan, the present Deputy Comptroller-General, who now holds the position of Acting Comptroller-General—and I emphasise the word `Acting'. I have explained to Mr Doogan that the government will reserve the right to appoint, at an appropriate time, from within or without the service, a chief executive. If we accept the recommendation to abolish the position of Comptroller-General, that will require legislation. One way or the other we have to work out a process for appointing a permanent chief executive. I said to Mr Doogan and other members of the service that they would be eligible to apply for the job at the appropriate time, as will people elsewhere—from within the Commonwealth Public Service and from outside the Public Service.

         I have not accepted any of the individual recommendations of the report as they have not yet had proper consideration. But I accept the thrust of the report—that there has to be a major change of culture in the way the service operates. This morning I explained that to the senior management. If the recommendation with respect to senior management is adopted, its 36 positions would go down to 28 and they would all be openly spilt and filled through open competition. As honourable senators can imagine, that created some concern.

I have said that today to several hundred members of the service and, I must say, I think most of them would welcome the change. I can assure Senator Ferguson that I will continue to work very hard on this report because I think it is very important that we get a very constructive outcome.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Before I make apparent the relevance of my remarks, I think it is pertinent that I deal with the history of this matter in order to inform the Senate of what has transpired. In July 1987 a gentleman by the name of Mr Malcolm Douglas expressed an interest in the lease for a crocodile farm in Broome. From 1987 through to 1992 the matter was the subject of a good deal of negotiation with local Aboriginal people, the Department of Land Administration and the Aboriginal sites department. In June 1992 an agreement was signed by Mr Douglas with the chairperson of the Yawaru Aboriginal Corporation for the development of a crocodile farm.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The then minister for Aboriginal affairs—bearing in mind that was a Labor state government at that time—had indicated his consent to the development provided that the Yawaru people were in agreement. One would have thought that at that stage that would have been the end of the matter, but that was not the case. The Kimberley Land Council commissioned a report which resulted in the reconsideration of the matter from December 1992 until July 1993. It was not until July 1993 that the minister finally gave consent for lease for the crocodile farm provided that certain parts of it were excised so as to take into account certain initiation tracts which the local Aboriginal people used.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At that stage Mr Douglas had expended a great deal of money and time in bringing this development to fruition. Subsequently several applications were made in the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Western Australia. As I understand it, four attempts were made to gain injunctions to stop this development. Those four attempts failed in the courts and, despite the fact that the courts had made a decision that the development should proceed, on 4 February the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, used his powers under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to temporarily halt that development. So we saw a blatant intervention in state affairs by a federal minister, halting something which even the courts said should proceed, which had undergone environmental clearance and which had undergone some six years of negotiations with the Aboriginal people.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The relevance of my supplementary question was that Western Australia had another controversial development regarding the Aboriginal community, namely, the Swan Brewery site. My question to Senator Collins was aimed at knowing whether Carmen Lawrence, previously a state minister for Aboriginal affairs and a state Premier, had asked the then federal minister to exercise his powers to halt that development. I would put to the Senate that that was not the case because the person who was developing the Swan Brewery site was involved in the Multiplex building company and had been responsible for a donation of $692,000 to ALP coffers.

         So we see a very big change in the action taken by the minister. When we have a friend of the ALP developing a site, we do not see the federal minister intervening. But when it comes to a small businessman in Broome attempting to develop a site, we see the full force of the federal government interfering.

         I am advised by Mr Douglas that he employs eight locals. He intends to work with local Aborigines and train them in crocodile farming. But, due to this latest development, his whole undertaking has been called into question financially. He could face great financial loss and the town could lose a possible $500,000 in exports per annum. To me, that is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. Although the courts have decided that this development can go ahead, this federal minister for Aboriginal affairs is going to ride roughshod over the rights of small businessmen and state interests.

       <para>
        In answer to a question from me, Senator McMullan effectively said that he did not know what I was talking about and that he would seek advice from minister Lee. My question related, firstly, to allegations on the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        </emphasis>
        and, secondly, to the contents of an internal Telecom document which was described in today's

         After question time, Senator McMullan came back and said that he had been advised by minister Lee's office that the answer he had given to my question last week still stood. That in fact had nothing to do with either the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          7.30 Report
         </emphasis>
         or this internal Telecom document, the contents of which became publicly known only this morning. Therefore, I have to say that it is a very inauspicious debut by the minister. I would have thought that, at the very least, he would want to contemplate the question that Senator McMullan knew nothing about and come back with a considered answer tomorrow. But, instead, he has rushed in to give an answer which effectively seems to suggest that he has not even paid attention to the subject matter of today's question.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To the extent that he was trying to say that any matters that were raised today are to be treated as having been disclosed by Mr Blount, the managing director of Telecom, to the minister in mid-January, I take that as a matter of some significance. I hope that it is not simply an inference that one is able to draw because of the haste with which the answer was given. I would therefore invite the ministers to make clear in this chamber whether it is being said that the allegation on last night's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          7.30 Report
         </emphasis>
         that almost 700 tapes of phone conversations involving Casualties of Telecom was in fact the subject matter of the discussion between Mr Blount and Mr Lee some three or more weeks ago and, also, whether the internal Telecom document to which I referred was discussed by Mr Blount with Mr Lee.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I would be amazed if the latter were the case because in fact that document was only provided by a source, as it would seem, outraged by the fact that Telecom had purported to comply with a FOI request but had not made this document available. Of course, inspection of this document makes it clear that Mr Dawson's telephone line was being tapped without his consent. That is a crucial document that clearly should have been provided pursuant to the FOI request. To the extent it was not, Telecom has a very serious case to answer.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is the matter that I want answered. I would not have thought that was in any shape or form the subject matter of the discussion between Mr Blount and Mr Lee. If it was, and if we are therefore being told that the matter is being investigated by the Federal Police, maybe we will have to accept that, although I disagree profoundly that that precludes the minister from making any public statement about the propriety or otherwise of Telecom's admitted actions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I do not have any confidence, in view of the haste with which that answer was given, that I can assume that that mid-January discussion did have anything to do with the internal document. So I ask the ministers to reflect further upon my questions, to take them seriously, to give a considered answer and to face up to what I think is a very important proposition—that is, that it is simply not good enough to ask privately that matters be investigated when, if there are admissions of wrongdoing or if there are matters that the minister regards with concern, they ought to be brought to the attention of the public as quickly as possible. Those persons who are adversely affected ought to have those matters confirmed to them, instead of continuing to pretend that somehow nothing has gone wrong and then finding that, day by day, evidence is emerging to the contrary.

         Coal is Australia's biggest single commodity export earner and represents one of the more advanced industries as far as technology is concerned. Ironically, the industrial relations system that rules the coal industry is outdated and inefficient, because it is governed by its own industry specific industrial relations system which operates outside the current mainstream industrial relations arrangements. That is because the Coal Industry Tribunal—a one-man board—which, in conjunction with the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and other lesser tribunals in Queensland and Tasmania—

        You will appreciate that as part of the Government's efforts to make the public sector more efficient it has commercialised many areas of my Department. This has resulted in a significant proportion of the traditional Commonwealth work conducted by DAS businesses being open to competition from the private sector. To a limited degree some DAS businesses have moved into other markets including State and local governments, tertiary institutions, non-profit organisations that are substantially funded by governments and on occasions unions and the private sector. Unions are non-commercial entities and a legitimate part of the DAS market and there is a history of their using DAS services, particularly where their membership includes public sector employees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Guidelines on the performance of non-Commonwealth work have been put in place to ensure DAS businesses' activities in these markets are within understood limits and on an equitable cost basis, without placing undue and unfair constraints on their capacity to compete. The work undertaken by DASFLEET for unions is within these guidelines. All work performed is charged at commercial rates and the rates cover provision for the payment of all relevant Commonwealth and State government taxes, charges and fees. Work undertaken by DASFLEET for unions in the first half of the 1993-94 financial year was less than 0.2% of its total revenue.
       </para>

        I am advised that the unions in Western Australia, including the Transport Workers' Union, lease eight vehicles from DASFLEET.

        Since then, there has been considerable progress in implementing the scheme.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consistent with the government's commitment to a more open and transparent process for the assessment and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, the government released this and the other registration bills as exposure drafts for public comment. Also, briefing sessions were held with the main stakeholders, viz: the states and territories;  the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry; the rural sector; and consumer, public interest and environmental groups.

        I should emphasise, however, that the AGVET code is being introduced without the formal agreement of the states or the Northern Territory. I propose to seek the necessary agreement  before the AGVET code is debated during the 1994 autumn sittings. In this regard, I wish to acknowledge the generous assistance provided by the states and territories in developing the scheme and the draft legislation.

       </para>

        This bill also provides that the whole legislative package will commence on a date agreed to with the states and Northern Territory.

        This bill is to be enacted in the Australian Capital Territory. It has been drafted in complementary adoptive form so that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code (AGVET Code), scheduled to the bill, can be adopted by each state and the Northern Territory. Through this mechanism, evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and related matters, will be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA).

        The AGVET Code focuses on the registration of chemical products, approval of active constituents, and approval of labels.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The over-riding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade and commerce.
       </para>

        The public will be invited to comment in respect of each chemical product containing a new active constituent prior to determination of an application.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards. The public will be invited to nominate chemical products to be considered for inclusion in this formal and systemic review program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, the NRA will be able to review a chemical product at its own initiative. If appropriate, the NRA may suspend or cancel the registration of a registered chemical product.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recognising the cost of additional scientific data when required to support continued chemical registration,  compensation provisions have been introduced which will apply in certain circumstances. The intention is to recognise research and development costs associated with updating data packages when such data may also support other manufacturer's products. The provisions will apply to data specifically requested by the NRA and where that data does not have patent protection. A considerable number of safeguards have been built into the AGVET Code to prevent the commercial abuse of data while ensuring that both the provider of the call-up data and a secondary applicant are treated equitably.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The NRA will be able to control the possession of chemical products. It will be an offence to supply unregistered chemical products or to supply products in contravention of the conditions of their registration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Where a chemical product has been supplied in contravention of the AGVET Code, then the NRA may issue recall notices requiring persons to stop supplying the product and to take action to deal with unsold stock as directed by the NRA.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A system has also been set up under which a person who wishes to do something in respect of a chemical product that would otherwise be an offence, may obtain a permit authorising the action to be done. For example, a person may want to conduct a trial or experiment in relation to an unregistered product in order to decide whether to make an application for approval or registration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To ensure chemical products available to the public comply with the specifications determined by the NRA, this bill provides for the licensing of manufacturers of registered chemical products. The introduction of manufacturing principles is to be phased in over a period of time so as to allow the manufacturing industry time to adjust.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The NRA will have adequate enforcement powers in respect of the AGVET code. Authorised inspectors will monitor compliance with the AGVET code and, if contraventions are suspected to have occurred, to obtain search warrants. In various circumstances inspectors will be empowered, or may be given powers, to enter and search commercial premises and seize things. An inspector may also require the giving of information or the production of documents. The code also provides that any person may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with the code.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To facilitate the NRA being able to seek a wide spectrum of professional advice in respect of its evaluation of chemical products and active constituents, the NRA will be able to release confidential commercial information. However, I emphasise that precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain other information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded. Each person in receipt of confidential commercial information will be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the AGVET code.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to note that there are extensive provisions whereby an applicant can have a decision of the NRA reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), including for example, refusing to grant registration of a chemical product. Before applying to the AAT for a review of decision, an applicant may, if they wish, request the NRA to reconsider the decision at no significant cost to the applicant. If the matter is not resolved, it can be referred to the AAT. These two appeal mechanisms will, I believe, provide a balance between the powers of the NRA and the concerns of applicants.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Transitional provisions have been provided which will ensure a smooth transition of existing arrangements to the new AGVET code.

        This bill, I believe, provides for the efficient and timely registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products.

        Honourable senators will be aware that in deciding to participate in the national registration scheme, the government decided that the full cost of the scheme would be recovered from industry, phased in over a four year period.

The bill identifies how liability for payment of a levy charge will be determined and the amount of levy that will be imposed. Generally speaking liability for the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of chemical products in Australia. In addition the bill allows for the authority to make an assessment as to whether a levy payment is required and the amount of the levy (if any) that is due. It also makes provision for a review process for persons dissatisfied with a levy assessment.

        A new Home Child Care Allowance is to be introduced from September 1994. The Department of Social Security will pay it each fortnight.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Home Child Care Allowance reform consolidates the Government's provisions that assist families with children. It provides more direct recognition of the considerable time, energy and personal support devoted to children by parents, generally mothers, who decide to stay at home to raise their children. For the first time, this support will be provided direct to the parent caring for children, rather than to the other partner as a tax concession.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Allowance will replace the Dependent Spouse Rebate currently available to couples with dependent children and be paid at a higher maximum rate of $60 a fortnight.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        About 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the Dependent Spouse Rebate available to couples with dependent children will receive greater assistance from the new Home Child Care Allowance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new Allowance will also be more responsive to families' needs than the Dependent Spouse Rebate. A parent leaving the workforce at any time during the year to, say, care for dependent children, will be able to claim the Allowance in that year, instead of waiting to re-establish their entitlement in the following year. This flexibility is expected to assist up to 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new Home Child Care Allowance will not be means tested on family income. Dependent partners with children and incomes below $10.85 a fortnight will receive the full $60 a fortnight. Those with income of up to $250 a fortnight will receive part payment. Some 840,000 families in total are expected to receive it at any one time.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Home Child Care Allowance will be tax free and indexed annually. It will be paid until the end of the calendar year in which a dependent child, generally the youngest child, turns 18, or until the child ceases secondary schooling, whichever happens first. It will not be paid where the child is a prescribed student child except where the child is qualified to receive payments under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme. A prescribed student child is a young person who has turned 16 and is qualified to receive payments under a prescribed educational scheme such as AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY. Families will have to meet Family Payment residency qualifications.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Dependent Spouse Rebate for couples without dependent children and the Sole Parent Rebate will remain unchanged. Families that receive the new Allowance will not be eligible for these rebates. Legislation to prevent dual eligibility will be introduced later.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Current taxation arrangements provide for a beneficiary rebate to protect full-year allowees from income tax, but the rebate assumes that for couple allowees, the family receives the full value of the Dependent Spouse Rebate. Abolishing the Dependent Spouse Rebate for couples with children would have left full-year allowee couples with dependent children with a large income tax bill. Currently these couples receive one combined payment. This payment will now be split so that each member of a couple will receive their own payment, with the dependent partner receiving a new Partner Allowance paid directly to them. Each partner will also get a tax rebate so that they don't have to pay tax on their basic allowance. As a result, dependent partners of maximum rate Job Search, Newstart and Sickness Allowances and Special Benefit will generally not be eligible for Home Child Care Allowance as they will receive the maximum rate new Partner Allowance in their own right.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Both the Home Child Care Allowance and the Partner Allowance build on recent family assistance reforms that together will result in over $3 billion of assistance to families being directed to the primary care giver, usually the mother, each year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has a strong commitment to assist families. The initiatives contained in this bill reinforce that commitment and are timely in view of the forthcoming  International Year of the Family.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law to make much needed reforms to the law relating to search, arrest and related matters for the investigation of most Commonwealth offences.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These areas of the law have been the subject of careful examination by the Law Reform Commission in its report `Criminal Investigation' and more recently by the Review of the Commonwealth Criminal Law established by Mr Bowen as Attorney-General and chaired by the Right Honourable Sir Harry Gibbs GCMG, AC, KBE. The Bill closely follows the recommendations made by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law in its Fourth and Fifth Interim Reports.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Review Committee made recommendations to modernise Commonwealth law to ensure that both technological advances are taken into account by these laws and the increased awareness of the need for Parliament to state clearly the balance considered appropriate between the community interests in effective law enforcement and the maintenance of individual rights and freedoms. To date laws in this area have been contained in numerous Commonwealth statutes, State and Territory laws applied by the Judiciary Act, police instructions or general orders and case law. This has lead to a considerable degree of uncertainty and inaccessibility of the law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Indeed, recent public concerns about the Victorian Government's Crimes Amendment Bill highlight the need for this Parliament to make specific provision for laws relating to search, arrest and related matters in the investigation of Commonwealth offences. As the law currently stands, without this legislation, Commonwealth investigators are required to use State powers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All these amendments will not initially supplant all other Commonwealth laws in this area as was envisaged by the Review Committee, those other laws are being carefully examined and brought into line with the provisions proposed in the Bill. It is intended to ensure that other officers, particularly those not subject to the training, discipline and accountability of members of a police force, have no greater powers than police. Until that review is completed, those laws which relate to the investigation of specific offences against Commonwealth law such as customs, quarantine and fisheries offences will continue to operate for police and inspectors appointed under those Acts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill provides for a comprehensive scheme for obtaining and executing search warrants, including telephone warrants, stopping and searching conveyances, arrest and related matters such as personal searches, taking and destroying fingerprints, holding identification parades and other identification procedures. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out any of these procedures and spells out the many safeguards to protect the rights of individuals.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill precludes the issue by lay justices of warrants for search or arrest in relation to Commonwealth offences. Only magistrates and justices of the peace or other persons employed in a court who are authorised to issue search warrants and arrest warrants, as the case may be, will be able to issue such warrants. Further, the Bill recognises 3 different types of search to which a person can be subjected and lays down a clear criteria and procedures for their conduct. Practical difficulties which might otherwise flow from the removal of the power of lay justices to issue warrants are to be met by the introduction of telephone warrants. Easy access to magistrates or court employed justices of the peace is assured by the ability to use telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. The Bill creates a number of new offences in relation to applications for search warrants made by telephone and other electronic means. There is also a general offence, applicable to all warrants, of making a false statement in an application for a warrant.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill prescribes in considerable detail the procedure which a police officer must follow to obtain a search warrant. The intended scope of the warrant must now be clear on its face. For example, if it is contemplated that a warrant obtained to search premises also authorises the search of persons at those premises, the warrant must clearly state this. Furthermore, to prevent the unnecessary execution of warrants on homes at night, the hours during which the warrant may be executed must be specified in the warrant.

         If a police officer applying for a warrant suspects that, in executing the warrant, it will be necessary to use firearms the issuing officer must be told this and the reasons for this suspicion so that he or she can take this into account in deciding whether to issue the warrant. This is particularly directed to situations where, given the nature of the offence and the character of the suspects, it is more likely than not that violence will occur and it is anticipated that special weapons squads will be used. It is not, of course, intended to preclude the use of firearms where this is necessary in the circumstances as they develop when the warrant is being executed.

         Search warrants will authorise the seizing of evidence of the offence to which the warrant relates as well as evidence of any other indictable offence. A warrant to search premises may, at the discretion of the issuing officer, also authorise the search of people at, or near, the premises when the warrant is executed who are suspected of being in possession of evidence or dangerous items. Any person searched must be shown a copy of the warrant.

         The Bill puts beyond doubt the right of police to be assisted by non-police experts. This will be particularly useful when the execution of the warrant involves operating computer equipment to locate evidence of an offence. The Bill permits the operation of equipment so that any incriminating evidence may be secured and retrieved but ensures that appropriate care is exercised to minimise damage to equipment. However, if damage is caused as a result of insufficient care in its operation, compensation may be payable to the owner of the equipment.

        The bill also contains three measures concerning the assessment of managed investments. As all these changes are beneficial to service pensioners with managed investments, it is proposed that they commence from 1 April 1993.
       </para>

        The first clarifies the legislation by ensuring that all losses can be offset against profits from other managed investments.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second ensures that where an investment has been held for less than twelve months and only an interim rate of return has been declared, that rate will be maintained as the annual rate of return. Applying the current provisions, the interim rate of return is extrapolated for twelve months. This can result in a higher rate of return being maintained in the service pension assessment than the actual rate of return over a twelve month period.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The third measure addresses certain friendly society investments. In the current economic climate a number of friendly societies have changed status. Under the Act, a change in the status of a friendly society would affect an investment made with that company. The investment would be considered as "realised" and any profit that has accrued would be maintained in a person's service pension assessment for twelve months. This measure would safeguard these investments by providing that where the conditions of the investment remain substantially the same, the current assessment rules will apply. Profits from the investment will not be assessed until it is "realised" by some other method.

        This bill provides consistency in the arrangements for offsetting compensation payments against disability pension for the same incapacity or death for which compensation is paid. At present, these provisions apply only to disability pensions paid under Part IV of the Act in respect of defence or certain peacekeeping service. The amendment ensures that the offsetting arrangements will also apply to disability pension paid under Part II in respect of war or operational service. These provisions will apply only to payments of compensation made after the date of Royal Assent.

        The bill also clarifies the operation of the tax file number provisions where a person fails to comply with a request for a tax file number. In such instances, the Veterans' Entitlements Act currently directs that the person's pension or allowance is not to be paid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments set out the effect of failing to comply with a request for a tax file number and introduce a generous reconsideration period. It is proposed to give the person three months from the date the pension was last paid to comply with the request for a tax file number and still receive full restitution of the cancelled payment. This would allow the person time to consider the consequences of failing to provide the tax file number. If a person complies with the request after the expiration of the three month period, the pension or allowance will be restored from the payday after compliance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        Another initiative simplifies the current arrangements for withdrawing an application to determine qualifying service or a claim for service pension.

This initiative is consistent with the aim of assisting pensioners in their dealings with the Department by encouraging oral communications.

        The Offshore Constitutional Settlement divided the jurisdiction over the mineral resources of Australia's continental shelf between the Commonwealth and the states.

        Under the Offshore Constitutional Settlement it was agreed that there would be a common offshore mining code that would apply to the whole of Australia's continental shelf beyond the territorial sea baseline proclaimed by the Commonwealth in 1983. This common offshore mining code will be governed by a package of complementary Commonwealth and state offshore minerals legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The revision of the act is a result of the states' dissatisfaction with it and an unwillingness by some states to enact complementary offshore minerals legislation so long as it remained in its present form. They considered that the existing act was not suited to the needs of the offshore minerals industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        In the preparation of the bill the Commonwealth closely consulted the states and in doing so drew on their extensive experience in minerals administration which has been greatly appreciated. The states at the same time confirmed their commitment to a common offshore minerals code.

        As this bill deals with rights associated with minerals exploration and exploitation it ensures that this legislation is consistent with the government's policy in relation to native title. The provisions for the granting of licences are non-discriminatory and administrative procedures, which are already in place, will ensure that aboriginal interests are consulted when considering applications for any of the licences which may be issued under this act. Operators will be required to respect Aboriginal rights and interests.

         This motion concerns the marketing of the disability reform package, an issue I have taken an interest in since the contracts were originally let in mid-1991 for a project with a total value of about $7 million, based on a two-year strategy and to be completed in June 1993. The aim was to inform the community, people with disabilities, doctors and people working with those with disabilities about changes to the disability reform package. The main contractor for the marketing of the disability reform package was a company called Corporate Impacts which was contracted by the Commonwealth to receive $4.95 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Corporate Impacts went into provisional liquidation prior to the completion of the contract. As at the end of last year 130 creditors including people with disabilities and service providers had not been paid. Some of the creditors contend that Corporate Impacts was working under the umbrella of the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth was liable for these debts. That assumption was made because sometimes the employees of the company worked out of Commonwealth offices and used a logo that was also used by departmental officers.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           Sixteen of the network facilitators employed by Corporate Impacts to market the disability reform package were also owed money. When we asked questions in estimates committees, Commonwealth officers contended that the Commonwealth may have been mischarged up to 13,000 head hours at an average of $45 per hour by Corporate Impacts as well as $220,000 by two designated officers to the contract and a significant number of other items, including an undisclosed number and value of deliverables, which at that time had not been obtained by the Commonwealth.

          Upon asking questions at the estimates committee, I discovered that no checks of Corporate Impacts's financial capabilities had been undertaken prior to the letting of the contract. Within a year of the commencement of the contract, two of the three departments on the management committee contended that the contract should be terminated, but no effective action was taken.

          Three departments were involved, and also the Office of Government Information and Advertising, with an officer from that department chairing the committee with three people from the different departments. That committee seemed to change as different representatives came from the different departments. There seemed to be a lot of problems in the way in which this project was managed because it went across three different departments.

          Corporate Impacts was supposedly paid on a monthly basis, but by February 1993 it had received all except $62,000 of the $4.95 million for the total contract and the contract was not supposed to be completed until June 1993. So some explanations are required as to why all but $62,000 was paid out well in advance of when the contract was to end. Despite the ongoing concerns about the contract, Corporate Impacts received a further Commonwealth contract in April 1993—weeks before it applied for voluntary liquidation.

          In the estimates committee a Commonwealth officer expressed concern about the objectivity of the liquidator. One former member of the management committee is taking legal action against the director of Corporate Impacts on the grounds of defamation. It was also claimed in the estimates committee that one of the Commonwealth appointed valuators was threatened with legal action by Corporate Impacts. That has apparently been resolved. Two separate evaluations have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the marketing project.

          While the progress of this contract raises serious concerns, the letting and supervision of it has wider ramifications in exposing major deficiencies in the administration of the Commonwealth's procurement policy. There are questions about the adequacy of current mechanisms used to manage contracts that cross three Commonwealth departments, plus OGIA, and about the adequacy of current procurement guidelines that apply to marketing and advertising contracts as distinct from contracts for materials and goods.

          I pursued this matter across estimates committees. One of the problems was that three departments were involved, so I had to ask questions of those three departments and of the Office of the Government Information and Advertising. That made it extremely difficult to ascertain all the relevant facts because sometimes I would find out one detail from one estimates committee by which time the other estimates committee had finished. It became obvious during the estimates process that that was not the most satisfactory means of obtaining all the information.

          There are also a number of non-government witnesses who may wish to provide evidence to a Senate inquiry about this contract. Again, that avenue is not available through an estimates committee. In addition, a large number of people who may have been mentioned in the estimates committee deserve a right of reply. For all these reasons, I commend this motion to the Senate. I look forward to the support of my colleagues on this side of the house.

          —The referral of issues to the various Senate standing committees is not an easy decision, especially as a larger and larger workload is put onto the shoulders of members of these committees. The Australian Democrats discussed this issue at length, and went through a process of first asking what the issue was: was it an issue of merit? I will not go back over this and argue the merit of the issue. Senator Patterson has done that very well. In this case it is not just a question of the impact on the community—which is very interested in the marketing of the disability reform package—but also a question of the use of government moneys, and exactly how taxpayers' moneys have been spent and where they have gone.

          Beyond the issue we have to look at what other avenues have been tried. As Senator Patterson has just said, the estimates committees have been used extensively. The new system with the estimates committees takes out of this chamber a lot of the work, and possible questioning of ministers. As well as looking at three departments we have to look at what other avenues can be tried.

          Another issue the Democrats had to look at is the actual pressure on these committees. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs is perhaps under more pressure than almost any other committee. On balance, having gone through this process, our answer was, `Yes, this is an issue of merit. It has been pursued through other avenues. Despite the workload on the committee, it is an issue that we believe cannot be let lapse'. Therefore we will be supporting Senator Patterson's motion.

I still fail to understand, after the several opportunities we have had to examine and discuss this matter, what in the main is intended to be the target of this inquiry. One part is obvious and, subject to the point Senator Lees makes about the priority which the committee wants to give to this as against other matters, it is a perfectly understandable matter to inquire into. The question is: has the outcome of this program justified the expenditure in it? I understand that. That is something we should look into with regard to a whole range of our activities.

          If the members of the committee—or a majority—think that is a matter they should look at, I will not quibble, even though I think other things are more important. It is a matter for the people who wish to conduct that inquiry rather than others. But there is a fascination with the process by which the people from Corporate Impacts were selected, and with the message that that might send about, firstly, whether the process itself is proper—and on this occasion whether it was properly conducted—and, secondly, the continually lingering innuendo that someone did something improper in making this choice.

          As with many other decisions when they are examined, it probably does show up—and it has shown up—ways in which some parts of the process of inclusion on the short list might be improved. But there has been nothing to suggest anybody involved has acted in a way that is in the slightest improper. That would seem to be the only thing that would justify the commitment to an inquiry, unless there was a reluctance to provide information. But a vast amount of information was provided to Senator Patterson last year. It covered virtually everything in this notice of motion. This led to lengthy questioning on a previous occasion, and nothing was disclosed that warranted further investigation.

They have been dealt with several times by the estimates committee. I keep hearing all sorts of rumours that somebody was supposed to have made this decision on behalf of a special friend of the government—or something. I do not have the slightest idea what the connection is supposed to be or with whom it is supposed to exist, other than that it may be that one of the people involved stood for preselection for the Labor Party 20 years ago. There is a longer sentence for standing for preselection than there is for murder.

          Alternatively, people may think there is cause for concern about whether the Commonwealth has been properly billed, or perhaps overcharged, for the work that was done; about the bankruptcy of the company concerned; and other such matters.

          It is also proposed that the committee should look at an evaluation of the marketing of the DRP campaign. No-one can object to that. That is an expenditure of the taxpayers' money. The parliament is entitled to look at how effectively the money has been spent. But there has been a formal process of evaluation in the normal course, as all such campaigns of any magnitude are evaluated, and it is not finished. I am advised that the overall evaluation, taking into account several separate research evaluations of different aspects of the campaign, cannot be available for about two months. So the committee is going to charge in with half the information and try to make a decision.

I know Senator Patterson will not say that because she has made up her mind before it has started.

          I have two concerns. The first is that there seems to be a fascination—not just in the Senate, but particularly in the Senate—that in some way inquiries are costless and that we can just go on having inquiries and there is no downside. It may be appropriate to drop some other inquiry off the list—I do not know the committee's full brief—but if it chooses to give this inquiry priority it is the committee's decision. Every time we add an inquiry it takes more public servants' time, it costs more money and it diverts resources. It is called opportunity costs. Each time we do this there is something else on behalf of the taxpayers we cannot do.

There is a never ending repetition of inquiries. Those opposite are entitled to scour wherever they like to try to get up facts but they should not then seek to advocate that in some way they are about lean and efficient government because this is about diverting the government's resources from the primary tasks that the taxpayers provide their money for us to do.

         We will not be supporting the second reading amendment. The wording is too vague to mean anything sensible and the general thrust of the amendment is already clearly stated in the bill. No commercial developments have been allowed which impact adversely in the eyes of those who have the power to stop any such commercial activities. Obviously, there is no development, past or current, under consideration that falls into the category of causing adverse impact which the amendment seeks to deal with. If there was adverse impact in the current proposal or in any past proposal there is plenty of authority and power for existing agencies to prevent that. They have not done that so obviously it has not occurred. It is unlikely to occur because the power is already there and it does not need to be spelt out in this particular second reading amendment.

         The skyrail project has been mentioned in the debate and it obviously has no adverse impact, as I mentioned, otherwise it would not have been approved by the Wet Tropics Management Authority, by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, by the local authorities or by the other agencies which have some interest in this matter. The skyrail project will be a great boost for tourism in Far North Queensland and will also allow ordinary Australians to experience at first hand the beauty and significance of the wet tropics in a manner which will not cause any damage to the rainforest or in any other way adversely impact on the area.

         For the benefit of honourable senators, I will explain what the skyrail project is all about because, from the fairly benighted references made by other speakers, they may well be excused for thinking that the skyrail project will involve clearing and felling huge tracts of forests. The skyrail will run from Smithfield to Kuranda with two stops, one in the national park and the other next to the Barron Falls. Both are in the World Heritage areas.

         The skyrail will consist of six-passenger gondola cabins. It is made of 37 steel towers, 25 of which are in the World Heritage areas. These towers are being installed by helicopter, each into an area of 10 metres by 10 metres. They are up to 40 metres high and are higher than the trees so as to provide a canopy experience for those using the skyrail. The idea of the gondolas and the skyrail project is to allow people to travel over the rainforest rather than through it. The whole development involves a total clearing of less than half a hectare. The CSIRO has stated that the skyrail cableway will allow people to experience the rainforest with less impact than any other means, including walking through the forest.

         For five or six years the skyrail people went through the process of obtaining approvals and getting the right sort of environmental slant on these things.

I can well understand why they would have a vote of no confidence in Mrs Kelly, but it is a vote of no confidence in relation to this matter. Those in the Labor Party are saying, `We don't trust Mrs Kelly to keep out developments that impact adversely'. We know Mrs Kelly has the power to do that but for some reason members of the Labor Party, by agreeing with this amendment, are saying, `We know Mrs Kelly has the power to stop it, but we don't trust her to stop it and, therefore, we are going to agree to this amendment'.

         Regarding the foreshadowed amendments, we can only agree with the government on the Democrats' proposed clause 6A and 5A(2) that it is not appropriate for this parliament to tell the Queensland parliament what it should do. In any case, if we look at the Democrats' proposed clause 6A, we see that it requires the minister to use her best endeavours to have the Queensland government `ensure that any advisory committee established by the Authority under the Queensland Act includes among its members Aboriginal representatives'. That is what the Democrats want us to do.

         With regard to foreshadowed amendment 5A(1), we support the concept that the Wet Tropics Management Authority should have on its board `one or more Aboriginal representatives who have appropriate knowledge of, and experience in, the protection of cultural or natural heritage'. The Liberal and National parties agree with that. We also think there should be an environmentalist on it and someone from local government and someone from the promotional areas around Cairns. We also believe that there should be women and men on it, but we are not going to change the act to make sure that local government is represented or that environmentalists are represented.

It is up to the government to do that today if it wants to. It does not need this bill to appoint Aboriginal persons to that board. I cannot understand why this amendment is necessary. My time has run out. I want to say quite a bit more about the appointment of people to that board, but I will do that in the Committee of the Whole debate.

The facts of the matter—and I must go through them—are that at approximately 4.30 p.m. yesterday someone called Imogen from Senator Woodley's office phoned Amanda from Mrs Gallus's office and said that the Democrats had some amendments to the wet tropics bill which would be `going through the Senate tonight or tomorrow'. Amanda asked what these amendments were, and for them to be faxed to her. At the time I started speaking in the Senate, Mrs Gallus had not received those faxes from Imogen, or whoever it was. After I finished my speech, I found the amendments on my table. We then sought to find out from Mrs Gallus what the whole thing was about. But she still had not received the amendments from the Democrats.

         I have been into this in some detail with Mrs Gallus, so I can refute what I knew Senator Coulter would come up with. It then transpired that we faxed across the material to her.

The Democrats knew that I was dealing with the bill. They had sufficient time to give their amendments to members of the Labor Party to enable them to run upstairs, look through all of them and come to a position. Yet they still did not—

         In my speech in the second reading debate I was indicating that we supported the concept of an Aboriginal representative on the authority board, which the Democrats propose through the inclusion of proposed section 5A.

         We also support—I repeat—the suggestion that there should be a local government representative on that authority board, because the local governments are inextricably involved in the management of these areas and the access to and from them. As well, of course, local authorities are locally elected, democratic organisations which are in the best position to adequately represent the views, concerns and aspirations of the people of the particular area. So it is essential that there be a local government representative on that authority board.

         As well, we believe it is essential that there be someone on that authority board who would mirror the interests of the tourist operators and developers, who have a very great interaction with the wet tropics management area. It is only by having those developers and operators that we can, sensitively and in a controlled and environmentally friendly way, get these areas to a stage where they can be accessible to ordinary Australians—not just those who can wander through them as long as they like and do not have to worry about the normal constraints that ordinary Australian families have. We want to make provision—and the tourist operators do this—for ordinary Australians to have the opportunity to get in and have a look at those rainforests. So we think there should be a representative of those sorts of people on the board.

         We also think that there should be a representative of the environmentalists on that authority board. That is essential. In fact, the government has agreed with that by appointing Dr Aila Keto, a well-known environmentalist, to that authority board. Nothing in the legislation says that she has to be appointed but the government has said that it is sensible, and we agree that it is sensible to have an environmentalist on the board, and so it has appointed her. The situation is similar with local government. There is nothing in the legislation now that says that a local  government person has to be appointed, but we have such an appointee in Councillor Tom Pyne, the Chairman of the Mulgrave Shire Council. He is there because he should be there, and because there should be a representative of local government. But that is not made mandatory in the legislation; it is up to the government to appoint these people, and it has.

         Similarly, it is important, as I mentioned, that there be a promotional person on the board, and the government has agreed with that and appointed someone. But that is not written into the legislation; it is not mandatory. It is for the government to decide and it has decided. And the situation is similar with regard to an Aboriginal person. We believe that such a person should be appointed to the board. It is up to the government to do it. The government now has all the power that it needs to appoint someone. Mrs Kelly can do it if she wants to; and, if she does not want to, perhaps Senator Richardson could tell us why that is the case.

People should not be appointed as Aborigines. They should be appointed as Aboriginal persons who have some real connection with the area. If, as I suspect, there are Aboriginal persons who have the appropriate knowledge of and experience in the protection of cultural and natural heritage and who can work in the broader thrust of preservation, maintenance and enhancement of the wet tropics rainforest, and if such a person would make a contribution at least equal to that of any other person who might be appointed, then that person should be appointed. As I have said, Mrs Kelly has the power to do that now. There is no need for special legislation; the power is already there.

         The amendments proposed by the Democrats come from the leader of the party. It amazes me that the leader of the party could have got it so wrong. She has moved an amendment proposing something already provided for in the bill in order to try to score some cheap political points for a party desperately trying to maintain a constituency on the very left of the political spectrum, and it is doing that in the face of a concerted push for that left wing vote from the Western Australian Greens.

         With regard to the two proposed preambles—one proposed by the Greens and one proposed by the Democrats—I point out to the Senate that clause 3 of the bill, which we have all agreed should be passed, sets out the object of the bill. It clearly sets out the purpose of the legislation. Clause 3 says:

         Senator Kernot might like to get some legal advice on the nature and effect of preambles in legislation. She might find out that the preamble is a statement of intention as an aid to interpretation, but that it is secondary to the specific clauses of the bill. It is in clause 3 that the objects of the bill are given, and they tell us what the legislation is all about. The preamble proposed by the Democrats is contrary to the specific clauses of the bill in that it is contrary to the specific reference made in clause 3. It is, again, fairly typical of the grandstanding of the Democrats—making some political point no matter how irrelevant it is to the serious business before the parliament. Perhaps it is a preamble which the Democrats might want to move to any legislation that comes before this parliament, because it is as relevant to any other legislation as it is to this particular bill.

But, unfortunately, the final three paragraphs also deal with Aboriginal issues and they are not at all relevant to the bill, particularly as the Greens' amendments do not in any way attempt to mention, involve or include Aborigines, leaving that part of the preamble standing completely alone and without relevance to the bill, particularly with respect to the specific provisions of clause 3.

I can remember the Yarrabah community—I have been there—which is within the world heritage area. There are issues relating to the people of Yarrabah, which we have handled over the course of the past five years, regarding their capacity to take timber out for artefacts and for some of their dwellings. We agreed to that some years back. It is an ongoing issue that we will need to handle very carefully. Probably the Democrat amendment handles it a bit better than this one.

Senator Coulter was present in this place when I made my earlier remarks on this subject. World heritage listing is a most controversial thing in Australia. As is well-known to senators, there is this continuing conflict involving the genuine hopes and aspirations of those who care for the environment and would like to see the environment protected and managed in a way that protects what are genuinely world heritage areas for the benefit of future generations, for the value of the amenity to those people who can enjoy it here and now, and for the value of the biodiversity, the flora and fauna and all the other aspects of heritage and environmental protection. These are very genuine hopes and aspirations, and they are good policy objectives when trying to maintain those values.

When world heritage listing is proposed we get this massive conflict with the right wing rednecks going around saying, `Watch out: Canberra will take control of your land', and, `Watch out for the nasty politicians and bureaucrats from Canberra'. The people from Canberra—generally the Australian Labor Party over the past 10 years—say, `Don't worry, we will look after you.

I do not know about those links—I have not studied the Aboriginal heritage in that area, so excuse me for not seeking to be an expert on them—but I am sure that Aboriginals have links which possibly go back to before white settlement.

         The situation is that world heritage recognises, under the world heritage legislation, a number of characteristics in areas which mark those areas off as world heritage. One of those characteristics which mark them off as world heritage is cultural connections. This seems to have been ignored by both Senator Campbell and Senator Macdonald when they say that the recognition of Aboriginal occupation of this area has nothing whatsoever to do with the objects of the act and with the declaration of this particular area as world heritage. It has a great deal to do with this area. The cultural attitudes of Aboriginal people which recognise the need to protect areas, the idea of living with the land, of being part of the land and of being brother and sister to the animals and plants which one finds among many indigenous people lies very much at the core of what Mabo is about. It is about the change in Australian society and about what world heritage is about. So if the honourable senators fail to see that, that is their problem. They are failing to see something which clearly the government, the Greens and the Democrats have recognised.

Heaven help us if the opposition were to form government and opposition ministers were in there if they have the sorts of attitudes that we have heard today in relation to Aboriginal people. I do not think any Aboriginal people or any of their attitudes will be represented whatsoever. I think the notion that one writes this into legislation, that one attempts as far as one can to ensure that these cultural attitudes are represented by having Aboriginal people with the necessary qualifications represented in there, is absolutely essential. So the first amendment we put forward proposes that there be this preamble acknowledging the connection of indigenous people to this area. As Senator Richardson has pointed out, some indigenous people have long-lasting connections with the area and their cultural tradition is an essential part of the world heritage qualities and should be recognised as such.

Here, one needs to reflect on the history of the development of this legislation in relation to management: that, prior to Mabo, an agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth government and the state government; that, prior to Mabo, the Queensland government passed its legislation; but now, post-Mabo, the federal government is passing its legislation and clearly needs to recognise the deficiency—that is what these amendments attempt to do—which potentially lies in there and to fill that necessary gap. Things have moved on since 1990, thank God. Things have moved on since 1993—thank God—with respect to our recognition of the legitimate land claims of Aboriginal people.

         The second and third amendments that we have put forward expand on this and make it the responsibility of the federal minister to ensure, upon consultation with his or her state counterparts and the Aboriginal groups concerned, adequate indigenous representation on the board of the authority and its committees. These amendments are specifically designed to encourage indigenous participation—not to just leave it open so that it may occur at the largess of the minister but that that be clearly identified.

         I accept Senator Macdonald's point in relation to the legal strength of objects which are written as parts of legislation and preambles. But, as he said himself, the preamble is in fact a part to which law courts can look for further explanation and exposition of the purposes and the intent of the legislation. Therefore, it is quite appropriate that that be in there.

         I am aware that a review of Aboriginal involvement in the authority is under way, and it is to be hoped that a memorandum of understanding will be drafted which makes a clear acknowledgment of the heritage and traditional association of indigenous peoples with the area and provides for their active participation in management.

I acknowledged in my speech during the debate on second reading that there has been quite serious mismanagement in relation to world heritage areas and management plans. If we are to have proper understanding and acceptance of world heritage by people with regard to, say, the Nullarbor and Lake Eyre, the government needs to do a lot more to ensure that management plans are put in place early. I think Mrs Gallus is suggesting in a possible amendment that some sort of preliminary management plan would alert people to what governments had in mind. This would be an excellent idea. I have no problem with that at all.

Our amendments go a substantial way towards addressing this. It is desirable that more direct legislative imperatives be put in place to ensure that the interests of Aboriginal peoples are considered.

However, it is our view that these amendments cover those exigencies, and the review may then come back with further suggestions for change. Our amendments ensure that simple legislative safeguards consistent with Commonwealth legislative and constitutional obligations to indigenous people—and these have changed since the Queensland legislation and since the Commonwealth-state agreements—are built into this bill. That is the basis of our strong support for these amendments. I formally urge on the Senate our first amendment which relates to the preamble.

         When the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) was talking about the amendment to the preamble that has just been lost, he said that it was redundant or worse. If it is correct that it is stating the obvious and it is unnecessary to put the context in which this bill is being presented, well and good—as long as it is clearly understood that it is for the protection and preservation of the world's cultural and natural heritage that is present in the wet tropics of Queensland. The Greens felt that it was appropriate to have that initial opening. We also felt that the provision referring to the role of Aboriginal people with regard to their participation in any management of the world heritage area was appropriate. Therefore, it would be very remiss of us not to support the Democrat's motion. Whilst leaving out what the minister has said about obvious and well-placed confidence in the legislation, we will be prepared to support the provision that refers to Aboriginal people.

         In responding to Senator Campbell's concern, the Greens do not feel that it is discriminatory to recognise the role of indigenous people in the care of significant environmental areas with which they have strong spiritual attachment. A lot of adjectives have been thrown around the chamber. It might be of interest to my colleagues to note that often I do not respond to any of these words. The reason why I do not react strongly against them is that, as a psychologist, I am very aware of the principle that whenever accusations are made they often reflect the accuser more accurately than the person who is being accused.

         The Greens and the Democrats have presented slightly different amendments. These have come from requests in the community from slightly different perspectives. In particular, Aboriginal groups have requested the inclusion of a special clause in the preamble. The Democrats are providing such a clause, and we are happy to support it. We believe that it gives recognition and encouragement to Aboriginal participation in the management process. There is agreement rather than competition between the Greens and the Democrats on this count. We will be supporting all of the amendments moved by the Democrats. We would urge the government to reconsider its reluctance to support all of them. I appreciate Senator Ian Macdonald's comments in which he supported in part the underlying meaning of the amendments, if not gaining the opposition's support for them.

         The act is about environment and conservation; it is not about social justice packages for Aborigines. It is not about Mabo; it is about the environment and conservation. The preamble proposed by the Democrats is simply poor legal drafting. I cannot imagine that the government and its advisers would concede that the statute book should be cluttered with preambles with poor legal drafting that have nothing whatsoever to do with the purpose of the bill. The purpose of the bill is clearly mentioned in clause 3, which sets out the objects of the act. The objects relate to conservation but not to Aboriginal issues. I am at a loss to understand why the government, except for political reasons, would be supporting this amendment. They are the reasons why we oppose the amendment.

         The dedication of the world heritage area may well have brought some of that hardship forward, but the fault does not lie at the feet of the conservationists who are attempting to protect that area. The fault lies at the feet of successive administrations and the forestry industry which, over many years, failed to establish proper plantation forestry which would have ensured that those jobs would continue in perpetuity; in other words, a sustainable timber industry was not established.

         —Senator Richardson said it before I asked the question. That reinforces the argument that this is redundant. Honourable senators in this chamber, including the minister, have admitted it is very nice to make another reinforcing statement which will remind future governments down the track that we need to think of Aboriginals first and not last. I am glad to see that the nomination included reference to the Aboriginal heritage in the area. But, again, if those opposite want to go into preambles because it makes them feel good, then they may as well mention in the preamble all the other tremendous world heritage features of the wet tropics.

         I would also respond to what Senator Coulter said in reference to future coalition governments when it comes to appointing Aboriginal people. It is always easy for the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens to look at the coalition's views on things like the Native Title Bill and this bill and say, `Aboriginals will never get anything if a coalition government is elected.' That is a cheap statement which personalises and lowers the tone of the debate. I make my comments from a very genuine point of view—I made comments during the Native Title Bill debate after a series of Labor Party politicians criticised the coalition in relation to Aboriginal affairs.

         Both sides of politics—including the Democrats—have a lot to be ashamed of for the way they have treated Aboriginals and Aboriginal issues for years, going back 30 or 40 years. It is fair to say that the coalition government under Malcolm Fraser and ministers like Ian Viner and Fred Chaney tried very hard to make progress on Aboriginal issues. It is probably fair to say that a number of ministers under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments have tried very hard as well. Many people are genuinely committed to the cause of trying to advance Aboriginals. But I do not think that just because one belongs to the Labor Party, the Greens or the Democrats one has a mortgage on empathy for the plight of Aboriginals. It is a sad reflection on anyone who says, `Coalition members are all anti-Aboriginal and the Labor Party loves Aboriginals because it keeps moving these bits of national land rights legislation and other things and supports pious preambles to bits of legislation.' We will fight this fight.

         I will defend our record every time a Labor Party or Democrat politician gets up and has a go at the coalition and tries to attack the credentials of the coalition parties, particularly the Liberal Party, in relation to Aboriginal affairs. I will put on the record our genuine concern for all Australians; that Aboriginals do have some very endemic problems that need to be addressed by a nation that can stand up and be proud of itself. There are health, housing and education problems—problems that need special attention. But those problems are not assisted by politicians trying to score cheap political points.

         We had a genuine commitment during consideration of the Native Title Bill to our belief that the Mabo II High Court decision was not the best approach for a whole range of reasons, one being that that approach would actually be counterproductive in solving those other serious problems of Aboriginal people. We stand by that approach. We think the government has made a very serious mistake in the way that whole process was entered into.

         Even though the politics of the situation in this chamber towards the end of last year certainly did not come out in the coalition's favour for a load of reasons, which those who have been in politics understand, I am quite sure that in the long run Senator Richardson will be proven wrong. I am glad that he is proud of what his government has achieved, because in public life it is good to feel that one is achieving something. I think the government has made a serious mistake with the approach taken with the Native Title Bill, which in the long run will prove to be an economic disaster for Australia and, even worse, a disaster for the Aboriginal people whom the government sought to assist with its approach.

         —We do not support the amendment. It is not necessary. As a practical lawyer, I believe that it is a much better idea to have the schedule to the act in the act rather than omit it altogether. If Senator Chamarette wanted the best of both worlds, her amendment could say, `A copy of which is set out in schedule 1 to the Queensland act as amended from time to time' and include them all. But simply as a matter of practical drafting, it is better to include it in the act because it is all there. If the agreement referred to is in the act it will make things much easier. Basically, Senator Chamarette's amendment is not needed and, again, it is improper drafting.

That part is legislated for. We also support the concept of having men and women on the board, as appropriate in this day and age. But we support the concept of having the best people on it.

         The Commonwealth has two nominations. Currently they are Mr Geoff Donaghy from the Cairns promotion bureau and Ms Aila Keto, the well-known environmentalist. The State government has two nominees: councillor Tom Pyne from local government and another gentleman, whom I do not really know. His name is McDonald, so he must be good, but I do not know what category he fits into. In addition, there is an independent chairman, Professor Ken Wiltshire, appointed jointly by the Commonwealth and state government. That is provided for in the agreement. Of course, the executive director also sits on the board.

         I understand that the government is going to get together with the Greens and pass this amendment. Where does that leave us? The bill says that the government has to appoint one Aboriginal person and that the other person has to be only generally qualified. The agreement between the two governments adopted in the legislation indicates the type of person that should be on the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. The bill gives a broad definition that the chairman and members shall be persons having qualifications relevant to, or special experience or interest in, a field related to the functions of the management authority.

         That is why I challenged the Australian Labor Party earlier. An Aborigine with those qualifications could have been appointed three years ago. Senator Richardson does not need this amendment to appoint an Aborigine. But if he does include this amendment, there will be one Aborigine and one other person having qualifications relevant to or special experience or interest in a field related to the functions of the management authority. That other person could also be an Aborigine. So there may be two Aborigines on the board. Good luck if they both have the qualifications. But one Aborigine is there because he is an Aborigine. This amendment is contrary to the agreement. There is going to be a field day for the constitutional lawyers, but that is not for me to worry about.

I am going to be around Cairns when this happens. Someone with specific environmental learning and qualifications will be put off the board. I do not always agree with Dr Keto—I rarely do—but she is an acknowledged expert in the field. Mr Donaghy is the representative of the Cairns promotion bureau. He does a tremendous job in promoting Cairns, particularly in the ecotourism area. He is promoting an industry which in Cairns has meant millions and millions of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of jobs to far north Queensland and North Queensland generally. They have all been associated with ecotourism in the wet tropics.

        I understand that the government will not support the amendment. The reasons are a little obscure because it seems to us to be an extension of 5A(1). We wondered a little whether it was because of the use of the words `Aboriginal representatives' rather than `persons', but we understand that is not the reason. It is just that the Commonwealth is a little chary about being seen in any way to put pressure on a state minister in relation to what the state might do.

         I do agree with what Senator Macdonald has been saying. It is important that other groups be represented. Whether we are talking about tourism, local government, environmentalists or scientists, it is clear that we have to try to make sure that the representation is as broad as possible. So while the Queensland government will be free to nominate an Aboriginal person, it may well be that it considers, along with the Commonwealth, that one Aboriginal person is enough, when there are only five people to be elected, and other legitimate groups need representation.

Could Senator Coulter explain to me—or if he cannot, can the minister or perhaps the minister's advisers—why this is necessary, apart from making the point that they are getting Aborigines onto the board and are making big fellows of themselves. In this post-Mabo era we are really making sure every piece of legislation that comes along recognises Aborigines.

         Can someone tell me, please, why this provision is in an agreement that has the force of law now because it is ratified in legislation; it is a schedule to it. It has gone through the Queensland parliament which has adopted it. The Queensland parliament said, `Yes, there will be an Aboriginal person on this community consultative committee'. The Commonwealth has adopted it today. It has said it agrees and every community consultative committee will have an Aboriginal person. Yet a new paragraph is being added to the bill saying exactly the same thing. I excuse the Democrats. They probably do not know better; but I cannot understand the government and its advisers, except if they are doing it for purely crass, political purposes. Would someone please tell me why?

As Senator Ian Macdonald said, this bill includes 12 categories of members among a 13-member community consultative committee—the community consultative committee, which is set up under this schedule. This amendment is to ensure that any advisory committee established by the authority under the Queensland legislation includes among its members Aboriginal representatives. Clearly, this anticipates the possibility of setting up other advisory committees in addition to the community consultative committee, which is mentioned specifically in schedule 1.

         The bill proposes to transfer guardianship powers of certain non-citizen children from the federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the state and territory governments. It does this by excluding children who enter Australia for adoption from the definition of non-citizen child defined in the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946. Following the passage of this bill in the federal parliament, state and territory governments will be able to assume guardianship when they have been declared by gazettal by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs after he is satisfied with the state and territory legislation.

         The coalition supports this bill because it puts into legislative context what is current practice; that is, the federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs usually immediately delegates his powers of guardianship of adoptive non-citizen children to the relevant state or territory welfare administrator. There have, however, been exceptions to this practice. The most notable was the baby Kajal case several years ago when the federal minister intervened in the state adoption process by exercising his guardianship powers. The failure to follow usual delegatory procedures in that case raised concerns from state governments about the way the federal government had interfered in adoption procedures which essentially come under state jurisdiction.

         Following a review into the federal government's guardianship powers, an understanding was reached by Commonwealth and state governments in 1990. This bill is the legislation required of the federal government to implement the 1990 understanding. Complementary legislation will be required by the states and territories. Although there will be a need for ongoing discussions between state and federal governments about the details of the complementary state and territory legislation, these are not part of the object of this bill. I understand these will be negotiated between the various states and territories and the federal government on an individual basis.

         Clause 3 amends the definitions section of the act and several definitions are extended, bringing them under the protection of the bill: firstly, the Olympic motto expressed in English as `faster, higher, stronger'; and secondly, a registered torch and flame design. The protection period for a registered torch and flame design for a particular summer or winter Olympic Games will be the period starting when the design is registered or on 1 January that is at least three years but less than four years before the opening of those games—whichever is the later. The protection period ends on 30 December after the closing of those Olympic Games.

         The bill proposes a definition of Olympic artistic work which includes a prescribed Olympic torch and flame design under proposed section 2A or an artistic work that incorporates either the Olympic symbol or a prescribed torch and flame design. Clause 4 inserts a proposed new section 2A, which allows for the prescription of a single artistic work of an Olympic torch and flame for a particular Olympic Games. Such a regulation may be made only where the committee is the owner of the copyright or the relevant work.

The AOC, which looked into this, is taken to be the owner of the design of the symbol and any design registered under the act before the commencement of this bill. Clause 6 provides that, in relation to an infringement of the monopoly in a protected design, a design may be a fraudulent or obvious imitation of a registered torch or flame design even if it does not incorporate a prescribed Olympic torch and flame. The opposition certainly supports this bill in terms of trying to protect the Olympic insignia, because it is a significant insignia, against exploitation.

Clause 15 proposes to preserve existing rights conferred by the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. Clause 16 replaces all references to `the federation' with `the committee'. With that brief summary of the purpose and the intent of this bill, I inform the Senate again that we will not be opposing this piece of legislation.

         The AOC says that the world body, the International Olympic Committee, has requested the strongest possible protection for Olympic symbols, particularly the Olympic rings and the torch. The Olympic motto, `faster, higher, stronger',  will also be protected under this legislation. As the Australian Olympic Committee also states, official sponsors need to be protected. Those sponsors who have authority to use the Olympic symbols should not be undermined by organisations which use these symbols without the proper authority. An example of this occurred after the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992 when a rival of one of the Australian team's major sponsors was able to cash in on the success at the games of the Australian athletes because this type of legislation did not exist. Unfortunately for the AOC, this particular sponsor has now ended its association with the Australian team over this incident.

         While welcoming the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill, the Australian Olympic Committee is concerned that it may not go far enough. The AOC has used the example of the United States to highlight its concerns. Olympic insignia protection rules are very strong in the United States and any individual or organisation wanting to use even the word  Olympic must have the expressed approval of the United States Olympic Committee. The Australian Olympic Committee and the Sydney Olympics Organising Committee have publicly called for measures similar to those in the United States. It appears that the government believes any attempt to restrict a word such as Olympic could be the subject of a legal challenge.

         On a personal note, it is a little disappointing too that the legislation does not include any product labelling. This could have been a prime opportunity to ensure that any Olympic products carrying a `made in Australia' tag should truly represent goods that are fully Australian. However, the Olympic Committee assures me that a lot has been done in this area.

         —Tonight we are debating the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1993. Once again, this is a non-controversial piece of legislation and the opposition will be supporting its passage. The purpose of the bill is to make necessary amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act to ensure that all competitors tested by ASDA under complementary state and territory legislation have access to the same appeals provision as those tested directly under the ASDA act.

         These amendments will enable the states and territories to confer jurisdiction for review of decisions by ASDA on the Commonwealth Administration Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court, even though athletes are being tested by ASDA under state or territory legislation. These amendments will also allow the name of a competitor tested under state legislation who has returned a positive test result or who has failed, without reasonable cause, to comply with a request by the agency to provide a sample and whose appeals have not been upheld, to be entered on the register of notifiable events established under the ASDA act.

         The amendments also include provision for the removal from the register of notifiable events the names of competitors who were tested under state legislation, which is consistent with those provisions applying to competitors tested directly under the ASDA act. While a number of state and territory governments have draft bills prepared, they cannot proceed until these amendments are completed. The opposition has one concern, I suppose, and that is that the states do not have comparable penalties. It is something that should probably be considered by the states. We will not be opposing the passage of this legislation.

         —The Democrats also welcome the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. As we move towards the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000, it is vital that Australia continues to play a leading role in the fight against drugs in sport. For this reason, the Democrats will be supporting this bill. To borrow a paragraph in the Australian Sports Drug Agency 1994 operational plan:

        Sport is about participation, performance, competition, and achievement. Above all, it's about building character and improving the health and well-being of the nation. Drugs to enhance physical performance undermine the essential values of all that sport is about.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the eyes of the sporting world focusing on Australia over the next seven years, we must ensure that action is taken to try to stop the use of performance enhancing drugs. The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill will assist the national approach to drug testing by providing athletes who have been tested under state or territory anti-drug legislation with access to the same channels of appeal as athletes tested under the Commonwealth act. In other words, all athletes will be treated equally in this respect. With state and territory legislation coming on stream soon that will mirror the Commonwealth legislation, this bill is certainly timely. It becomes necessary, following the agreement of states and territories, to introduce this complementary legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Australian Sports Drug Agency has indicated to me that this coordinated approach will ensure that all athletes competing at international, national, or state levels will now be exposed to drug testing. It will also allow the agency to carry out more drug tests. It is hoped that this will provide an even greater deterrent against the use of performance enhancing drugs, as it will become increasingly difficult to avoid detection. Australia's strong anti-drugs policy should send a message to the sporting world that this country does not support the use of any drugs that enhance performance in sport. The Democrats support this legislation.

I want to pick up a point that has been made. If we are trying to send a message to the community, and particularly to younger Australians, that we do not promote the use of performance enhancing drugs, that message has to be sent consistently and in a fair way, and the legislation ought to reflect the principle that no one competitor in a fair competition can be advantaged over the others.

         This amendment to the ASDA act allows for testing at all levels of competition in Australia—international, national and local. It also, importantly, allows for a uniform appeals mechanism. So that not only is justice done, but also justice provides athletes who feel that they were not using performance enhancing drugs with an appeals mechanism for them to protect their good names or to see that justice is done in their cases.

         It is very important that the principles of fairness in open competition be reflected in a testing mechanism that gives no athletes the opportunity to get away with cheating—which is what performance enhancing drugs really amount to—and provides all athletes equally with access to an appeals mechanism. We can be very encouraged in the extension of this legislation. It builds on the international reputation Australia has established in the area of drugs in sport.

         I have much pleasure in speaking on the Australian Wheat Board annual report 1992-93. There will not be time to go fully into this report, so I will address just a few points. Firstly, I commend the Australian Wheat Board and the bulk handling authorities of Australia for the way they handled the near record Australian crop of 18 million tonnes in the season just finished. They did a phenomenal job considering the shorter time of the harvest. The section headed `Storage and handling' on page 11 of the report states:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          As part of its continuing commitment to cost reduction, the AWB continues to work closely with service providers to continue to disaggregate charges and link them more closely with the distribution services provided. Although some progress has been noted, further work is required.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         I assure the Senate that there is a lot of further work required. As we do more and more segregation to take up the opportunity of getting a premium as low as $5, $10 or $15 per tonne for certain types of wheat that can be marked down, I believe that any premium paid to growers must reflect the costs, and included in that cost of segregation are the extra costs of handling and space.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One might wonder why one sort of wheat should cost more to store than another. If I may briefly explain in the short time I have, it is because, if many types of wheat are segregated, one has a lot more space in one's silos; it is as simple as that. Making separate piles means a lot more airspace in the silos. To date, that has not been reflected in the premium returned to growers. So, if the premium for a certain type of wheat is only $5 per tonne, I can see most of that being taken up in extra handling and storage costs. The Wheat Board must address that matter fairly quickly because over the past season a record number of types have been segregated. This has been done for the valid reason that we have niche markets for these particular types of wheat, but the situation must be addressed because, after all, if it costs someone $10 extra to store something that attracts only a $5 premium, it is hardly worthwhile and, of course, it means that Australia's total storage capacity cannot be utilised to its fullest extent.

          I would like to make a particular point with regard to Western Australia, bearing in mind that the costs of disaggregation are supposed to show up and be transparent. I was at a pastoralists and graziers conference in Perth when this matter came forward. People who know Western Australia will be aware that all the road deliveries of wheat to port go to the port of Fremantle, but it has been 10 or 15 years since loading for export was done at Fremantle; it is all loaded at Kwinana. After the road deliveries are made to Fremantle, the wheat is transported by rail to Kwinana, but that cost is not made known to growers. It is claimed to be commercial in confidence and the costs are spread over the growers of the whole state rather than being borne by those who deliver to Fremantle and get this advantage. CBH of Western Australia refused to answer my question on that matter; Westrail also refused to answer it; but sooner or later they will have to answer it—hopefully it will be pretty soon.

          The linchpin to the future of this vital industry is the continuation of the established single desk selling policy for export. It is estimated that single desk selling, which is an advantage to the total Australian economy, is worth between $25 and $30 per tonne. The retention of single desk selling is paramount to Australian wheat growers. It allows the Australian Wheat Board to extract the top market premium for each stratum of the market and for each market. The successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT after years of negotiations is positive news to the wheat industry and it represents an encouraging future in the long term. The main benefits will be the decrease in subsidised United States and European grain entering the world market. The export subsidies for these countries are to be reduced over time by more than 30 per cent—not a panacea but certainly a move in the right direction.

          ABARE has estimated that this will increase the value of wheat exports from Australia by about $250 million per year when the reductions are fully implemented over time. Even if these estimates are over-optimistic, we must be confident that the prospects of the industry have been improved. Australian farmers will still see rises and falls in the price of wheat, but now these fluctuations will be decided more by the laws of supply and demand than by the subsidy policies of the United States and the Europeans. The corruption of the market will be reduced, and that will be one less factor outside their control that Australian farmers will have to worry about. That problem will be eventually removed.

          This change of direction is important for Australian wheat farmers as, over the past few years, while they have maintained their production of grain, their capital equipment has been running down. Good farmers need good equipment, and it will be a slow process to re-equip. But it has a greater chance of happening now. The Europeans, on the other hand, are much better capitalised with new equipment which will take a significant time to run down. Their potential to maintain production for an extended period of reduced returns is still very high. This could significantly delay the advantages to Australian grain growers. The EEC and the US have also been engaged in significant set-aside programs for their grain production. This has had the effect of taking a large acreage out of production and this land could quite easily enter production again.

          The challenge for wheat farmers now is how to react to the changing environment. Knowing Australian farmers as I do, I am sure they will equip themselves very well. The priorities of Australian governments, industry associations, unions and the community generally must be directed to trade access and international competitiveness if Australian employment needs and debt repayment targets are to be met. I commend the AWB on the job it has done this year.

         I was particularly interested to read this report because I have made remarks in the past in relation to the new method of organisation within Australian defence to try to incorporate corporate structures within defence policy.

          There seems to be some schizophrenia in the way these efforts are made—in terms of whether we are supposed to be making money out of defence or whether defence is an end in itself and where the ethical or moral and strategic lines are drawn. If it is a buyer's market in our region, I guess this kind of document tends to reflect that situation. For a start, it is, I guess, agreed that we currently are not making much money out of our efforts, but that tends to put more pressure on those who wish to make this kind of corporatisation work to use as their criteria of success how much we sell or are likely to sell.

         —I would like to speak very briefly on the current 24-hour rolling strike in the coal industry which commenced last night. The government has failed to address the underlying cause of the coal industry's problems, although Senator Collins acknowledged the stupidity of this industrial dispute in the Senate today. It is now time for the government, and especially the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, to outline a coal industry industrial relations reform package to provide a boost for this important industry.

         Coal is Australia's biggest single commodity export earner and represents one of the more advanced industries as far as technology is concerned. Ironically, however, the industrial relations system that rules the coal industry is outdated and inefficient. It is governed by its own industry specific industrial relations system which operates outside the current mainstream of industrial relations arrangements.

         The Coal Industry Tribunal is a one-man board which, in conjunction with the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and other lesser tribunals in Queensland and Tasmania, acts with virtually the same powers as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The tribunal came into existence in 1946 at a time when coal production was focused entirely on domestic consumption. It has no place, or very little place, in 1994. This industry has undergone dramatic changes, and the tribunal is still stuck somewhere back in the 1940s.

         The level of industrial disputes in the coal sector remains significantly above the national average. In 1988, which is a couple of years ago I know, the number of days lost to industrial disputes per 1,000 employees was 15,548. It is now 2,970 per 1,000 workers. That is a remarkable improvement, I guess, but to put this in perspective it should be compared with an all industry Australian average of just 158 days per 1,000 employees.

         In another context the coalmining sector accounts for 0.3 per cent of the work force, but in 1991-92 it accounted for a huge 23 per cent of all industrial relations disputes. Last September's strike—a forerunner to the strike going on now—over BHP coal contract prices illustrated perfectly the problems of the coal sector's industrial relations system.

         The Coal Industry Tribunal was powerless to control the United Mine Workers Federation of Australia. The union flagrantly disregarded the one-man tribunal. Before various companies used the section 45D remedies, and before injunctions requiring a return to work were issued, five days of production and $170 million worth of exports were lost, and a reputation of industrial instability was confirmed.

         As of last night the industry has again been thrown into a series of rolling stoppages, estimated to cost $1 million per hour, which is $24 million per day in lost production nationwide. This action particularly impacts on the Hunter Valley, an area that is economically crucial to this nation.

         Let me make one thing clear. The current strike action cannot overturn the new contract arrangements which have been forced onto producers by shrinking demands from Japanese steel mills. This strike action only places jobs at risk and robs us of the opportunity to have mines maintain their labour forces at current levels.

         The coalmining sector is further weakened by every strike such as this, and it makes it all the more difficult to keep up with cutthroat competition from countries such as Canada, which is setting the price on this occasion. Under the present coal sector industrial relations system, neither the industry nor the work force can fight these poor prices and foreign competitors, however upset they might be. Importantly, from an industry perspective, coal industry earnings have totally outstripped industry productivity growth. These sorts of trends kill coal producers, and this problem has stuck with the coal industry for a very long time.

         It is not only the coal companies that would benefit from the industry's antiquated industrial relations system being absorbed into the national industry; it would be all of us. The security of employment in the industry and future job growth would be enhanced. The Coal Industry Tribunal can do nothing to lock in labour productivity growth. The last three major studies of the coal industry—namely, the Hancock report of 1983, the Niland report of 1989 and the Industry Commission study of 1991—have all recommended that the Coal Industry Tribunal be abolished.

         This essential industry will be one that continues to drag us out of recession. It deserves an industrial relations system to match its national importance. In the meantime, the coal union should realise that its strike action is, regrettably, counterproductive.

         reported that, after 11 years of effort costing more than $US550 million, the laser link system is about to be trashed. Developed and built by McDonnell Douglas, the program was to replace the link-ups provided through ground stations by directly linking the satellites themselves. The link was initially requested by the US air force because it wanted freedom from relying on nations like Australia. Now it realises that this `freedom' will make the new defence support program missile warning satellites cost far too much for Pentagon budgets.

        The laser devices are being delivered months after schedule,  are failing in testing and are being returned to McDonnell Douglas, which then has to announce to its shareholders that it lost $US11 million of its own funds spent on the program.

         Well, can it ever happen? The US government has already wasted heaps of money on the failing program in a time when US voters are less warmed by huge military budgets. The technology does not exist yet. Probably the biggest crunch for the laser links is shareholder dissatisfaction, for without their capital and enthusiasm further development of a Nurrungar replacement will cease.

         Are the minister's comments out of step with the realities of developing such an expensive and problem-ridden set of satellites? On what information does the minister base his comment, `I doubt it'—the Nurrungar base, that is—`will be there at the end of the century.'? Is it that the United States has decided that it no longer requires this kind of information gathering? We would like to think so. If that is the case, let us have further information about what decisions are made on our soil. If there is no basis to the comment, why was the comment made?
