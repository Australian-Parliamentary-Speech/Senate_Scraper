         —One hopes that, as rats in a maze learn their way out after a period of time, even Senator Hill would learn some of the basic realities about the setting of long-term interest rates, which are not within the control of the Australian monetary authorities or the Australian government. They are set by the market and they have regard—or they should have regard—to the underlying fundamentals of the economy. Manifestly at the moment they are not. Manifestly they are having regard more to overseas developments and perceptions as to interest rates that seem likely to prevail and economic activity that seems likely to prevail elsewhere rather than to the underlying reality of the Australian scene and the predictions that all reputable analysts and economists are making.

         To be building in—as these figures seem to—inflationary expectations of five or six per cent simply is against the run of all the objective analysis that is coming from commentators here within the system. The fundamentals just do not give rise to interest rates of that particular kind and there is no basis for those sorts of figures. So we just have to live with the reality of that figure being struck. But it has nothing to do with the government's deliberate decision making in the area of interest rate management; nor has it anything to do, as I keep saying, with the underlying fundamentals of the Australian economy.

         There is no rational relationship between long-term interest rates as they are prevailing now and the present condition of the management of the Australian economy, because the underlying realities of the Australian economy are that we have—as is constantly being said—the best conjunction of fundamentals for 30-odd years. The growth rate is fine. The inflation rate is fine. The level of investment that we are currently experiencing is fine. The wages situation is fine. There is no basis for these sorts of assumptions. Whatever has happened in the past in relation to short-term interest rates bears no rational relationship to the long-term situation.

This agreement with Mexico represents a major step forward in the commercial relationship between Australia and Mexico.

         This is an agreement which positions Australia to capture some of the benefits of the predicted rapid growth in the Mexican market. It provides practical benefit to Australian exporters and investors in two ways. There is a framework for the resolution of trading problems that might emerge between the two countries as our level of economic engagement increases. We both have relatively open economies but that does not mean no conflicts can arise. For example, Australian beef exports to the Mexican market have dropped dramatically as a result of the imposition in 1992 of a 25 per cent tariff on frozen beef. Of course, our competitors in the US and Canada do not face that because of NAFTA. There is also a complex issue, which I will not take up the time of the Senate with now, about our relationship with Mexico concerning sugar. Overall, we have a very positive relationship and a basis on which we can build.

         This agreement provides an opportunity to examine and develop new opportunities for trade and particularly for investment, because Mexico is becoming a country of major commercial opportunity for Australia and more and more countries are showing interest in it. This is the third aspect of this agreement. It has a demonstration effect. It says to Australian business, `This is a country to which you should be giving more attention. Here are some significant opportunities.'

         Mexico is an economy in which there has been dramatic economic reform. It is a country of 90 million people and with a GDP growth of 3.8 per cent. As it opens, so an increasing proportion of its economy is being serviced by imports. Our exports to Mexico have tripled over the past four years, but they are still very low. They are now $192 million, although, as I said, that is a tripling in the last four years. It has risen to be significant amongst our markets around the world, although it is still nowhere near the top of the list and nowhere near its potential, particularly on the investment side, where Australian businesses are just starting to look. We are getting some mining investment there. But even though exports are picking up, we are underperforming on the investment side.

         I look for this agreement to be one of those aspects that will increase the priority in that, as is the decision—the very welcome and correct decision—by the department and by my predecessor to include Mexico as a focus market at the national trade and investment outlook conference. It is another demonstration effect raising the significance of this market in the eyes of Australian business, both for trade and investment, and is also a very practical way of making contacts for Australian business in Mexico and for allowing Mexicans to make contact in Australia.

         We are also developing much more of a habit of dialogue and cooperation with Mexico as it comes into APEC and as it has now joined the OECD. This trade and investment agreement is significant directly for our trade and investment relationship with this increasingly important and underestimated economy. It is also a signpost of the way into the growing Latin American market, an area with one of the fastest rates of growth in the world and with significant political change going on, generating further significant opportunities.

In view of the total inability of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to answer Senator Hill's very simple question asking why Australia's long-term interest rates now under this government are at their highest level in over 30 years, let me try another interest rate question on one of his junior colleagues. I ask it in the context of the OECD having recently predicted that Australia will have the highest long-term interest rates of any of its members in 1995. Is he aware that bank, housing and business  loans are now around nine per cent and rising? Is it not also a fact that real interest rates are above seven per cent and rising? Why are real interest rates so much higher than current and projected rates of inflation? Can he assure the Senate that interest rates on home loans will not rise over the next six months?

The main feature of the explanation was Senator Evans accurately reporting that, of course, we do not regulate long-term bond rates in Australia. That is a feature of market activity, and as far as those in the long-term bond market factoring in inflation rises of the order in which they apparently are—between six and seven per cent—are concerned, there is no empirical evidence, nor is there any evidence among the economic pundits or the government forecasts, that such a level of inflation in Australia is at all likely or indeed tenable.

         Therefore, it does leave a question as to why they do this, and do it in a speculative market. I must say I am somewhat surprised but, nonetheless, they do do it and it is a factor of the market—it is not a factor of government regulation. So the opposition cannot come to us as a government and say, `In this area that you don't regulate, you are responsible for the way in which speculators go about setting long-term bond rates.'

         Interest rates in Australia tend to be higher than the inflation rate, and that has been a long-term feature of the economy. I have often heard senators from the other side compare Australia with New Zealand and, on the basis that a conservative government applies in New Zealand, therefore New Zealand somehow or other attracts their admiration in preference to their own country. It is my understanding that interest rates in New Zealand are higher than interest rates in Australia and that that is a feature of its economy. This is an empty and vacuous question which has already been answered in the main by Senator Evans. I have nothing further to add.

         —It is very interesting that Senator Short should raise the question of our forecasting ability. I recall vividly that shortly after the budget was brought down, Senator Short joined in the chorus of other sceptics in Australia, arguing that the budget forecast on investment projections—a 14 1/2 per cent growth in investment for the budgetary year 1994-95—was impossible to achieve, or was unbelievable, and went on to rubbish the forecasts, as oppositions always do, to try to undermine the budget settings. But, of course, we are now seeing that we may have been in fact wrong in the sense that we may have underestimated the growth in investment in this country, because the figures that are coming through now—and given the latest predictions of the agency that Senator Short prefers to cite, Access Economics—show that our estimates are in fact realistic. Therefore, the opposition cannot have the allegation that it now makes.

Since the clearing was first proposed and the deed of agreement for the development was drawn up, information has been made available to me and my department that gives us cause for grave concern about the likely impacts of the clearing on the seagrass communities that are adjacent to the site in the channel. These seagrasses are feeding grounds for dugong and are an integral part of the World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area.

One of the difficulties in Australia at the moment is that the drought declarations are state government matters and the processes by which they are carried out differs widely from state to state. Indeed, a number of states have no drought declaration processes at all, which means that it is crucial to get a more uniform national response to this.

         The facts are, however—and I have said this before—that if the drought should not break by autumn of next year, if we do not get a substantial relief in what will then be the fifth continuous year of drought for areas of Queensland in particular, it will at that point have escalated to a major domestic crisis, not just for the rural community but for the whole Australian community. There is no question that the government at that point will have to examine the responses that will then be necessary, because the quantums of assistance that will then be required will be extremely high indeed.

         —The thrust of Senator Harradine's question, as I understand it, concerns the different treatments for the payments for child care in the home, as opposed to payments for child care in formal child care arrangements. Quite clearly, there are ways in which this government has addressed those needs. The decision to assist with the cost of child care through child-care assistance, as Senator Harradine well knows, deals with the needs of low income families but the additional introduction of the child-care cash rebate this year goes to the recognition of two things.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The first is that child care is a legitimate cost against earning an income and, like any other cost against earning an income, it is non-income tested. Unlike other tax deductions, it is paid as a rebate to enable the costs of child care to be offset as they occur. Properly, like any other tax rebate, it is not income tested and recognises the cost of child care as a legitimate claim against income. The second thing it does is extend the assistance for the cost of child care to the informal sector. Up until now, we have not been able to really assist with the informal costs of child care; yet we know how many families use informal child care either by choice or by necessity.

         The other thing Senator Harradine's question does not recognise is that many of the people accessing our child care are effectively in single-income families or are not in the work force. This figure is not recognised. Our program tries to balance most of all keeping the costs of child care fair and, at the same time, making the provision of child care available to as many people as possible. For example, our occasional child care and the fee relief—the child-care assistance for that—is never mentioned by Mrs Carole Carroll, Senator Minchin or anybody opposite.

In their adult lives they will move from the care of children at home, particularly when the children are young, to participation in the work force, and they have a need for child care to assist them in doing that. We have provided programs that support them in their choice. We have used direct payments through child-care assistance and have now assisted that with the tax program for the child-care cash rebate. It is a program that extends child-care assistance to as many families as possible. I believe it is very much based on access and equity.

         I suppose the honourable senator can propose this hypothetical about why should not he, if he goes to work, be able to claim a tax deduction for the cost of the child care his wife is providing for him. It would be a stunning exception to every other example of how the tax system works on family income. I think it is important to recognise that child care provided within the family is not an outlay on that family income.

While acknowledging the overall benefits to Australian industry from the Uruguay resolution, I point out that there are some Australian industries, like the egg and pork industries, that receive no assistance but in the follow-on from the GATT implementation will go to a total free market and be placed in an unfair trade position compared with other countries which will continue to benefit from high assistance levels. For example, the Canadian egg industry will go from a 192 per cent tariff to a 164 per cent tariff, which is equivalent to 80c a dozen over the next six years. As other countries have introduced measures to ease industries through their adjustments to the new GATT requirements, such as an $86 billion package to Japanese farmers and the US proposals, what does the government intend to do for these particular unassisted Australian industries that will be left totally exposed to a continuing unfair international trade situation, including imports from countries which will retain high subsidy levels?

We have been out in front. The essence of Senator Boswell's question is that we did not, in the Uruguay Round, get as far as we would have wished in getting the elimination of distortions and unfair subsidies in the agricultural industries, and that is correct. We made more progress than has ever been made before. I realise Senator Boswell acknowledged that, and I thank him for that because it is unusual. This is the first time in which the Australian agricultural sector has made big gains out of such negotiations, and this is fundamentally because of the initiatives taken by my predecessors through the Cairns Group, with the support of a large number of other countries.

         One of the interesting examples that Senator Boswell gave—I did not get a chance to note them all, but I tried to take them down as he spoke—was the subsidy for the Japanese rice farmers because of the wonderful achievement that we gained in getting access to the Japanese rice market, even though it was less than we should have had. They are having to pay subsidies to compensate for the fact that Australian farmers, for the first time, will get access to this market. The last figures that I saw estimated this market to be worth more than $100 million a year to Australian rice farmers.

         We are trying to open up the market.

But we do not have the budget to compete with the subsidies provided by the major players. If we sought to enter into a subsidy contest, we would lose. It would be against our interest, and it is certainly not consistent with the policy of reducing the budget deficit by slashing outlays, which Senator Boswell's party proposes. We cannot increase spending on everything and reduce outlays at the same time.

It is still getting some exports because it is an efficient industry, but it is not getting as much as we would like.

Since then, the government has got on with the job of carrying out those recommendations. I am able to say to the Senate and to those senators interested in this issue—and there has been plenty of interest in the restructuring of Customs over the last 12 months—that, for example, we have appointed a new head of Customs and we have established a Customs Advisory Board on which the private sector has the majority of positions.

         This week 319 officers will be retiring from Customs under a voluntary redundancy program. A further 67 officers will be retiring early next year and, in accordance with the agreement of cabinet and after discussions with the staff and with the union, there will be new recruitment coming into Customs to provide new blood into the system, but there will be around 250 overall reductions in positions in the Customs Service in line with the reform process. This is a significant saving to the operation of Customs and, of course, a significant saving to the budget of the Australian government.

         Not only have we established a new Customs Advisory Board; we have also established new industry panels, including an industry panel on gateway clearance which also will deal with mandatory electronic clearance. After discussions with industry, if we are able to proceed with these new processes, we will find that this is an area that will provide further substantial savings in the future; but it will only be done after direct consultation with both the staff and with industry.

Where appropriate, it has now been agreed that that body will be consulted on the introduction of any legislation for Customs which does not affect budget procedures but which would have an obvious impact on the industry.

They realise in the long run they will end up with a better service offering a better career structure—a structure that will offer them a more encouraging lifetime career if they choose to stay within the service. So the changes in the last six months have been significant. We have not completed the changes, but they are well under way.

         Yesterday I confirmed to the Senate that on 13 November Mr Eric Robert Bowra, an Australian businessman from Western Australia, was sentenced by a UAE court to a prison term of 12 months. This term is to take account of the time Mr Bowra has already served. In addition to the prison term, Mr Bowra was ordered to pay to the family of the deceased the equivalent of about $A55,000 as compensation. This amount has been paid from funds lodged with the court.

         The embassy in Riyadh has now provided me with a translation of the judgment. The judgment, in Arabic, was given to the Australian consul who attended the hearing on 13 November. In the judgment Mr Bowra was found guilty on three counts: manslaughter, causing injury and not aiding the injured. The court, in deciding on the criminal aspects, left it open to the family of the injured party to pursue civil compensation including property damage claims.

         Mr Bowra was not present for the hearing. On the other hand, it seems though that the family of the injured party or its legal representative were also not present. Mr Bowra's legal representative from the legal firm of Aljabri and Partners, Abu Dhabi, did not object to the hearing proceeding without Mr Bowra being present. I am informed that both Mr Bowra's legal adviser and an independent legal source considered that this course, though unusual, was not illegal. I believe Mr Bowra's business associates and his legal adviser have decided to appeal the sentence and will do so within the prescribed period of two weeks. It is expected that hearings in regard to the appeal could commence in early December.

         There have been questions raised about the matter of Mr Bowra's release, or application for release, on bail. On 5 October a departmental officer in Abu Dhabi, that is one of my officers, was told by Mr Bowra's business associates and legal adviser that they were considering their options regarding the bail order, which had been made on 27 September and was unsuccessfully appealed against by the prosecutor the following day, 28 September.

         An embassy officer was advised on 24 October by Mr Bowra's legal adviser that the lawful reason for the continued detention of Bowra was not known. The next day the embassy official submitted a formal request to the UAE authorities for an explanation regarding Mr Bowra's continued detention. The Australian ambassador in Riyadh followed this up with a high level inquiry on 2 November. A further follow-up was made by the Australian consul to the head of the consular department of the UAE foreign ministry on 12 November, but this was then overtaken by the events of 13 November. Our embassy in Riyadh has, nonetheless, been instructed to seek a written response to its representations, and I will advise Senator Ellison when further information comes to hand.

         An important question, and one that I touched on yesterday, is whether an Australian citizen has received, as we would expect, the benefit of the same laws, administration and protection of rights and redress that are available to citizens of the country in which the arrest took place. Mr Bowra's legal adviser has told the Australian consul that a UAE national would have been treated in the same way as Mr Bowra. While his business associates have concerns about the judgment against their colleague, there has been no suggestion that—apart from the bail question which remains unresolved, and we are awaiting answers on that—he has been treated otherwise than in accordance with UAE law.

The report of the criminal laboratory no: 1120/2/14 proved that the iron boat collided with Al-Danah which belongs to the victim at its front left half and went over it by an angle of 45 degree towards the rear right side, colliding with the external edge of the driving cabin.

        The court session of 25 October 1994 was attended by the defendant and the victim's son, as one of the heirs. A representative of the heirs also attended. The son of the victim insisted that the defendant had failed to help them and had left after the accident. The representative of the heirs said that the heirs accuse the defendant of murder because he did not treat the victim after the accident, and this being evidence that the defendant acted deliberately. The representative of the heirs requested that the case be referred to the public prosecution to investigate the defendant and also requested that the second victim be referred to a medical committee.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Regarding the request of the heirs' representative to refer the case to the public prosecution to investigate the defendant on the crime of murdering the victim, the court rejected this request because it is clear from the papers of the case that the incident took place by mistake. It is clear from the testimony of the witness Suheil Freih Al-Qeesy that the defendant was wandering about the sea and performing spectacular moves. This was before the arrival of the victim and the accused did not change his behaviour. The two sides were surprised to be face to face. If it was deliberate, the boat of the accused would have been following the victim's boat, and there would not have been a collision in the manner which led to the death of the victim. The one who is deliberate takes complete precaution when committing a crime and the collision would not take place in this surprising manner or speed. The report of the criminal laboratory stated that the boat of the defendant flew in the air during the collision at an angle of 45 degrees. This confirms the attempt of the defendant to avoid the incident in all ways which negates intent by the defendant while committing the crime. Therefore, the decision of the public prosecution is right in charging the defendant of manslaughter. Not treating the injured does not constitute a proof of deliberation, and the defendant said that it had been because he was attempted to treated the people injured with him, and that a man in such circumstances feels frightened, and this is shown by the attempt of the defendant to escape from the country after the incident. These two matters, not treating the victim and attempting to escape from the country, are not considered a proof of murder. The intent to murder is something that the perpetrator keeps to himself. The crime of murder requires a special intention to kill the victim. Nobody knows this intention except Allah, unless the tool used in the incident proves it, or unless it is proved by the circumstances of the incident and by the way in which it took place. This crime is a normal collision accident which happened due to the fault of the defendant who did not intend to kill the victim, for the reasons that the court has mentioned. The incident took place by mistake. Therefore the defendant will be punished for the crimes of manslaughter, causing injury and not treating the victims by imprisonment for one year, and be impelled to pay to the victim's heirs the blood money of 150.000 dirham and to hand this sum to the heirs in the court. The heirs will maintain the right to seek the value of damages that occurred to the property of the victim as a result of the incident, and the injured victim will maintain the right to seek compensation.

         The Australian Taxation Office has advised a draft ruling in relation to the correct sales tax treatment of prefabricated homes. I emphasise that the ruling is only a draft one. The motivation for issuing the ruling is the inconsistency in the way in which businesses that manufacture prefabricated buildings deal with sales tax.

         Some businesses pay sales tax on the taxable component of their prefabricated product and get their input sales tax free. Other businesses pay sales tax on their inputs and are not required to pay tax on their outputs. Different rates of sales tax are payable depending on the approach adopted.

         The ATO has reviewed the industry with a view to ensuring consistency of treatment. As a result, it has issued a draft ruling. The ATO's view is that the law requires sales tax to be payable on the prefabricated buildings unless the manufacturer qualifies for the small business exemption. As is usual with draft rulings, the ATO is consulting with the relevant industry bodies.

In my answer to that question I said that the December 1993 appointment of Mr Garth Head to the IRT had been announced at the time. I did so on the understanding that all such appointments of the executive council are routinely gazetted and therefore publicly announced. I have now been advised that this was not the case, although I note that Mr Head's appointment was advised in the IRT newsletter of 15 January 1994. I regret the error.

He claimed that New Zealand interest rates are higher than interest rates in Australia. We were talking in the context of bond rates and long-term interest rates. Let me put it on the record that, according to the latest official statistics, Senator Cook is wrong.

         The long-term interest rate in New Zealand in August was 8.35 per cent. In Australia it was 9.35 per cent and, indeed, between August and September the Australian rate went up a full percentage point to 10.35 per cent. I hope that Senator Cook will acknowledge that.

         Let me get a couple of things on the record about interest rates which were not covered in Senator Cook's answer to my question and which should have been, if he were serious about attempting to answer the question. The fact is that interest rates in Australia are rising and that interest rates in Australia will rise further. The basic reason for both of those two irrefutable facts is that they are due overwhelmingly to the failure of the government's economic policies and, in particular, to its incredible laxity when it comes to budgetary or fiscal policy.

At that real figure, they are the highest real interest rates that we have had in Australia for more than 30 years.

Can I let him into a secret, because he obviously does not know it: the September quarter current account deficit of Australia is the worst ever in our history. It is $7 billion. I do not know whether that has ever entered his consciousness, but it means that in Australian interest rates there is built in a premium for the risk involved of foreigners, in particular, buying Australian dollars.

It hits the mortgage rates of ordinary Australians who now are going to the industrial tribunals seeking huge increases in their wages. This is inflationary and, therefore, Australia is being priced out of more markets. As a consequence of this government's incompetent fiscal policy, interest rates have to rise.

It is a pity that Senator Evans did not listen to Senator Walsh when he had the opportunity to do so in the cabinet because if he had, at least he may have become economically literate instead of trying to pretend, along with his colleague Senator Cook, that the government knows what it is doing. The consequences of its actions are disastrous for Australians.

         Senator Evans came into this chamber and said that we had a wonderful conjunction of economic figures. We have the highest real interest rates for 30 years, the highest real interest rates in the OECD area, and the worst balance of payments figures in the OECD area. I put it to Senator Evans, as Senator Walsh undoubtedly pointed out to Senator Evans in his article this morning, that there are some major fundamentals in this country which are going sour. Senator Evans mentioned the budget. These are Senator Walsh's views compared with Senator Evans's:

        I put it to Senator Evans that there are serious problems in the economy. It ill-behoves Senator Evans and Senator Cook—who I concede is the junior minister, but who undoubtedly takes his lead from Senator Evans—to come in here and pretend that everything in the economy is lovely, but find it absolutely impossible to explain why interest rates in Australia are at record levels. I suggest that Senator Evans should go back to his office and get a decent briefing for a change.

         The whole point of my question this afternoon was to draw the minister out on the issue of what he is doing to protect farms and the business units in rural Australia. I was not asking the minister a question about social welfare matters, even though the government has introduced such measures. These measures are totally inadequate because they apply only to areas of extreme drought and only four per cent of farmers are getting any relief.

Even though the New South Wales government has greater restrictions than the federal government, it brought in measures amounting to $22 million in August and $60 million more recently. The New South Wales government has given local government relief, matched rural adjustment scheme money, provided relief on electricity accounts, provided funding for humane treatment of stock, provided for plant seeding projects, fodder and water trains, and the carriage of charitable goods, and has allowed grazing on crown land.

        Also, the instrument does not indicate the day on which it was made, although the instrument is expressed to be effective from 8 September 1994. If, however, the instrument was made and was effective on that date, then unless it was also gazetted on that date it appears to be void under s.48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.  As well, the intention of the instrument, which is reflected in the explanatory statement, is that Impulse Airlines may act contrary to a specified Civil Aviation Order. Regulation 207, however, under which the instrument was made, does not appear to provide a power to exempt anyone from the Civil Aviation Orders or permit anyone to operate contrary to the Orders. The Committee has asked the Minister for advice on these matters.

         —I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter that has been brought to my attention regarding the Sizzler chain of restaurants. For the information of the Senate, the Sizzler chain has some 92 restaurant outlets in this country. It is relatively new upon the Australian scene, having been here for only the last couple of years, but it has experienced fantastic growth. It is a United States based concept and it has enjoyed many of the advantages of this country.

         It has also been brought to my attention that the Sizzler chain, for the first time known in this particular industry, is importing United States beef. It is, indeed, importing into this country the largest single shipment known of United States beef. It does not show loyalty to its suppliers at all—that is, the Australian farming sector—so I think the Australian customers who have patronised this particular outlet should not show the same loyalty in return for this particular act.

         Australians would get amusement out of the fact that this particular chain of restaurants happens to use in its advertising campaigns that well-known Australian Kieren Perkins, the champion Australian swimmer and gold medallist in the Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games. That is a laugh. That is misusing a good man, a well-known Australian, when all the time through the backdoor it is screwing Australian suppliers.

         The reasons given by the spokesmen of Sizzler do not hold up. They are blaming the drought. Talk about walking out on stricken Australian farmers at a time of need! Sizzler has been far too quick to walk out on them. Australians have not walked out on them generally. Even this government at last has come to the aid of the farmers with a package. Australians have extended the hand of charity to the Australian farming sector and generally the nation has pulled together for the plight of the farmers.

         While we cannot force Sizzler to use Australian beef, we would have expected a bit more generosity in this particular aspect because of the plight of the Australian farmers. Its excuses do not hold up. Price is not a factor; it has admitted that itself. One of Sizzler's purchasers, the Sydney based Beak and Johnston, said that price, supply and quality were not an issue. They are all matters—price, supply and quality—which Sizzler has agreed are not an issue.

         The Cattle Council of Australia says that prices have fallen since last year and premium cattle in Australia still cost less than those in the US. In relation to supply, the proportion of the national kill which was female was rising and was particularly concerning for the production potential of Australia. In other words, Australian farmers are unloading their cattle onto the market, so the cattle yards are actually full at the moment. That may be a different story down the track.

         I think that the Australian customers of Sizzler should blackball this particular chain of restaurants and certainly should be writing to the chain requesting an answer as to why it is not sticking by the Australian farmers if price, quality and supply are not legitimate reasons. It is going to make Christmas for the Australian farmers rather miserable. If this particular American beef is to land on the tables of Sizzler during Christmas and the New Year, then we should equally in return make Sizzler's Christmas sales miserable.

        A US Army investigation of the incident concluded that the Scud missile attack succeeded because two Patriot missile batteries deployed to protect the Dhahran Air Base were unable to engage the Scud. The first was undergoing repairs to a radar receiver at the time, and was therefore out of action, while the other experienced an inexact computer calculation and was unable to detect the incoming missile. The US Army also concluded that, even if there had been earlier warning of the Scud attack, the resulting deaths would still have occurred as the soldiers would have followed their instructions to remain in the building or would have entered after the alert if they were outside.

        (3) No. Some vehicle manufacturers have already conducted crash tests which indicate that the fitment of a bullbar will affect the crash performance of the vehicle. One local manufacturer has developed a bullbar which has been integrally designed into the airbag safety system to ensure that compliance with ADR 69 is not affected. It is understood that another local manufacturer is developing a bullbar for its family sedan which is compatible with its airbag system. It was acknowledged by those present at the Bullbar Workshop sponsored by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority and the NRMA, that all parties involved needed to discuss the issues involved to arrive at a workable solution. That is why the Federal Office of Road Safety and the National Road Transport Commission is coordinating a special working group to examine these issues. It is intended that the bullbar industry be represented on this working group where they can present any test results they might have.

        There are no quotas or targets assigned to individual posts or onshore regional offices, but there are stated planning levels at the start of the program year. The progress of the program is closely monitored and if it becomes clear that planning levels are likely to be exceeded, or there will be a considerable shortfall in approvals, close management of places may be undertaken in the Concessional Family and Independent categories through notional allocations to overseas posts. Such allocations are made following close consultations with posts, and are determined solely by such factors as overseas application rates and posts' processing capacities. The allocations are constantly adjusted (often on a week-by-week basis) during the program year as processing trends within posts and regional offices become evident.
