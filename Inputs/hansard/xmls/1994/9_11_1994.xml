        The Regulations provide for several apparently important discretions in rr. 1.05(2)(c), 1.06(2)(c) and 1.08(2).

        The present Regulations provide in clause 1 of Schedule 1B for an apparent subdelegation of legislative power to the Commissioner. As such, this appears to be invalid.

Nevertheless, we would appreciate your advice on the validity of the provision.

        Thank you for your letter of 25 August 1994 concerning the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rule No 189 of 1994 (`the Regulations').
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I note that your Committee seeks my views on two points:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        Does clause 1 of Schedule 1B constitute an invalid sub-delegation of legislative power to the Commissioner?; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        If clause 1 of the Schedule is valid, should the `arrangements' made by the Commissioner under that clause be subject to parliamentary scrutiny (by a tabling and possible disallowance procedure).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Regulation 1.08(1) of the Regulations prohibits regulated superannuation funds from using a pension conversion factor (called for the purposes of the regulations a `pension valuation factor' (PVF)) greater than the PVF that would apply under Schedule 1B.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Schedule 1B sets out a range of PVF's which apply according to the applicable indexation rate applied by funds (as determined in accordance with that Schedule). Clauses 5 to 8 of Schedule 1B provide methods of calculating an applicable PVF for funds which determine their indexation factors on wage indexation figures, the CPI or on a discretionary basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clause 1 of Schedule 1B provides that for funds that have an indexation rate greater than 8 per cent (in accordance with cl 6 or 7 of Schedule 1B), the applicable PVF is to be `calculated in accordance with arrangements determined in writing by the Commissioner'. Funds that fall within this category are, in practice, extremely rare. For instance, the provisions identical to Clause 1 in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations 1987 (the OSS Regulations) were used on only about two or three occasions (and each time in relation to a particular fund). In this regard it is important to note that clause 1 of Schedule 1B does not, in a practical sense, represent a new regulationâ€”the clause has existed for some time in Schedule 3 of the OSS Regulations in the exact form that it now appears in the SIS Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        By empowering the Commissioner in determine, in certain instances, `arrangements' to calculate PVFs, it is clearly arguable that the Governor-General has delegated to the Commissioner the power to set `standards' in respect of regulated superannuation funds in certain (albeit limited) circumstances, which is a power of the kind conferred on the Governor-General by sec 31 (in conjunction with sec 353(a)) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (`SIS').
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Office of Legislative Drafting in the Attorney-General's Department considers that clause 1 of Schedule 1B is probably a sub-delegation of legislative power unsupported by the terms of the SIS act, and therefore invalid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have asked the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to have amending regulations prepared as soon as possible for submission to the Governor-General to amend Schedule 1B so as to avoid the probable invalidity of the current Regulation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        My advice about clause 1 makes a response to your second query unnecessary.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In view of my undertaking to amend clause 1, and the fact that Schedule 1B is unrelated to the majority of the regulations in Statutory Rule No. 189, I seek confirmation that your Motion of 19 September to disallow the whole of Statutory Rule No. 189 will be withdrawn before 10 November.

        Dear Senator

        Thank you for the recent correspondence from the Committee of 25 August 1994. I apologise for the delay in replying.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Legislative Services Group of the Australian Taxation Office on 25 June 1992 requested the Attorney-General's Department to prepare regulations to give effect to the introduction of the BillPay and EFT payment systems. This required amendments to the Taxation Administration Regulations and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The drafting instructions to the Attorney-General included requests for provisions to be made for evidentiary certificates in relation to liabilities other than tax, that is, child support. It was requested that the provisions should allow for the certificates to be sufficient evidence of the facts that the person named in the certificate is liable to pay an amount to the Commissioner and that the sum in the certificate is, at the date of the certificate, a debt due to the Commonwealth. However, the request also stated that where the issues could not be dealt within the Taxation Administration Regulations, the new Child Support Regulations be amended to mirror these changes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Attorney-General responded by framing Regulations which are now included in the Child Support Regulations. You have stated that these Regulations lack appropriate safeguards.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is true that the Child Support Regulations inserted by Statutory Rule No 197 of 1994 differ from other Regulations to which you refer. The principal differences are that a certificate issued under the Child Support Regulations does not have to state:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        .the basis of the liability (that is, a court order or administrative assessment for child support) or the particulars of that liability;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        .that notice of the liability has been served on the person.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The scheme of the child support legislation is quite different from the other legislation to which you refer. The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 does not, of itself, create a liability. It merely provides for the registration of certain liabilities created under some other legislation (generally the Family Law Act 1975 or the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989). Once the liability has been registered, it becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would be inappropriate for a certificate issued for the purposes of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to state that the liability has been correctly raised under another piece of legislation or for it to contain a statement as to the correctness of the liability.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As it stands, the regulation merely requires the certificate to state that the debt is payable by the person to the Registrar. This reflects the way in which the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 operates.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is also important to consider section 116 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. That section provides that the mere production of a document purporting to be a copy of the entry in the Child Support Register is conclusive evidence of certain matters. These matters include the fact that the liability is a registrable maintenance liability, that the liability is duly registered under the Act, that the particulars entered in the Register are those set out in the document and that all of those particulars are correct. A notice specifying the particulars entered in the Register is served on both parties when a liability is initially registered
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, I would like to point out that a certificate issued under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations is evidence only of the facts stated in the certificate. It does not purport to be evidence of any other facts. There are other mechanisms provided by the Principal Act for disputing the registration of the liability or the particulars entered in the Register. Any dispute as to the correctness of the liability, whether raised under an administrative assessment or a court order, must be dealt with by the Court under the appropriate legislation.

        PIPELINE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this bill is to make a number of technical amendments to the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 and the Pipeline Authority Act 1973. The first of these amendments will ensure that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline can be licensed under state laws. The second category of amendments will facilitate the transfer of certain easements from the Pipeline Authority to ICI. The Pipeline Authority is currently obtaining easements for ICI to support the construction and operation by ICI of a new pipeline to transport ethane from Moomba in South Australia through Queensland and to Botany in New South Wales.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, at the time when the Moomba-Sydney pipeline was sold in June of this year, it was generally agreed that this was the most complex privatisation project undertaken by the government to date.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Not only were the parties involved required to meet a very tight time frame, but the sale itself involved the transfer of all pipeline assets to the new owners but with the Commonwealth retaining a joint ownership interest in the easements in which the pipeline runs. Further, the sale legislation had to take account of the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline project which at that stage was still being developed between the Pipeline Authority and ICI. The task was not an easy one.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fact that the pipeline sale was completed on target and was able to also accommodate the future requirements of the ethane project attests to the determination and professionalism of all parties involved. The fact that the need for some technical amendments to the sale act has become necessary is, in the circumstances, not surprising.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments I am introducing today are essentially in two categories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first address some concerns which were raised by the NSW government after the passage of the sale act with regard to its impact on the operation of state pipeline licensing laws. It was put to the Commonwealth that the legislation, as it stood, may have prevented state licensing laws applying to private sector pipelines running in easements in which the Commonwealth had an ownership interest.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was never the government's intention that state licensing laws should not apply to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline after its sale to East Australia Pipeline Ltd or indeed, to any other private sector pipelines operating in these easements. Advice received from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General indicated that the problem, as perceived by NSW did not, in his view, in fact arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, as the NSW Solicitor-General took a somewhat different view on this issue, the government agreed to introduce an amendment in this session to put this matter beyond doubt. Accordingly, I am now proposing the required amendments that will clarify and acknowledge the application of state pipeline licensing laws in the relevant circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It should be noted, Mr President, that these changes will not affect the conditions under which the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline is being constructed by the Pipeline Authority for ICI. The authority is undertaking the construction process utilising immunities from state laws available to it under its own act. Once the authority withdraws from this project, however, these immunities will cease and ICI will become subject to those state licensing laws which these amendments are designed to uphold.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second group of amendments relate specifically to this Moomba to Botany pipeline project that will bring ethane for use as a feed stock to ICI's plastics manufacturing plant. In September, after considerable negotiation, ICI was able to finally secure sufficient quantities of ethane from the Cooper Basin producers for this important project to proceed. At the same time the South Australia government approved the sale of these ethane reserves by the Cooper Basin gas producers to ICI.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This in turn cleared the way for pipeline construction contracts to be let. The Pipeline Authority will initially be responsible for building this pipeline and it is also obtaining those additional easements that will be required specifically for the ethane pipeline. As part of the agreed basis for this project, ownership of those easements being specifically obtained for the ethane pipeline by the Pipeline Authority are to be transferred to ICI once they have been secured.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is appropriate that the responsibilities and obligations of owning these ethane-specific easements should ultimately rest with the organisation that will own the pipeline itself. This is particularly so in this instance where ICI is meeting all the costs associated with obtaining these new easements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The inclusion of specific provisions in the bill by which to effect the transfer of ethane pipeline easements has a particular purpose. It reflects the Commonwealth's undertaking to facilitate, to the extent possible, the subsequent registration by ICI of its ownership of these easements with state titles offices. Whether or not this will ultimately occur is a matter for the states to determine. The Commonwealth cannot give any undertaking to ICI on this matter of registration but has sought to enhance the prospect of this occurring by including specific transfer provisions in this bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, whilst these amendments are technical in nature, they are nonetheless small but important steps in the overall context of the government's gas reform agenda. They will enable the Commonwealth to continue the process of disengagement from its involvement in the construction and operation of gas pipelines, allowing it to focus its attention on the creation of a pro-competitive market environment in the gas industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The sale of the Moomba-Sydney natural gas pipeline to the private sector and the private ownership of the ethane pipeline project illustrate the confidence that business has in the future of Australia's gas industry. The most important role that government can play is to ensure the potential that exists in this sector is realised and that the benefits of reform accrue to all gas users and ultimately to the nation as a whole.

        WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (PREVENTION OF PROLIFERATION) BILL 1994
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994 will assist the Government in ensuring that Australia is fulfilling its treaty obligations and its citizens do not contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in any part of the world.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Controlling weapons of mass destruction is one of the most important security challenges facing the post-Cold War world. The issue is a high foreign policy and defence priority for the Government. International recognition of the horrific results of the use of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and their missile delivery systems) and concerns over the destabilising impact of the proliferation of such weapons have resulted in several major achievements in addressing this problem. Of greatest importance are the multilateral treaties either banning or restricting the proliferation of such weapons, principally the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention (which is not yet in force).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to these global treaties, and reinforcing their objectives, are other measures which have been taken to stem proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In concert with other similarly-minded countries, the Australian Government has maintained a range of export controls aimed at preventing the transfer, directly or indirectly, of goods and technology, which could be used in the development of WMD, to programs known to be or suspected of posing a WMD proliferation risk. These controls were developed by international export control regimes of which Australia is a memberâ€”the Nuclear Suppliers' Group and the Zangger Committee (nuclear), the Australia Group (chemical and biological) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (missile delivery systems).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Australia's export controls on goods (including technology in a tangible form) are covered by the Customs Act 1901 through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Exports of dualuse materials and technology (equipment and technology which have both commercial and military uses) are controlled under a series of these Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not possible to identify and describe (for regulatory purposes) all items that might be used in a WMD program. Some items may be identified but, because of their widespread commercial application, it would be impracticable to control them under the Customs Regulations: once in Regulations, all exports of these items would require a permit, which would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the licensing authority as well as for industry. However, the Government would still want to have the authority to stop such items from being exported to a destination considered to be a WMD proliferation risk.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Customs Regulations also cannot control the supply of goods and technology by an Australian overseas or the provision of services or other assistance to a WMD program. Services or assistance could for example take the form of a consultancy contract to provide technical, operational or management advice to a WMD program; financial assistance; brokering the supply of materials; or specialised training. It would also cover the transmission of information by telephone, fax and other forms which cannot be covered under the Customs Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of similarly placed countries have responded to this problem by the development of the "catch-all" or "safety-net" provisions as an element of the barriers to WMD proliferation, for example the United States and Germany. Although it can take different forms, essentially it works in two ways: it puts an onus on a person not to export goods or provide a service or other assistance intentionally or recklessly to a WMD program. It also provides the Government with a mechanism to prevent the export of goods or the provision of a service or other assistance to an actual or possible WMD program. While there is a wide range of goods and services that can be used in a WMD program which have legitimate commercial uses and are not specifically controlled under existing legislation, it would be inconsistent with Australia's strong support for the international non-proliferation regimes and strong opposition to WMD proliferation for the Government not to have all necessary authority to prevent the provision of goods and services to WMD programs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is not a theoretical problem for Australia. There have been several cases in recent years where Australian companies have inadvertently become involved in activities which could have assisted WMD programs, and these activities were not specifically covered by Australia's existing non-proliferation legislation. Fortunately the companies involved were cooperative and ceased the activities in question when the Government informed them of its concerns. We cannot, however, conclude from the positive outcome in those cases that this will always be the case in the future, particularly in the face of the possible financial inducements on offer from those associated with the WMD programs. Hence the need to provide clear legislative backing for the Government's comprehensive WMD non-proliferation policy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The prohibitions under the bill would apply where the person involved knows or suspects of the connection with a WMD program. The bill provides for a Ministerial certificate to be issued prohibiting relevant activities in cases where government authorities are aware of the risk of the potential contribution to a WMD program, but the exporter is not aware of the connection or has ignored or not appreciated warning signs. An important element of the bill is the provision for a mechanism to be established for companies and individuals to obtain written guidance from the Government on the risk (or not) of a particular planned transaction contributing to a WMD program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This legislation is not meant to be the prime or sole barrier against possible Australian assistance to the proliferation of WMD. The Customs Regulations, information programs and persuasion will continue to serve an important function. The legislation would be used only when other measures fail or are unavailable. It would also serve to underline again the Government's clear commitment to prevent Australian assistance to proliferation of WMD.

         It seems to be a waste of the Senate's time to go through and deal with various amendments suggested by, or that come up as a consequence of, our own committee, only to have the bill go down to the lower house and probably have another bout of amendments. If we were really being sensible and efficient, as we claim Public Service departments ought to be when they come before us in estimates, we would say, `Look, why don't we let everybody have their say on this and then we will deal with it in the respective chambers.' I am pleased to say that the attorney has agreed to that path; so today, as I understand it, by agreement we will proceed with the second reading of the bill but no further.

Over the last 20 years or so, controls on the exercise of power delegated to the executive and the bureaucracy have mainly involved discretionary power, administrative review, freedom of information, the ombudsman's review and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and largely operate to control administrative decisions affecting individuals. Delegated legislative power has been left, I might say for the Senate regulations and ordinances committee, largely untouched. The bill defines the term `legislative instrument' for the purposes of the act. It establishes a federal register on which legislative instruments must be recorded. It sets up consultation procedures that must be undertaken in relation to legislative instruments affecting business. The procedures require that a form of regulatory impact assessment be prepared in relation to such instruments.

Somebody has to be watching that the bill, when passed, which will make everybody feel happy that the processes have been improved, is actually being properly complied with. Otherwise, it will be just a piece of window dressing under which a number of legislative instruments would go through the proper consultation process each year and others would escape. So somebody has to be the watchdog in that respect. We need to ensure that the watchdog in that sense has the proper resources and capacity to do the job. I hope that matter is given further consideration while this bill is being considered by the House of Representatives committee.

         It is important to note that the bill absolutely and positively prohibits judicial and administrative review of a number of crucial determinations as to whether the procedures contained in the bill apply. This bill is not going to apply to every legislative instrument. In addition, failure to comply with certain crucial proceduresâ€”that is, consultation for exampleâ€”does not in the end affect the validity of the rules.

         If we are going to say that this is a legislative instrument which should have gone through this course of consultation and then we say, `It didn't go through that course of consultation but don't worry; it doesn't matter; the rules are still valid,' it raises the question of why we bothered to say that it should have gone through the consultation process in the first place. There has to be some type of muscle standing behind the requirement that the consultation process take place otherwise, on difficult matters which are likely to have an adverse reception in the community, the consultation will not take place. It is as simple as that.

         In the context of judicial and administrative review of the procedures, I want to comment on a specific matter that was the subject of comment: to have a recommendation by the regulations and ordinance committee. It concerns clause 7 of the bill which, as presently drafted, gives the Attorney-General conclusive and unreviewable power to determine, at the request of a rule maker, whether a legislative instrument is covered by this bill. The determination is specifically excluded from both judicial review and administrative review.

         The Attorney-General has argued that such a determination is not suited to review. After expressing considerable reservation about that power, the regulations and ordinances committee was satisfied with the proposed amendments of the government that would make a determination that an instrument was not covered, subject to disallowance by the parliament. Fortunately, I will have more time to reflect on whether that is the best way to deal with that problem. Time will be granted because, as we know, this legislation is going to the House committee.

         An associated question that does not appear to have been raised in detail is the situation where the rule maker determines unilaterally, without reference to the Attorney-General, that the instrument is not covered by the bill. There is no specific mention of judicial or administrative review of that determination. If that means review is permitted, it would appear inconsistent with the policy that no review is possible when a certificate is issued. That matter needs to be cleared up.

         I would like to comment also on the failure of the bill to implement the recommendation of the Administrative Review Council that legislative instruments be sunsetted.

Every parliament has to make a contribution to simplifying the law, making sure it does not sit there as a dead letter arrangement, out of touch and out of date, and perhaps not even used, cluttering up the statute books and making legal advice far more expensive because any sensible solicitor checks every rule that can possibly be checked to make sure that the advice given is the right advice.

         One way we could do that is by setting ourselves targets, by sunsetting things, by forcing ourselves to have another look at what we have done and considering whether it is still appropriate. It is not a matter of simply passing a bill today and, no pun intended, sailing off into the sunset and not worrying about how it will affect people in the future. That is not to say that I think we should now automatically say, `Yes, let's sunset it.' I am simply raising the point that we have to get to the bottom of how this massive Commonwealth legislation and delegated legislationâ€”these legislative instrumentsâ€”can possibly be kept up to date so that everyone has at least a tenth of a chance of knowing what the law is in areas where they want to know what it is.

         Another matter in relation to the ARC report is the extent of the consultation requirements. These procedures apply only to specified rules affecting business, and that significantly backs away from the ARC recommendation that procedures apply to all legislative instruments. It eliminates from the requirements many of the types of legislative instrument that should be subject to consultation procedures. One example may well be welfare entitlements.

I congratulate the government for having had the good sense to agree to move amendments to increase the flexibility which, some would say, is already there but which is often not exercised because of some doubt about whether the Senate has the power.

         â€”The Senate is debating the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994. Overall, the Australian Democrats welcome this bill. Its main purpose is to provide easy and inexpensive access to delegated legislation through the creation of an electronic register of legislative instruments and to create a more streamlined process for classifying and subjecting them to parliamentary scrutiny. I think it is important to note that we are dealing with a substantive body of law that comes into being through this particular process and that this bill is therefore a very important one.

         I note that the government has published its intention to refer the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As a result of that, the Senate will be proceeding to the second reading stage only. I welcome that move. I believe it is important that this bill be subjected to searching inquiry. While we have had the benefit of a report from the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinancesâ€”and it is indeed a very good committeeâ€”that committee has not addressed all the issues substantively that need to be addressed. I look forward to the report of the House of Representatives committee, which will have the benefit of this debate in the chamber.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Rule making by Commonwealth agencies
         </emphasis>
         . After enactment of the bill, members of the public will be able to scan the register and print out a copy of any delegated legislation or regulation. This is a major improvement over the existing situation where poorly organised records of delegated legislation are inaccessible to all but a small proportion of the population. As such, it should move us a little closer to the desirable reality of access to the legal system for all Australian citizens. All new legislative instruments will be placed on the register and, over time, all existing instruments will also be included. Instruments that are not properly registered will not be enforceable.

         In addition to the creation of this instrument register, the bill provides a new regulatory framework for delegated legislation. Part of this framework includes the definition of what constitutes a legislative instrument, a prescription for limited community consultationâ€”I might say even now it is far too limitedâ€”and mechanisms for parliamentary scrutiny. The principles behind this billâ€”namely, accessibility, predicability and, to a certain extent, opennessâ€”are to be applauded. They comprise a vital element of the process of improving access to justice and go some way in achieving a greater transparency in the legislative process.

         The question is whether the bill goes far enough in its present draft. The answer must be no. The Australian Democrats have a range of significant objections and proposals for amendments. The first of our concerns relates to the power of the Attorney-General under clause 7 to conclusively certify whether or not an instrument is legislative. I welcome the suggestion made by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances that certificates issued by the attorney should be expressly deemed to be disallowable instruments. I understand that the government has agreed in substance to that suggestion.

         However, this proposal does not address the fundamental concern that the bill confers quasi-judicial powers upon the Attorney-General and goes further to exempt his decisions from the ADJR Act. This may be in breach of chapter 3 of the constitution that exclusively vests the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the High Court and Federal Court of Australia. It would certainly appear to contravene the principle that the parliament should make law and the courts should determine disputes according to the law. In my view, the bill would be greatly improved if clause 7 were to be deleted.

         Another of the Democrats' concerns relates to the absence of sunsetting provisions, despite the fact that the Administrative Review Council specifically recommended sunsetting in its report. Presumably, the government has ignored this section on the basis of the cost of the practice. However, this aspect of the bill is also entirely at odds with the recommendations of the action plan of the Access to Justice Advisory Committeeâ€”the so-called Sackville report. It recommended:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para>
        The government should spare us the fanfare that accompanies the release of such reports if it has absolutely no intention of implementing its recommendations. Even the Business Council of Australia was scathing of the government's bill in this regard. In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances it stated:

         The third point I wish to make about the Legislative Instruments Bill is that the consultation provisions are inadequate. The bill sets out the circumstances in which consultation is not required. The first of these provides that consultation is not required in the event that the instrument implements an obligation of the Commonwealth under an international agreement. The Australian Democrats believe that the Australian community would benefit from improved consultation during the creation of international agreements, and the private member's bill introduced by Senator Bourne bears this out. For this reason we cannot accept the specific exclusion of this matter in the bill.

         Under the legislation, consultation is also not required where the instrument gives effect to a decision announced in the budget. I would be keen to hear the government's explanation for this. In our view, this is only warranted if the budget announcement were preceded by adequate consultation. Certainly, there are other clauses in this area which cover this particular situation and which are of concern.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The third exclusionâ€”and this would appear to be the broadest in scopeâ€”is that the government has decided not to consult in relation to matters that do not directly affect business. Certainly, we understand the significant use that the business community makes of delegated legislation, but it is difficult to see the justification for this provision excluding all other sectors. In particular, we cannot agree with the implication that regulations that affect business are in some way more significant than those that impact upon other rightsâ€”for instance, welfare regulations and regulations that concern migration, social security, education, family law, defence and others.

        The current proposal to limit the consultation provisions to areas affecting business is contrary to the Government's stated commitment to make justice within Australia more accessible. It also implies that business interests are in some way more important than other interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, while we fully appreciate the important role that delegated legislation has for the business community, it is difficult to accept that the other sectors are somehow second best and not deserving of consultation provisions.

         The refusal to consult on non-business regulations also passes up, in our view, a critical opportunity to improve the standard of subordinate legislation. The director of the Australian Council of Social Service, Ms Betty Hounslow, gave a good example of this in her submission when she explained:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Business Council of Australia was also critical of this feature of the bill, arguing that it does not provide for public hearings into controversial or sensitive legislative proposals, as recommended in the ARC report. The point here is that by avoiding legislative rewrites and producing more efficient legislation, consultation can actually save money. I believe that the government's pre-occupation with costs ignores this fundamental point.

         I turn to another of our concerns. Clause 48(4) provides for a new provision under which a house may defer consideration of a motion of disallowance for up to six months. Although this would appear to extend the degree to which parliament may control legislative instruments, it has been argued that it may serve to limit parliament's ability to actually effect disallowance. The reality is that in some circumstances a delay will help parliament to make better decisions, while, in others, it may weaken parliament's resolve.

         While we do not oppose this provision, we believe it should be complemented by allowing parliament to defer the effect of a disallowance motion for up to six monthsâ€”in other words, to pass a disallowance motion but to defer its effect. This would make it clear that the instrument in question would cease to operate, while allowing time for alternative regulatory arrangements to be put in place. It would allow a disallowance motion to be dealt with without creating a regulatory vacuum. It is worth noting that this is what the ARC proposed in its report, and the bill has departed from the council's recommendations.

         There is one further point in this area that I should make. The Democrats contend that it ought to be possible to disallow part of an individually numbered regulationâ€”in other words, a subclause or a subsection; disallowance should not be limited to full sections of a regulation.

         In conclusion, the Australian Democrats welcome this bill and applaud the work of the Administrative Review Council that gave rise to it. The bill will certainly improve the accountability of makers of delegated legislation, leadâ€”we hopeâ€”to a more accessible body of rules and provide a more coordinated framework in which this substantial body of law is administered. The importance of this legislation underlines the need for us all to make sure that we have the best possible regime in place. To this end, I look forward to the report of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. As I have said before, I welcome the decision to defer the committee stage of the bill in the Senate until that report is available.

         â€”The Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 is a very important piece of legislation. I concur with the comments made by the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone. I also very largely concur with the comments Senator Spindler made on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The very name of the bill indicates that this piece of legislation is somewhat dry and boring in nature. Put simply, this bill deals with process and, as such, it is vitally important that the government and the parliament get it right.

         This bill was first introduced into the Senate more than four months ago. On 25 August 1994, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I am pleased to say that the committee, on which I have the honour of serving, came down with a unanimous report.

         As an aside, this report once again shows the strength of the Senate committee system and the fact that a lot of issues facing this house are dealt with on a non-partisan basis by all parties with one concern at heartâ€”that is, to get it right for the benefit of those whom we serve in this chamber, the Australian people. It is something that the media and other people often do not realise, so I take the opportunity on a broadcast day to remind the Australian people that their parliament does work effectively. People from all parties can get together on committees and come down with unanimous reports indicating their views on the best way of drafting legislation.

         This exercise that we have been through with the Legislative Instruments Bill also highlights the very important role of the Senate as a house of review, with its committee system and structure, in allowing us to try to get things right. It is noteworthy that this bill, which was introduced by the government, now faces 81 amendments as a result of further consideration being given to it. I believe that this bill, with all the proposed government amendments, will be of benefit to the people of Australia who, unfortunately, have their lives controlled by a plethora of regulations and ordinances.

         A top performing former Tasmanian Liberal senator, Sir Reginald Wright, had a proud history of checking regulations and ordinances and protecting individuals, the citizenry of Australia, against the heavy-handed approach of executive government and bureaucracy. I believe that all senators would do well to keep in mind that proud record of Sir Reginald Wright.

         The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has had an ever increasing number of instruments to scrutinise. The people of Australia may like to reflect on the following statistics. In 1992 the committee, on which I now serve, checked 1,562 instruments; in 1993, 1652 instruments; and in 1994, 1,804 instruments. In very rough terms that is about five or six new instruments per day or a new instrument every five hours.

         It is somewhat frightening when one considers that these regulations and ordinances impact on the daily lives of people in all spheres. When my colleague Senator O'Chee and Iâ€”and also Senator Colston, who is present for this debate and who is the chair of the committeeâ€”look at all these instruments, we realise the impact that they have on individuals in all walks of life. They might relate to the Family Law Act, meat exports, civil aviationâ€”the list goes on. One can be assured that regulations and ordinances, or legislative instruments, are made virtually in respect of every sphere of life and have a very real impact. Usually they are not even commented upon in this parliament and often come into force without much public consideration or comment. Therefore, the role of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is important and this new bill is very important in itself as it will introduce a new regime on legislative instruments.

As previous speakers have indicated, the bill has its genesis in the Administrative Review Council report to the Attorney-General entitled

         The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances considered the bill and has supported it, with significant amendments proposed by the committee as a result of its own deliberations, but also as a result of public hearings very good and worthwhile input was contributed by members of the public as well as by people who deal with legislative instruments every day of their lives. That was of great benefit to the final product which will come before the parliament, which hopefully will pass it. I also note that it is quite possible further amendments will be forthcoming as a result of the review that is being undertaken by a committee in the other place.

         My main concern with the bill is with clause 7, which would have given the Attorney-General, or indeed the executive arm of the government, the final say in determining into which category an instrument might fall. The Attorney-General had the power to determine conclusively whether an instrument is a legislative instrument without any possibility of judicial review. I found that highly objectionable. Indeed, on reflection, it is of great concern to me that such a proposal was allowed to be put forward because it does not give voice to the principle that I believe we should hold dear, namely, the separation of powers between the executive government and the judiciary. Basically the Attorney would have been making the decision and then avoiding any judicial review of that decision. I believe that would not have been in the best interests of the people of Australia, and certainly not in the interests of a separation of powers with all the safeguards that that provides.

Although it is not a piece of legislation where we will see public meetings, petitions or headlines in our mediaâ€”indeed, I dare say the people in the public gallery are not exactly riveted to their seats, given the debate that we are having on this Legislative Instruments Billâ€”it is a very important piece of legislation because it deals with the very regulations and ordinances affecting all of our lives and it will have impact for the future. I look forward to the committee stage of this bill, when I hope to make a further contribution to it.

         â€”My friend and colleague Senator Abetz has quite rightly pointed out that there are over 1,800 items of delegated legislation which are dealt with by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances every year. Whilst some of these items of delegated legislation may seem inconsequential and, in fact, trivialâ€”for example, I believe last year we had an instrument which set out the definition of a shearerâ€”some of the instruments that come before the committee are very important ones because they relate, for example, to a person's right to conduct business, to regulations in the Public Service, and to people's superannuation entitlements; and these are all very important matters.

         It is very important, therefore, when a bill such as the Legislative Instruments Bill comes before the parliament that it is given proper scrutiny. Certainly, when the bill was originally presented I had grave reservations about the provisions that were contained in it. I am very proud to say that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, chaired very ably by Senator Colston, who is across the aisle, has done an excellent job in presenting its report, a report which, I am very pleased to say also, was a unanimous report. Members of the committee will know my concerns in this regard because the recommendations of this committee have never been deviated from, at least in so far as items of delegated legislation themselves have been concerned, and I was very keen to ensure that the work of the committee could not be characterised as a partisan work on either side of the chamber and that, if possible, we could get a unanimous report; and that is what we got.

         I think one of the crucial areas, and one of the areas that the committee spent longest deliberating on, was the proposed clause 7. As Senator Abetz has said, proposed clause 7 would have enabled the Attorney-General to issue a conclusive certificate in respect of future items of delegated legislation to totally exempt them as legislative instruments, which would have had the effect of eliminating the necessity for those instruments to be put on the register and, in certain circumstances, would also have limited the power of the parliament to disallow those instruments.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The conclusive certificate power which was proposed in the original clause 7(2) was not a power that related just to individual items of delegated legislation; it related to whole classes which were yet to be made. Of course, no decent committee of this Senate can allow a situation like that to arise. No decent committee of this Senate can say, `We are just going to allow the Attorney-General to exempt a category of instrument from the purview of the Senate or of the House of Representatives.' That is why the committee recommended, as it did, that conclusive certificates issued under clause 7(2) be disallowable instruments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The purpose of that was very simple. First of all, the committee had concerns that the Attorney-General should not have a quasi-judicial function. That is certainly what clause 7, as originally proposed, would have given the Attorney-General. Moreover, the committee was concerned that there be some mechanism, while still fitting into the general scheme of the bill, which would allow those items to be reviewed so that the Attorney-General could not just sign off with no review and no appeal process. I believe the recommendation we brought down in relation to clause 7(2) is a very good recommendation.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Why did the committee not decide to make the same recommendation in relation to clause 7(1), which concerns the power of the Attorney-General to make a conclusive certificate in relation to an instrument made before the commencement of the bill but which was not added to the register? This is really very much a matter of rectifying mistakes made by the Public Service.

         Those regulations which are made before the commencement of this bill, and which have been validly made under the Acts Interpretation Act, are valid now. Their omission from the register could make them unenforceable. The provision contained in clause 7(1) created a mechanism by which that could be circumvented. It would seem unreasonable for the committee to say, `Look, we are going to knock that out entirely,' given that these instruments are already of force and effect and given that people are deemed to know that these instruments have come into force. Certainly an affected person, I would assume, does know in most circumstances that these instruments have come into force because many of them have been in force for a long period of time. It seems unreasonable for an affected person to then be able to plead that because the instrument of which they may well have had knowledge was not included in the register it should be unenforceable against them. That is the basis on which the committee decided to exclude conclusive certificates issued under clause 7(1) from being disallowable instruments as proposed for clause 7(2) conclusive certificates.

         I am pleased to say that most of the recommendations of the committee have been accepted by the government, but there are a number which should not be accepted by the government. There are two in particular to which I wish to turn my attention. The first of those recommendations relates to regulations in relation to the Australian National University and the content of courses. I agree with the committee's report that those items should probably best be excluded from the operation of the bill. That sounds a rather strange suggestion that it would actually reduce, so it would seem, the opportunity for examination of these matters, but these are matters in relation to the subject matter of university courses at the ANU.

       <para first-indent="16">

         It seems rather strange that the ANU should be in a situation where its course material should be subject to the scrutiny of both the House of Representatives and the Senate when, of course, that is not the case in other universities. It just seems to me that it also creates the opportunity at some future date for somebody in just one house of this parliament, not both, to exercise an ability to effectively censor course material at the ANU. If that power to control the course material required an act of Parliament and passed both houses, that would be one matter. But the fact is that course material at the ANU could be disallowed by either house creates the opportunity for rather arbitrary interference with intellectual and academic freedom. That is why I support the recommendation made by the committee. I believe that the government really should turn its attention to that matter again, and I believe this chamber would do well to accept the recommendation of the committee.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other recommendation that the government did not accept is one I also believe the government ought to accept if it is interested in ensuring that people have an opportunity to know the law as it affects them. The recommendation that the committee made on page 7 was that other material which was produced by the office of the principal Legislative Council should be available in printed form.

         The government had said, `Look, that is not necessary, because when one goes to court the court is happy to accept a print-out.' But the whole purpose of allowing people access to the law is so that they can govern their conduct so that they do end up in court. That is why I believe the Attorney-General has erred in not accepting the recommendation. Because if people cannot get access to the law, it then makes the law seem very arbitrary and very unfair. If people have access to the law and relevant documents in relation to those laws, then at least they have an opportunity to acquaint themselves with their obligations under the law. That is why I believe that recommendation should be accepted.

         There is one other matter that was raised in the committee's report and which was not alluded to in the Attorney-General's response.

         Honourable senators will be aware that over the recent winter recess the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was given a power in relation to the Industrial Relations Court rules, to release those rules from the ambit of a protective notice of motion so as to allow them to be re-made. But that was an unprecedented power and a power which the committee decided not to exercise in the particular circumstances.

         However, I believe it is appropriate for the Senate and the parliament to consider a wider power to be given to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and that would be a power to suspend a regulation when the Senate is not sitting. A suspension would not be the same as a disallowance of the instrument, because disallowance of the instrument would therefore make it impossible for that instrument to be re-made within a period of six months. But there are certain circumstances when a legislative instrument could severely restrict the rights of individuals and where to delay dealing with that matter would be a gross contravention of people's civil liberties.

         In those circumstances, I think it is appropriate that the committee should have a power to suspend the operation of that particular item of delegated legislation until such time as the parliament comes back and the matter can be properly dealt with. Whilst the committee did not find it appropriate to recommend that that be added to the bill at this time, the committee was certainly of the view that it should be part of the review in three years time, and I hope that the Attorney-General can give an assurance to this chamber and to the parliament that that will take place. The increasing volume of delegated legislation does give rise to an increasing opportunity to restrict a person's liberties and freedoms unduly. It would be a dreadful thing if a situation were to arise where, if the Senate standing committee had the power to suspend that particular item of delegated legislation, an individual's or a group of individuals' rights would be trammelled in the way in which it is capable of being trammelled at the moment.

         This bill is a retrospective attempt to deal with an issue that has plagued successive immigration ministers in this government. However, it is an issue entirely of the government's own making, and stress that. The opposition recognises the government's dilemma and to this point has done much to help the government attempt to resolve the problem, as I hope the minister will acknowledge. However, the opposition is now of the view that, on balance, this bill is an unacceptable method of tackling the problem. Therefore, we will be voting against the bill in its entirety, and that includes the new section to repeal section 54RA of the Migration Act.

         Before going into detail, I will list the main reasons for our rejection of the bill. The bill is designed to make lawful what is now unlawful. It attempts to change the law so that the unlawful action of depriving boat people of their liberty between November 1989 and May 1992 is now deemed to have been lawful.

         With the exception of the section that repeals section 54RA, this bill is totally retrospective. It applies only to boat people unlawfully detained between November 1989 and 6 May 1992. It has no application to any future unauthorised arrivals; their detention is lawful as a result of the Migration Reform Act, which came into effect on 1 September 1994. The coalition fully supports the detention provisions in that act.

         The bill also breaches several basic principles of law. It condones the proposition that, wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken, the parliament may retrospectively act to cure it. If we accept that proposition, that would, as the Law Council of Australia has said, `destroy or at least significantly diminish the Commonwealth administrative law system'.

         It is quite certain that, if this bill were passed, it would be challenged in the High Court. Legal advice indicates that such a challenge would very likely be successful. Passage of this bill would therefore be unlikely to solve the government's existing problem. It would simply continue the debilitating and unsatisfactory legal wrangles that have been the hallmark in this area of government policy in recent years. A successful challenge would still render the government liable for compensation payments.

         The coalition recognises that failure to pass this bill may cause the government to be required to pay compensation to the claimants involved, although, as I have just said, a likely successful High Court challenge to the bill would in any event render the government so liable. The coalition does not believe, however, that considerations of this nature, unfortunate though they may be, should be permitted to override the fundamental objections to this flawed bill, with its breaches of basic principles of law and with all its damaging implications for the future processes of and confidence in our legal system.

         The repealing of section 54RA, the one section which differentiates this bill from the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), does not in any way change the coalition's attitude to this bill. We supported the introduction of section 54RA a couple of years ago, when it was introduced, to cap the potential compensation payable. Its repealing at this stage is simply yet another cynical exercise designed merely to buy the government more time on this matter. If the government were really serious about repealing section 54RA, it would have facilitated it through separate legislation rather than tacking it on to this already fundamentally flawed bill.

         I would like to go briefly into the background to this whole matter. Unauthorised arrivals in the form of what we call `boat people'â€”mainly Cambodians but Chinese, Vietnamese and some other nationals as wellâ€”began in Australia in November 1989. They were detained under section 88 of the Migration Act. Section 88 is said in the act to apply to `Custody of certain persons during stay of vessel in port'. Early in 1992 several of the Cambodian detainees challenged the legal right of the government to detain them under section 88, which was the only section of the act that could possibly be used as the basis for their detention. This challenge became known as the Lim case after one of the plaintiffs.

         On 9 May 1992, two days before the plaintiff's action for release was due to commence in the courts, the government rushed amendments to the Migration Act through the parliamentâ€”with the support of the coalition. The amendments introduced a new division 4B into the act which validated the continued detention of `a non-citizen who has been on a boat in the territorial sea of Australia after 19 November 1989 and'â€”in effectâ€”`before 1 September 1994'. Of course, 1 September 1994 was the date for the commencement of the new Migration Act which subsumed the past legislation.

         In its decision in the Lim case, handed down on 8 December 1992, the High Court upheld the constitutional validity of division 4B. In its comments, however, it expressed the view that section 88 had not authorised any detention of the plaintiffs prior to 6 May 1992, and that such detention had been unlawful. A majority of the judges held that detention ceased to be lawful under section 88 after the destruction of the boat on which the person arrived or, in other circumstances, if the boat was made unavailable for the person's departure.

         In anticipation that boat people who were now lawfully detained under division 4B after 6 May 1992 might bring a common law action for damages for unlawful detention for the period prior to 6 May 1992, the government rushed through the parliament in late December 1992 another amendment. That was the introduction of the new section 54RA to the Migration Act. This section extinguished the common law right of action for damages for unlawful imprisonment of boat people prior to 6 May 1992, and replaced the common law right with a statutory right, capping the amount of damages payable at $1 per day. The coalition supported that bill, but only after strenuously making it clear that it would not have done so if the bill had contained any element of retrospectivity.

         The prime purpose of the December 1992 bill was to limit the impact of any damages claim made by those deemed illegally detained, although it did contain other amendments to the act in an attempt to put beyond doubt certain aspects of the detention process. In this respect, it extended coverage to include people arriving by boat on or after 1 December 1992 until the commencement of the Migration Reform Act.

         Section 54RA is being challenged in the High Court by 88 of the Cambodians who arrived in Australia by boat prior to May 1992. The High Court was listed to hear the action on 9 October this year. The reason for the introduction of this bill is to encourage the High Courtâ€”which it has doneâ€”to postpone the hearing of that case. I think it is now listed for April 1995.

         The most obvious argument for the challenge is that the diminution of the claim for damages constitutes an acquisition without just terms, contrary to section 51, placitum (xxxi), of the constitution. On 9 March 1994 the High Court gave judgment in four cases concerning the acquisitions power. One of those cases, Georgiadis v. AOTC, has clear similarities to the case being heard by the High Court in a few months time. In the Georgiadis case a majority of the court held:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that extinguishing a course of action for damages in tort against the Commonwealth or one of its agencies amounted to an "acquisition" of property for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution.

        I understand that the government has been advised by its own Solicitor-General that, unless sufficient grounds are made out to distinguish the current case from Georgiadis, it must now be expected that section 54RA will also be held to be invalid. I also understand that the Solicitor-General has advised that there were doubts as to the efficacy of section 54RA when it was first enacted, and that the Georgiadis decision has simply elevated earlier reasoned doubts to near certainty.

         I further understand that the Solicitor-General has concluded that an amendment to section 88, to give it the effect that the government previously thought it had, may be acceptable to the High Court, and that it is on this advice that the government is now seeking to act in the bill before the Senate.

         If the bill were passed, and if it withstood an inevitable strong challenge in the High Court, it would make lawful what the High Court now regards to be unlawfulâ€”that is, the detention of boat people who arrived in Australia between November 1989 and May 1992. As I said, the bill is totally retrospective in this aspect. It applies only to this period of 2 1/2 years to 6 May 1992, almost five years ago and stretching back well beyond that.

         At the request of both ourselves and the Australian Democrats, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)â€”which, as I have mentioned, is almost identical to this billâ€”was referred to the Senate constitutional and legal affairs committee after its introduction into the Senate on 7 June. Before that consideration by the constitutional and legal affairs committee, it was examined by the scrutiny of bills committee.

Coalition membersâ€”Senators Vanstone, Ellison and O'Cheeâ€”opposed the bill. May I publicly congratulate them for what I think was the quite excellent work they put into the work of that committee. Although government members on the committee supported the bill, it is quite clear from the report and the drafting of it that at least some of them held real concerns about bill No. 2, which they obviously still would have to share about this current bill No. 3.

         All witnesses at the constitutional and legal affairs committee public hearingsâ€”with the one exception of the representatives from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Attorney-General's Departmentâ€”strongly opposed the bill. The main objections were objections of legal principle. The Law Council gave three basic objections which reflected the views of the others, because the sole purpose of the bill was to defeat the High Court challenge to section 54RA of the Migration Act.

         The three fundamental objections that the Law Council gave were, firstly, that the bill distorts the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government; secondly, that it `strikes at the very basis of the argument that the common law provides adequate protection against infringement by government of civil liberties'; and, thirdly, that it condonesâ€”entrenchesâ€”the proposition `that wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken the parliament may act retrospectively to cure that. This would destroy or at least significantly diminish the Commonwealth administrative law system'. The Law Council rejected outright the government's argument that the bill is merely curative. As I said earlier, the Solicitor-General apparently also has raised doubts as to whether the High Court would accept the curative argument.

         I also point out that the government's claim that, at the time of the unlawful detention, the minister and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs thought the law gave them the power to detain these people in custody is open to serious question. An internal departmental memo, dated 27 June 1992, presented in evidence to the constitutional and legal affairs committee, expressed the view that destruction of the vessels on which asylum seekers arrived would be likely to result in the automatic ceasing of custody as defined in section 88, leading to an order for release by a court. So, in other words, way back in the middle of 1992 the department was expressing real concerns about the legislative basis for the actions that it was taking.

         This bill is the latest in a long string of actions by this government to attempt to correct policy and administrative failures in the immigration area. If this bill were passed, there would be no guarantee that that would be the end of it. Indeed, the contrary is much more likely to be the case. As I have said, the bill is, on the whole, essentially retrospective. The bill, on the government's own frank admission, has been introduced solely to make lawful what is now unlawful.

         The bill has nothing at all to do with ongoing detention. The question of ongoing detention was settled in May 1992, and it was again addressed with the advent of the Migration Reform Act of 1 September. As I have said before, the bill breaches several basic principles of law. It is quite certain that, if it is passed, it will be challenged in the High Court.

         The financial implications of this matter cannot be estimated with any certainty. It is thought that there could be around 350 persons potentially eligible for compensation for unlawful imprisonment if the bill is rejected and if the High Court upholds the challenge to section 54RA, assuming that section still exists if these matters go ahead. It is likely, however, that the actual number of people would be much less than that.

         Estimates vary as to likely compensation payments. One quite extreme upper figure of $200,000 per person has been mentioned by one source. If that were the average, and 300 people received this amount, the total payout would be $60 million. However, it is virtually certain that the amount would be very significantly less than this. The number of applicants is likely to be well less than 300, and the average compensation payment very much less than $200,000. I stress this: the passage of the bill would not necessarily protect the revenue anyway, because a High Court challenge to it could be successful.

         The opposition hopes that, in the event of the High Court ruling section 54RA unconstitutional as expected in April next year, any consequential compensation determination would take full account of all the circumstances. These include the fact that in many cases those who were detained for long periods of time were detained of their own volition because they chose to pursue their applications for refugee status in the courts after failing to accept rejection decisions at the two-tier administrative level.

         â€”I shall not detain the Senate long to traverse yet again the arguments that have been placed before the Senate. The government is well aware of these arguments as a result of the report on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 which was prepared by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.

         The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 is similar to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) in all material aspects. It removes the section which limits compensation to $1 a day, but it does not cure the other defects which have been placed before the Senate by the Australian Democrats and others as well as through the committee's dissenting reports.

         It is surprising, therefore, that the government is wasting the time of the Senate in bringing this bill before it. The only reason for the government doing this is that it wants to provide the first leg of a trigger for a double dissolution. No doubt, we will see this bill again for this very purpose early next year. The Australian Democrats, the coalition parties and the Greens have stated very clearly that this legislation is unsatisfactory on a number of grounds and will be voted down by the Senate. So why waste the time of the Senate, except to provide the government with the first leg of a double dissolution trigger?

         The bill continues, as the No. 2 bill did, to retrospectively authorise the detention of asylum seekers and to remove the right to obtain proper compensation for unlawful detention, even though the matter is before the High Court, where the government expects to receive an unfavourable decision. To pass this bill would be to condone an executive government changing the law to avoid legal liability.

         The bill also offends against the principle of separation of powers, and the right of citizens to obtain just compensation when property or the right to property is appropriated by government. As has been said before, it is also likely to be challenged on the grounds that the bill deals with matters beyond the constitutional power to legislate on matters concerning aliens.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The bill, if passed, would certainly be subject to challenge in the High Court and hence would prolong rather than end the now long drawn-out process in the courts on this matter. It should be rejected. The Australian Democrats will be voting against it.

         â€”The long awaited Senate discussion on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 and, indeed, the earlier piece of legislation, is welcomed by those on this side of the chamber for the very simple reason that it gives the Senate, the upper house of the Australian parliament, the opportunity to make a choice between the lawful, law abiding, taxpaying citizens of this country and some people who have chosen to take the laws of Australia into their own hands, breach our migration laws and determine that they know better as to whether or not they should be allowed to settle in this country. It is a very clear and stark choice.

         I issue a challenge now to those opposite and to my colleagues from the Greens (WA) to go out into the community and debate publicly the provisions contained in this legislation. Let members of the community take a stand on whether they support this legislation or whether they support the possibility of Australian taxpayers forking out up to $100 million in compensation for people who were held unlawfully for a short time and who initially had arrived illegally in this country. That is a challenge that I hope will be taken up. I already know who is going to win because of the responses that are coming into my office from right around Western Australia and from many other parts of Australia. The community is not supportive of the actions of the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens in what I think they intend to do by voting this bill down later this morning. That is a sad reflection on them and the abrogation of their responsibilities to the Australian community.

         I seek to correct part of what Senator Short said in his speech. He said that a challenge to section 88 of the Migration Act was mounted in the High Court. That is not true. With regard to the people in question, the people held in what is now deemed to be a technically unlawful situation for a period of 2 1/2 years, never at any time during that 2 1/2 year period was there a legal challenge mounted against the lawfulness of their custody. Nobody in any of the courts challenged the validity of that section. Section 88 and the possibility of unlawfulness came to public notice when the High Court, in adjudicating in the Lim case, which Senator Short correctly identified, drew attention to it. But it was not the question which was under the scrutiny of the High Court at the time.

         Many people have been involved in this issue since the first boat arrived here in November 1989, including some eminent legal persons from around Australia. Certainly, at least one judge who comes to mind has made public statements. But until the High Court handed down the Lim decision nobody drew any attention to the possibility of unlawfulness in respect of that section.

         This matter is itemised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, the bill that preceded the piece of legislation now before the Senate. I wish to emphasise this point because much has been written about this saga. Indeed, a great deal has been written on the topic by the advocates and supporters of the boat people.

         I refer to the Refugee Council of Australia, which was engaged by government to provide legal representation to people held in detention and which issued many statements and reports during that time. Never once did it draw attention to the possibility that section 88 might be unlawful. We know that the High Court drew attention to that matter. I do not knock the High Court for doing its job, but it has created a problem for the government. It was an unfortunate error that people were held under the provisions of that section, but the error once pointed out was corrected.

         It appears that once the error was pointed out, some people took the view `Aha, we can make a quid out of this.' This affected the boat people themselves and, more likely, their legal representatives, many of whom had given their services and time free of charge to the litigants. If ultimately there is an award of damages to such people for unlawful detention, undoubtedly the lawyers who provided their services free of charge at the time will now be able to claim back from the individuals who receive compensation. Some, if not all, the fees will be able to be claimed, and of course the cost will fall on the taxpayer. Obviously Australian citizens are charged fees by lawyers when they act for them in normal legal procedures that take place daily.

         â€”Senator Short intervenes to say that it is unrealistic, and people have said that the figure is somewhat fanciful. However, I do not think we should be so eager to dismiss the figure. The claim was made in a submission by an eminent individual who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The lady in question made her submission in writing and elaborated on her claim under questioning by members of the committee. The person who made the claim was Dr Mary Crock, a lawyer and publisher who has written many books, one of which is to be published shortly according to evidence she gave to the committee. I do not think Dr Crock should be dismissed easily. She is held in very high regard within the community that she associates with, namely, those who support refugees. I do not wish to knock such people, because indeed I support refugees. However, I have problems with people who support those who purport to be refugees. The sum of $100 million, if finally awarded through the court processes, will come from the pockets of taxpayers; taxpayers who have had enough of the exploitation of the system that has now gone on for almost five yearsâ€”since 1989.

Love did blossom in the detention camp in Port Hedland, I am very pleased to record, and I am also very pleased to record that they have now publicly solemnised their marriage and will next year, upon their return to Australia, further solemnise it under Australian law, which is somewhat different from Cambodian law.

         As time has passed, the response from the government has become increasingly hysterical, in both its public statements and its legislative attempts to deal with what it obviously considers to be a major problem. But, increasingly, we are seeing that the government's legislative response is trying to turn back the clock. I wish the government would turn it back as far as the time when our country was noted for its compassionate, warm response to the Vietnamese boat people. However, the government is not turning it back that far. This bill is the most blatant and obnoxious example of turning the clock back to the degree of retrospectively making legal by parliament what was found to be illegal by the courts.

In the long saga of the asylum seekers who are being held in Port Hedland or Villawood, this action merely confirms what many of us have been saying for a long time. The government is concerned about border control and about the political messages that would be sent out if it allowed people to stay and it will do anything to deny these people right of entry. It is vindictive in the extreme towards the individuals concerned and constantly has one eye on its trade relationships, which it puts before human lives.

         â€”I do not doubt that it may well have saved the government hundreds of millions of dollars that could have legitimately been given in the courts as compensation. I wonder if I am being too cynical here in wondering whether the government did not have much to lose. Here it was putting to the Senate a bill that would repeal that reprehensible clause, saying, `If we pass the bill the opposition is hoist on its own petard. We have hundreds of thousands of dollars. It will be a terrific political statement we can make that the government, in spite of itself, was unable to prevent the opposition supporting its own legislation, removing this reprehensible clause and making the taxpayer have to re-double the expenditure, which is already hundreds of millions of dollars, on detaining refugees illegally.'

         Instead, it wins both ways, because now that we are going to reject the bill we are going to save the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation. But does the government also get a win here? Is it able to say to the High Court, `We did try to repeal this dollar a day compensation limitation. It was the Senate that would not let us get it through'? If that helps the government in its challenge in the High Court for that previously reprehensible clause, well may it do so. I wish the government luck, because I think that the conduct of this government has been disgraceful in regard to every single piece of migration legislation it has passed in this chamber since I have been present here.

I am absolutely delighted today that the majority of the Senate, the parliament, through its powers, is exercising responsibility in putting a check on the government and making it accountable for what it has been doing since 1992, if not earlier. The boat people who have been detained in Villawood and Port Hedland stand as testimony against this government. It will have to wear that immoral judgment at some point.

         Those on the other side of the chamber say that this bill should pass to rectify the government's unlawful detention of people on the basis that these people are not Australian citizens. That is the substance of what the government is saying. It is saying that these people who came here seeking asylum have been unlawfully detained, that the courts have decided that their detention is unlawful and that it does not want to have to cough up the compensation. That is what this bill is all about. It is based solely on the nationality of the people who are detained.

But the flaw in that argument is this: the government comes before this parliament and asks it to rubber stamp its illegal and unprincipled actions, but when Australians are unlawfully detained in another country this same government seeks a different standard from that country. Australians are absolutely outraged when Australian citizens are unlawfully detained in other countries. We hear no end of complaint.

It was not a question about detention; the issue of detention was not in dispute. But the fact that the boat was not going on to Antarctica, or to New Zealand or go backwards was the technicality.

         â€”Let us accept that 350 people are claiming $200,000 eachâ€”that is what their representatives are talking about. We cannot run away from the fact that they are talking about an amount of somewhere between $70 million to over $100 million. Even if we took Senator Short's figure of $60 million, I could still do all those things I was talking about. Let us not quibble about that amount. What we do know is that the claim before the High Court is not for a set amount; it is for open-ended damagesâ€”open-ended compensation. The reality is that we are trying to restore to the legislation the intention that everyone knew it had at the time we applied it. We are doing it because our advice isâ€”contrary once again to what Senator Short is sayingâ€”that we have more than reasonable prospects of a majority upholding the validity of the law.

It is a windfall of $150 million to people who, when they applied to stay here and went through the processes, had no understandingâ€”nor did their lawyersâ€”that they were being held under a section of a piece of legislation that was an inappropriate one. There is no question about the detention. Senator Short does not disagree that they should have been kept in detention. It is all about what section they were kept under.

         â€”The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill went to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and I imagine that my colleague Senator Ellison might want to say something about that later. There is just one particular aspect I want to raise in relation to some amendments being moved by the government subsequent to the hearing. These amendments were not canvassed at the hearing, but the Attorney-General wrote to the then chairman of the committee, Senator Cooney, advising him of these amendments which, by and large, are uncontroversial. There is just one aspect that I think is probably all right; therefore, we would not seek to delay the passage of the bill because of it, but it does deserve an airing.

         As senators might remember, under the crimes search warrants and procedures legislation magistrates need to give approval for certain searches to be undertaken. As I understand it, as a consequence of a case generally referred to as the Grollo case, that sort of work is regarded as being administrative work. Federally, because we try to keep a close watch on the constitutional requirement to keep a separation of powers, we do not want to give judicial officers administrative tasks and vice versa.

         We have a situation where magistrates who normally do work for the states have been happy to take on work for the Commonwealth. There are people in each state ready to do this work, but they are concerned of the position they might be in because, if they are acting in a federal capacity, there might not be a separation of powers. So someone had the bright idea, which was apparently used in the telecommunications interception legislation and in customs legislation as well, of how to solve this problem. The idea was that we would not give them this power in their judicial capacity and that we would give it to them in their personal capacity.

         People instantly think that is okay because they can have it in their personal capacity; that is, until they think about it a bit. While they are thinking about it someone says, `And by the way, we'll also give them immunity from civil action in case they make a mistake when exercising this power.' In other words, to all intents and purposes we will get as close as we can to treating them as judicial officers and get them to do this administrative work.

         That begs the question whether this scheme would be seen on closer reflection as being just a ruse, a sort of veneer, to get over the problem of separation of powers. It is a problem we have more so than the states. It is not a problem for the states. They do not have such a closely restricted set of constitutional arrangements that require them to keep such a distinct separation, so it is okay for them. But, as I understand it, the Commonwealth advice is that since the Grollo case it is not okay for us. So the magistrates understandably say, `Well, look, we don't mind doing this work for you,' and the states, in their capacity as states, say, `Well, we don't mind our magistrates doing this work either.' But if we are going to give it to them in the personal capacity, they need to have this protection. I suspect it is a bit of veneer and something that, in the end, we need to look at more closely.

         Of course, to our shame we have missed this sort of problem before. Some of the bankruptcy legislation comes to mind where there was a keen rush to get bankrupts who could also be described as crooks and who escaped with their money to ensure that they gave as much of their money, as properly should go to creditors, to creditors. Because of that we gave some sort of capacity to the receiver to make a declaration of certain matters and then to register it, I think, if there was no objection, as an order of the court. Perhaps there did not even need to be an objection, I think people just make the declaration and go and do it. The whole thing was thrown out because we forgot that what we were doing was giving someone, other than a judicial officer, judicial powers.

         When it was pointed out, it was as clear as a bell to everyone. We said, `Oh, yes, that is clear. We will fix that,' but we did not see it at the time when it was staring at us. Maybe there is not a problem in using this ruseâ€”and I am not using that as a pejorative term, I just cannot think of another way to describe what I meanâ€”to get around this problem. Maybe it is not a problem because the states do not have this need to keep such a distinction. But I suspect there is a problem there that we have not yet completely isolated. That is the matter I would like us to look at in the future. It is going to happen more and more, one imagines, where we will wantâ€”commonsense prevailingâ€”cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth, and there may be other areas where we want judicial officers to undertake administrative tasks. I do not think, therefore, that this is just an isolated incident that we can sweep under the carpet and not worry about until later.

         The government may say, `Why are you agreeing to it today?' I have been convinced today that it is okay, but that is because I have only seen the arguments at first blush and I see the need to get this system working. I also understand that no-one may challenge it, so it might be effective for quite awhile, in any event. But that does not mean that one should not flag the problem and ask that we look at it to see if we can resolve it for future times.

         I think that is the only particular matter that I want to raise. I understand that the government, in the fifth amendment, is deleting the amendments to the Trade Practices Act because it was thought that they would extend police powers. I understand the argument that it did not. It actually narrowed it down but, nonetheless, that amendment has been given away.

         The fourth amendment by the government is the one I have just dealt with. I am trying to get over this problem of what is and what is not judicial power. The third amendment relates to some copyright matters and seems to be inconsequential, as does the second amendment, in relation to the Law Officers Act. I remind senators that that was to have the capacity to always have someone who could step in as the Solicitor-General, and we were happy to accept that. But then there was a problem because Gavan Griffith is off at the UNâ€”there is already someone acting in his placeâ€”and I understand this amendment needed to make sure that the acting person at the moment is not affected by that and it will all be okay. I suppose they are words we really have to watch out for when a government says them to us, but I do understand the purpose of the amendment. It seems perfectly sensible, so we have no concern with it. I look forward to the passage of the bill.

         â€”This bill introduces a pro rata payment threshold on the repayment of HECS liabilities for students who leave full-time education for the first time. These changes, which I will detail in a moment, we will oppose because we believe they are inequitable and unfair, and because the provisions contain what seem to us to be unexplainable anomalies. There are, however, other provisions in the bill which we either support or will not oppose.

         These other amendments include removing the restriction on the number of units for which an eligible client under the open learning deferred payments scheme may defer payment in the first semester of study, an amendment to the maximum level of grant funding available under certain provisions of the act to reflect the revised amount available following verification of relevant HECS information, and an amendment to provide for the transfer of funds to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. There is a minor change to the definition of overseas student to ensure that members of foreign armed forces studying in Australia pay full fees rather than HECS. There are also some technical amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act 1994.

         As I indicated, we are not opposing these matters but we do oppose the attempt to introduce pro rata payments of HECS. We believe that this bill is probably just the first of a series of such changes that are going to be forced upon students who have incurred a HECS liability. It has been estimated that the effect of the pro rata payments part of the legislation will be to bring forward the payment of $5 million for each of the next three years. It should be stressed that this is not extra revenue, but an attempt by the government to force earlier payment upon students; that is, earlier payment than that which students understood they would have to pay under the HECS arrangement that they entered into at the commencement of their course. The government has offered support for the education of students on the basis that they accept a liability to repay a portion of the cost under HECS. Now the government is bringing forward that liability to the disadvantage of a number of students.

         No notice was given of that. It was not included in the budget. It is one of these measures that the government was seeking to impose upon students without notice until the introduction of this bill. I might say that it is a provision that is not well understood within the student community, and I am sure that as the attempt by government to do it becomes better understood the student community will be extremely disappointed.

         It fits with the same attitude that the government exhibited when it unilaterally decided to lower the HECS threshold and when it similarly decided in the past to increase the HECS repayment. Over a period of time since the introduction of HECS we have seen further attempts by government to extract greater revenue from students by these means. This is just another step in that series.

         I would like to further explain the situation as to the students that this measure will affect and the circumstances in which they will be affected. The pro-rata HECS payment will apply to persons who leave full-time education for the first time and achieve full-time employment within the same financial year. Normally, students finish their course in November or December. If they obtain full-time employment in, say, May or June of the following year, they will have to repay pro-rata HECS for those two months. As the law stands now, they are not obliged to do that because the law applies an annual threshold based on average weekly earnings. On that basis, they would not have passed the threshold and would not be liable for repayment in their first two months of employment. However, if this legislation passes today in its current form, they will then become liable.

         The government does not seem to understand that many of those students leave university having had to support themselves for the whole of their final year. Often they have had to borrow in advance on their anticipated earnings from their anticipated employment. For many of them, vacation income, if they are lucky to get some, or the few months of full-time employment that they get at the end of that one year has to sustain them for the whole of the previous year. Presumably, that is why the government in its original plan did not intend to require repayment of pro-rata HECS during the first few months of their employment. But, for no reason that has been given to the parliament or to students, the government has now changed its mind and decided that they should be paying immediately upon gaining that full-time employment.

         I do not think the government understands that many of these students, upon completing their tertiary studies, are in quite difficult financial circumstances. Many have had to borrow to complete their education. Under the system that I understand exists with a number of the private banks, interest repayments are not required during the term of students' studies but are required as soon as they graduate. There are also obligations in respect of ancillary university fees which become immediately liable for repayment, in many instances being payable before students are permitted to graduate. In fact, many students are now having to borrow quite considerable sums of money to maintain themselves during their education.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I suppose that the government has acknowledged that to some extent by providing systems through which students can borrow to pay for their education. But all of these debts immediately become payable as soon as students graduate. That period, therefore, is quite a difficult financial time for students. In such circumstances it is hard to understand why the government has decided to extract from them so early payment of at least part of their HECS liability.

         The provision also contains a number of strange anomalies. For example, if students have been, say, unemployed because of maternity leave or for some other reason and then get into full-time employment, this provision does not apply at all. There does not seem to be any consistency between the position of those students and people who have, in effect, been out of the work force because of the period that they have been in full-time study. No sensible explanation has been given by the government for that anomaly.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The legislation also states that it is pro rata in that the threshold as a consequence of ceasing full-time education will occur only once in a person's lifetime. Why should that be so? If people return to full-time study and incur a subsequent HECS liability and then complete that course, why should their obligation to repay not start until the beginning of the following financial year? Yet the obligation of students who are completing their first period of full-time study in fact starts earlier. I would have thought logic would suggest that, if anything, it should be the other way roundâ€”that people who have gone back and utilised the system twice might be more likely to expect the earlier obligation rather than the people who are coming out of that first period of full-time education. These anomalies come out of what is a very complex scheme that the government is seeking to apply to students to extract just a small amount of extra revenue.

         As I said, we suspect that this provision will set a precedent for further legislation which will apply HECS pro rata to any part-time income. There is no doubt, in our collective minds anyway, that the next step by government will be that students' vocational income, provided that it is over average weekly earnings on a proportionate basis, will incur an earlier repayment of HECS liability as well. That seems to us to be the logical next step from what the government is seeking to do by this piece of legislation. But again the government has not come clean in relation to that intention.

         In all the circumstances, we therefore do not believe the government has made its case for this earlier repayment of HECS. I think students have been misled by government. They are entitled to be, as I said, quite disappointed by the attitude of government in relation to their circumstances and the attitude of government in not understanding the financial difficulties that are incurred by students in education, and in particular the difficulties that they have when they complete a period of full-time tertiary study.

         As a primer on how to lie, cheat and bully one's way to political success, Graham Richardson's book is worth the $39.95. As a compendium of the sort of behaviour that has made politics so unacceptably rotten to so many Australians, it is only partly successful, because it leaves out so many of former Senator Richardson's achievements. Richardson used his trademark facade of disarming apparent honesty to try to convert the anti-democratic practices and political thuggery of a New South Wales right wing warrior into justifiable, often whimsical, commonplace actions that anyone in his situation would have doneâ€”and anyway, the Left was doing it too. His book is `an essay in the accumulation and exercise of power.' The revelations of the Hawke-Keating leadership battle, and before that the Hayden-Hawke war, are illustrations of Richardson's revelling in exercising that power: a surge of adrenaline `better than sex and almost as exciting as a good feed.'

         One of the more remarkable examples of this self-gratification is in his incomplete explanation for deciding to ditch Hawke for Keating after Richardson, Labor's hero in delivering the Green preferences needed to keep Hawke in office in 1990, was denied his request to become minister for transport and communications. The transport bit, of course, was incidental. This job was basically minister for Murdoch, Packer and Black, a set of relationships prized by Hawke himself. An operator like Richardson, with his tribal loyalty to the New South Wales Right, of which Keating was a member, was the last person Hawke would allow to be interposed between himself and such vitally important people, so the job went to good old reliable Beazley.

         Naturally, Peter Barron, the former Hawke staffer now with the Packer group, was the longstanding mate that Richardson phoned in a fury that night, saying of Hawke, `I'll get this bastard; I'll do whatever it takes, but I'll get him.' Richardson's thoroughly unconvincing explanation as to why his not getting communications was so important that it warranted destroying a Labor prime minister raises more questions than it answers. Eventually, after the Keating putsch in December 1991â€”20 months laterâ€”Richardson got transport and communications, only to lose it after six months when he resigned over the Marshall Islands affair.

         But was this power really there, or was it mainly in the eye of the press gallery? To an extent Richardson could exercise power because the media, under his enthusiastic prompting, kept on asserting that he was powerful. It is remarkable that this book reveals nothing of how this power was acquired by `a paunchy, urbanised, sedentary'â€”according to Hawkeâ€”unprepossessing person who dropped out of university and enjoyed a very non-commanding presence, and how tangible this power really was.

The left wing of the ALP in New South Wales had strong views about Richardson's use of power, which it categorised as an abuse of power in a document with that title in 1982. I quote from it:

         When Richardson poses the personal dilemmas involved when he `had to reconcile personal and factional loyalties, weigh up conscience against threat, personal integrity against the welfare of the party and, of course, the public lie against the private truth', there was an inevitability about the manner of their resolution. `Not every reader will approve the way in which I have conducted myself over the last 20 years. The Marquess of Queensberry's rules never applied to Labor.' Naturally his political hero was Neville Wran who `just did it without worrying too much about the niceties of democracy.'

         It is nonsense for him to plead that the Westminster system requires politicians to lie. His colleagues in cabinet now protest that they do not lie, but it does seem clearly to have become part of the culture of the New South Wales Labor right wing, which has created the new synonym for political lying, `Doing a Richo.' I would assume that his factional colleagues have now learnt from his example.

         To make Richardson a political hero is, on the basis of his own book, to diminish even further the status and standing of politicians. It is to tar all politicians with the Richardson brush, to set him up as the standard, so that those of us who refuse to live by Richo's rotten rules are dismissed as wimps, incompetents and easybeats. His dictum that `power is attractive and absolute power is irresistible' reinforces Lord Acton's admonition that power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely. The problem is that those corrupted by power seldom recognise the fact. On the evidence of this book, it is fortunate that Mr Richardson has forsaken political power for journalism, or does even greater power now reside in the media?

It was agreed here yesterday that a Senate committee should inquire into the adequacy of the disclosure provisions for Australian prime ministers who acquire assets while in office, and this followed an overwhelming defeat for the government in the Senate.

         The government was defeated by 42 votes to 24 when it opposed my motion to refer to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee the question of disclosure and accountability of prime ministers for their acquisitions of assets and liabilities while in office for report by 1 December. I said at the time that there was no specific requirement for prime ministers to meet the standards required of ministers who must be accountable by revealing to their Prime Minister details of their financial situation; I said that there is no-one to whom prime ministers should be accountable. The fact that the motion was supported by the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine, after I accepted a Democrat amendment to include the Leader of the Opposition in the reference, is of some significance. The fact that the Leader of the Opposition does not exercise executive power means that that amendment was nonsensical, but I was quite happy to accept it because this was a significant resolution by this Senate. According to the bulk of the media it was not a fact; it did not exist.

         Today I wish to address an issue which I have raised here before, which relates to the provision of goods and hampers to drought affected areas. I have raised concerns before about the fact that donations in the form of goods were being sent from city areas to the rural areas that are drought affected, and the effect that this has upon the small businesses and the supermarkets within those communities. It means that, if food hampers and goods are sent, the small businesses and the small shopkeepers in the communities are not able to sell their produce and their goods. They are suffering a cash flow problem and will continue to do so. It is a major problem.

I have spoken to the farmhand appeal; I have spoken to the Smith Family; I have spoken to the Salvation Army people; I have spoken to people from St Vincent de Paul and Careforce. They all tell me that the best way to provide aid is to provide cash, because this cash can be given to the people in those areas, they can then prioritise their greatest needs and use the money for themâ€”and not be sent a parcel that might contain two tins of Milo when there is nobody in the house that drinks Milo.

I have also spoken to Councillor Wally Mitchell, the President of the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales, who expresses the same concern. That is, if we are going to help the rural areasâ€”and people should be helping the rural areas by making donationsâ€”then let us maximise the assistance we give. Let us help both the farmers and the small businesses. To do this, the best way is to make cash donations.

         I am aware that in my home town of Bathurst, and also in Orange, Coles has a big box in the supermarket saying, `Help the farmers: donate non-perishable goods' so it can give a hamper. There may be the odd Coles supermarket in the small communities, but usually the major supermarket chains do not have a presence thereâ€”and if they do, there will only be one. Usually it is a local small business person who is running a supermarket. By sending non-perishable goods to these communities, people are reducing the amount of income that these businesses receive and run the risk of sending those people out of business.

         This means that when the drought is over, and even before then, people in Bourke, say, would have to travel to Dubbo to do their basic commodity shopping. Now we have the situation where people are crying out because small country towns are already under threat from the larger towns. The larger towns and communities provide a very valuable support, but the smaller communities are under threat. Sending goods to drought afflicted areas runs the risk of undermining these small businesses and towns even further, and removing any support mechanisms that might be there now and that might be needed for future times. By all means, donate to these hampers, but let us see whether we can do something like having big raffles in the areas that can afford to donate goods and raise a lot of money, then give that money to farmhand.

         The farmhand project is still alive and well. The government is offering a dollar for dollar donation and at this stage has given in excess of $6 million to farmhand. Farmhand is now targeting its donations and assistance to the areas just outside the exceptionally drought declared areas, so that those who in the next few months, if the drought does not break, are declared to be in exceptional drought circumstances will be able to get some assistance from farmhand. It is vitally important that we look at the best ways of providing this assistance. The best way is to donate money to farmhand, to the Salvation Army, to the Smith Family, to St Vincent de Paulâ€”to one of the agencies there to help people. They have all told me that cash is the best way, because it enables people to meet their own priorities.

         When I was in Bourke and Enngonia last week I was talking to a number of people who had received assistance from farmhand. The sorts of things that they had used the money for varied markedly. Somebody had lost a house and its contents in a fire. For that person the most urgent priority was not to buy groceries; it was to get a fridge to put in the house to put things in. For somebody else it was to pay the telephone bill. They had worked out in their own budgets what their highest priorities were, and their highest priorities were not food parcels but other necessities of life. If we give people money, financial assistance, they are able to make decisions for themselves as to what their priorities are and it is less of a charitable type of thing. It is very important that we actually look at how we can assist.

         To make cash donations is a way to have a win-win situation or, rather, a win-in-win situation. The farmers can win by receiving cash amounts to spend as their priorities and needs dictate. The local communities can benefit because the farmers will spend the money in their local communities and keep the businesses and infrastructure in these communities going. The people donating can know that they are getting the maximum benefit for their dollar. They can also be allowed to feel good about being able to help, and know that their assistance is not in the long term going to have a detrimental effect upon the communities and infrastructure in these small rural areas. It is absolutely essential that this be looked at, and looked at carefully.

They are going to have to keep living in those communities after the drought has broken and they will have need of this infrastructure which, if we give donations in kind, donations of goods, is eroded. If groups feel they must give hampers, they should buy the hamper in the area that is being affected, so that again the money is circulating in that area. I cannot re-emphasise enough that it is important to help everybody in these areas.

         Coles in Bathurst is collecting non-perishables for distribution. I wonder what happens when this goes to small country towns and communities which do not have a Coles storeâ€”they may have one major chain in the area but they will have a small business person who runs a supermarket. Coles or Woolworths, or whoever is running this program, benefits because somebody in the community buys the goods to put in the box for the hamper. The local community does not benefit a great deal; some people get some goods that they may or may not want. The risk is run of closing down the small business, the small supermarket, in the small community town. When the drought is over, or even before the drought is over, people will be forced to travel 50, 60 or 100 kilometres, or 100 or 300 miles, to do their grocery shopping. Who benefits then? It is Coles and Woolworths, the majors, or whoever has run the program. It means that people have longer trips to buy their commodities, greater expense and such types of things. It is a little unfair and it needs people to think through very carefully just what the impact is going to be and how we can make sure that we maximise everything.

         As I said, I do not want to be critical of those people who are making donations and those people who are organising for assistance to these areas, but I urge them to look very constructively and very carefully at how they can maximise the benefit of these donations. I would contend, and everybody I have spoken to would contend, that the best way of doing this is to provide financial assistance so that those people can spend the money as they need to. That way, people can spend the money and not rely on hampers, so that if they walk into a shop they are spending money like everybody else doesâ€”nobody needs to know where that money has come from, and they can do it with pride and with dignity.

         We need to make sure that the shopsâ€”the infrastructureâ€”in those towns remain. We also need to make sure that those people donating are aware that their donation is benefiting the maximum number of people in those communities. As I have said, the farmhand appeal now is targeting those who fall outside other criteria, such as those who are ineligible for assistance under the criteria for exceptional drought circumstances, so those people should be looking to get assistance. It is going to require consultation and cooperation on the part of many people and many groups, but it can be done and it should be done.

I would suggest that if people want to maximise the amount of money they get out of the government they should make sure they give plenty to farmhand, because we have got a pledge to match this dollar for dollar. It is very important that people recognise this. They should keep making sure that they do donate, but donate in a way that is going to maximise the benefit to those people out there, to the whole of the community and not just to one member.

Not everybody would chose to have several tins of Milo. People may not want to have dog biscuits.

         I mentioned the last time I spoke that ten tonnes of potatoes went to Bourke. What happened was that in a number of areas potatoes went rotten. They went rotten in the stores that were not selling them. Their turnover of potatoes dropped markedly, therefore the potatoes were stored for longer than they needed to be, and that caused a problem. Also, they were donated in bags that were quite significant in size, and people were not getting halfway through them when the potatoes were staying fresh. Where only a husband and wife or two or three people were eating potatoes, by the time they got towards the bottom of the bag they were again having rotten potatoes. That is a waste of a precious commodity. Nobody did it intentionally, and I am not being critical, but it highlights the need for people to be able to choose to get the commodities they need as they need them, in the size and type that they need.

         So I reiterate again and againâ€”and I will continue to do soâ€”that people making a donation should try to make sure that it is in cash. If somebody does build up a hamper, why not raffle it in the community for which money is being raised? Then the money can go to farmhand or any of the other charitable organisations and supporting organisations, so that the maximum benefit is obtained for all involved. This will have to happen and continue to happen, but that is the plea that I would make to everybody: make sure you get the maximum benefit for your dollar that is being expended.

Yet the government, through one of its departmental officers, criticises these groups for not getting their message across.

         Fisher's attitude is typically myopic of someone who has been cloistered in Canberra, away from the real world, for far too long. The government's abysmal record on consultation and negotiation on previous conventions is a view shared by many, including Mr Geoff Allen from the Allen Consulting Group.

         The departmental attitude flies in the face of the government's stated intention to consult and it is almost certain that the government will proceed to ratification of this convention with only limited consultation. With the advice it is receiving from the department, it is no wonder that concerned business and farm groups regard the government's commitment to consultation to be merely token and not real. There is an opportunity and a real test for the government to make some genuine reform in this area. It is for this reason that I raise this issue, yet again, as a matter of public interest.

The point of raising them today is to further assist in a much needed educative process for the government and to encourage it to continue its somewhat hesitant first steps at accountability to the Australian public. The issues are: firstly, the government's intention to submit a voluntary national action plan; secondly, the treaty making process, and the need for consultation with the states along with broader community involvement, including greater transparency, parliamentary scrutiny and accountability; thirdly, the use of the executive prerogative and the non-exclusive nature of the external affairs power; fourthly, desertification, as a local or regional as opposed to a global issue; fifthly, north and south economic adjustments; and, sixthly, trade and unintended implications of treaty making.

Basically, developed countries like Australia and the United States did not want to give aid money to Third World countries to stop the spread of deserts unless those Third World countries had National Action Programs in place to demonstrate that the money wouldn't be wasted.

I invite members of the public and, indeed, members of DFAT who are interested in such matters, to read very closely the views of the mining and farming industries. In relation to the climate change convention, for example, there was quite a degree of concern expressed in relation to that particular framework convention, particularly as we go towards next March when there will be major negotiations taking place.

It is not only business that was concerned about the negotiations and the way that the whole Basel convention was signed. There was a leaked letter from the US Department of State which expressed the greatest concern for the way Mr Lamb chaired the final negotiations on these hearings. It felt that there was not sufficient debate about the impact that this convention would have. Again, we need a response from the minister, because it is those concerns which are building up in the community.

Senator Chapman drew our attention, quite rightly, to some particular trade issues which may emerge. One way that conventions in the future can be enforced, or attempted to be enforced, is the use of the trade weapon. Again, the evidence that was given to the hearings on this particular matter was particularly instructive.

For example, there was a report card referred to in an estimates committee hearingâ€”the ninth periodic report of the government of Australia to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. I have to say that a fair-minded person reading such a report card would think that Australia was one of the most racially intolerant, bigoted countries in this world.

         Why an Australian government would file such a unbalanced report beggars belief, but unfortunately this is the attitude of this government to the UN. As Senator Chapman says, it seems to be overtly zealous and, indeed, quite naive about the impact that these reports can have. This issue of naivety came up in relation to the first report card that we gave on climate change, which was filed last month. This is what the evidence to the committee showed about the whole approach to filing this report card. I quote Mr Hadler of the International Farmers as follows:

What is the advantage to this country in filing a report to the United Nations which portrays us in such a bad light?

         The UN Convention on Desertification, has brought quite a few issues to a head. The government has signed the convention, but now it says it will consult with business and the states before it ratifies the convention. My view is that the government will be placed in a difficult position, because it is now being asked by businessâ€”and, I am sure, by the statesâ€”to give a guarantee that it will not file a national action program. If it refuses to accede to these requests, the strong advice from business and, I suspect, ultimately from the states will be not to ratify this particular convention. It will be interesting to see, when the government is faced with this dilemma, just what road it is prepared to take. What substance do we give to the consultative arrangements that Senator Evans and Mr Lavarch flagged so recently? I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the government is about to undertake a major test in relation to its sincerity on the consultative arrangements with the states and with business.

         In particular, there is the question of why the fund manager transferred about $450,000 from secure investments to the high risk, unlisted property trusts sometime between June 1990 and June 1991. More to the point: what was Mr Maranta's involvement in that decision? It should be noted that not only was Mr Maranta chairman of directors of the fund manager Northern Securities but he was also the principal executive officer during that period. Therefore, he was running the company that ignored the indicative investment authority given by the employer and made the investment decision to increase investments in the Norsec property trusts by $450,000. Thus the exposure of the McDonnell and East workers' superannuation savings to these high risk investments was effectively increased to a whopping 80 per cent.

         There is another decision relating to the superannuation fund's investment which is also somewhat puzzling. In June 1992, the employer, North Quay Ltd, supposedly gave a new investment authority which authorised the fund manager and trustee to invest 70 per cent of the funds in the Norsec property trusts. This new investment authority was given at a time of the property trust's rights issue. North Quay management claimed that it thought the authority was needed to take up a $250,000 investment in the rights issue, whereas the fund manager's response was that it was quite clearly a new investment authority. It should be noted that the fund manager initiated the new authority, not North Quay management.

         How can we be sure that the employer had really wanted to make the change at that time, rather than merely going along with the fund manager's suggestion? The most telling point here is that, if the superannuation fund's asset allocation had been in accordance with the original investment authority at the time of the rights issue offer, the fund would have been entitled to take up only some amount that would have been a small fraction of the $250,000 that was taken up.

         If that had occurred, the superannuation fund would have avoided the substantial losses in the value of those property trust units in the following 12 months. This point demonstrates that several years down the track the superannuation fund's financial troubles can be traced back to that decision taken in the first year of the superannuation fund's operation, to substantially increase the fund's investment in Northern Securities property trusts. Again, who was responsible for that decision?

So what was the extent of Mr Maranta's involvement and interest in the company which was fund manager of both Norsec superannuation fund and the property trust? The McDonnell and East workers' superannuation savings were held by the former, and most of the assets were invested in the latter.

         The 1992 accounts for Northern Securities show that payments to two directors for that year totalled $287,000. Payments in 1991 are shown as a total of only $40,000 for two directors. One of the directors received an amount between $130,000 and $140,000, and the other director received an amount between $150,000 and $160,000. As Mr Maranta was a director during this period, he would have received one of these amounts. Mr Maranta at that time also had substantial shareholdings in the company. With a combination of direct holdings and indirect holdings through private companies, Mr Maranta and his family effectively owned 30 per cent of Northern Securities. The accounts also show that, in both 1991 and 1992, Northern Securities paid $25,000 for a season box to the Broncos Rugby League Football Club. At that time Mr Maranta was also a director of the Broncos club.

         I reiterate my previous comment: if public confidence in superannuation is to be maintained, there should be swift remedies for superannuation members who have suffered losses such as in the McDonnell and East case. Unfortunately, the relevant authorities seem to be unable to help them and the only remedy they have available is to engage in costly court action. Most, if not all, of those individuals do not have the resources to take legal action against those who are responsible, whereas those who are responsible for the losses seem to have substantial resources at their disposal to defend any such action. This highlights the alarmingly inequitable position of all superannuation fund members.

Scientists project that it will continue to get bigger each year until around the turn of the century because it takes years for CFCs and other ozone depleting substances to reach the stratosphere where ozone depletion takes place. As chlorine levels drop in the stratosphere, eventually the ozone hole too will shrink.

Our highly regarded environmental expertise and high credibility when it comes to meeting our commitments allow Australia to play a very valuable role in developing international approaches that are not only in Australia's best interests, but are in our international best interests.

The fact is that the deregulation of the Australian aviation industry and the establishment of the International Air Services Commission, with the ability for airlines other than Qantas to service international markets, have produced an environment to the great benefit of the tourism industryâ€”an industry with which the coalition has no credibility whatsoever as a result of the extraordinary statements made by those opposite over the years about aviation policyâ€”and has provided Australian consumers with unprecedented prices on tickets and unprecedented packages that they have never previously enjoyed in this country. That has been reflected not only in the growing numbers of Australians who are flying in this countryâ€”numbers which are growing in exponential bounds with every yearâ€”but also in a huge increase in the tourist industry generally in Australia, which has resulted from additional international flights to Australia.

Does the minister agree that seagrass is not only of World Heritage value in its own right but also important for the survival of dugongs, which are of World Heritage value also? Does the minister agree that seagrass has been found off Oyster Point near Cardwell in North Queensland, and it includes a rare type of seagrass? Does the minister agree that seagrass can be impacted upon by land-based activities? Will the minister make available to the public the seagrass study referred to in his answer of 20 October 1994? We understand that study was completed some time ago by the Queensland government.

         â€”The process in relation to seagrass baseline studies at Oyster Point is this. In relation to Senator Woodley's question on seagrass being of specific World Heritage value, I can confirm that the 1980 document nominating the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage area described the significance of seagrass and also marine life that was dependent on that seagrassâ€”that, of course, included dugongs. I am concerned, as I have indicated in this chamber on a number of occasions, about the potential of land-based activities having an impact on World Heritage values, such as seagrass. Officials from my portfolio will visit this site within the next week. They will inspect the work that has already been undertaken.

         I am obviously aware of the community concern that exists over the clearing of mangroves. Again, that has been communicated to me on quite a number of occasions. The seagrass study that Senator Woodley referred to is being prepared as part of the inshore series of baseline studies being undertaken by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries for the Queensland government. I am not aware of any preliminary results of those studies, so I cannot confirm the existence or identification of the presence of any rare seagrass in the area.

         I raised the completion of this study with the Queensland environment minister, Ms Molly Robson, at the meeting of the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council that was held in Adelaide last week. After discussions with Ms Robson, I understand that the study Senator Woodley referred to is nearing completion. I expect to receive a report in the near future. I can say only this to Senator Woodley: until I have received that report and had an opportunity to examine it, I think questions about its public release are premature.

The cost shifting practices going on in the states are costing taxpayers several hundred million dollars. While they are engaged in this process of cost shifting, at the very same time Mr Kennett and his minister, Marie Tehan, have actually cut $370 million from hospitals and community services. So they are cutting it out. As soon as we give it to them, they are cutting it back. At the same time they are engaged in a very sophisticated cost shifting exercise, particularly from outpatient services.

         The other states are not so blatant as Victoria, but it would not be too wrong to say they are examining, indeed doing, the same thing. New South Wales is at the head of the queue. They are waiting to see exactly what the Commonwealth government's response will be. The opposition should be clear that the Medicare agreements which the states have signed require the states to deliver a range of services, including outpatient services and other services for ambulatory care. They are to be provided free of charge. The new Medicare agreements were signed in 1993 and included a considerable increase in funds for the states. The Victorian government's approach to its health portfolio is to totally ignore that contract.

         I personally chaired a safety forum in this parliament house of all the organisations involved in air safety in Australia, including the engineers who do most of the complaining, every peak organisation representing pilots in this country, and the unions representing the employees of the airline industry. That forum was conducted to examine the progress the Civil Aviation Authority had made on the implementation of the Terrell report and pronounced themselves satisfied at that point.

         The reason I did that is as follows. Many organisations that have discussions with us about air safety, given an opportunity to complain about it, do not do so and then say something else as soon as they get out of the room. That was a perfect opportunity, with everyone in the same room together, to assess whether the CAA was implementing Captain Terrell's recommendations and they pronounced themselves satisfied with the result of that implementation. Aviation safety is vitally important. It needs to be kept under constant review and I certainly did my bit to ensure that it was.

Thirdly, can the minister advise whether this proposal from the National Children's and Youth Law Centre will be included in the justice minister's budget submission to cabinet?

         â€”Mr President, I do have some advice from the Attorney-General and, of course, the Minister for Justice, who inform me that the final draft of the report that Senator Spindler referred to has been prepared. I should ask the honourable senator and the rest of the Senate to note that when one prepares a report or submission such as this there is a long, tortuous consultative process with state and local governments and other organisations and departments as part of the way that we on this side of the parliament handle our international obligations. It has taken some time. The final draft of the report has been prepared and will be forwarded to the Attorney-General for his approval shortly. It is expected that the report will be submitted to the United Nations rights of the child committee in early 1995.

I am also advised that another 130 or so submissions have gone to them in response to the Access to Justice Advisory Committee's report.

         As was pointed out correctly by the federal member for the Northern Territory in respect of this claim, it is perfectly understandable that the members of this man's family and the very large Aboriginal community on Elcho Island would want to see this claim pursued because it was this man's dying wish that it should be, and there is a perfectly legitimate right for people to make such claims. My view, for what it is worthâ€”and it is not worth very much because I am not a lawyer and neither am I permitted by the standing orders to give legal opinions in hereâ€”is that this claim has very little chance of success.

As to whether the claim will be granted, that is a matter for the proper authorities to determine at the time this claim is considered. At the moment this is, of course, nothing other than publicity. To the best of my knowledge, the claim has not even been lodged.

That is how the Australian government sees the best way of ensuring increasing competitiveness, growth in the business sector of Australia and the winning of a major share of this in the international market.

We have had the first stage in place since 1988, and we have been trying since then to get agreement for the second stage. Five states have signed that agreement and proceeded to establish the child-care places.

         This opposition yesterday wanted to say that we were not doing enough for child care. Those opposite wanted to say that we did not have enough places. But they are not prepared to admit that one of the reasons we cannot get the places up as fast as we would like is that Victoria and New South Wales flatly refused to sign the child-care strategy.

         Indeed, it is worse than that for New South Wales because it actually signed the first strategy in 1988; but, unlike all the other states, it has not even honoured its half of that strategy. So child care in New South Wales is 780 places behind when it could well be that far ahead and, if it had participated in the second signing of the strategy, could be much further ahead. New South Wales has not even completed its 1988 agreement. That is one of the reasons we do not have sufficient child-care places in this country.

         â€”No, it is all right. I am not reading; I am just checking the figures. I would like to give one example of the difficulties we have with New South Wales. Since 1992, there has been an agreement with the New South Wales government to establish a child-care centre in Hurstville. The plans had been approved by council and funding was ready to go. The New South Wales Department of Education, which was supplying the land, decided to increase the cost of the lease. An internal wrangle in the New South Wales government over funding has now stalled the establishment of this place even further. That is one example of the difficulties we have with the New South Wales government.

He read the letter and sent the letter back to the CSIRO for further and better particulars on 3 November. The letter has not yet been returned with the particulars we have sought and the issue has just now been brought to my attention. My answer was that the matter is not before me.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ferguson this day, relating to redundancies at the CSIRO.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        I thought that the opening paragraph of my question was a fairly simple request, and I think it really indicates the interest that this current minister has in what is actually happening in CSIRO at present. A letter was written to him or to his office after a meeting of the board on 18 October this year. By a further answer after question time he indicated that one of his staff had returned that letter to the CSIRO to get more information. I would have thought that the minister would have at least sighted the letter so that he would have had some idea of the request, clarification or advice that he was being asked for. He could have had at least some idea or input. I am just quite staggered that he is not aware of what is going on in CSIRO at present.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The minister in his answer to me today said, `Why should I know when CSIRO is just one line in the appropriations?' One of the reasons that these questions need to be asked is that the minister was responsible for delivering a $60 million shortfall over the triennium. That $60 million shortfall is one line in the budget. That is one of the reasons why there are redundancies in the CSIRO today. The minister cannot cut $60 million from a budget and then wipe his hands of any responsibility for a program of redundancies. If the minister did not have anything before him in the form that I outlined in the question, then I think the least he could do would be to present the Senate with the information that he does have because these questions have been asked for a great period of time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The questions were first raised during estimates back in May and June, when certain indications were given to us by both the minister and Dr Stocker as to what this redundancy program would be. The minister, in his response to me, asked, `Why one institute? Why do you single out one instituteâ€”the Institute of Animal Production and Processing?' One of the reasons that that institute has been singled out relates to the 200 redundancies that we were told back in May and June would occur. Dr Stocker told us in evidence that the figure could be up to 200. Of those 200 redundancies, 138 will be from the one institute, the Institute of Animal Production and Processing. That, I would have thought, was a disproportionate number of staff to be taken from one institute as part of the ongoing program that we heard about it in detail during estimates in June and which we have heard some more about over the past couple of months as we have been conducting the Senate inquiry. That is the reason why we are referring to the one institute. In confirmation of that, on 23 June Dr Stocker said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I can give you more accurate figures. The reduction in positions, according to Dr Donald's figures for the Institute of Animal Production and Processing, would be from the present number of 1,554 to 1,416 over the three years, only three of which would be research staff.
       </para>
       <para>
        All I asked of the minister was specifically whether he could reaffirm that statement, because we have heard nothing in any evidence we might have taken since to suggest there will be only three. There seems to be general concern amongst many people who have given evidence to us that the figure is likely to be more than three. That is of particular concern. One of the concerns is that this program is being carried out prior to the Senate inquiry having the opportunity to report to this parliament, which we intend to do by the last day of the sittings. It also flies in the face of another comment by the minister. On 26 May, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I understand that most of any staff change in CSIRO will occur by natural effluxion of attrition rather than by any particular program of targeted redundancies.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I think the minister has a responsibility at least to let us know how well he is informed of what is going on in CSIRO. Also, for the sake of the people employed by CSIRO, there needs to be some certainty for them. All I was specifically asking for was a reaffirmation of the remarks made during estimates last June. The minister failed to reaffirm Dr Stocker's statement about the number of redundancies and just how many of those people would be research staff.

         â€”I wish to refute much of what Senator Ferguson said while taking note of the answer. As chairman of the committee which is now conducting the inquiry into CSIRO, I thought he would have conducted himself in a more responsible way and not embarked upon a campaign in this place of scaremongering and putting further fear in people who work for CSIRO in regard to their employment. We have no answers to such questions, other than those given to us during the inquiry by Dr Stocker and the directors of the institutes.

         In regard to his claim about the matter of funding, as the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) said with regard to his responsibility, he has no responsibility for the direct management of the CSIRO. That is the responsibility of the chief executive, the board, the directors and the other management streams of the CSIRO. They make the decisions with regard to the employment of people within that organisation. That is exactly how it should be and, indeed, that is exactly what those opposite wanted it to be. So do not come in here raising a question with regard to the minister's role when his role is exactly as it should be. He has no responsibility to reaffirm anything that the chief executive has said. That was said to us during the course of the inquiry. The chief executive also informed us, along with the directors of the Institute of Animal Production and Processing and the Institute of Plant Production and Processing, that there had been a seven per cent increase in funding for rural research.

         Of course, some people on the other side would like to contradict that, and that is their right and their prerogative.

         As the two senators opposite are very much aware, it is certainly not the view of the staff of CSIRO that this very important and much needed inquiry is undermining the CSIRO. It is the government that is undermining the CSIRO: firstly, by cutting its funds by $60 million; and, secondly, by causing the CSIRO to redirect its research priorities away from rural industry, particularly into manufacturing technology and information technology. The government has done that despite the fact that rural industry remains, and will remain for many years, our major earner of export income.

The government has done that despite the evidence that has been presented to this committee regarding the enormous benefit to cost ratio that is returned from funds devoted to rural research. The other important issue in relation to the provision of government appropriation funds to rural research is the large amount of public good that comes out of rural research as against individual private good. That is another very important issue. There is a higher level of private good involved in research in the manufacturing information technology sector.

We cannot get our research results off the shelf from some overseas research institution that has undertaken that research because the Australian rural environment and the Australian rural industry are very much unique to Australia. Again, this is in marked contrast to secondary industry information technology, particularly in this age of the global economy and multinationals where those industries can obtain a lot of their research and development from overseas.

         There is no doubt, when one looks at the question of rural research as against manufacturing and research in, for example, the electricity generating resource area, that CSIRO was established on the basis of rural research and developmentâ€”more research than development. It was not until later that the areas of mining, the production of electric energy and other forms of energy, and manufacturing came onto the scene. I, among others, argued that more facilities should be going to research in the manufacturing area. But at no stage have I consideredâ€”and I certainly have not publicly uttered any suggestionâ€”that rural research was not still very important. Adequate funds should be allocated to that.

        Quite correctly, that was a move to break down the duopoly that had existed in Australia for many years. Over the last two weeks the government has put forward a series of explanations as to its actions in repudiating the memorandum of understanding signed by Senator Collins. I might say that the reasons given do not hold water, and everyone in the industry recognises that.

         The letter that Mr Brereton sent to his New Zealand counterpart argued that New Zealand had not fulfilled its commitments to implement appropriate passenger facilitation arrangements. Rubbish! By last year the New Zealand parliament amended that country's immigration act to set up the legal framework for the passenger facilitation arrangements. At about the same time Mr Brereton was dialling 0011 on his fax machine, New Zealand Customs told the Australian Customs Service it was ready to proceed with a trial of the new systemâ€”No. 1 excuse down the drain.

         The minister said in his letter that the consultations relating to the ownership and control of Australian and New Zealand airlines had been `attenuated and inconclusive'. We have heard from Senator Gareth Evans a great deal about the consultations required under the memorandum. The fact is, howeverâ€”Senator Collins would know this, and I will be interested to hear his remarks on this when he gets up to speakâ€”that that particular clause on ownership and control was proposed by New Zealand, and it was proposed to try to ensure that the New Zealand air operator, Air New Zealand, would not be taken over by a predator from a third country. Senator Collins would recall that. In fact, there were suggestions about the level of ownership.

The reason is that it is drifting backwards in policy terms towards the duopolistic aviation system that his government was so critical of in the past. It is to the disadvantage, I might say, of the Australian public.

         The government's One Nation policy built on its initial deregulation of the domestic airline market which took place in 1990. When Senator Gareth Evans first announced the termination of the two-airline agreement, he rejected the concept of an open skies policy. He said there was no rational solution short of designating a single carrier to service Australia and New Zealand's overseas markets, inspired, presumably, by the ALP's continued fascination with Sweden. He cited Scandinavian Airlines, SAS, as a model. That airline is still making a loss, as I understand it.

         In conclusion, the government's aviation policy is incoherent. Senator Collins mishandled the portfolio, but the incumbent minister, Mr Brereton, is even worse. He has grossly mismanaged aviation safety; he has clumsily backed out of an important bilateral arrangement which has cast doubt on our international credibility, and he and the Prime Minister are presiding over a significant reversal in aviation policies, a reversal that will cost Australians dearly. The minister has been described in the media as a decisive minister. He must act decisively now and resign before he does any more damage to the aviation industry in Australia.

         I would like to correct a point that Senator MacGibbon made when he waved around a newspaper article on safety regulation and cost recovery. Senator MacGibbon has kindly confirmed that the article that he was waving around was the Tom Burton article which referred to me and Minister Beazley. It said that I was `happy' about the cabinet's decision to go for full cost recoveryâ€”and that is still coalition policy. That is what the article said. As was pointed out to the journalist by a member of my staff at my request, and it is on the public record, that is profoundly not the case.

         It is now a matter of public record that the ERC took a decision for full cost recovery some years ago, and I might add that that original decision included full cost recovery for search and rescue. Far from being happy about it, I was in fact profoundly unhappy about it, as the public record testifies. I went back to cabinetâ€”although I was not then a cabinet minister, but I went into cabinetâ€”and had the decision on cost recovery for search and rescue immediately reversed. A decision was made by cabinet that the implementation of full cost recovery would be deferred for a full year, which it was, and I then discussed the matter with my colleagues in that intervening year.

         However, cabinet took a decision to rescind the original arrangement and only recover 50 per cent of the cost. As a result of a submission from Minister Breretonâ€”which I strongly supportedâ€”cabinet identified the true public interest component of air safety regulations and added additional public finance to the original 50 per cent, and that is now taken from the budget.

The coalition went to the last election and not only asserted full cost recovery for safety regulation, but said it would abandon the traditional arrangements that we were going to put into place, and immediately move for full cost recoveryâ€”which would have crippled the light aircraft sector in this countryâ€”and boasted about the fact that by doing so the coalition would save $20 million in public money.

These deregulation policies were brought in in 1990, and in the four short years since then there has been an increase of 58 per cent in the number of passengers flying on the 21 top routes in Australia. I will say that again: since 1990, as a direct result of these policy changes, there has been an increase of almost 60 per cent in Australians flying over the top 21 routes.

It is very hard to find someone with less intellectual ability than Charlie Jones, but in many ways Charlie Jones started it all. Then he became minister for transport. In those days, when Mr Jones took over aviation, we had a body, the Department of Civil Aviation, which was highly and universally respected in the aviation community.

         Let us look at the history of the Australian Labor Party in government. Who introduced real competition into airlines way back in the 1940s? It was the Chifley government, when it established TAA to compete against ANA. That airline, and subsequently Australian Airlines, had an excellent safety record. Over the years, we had the two-airline policy. No government seemed to think it was a good idea to get rid of it but, as a result of a change of heart within the ranks of the Labor Party, particularly by ministers in the cabinet, we had a situation where the aviation industry was deregulated.

From my point of view, though I was in disagreement with such a policy, it challenged the airline industry to show that, as a result of cheaper fares, there could be an improved result for people who used the airlines. That was going to mean more airlines involved in Australia and more competition.

Twice it went down the drain because both the operating airlines had the capacity to reduce fares in a way that Compass could not compete with, and Compass was destroyed. Perfectly good investment capital went down the drain. It showed clearly, as many other occasions have shown, that competition can be useful. It can create a situation where people strive for excellence and compete on the basis of the result of that excellence.

It is absolutely disgraceful that someone from Senator MacGibbon's background belonging to the party that he does with the policy it has should suggest that we should not accept our responsibility, not be innovative and not do the things that are necessary.

         Mention was made about Australia being $200 billion in debt. We are and I am not happy about that. I look forward to when we turn the corner and start to reduce that debt as a result of the way in which money is invested and spent. We should not lose sight of the fact that 60 per cent or more of that money is debt that is held by private companies. Much of it was generated as a result of people who are no longer considered to be great in the community, like the Christopher Skases and Bonds and other people. That was the wrong thing.

It was quite obvious that he was bagging his own party's decisions on aviation in the years gone by. I will be interested to see Senator Burns calling to sack all the wharfies and the people from ANL who are striking and causing enormous trouble to Australia. As I understand Senator Burns to be saying, we ought to bring in the army and foreign workers to get rid of the ANL strikers. We might just do that, and we would do it confident in the knowledge that Senator Burns would support us all the way.

         It surprises me that, out of all the people on the Labor side of parliament in the House of Representatives and in here, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and Mr Hawke before him, cannot seem to find just one person who can do a decent job as the Minister for Transport. As senators MacGibbon and Parer said, we have had a series of ministers who have been the most incompetent in the whole of the parliament. Since I have been in parliament, we have had as our Minister for Transport Senator Collins, Senator Cook before him and Mr Brereton now. They continue the line of incompetent ministers who always seem to end up in this portfolio.

         In Senator Collins's time as minister, he was in charge of a lot of the regulation when the CAA was trying to establish an aviation policy. What did we have in Senator Collins's time? Inquiry and report after inquiry and report. It went on and on. In December 1988, we had the review task force. We then had the second review task force, the Senate inquiry into the CAA, the Ratner report, the Lawry report, the Yates report, the Beale report, the Macphee TAAATS inquiry, the Terrell report, the Sypher Meuller report, the BASI report into Monarch, a coronial inquest into the Monarch disaster, the preliminary coronial inquiry into Seaview, a judicial inquiry into Seaview, a police inquiry into the CAA and Seaview and a parliamentary inquiry into air safety. There have been 15 major inquiries and reports since 1988, and not a thing has been done by this incompetent government and its incompetent ministers. Senator MacGibbon pointed out 16 appointments of 11 different transport ministers in the last 10 years. It is no wonder there is no coherent aviation policy or any other sort of transport policy.

My colleagues and I have been overwhelmed over the last few years with complaints, reports, leaks and secret letters about Senator Collins's complete arrogance and inability to understand what aviation policy and safety should be all about. Senator MacGibbon quoted from an article in question time. I have to repeat it. It says:

No-one would take much notice of what Senator Collins has said. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might recall that he lied to me in estimates committees. It was shown in the chamber from questions that were asked that he had altered the minutes of a CAA board meeting. That is all on the record. I do not need to repeat that.

         Senator Collins has been talking about the great steps forward in tourism and aviation in recent times. During question time today, he accused us of promoting Air New Zealand. He said that we should be in the New Zealand parliament. I suppose Senator Collins is aware that British Airways owns 25 per cent of Qantas. How is that for looking after the Australian people? Of course, 50 per cent of Ansett is owned by that great Australian Mr Murdoch, who I think is a citizen of the United States. Yet Senator Collins has the hide to accuse us of looking after a foreign airline by promoting the cheap air fares that Australians would get if Air New Zealand came into the domestic market.

         The records show the tremendous strides that occurred in passenger accessibility to airlines during Compass's ill-fated history. It just showed what can happen with competition. More and more Australians were able to travel internally at a cheaper rate. The statistics on the growth in passenger numbers in the years that Compass was around are legend. Unfortunately, I do not have time to put those statistics on the record, but enormous strides were made in passenger numbers when we had genuine competition. We were going to have that again with Air New Zealand being given permission to fly domestically but, just because the Labor Party's mates could not hack it, the rug was pulled out from under Air New Zealand and we are back to the old two-airline policy.

         One must also recognise, as the minister pointed out, the huge increase in demand for air travel that has occurred in this country and which has imposed consequential pressures upon the system. But the government, unlike the opposition, is continuing to improve the system. At the direction of the minister, a formal system has recently been established which will automatically trigger an increase in safety surveillance of operators who are known to be in financial difficulty. The government has established a far reaching inquiry into the conduct of air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors of the industry. The government, as the minister announced on 13 October, has undertaken an investigation into that most unfortunate accident. That inquiry commenced today.

         â€”The government opposes amendment No. 55. The amendment seeks to add a paragraph to the effect that the ILC should pursue a policy of `not retaining any interest in a parcel of land in which it has granted an interest' under a previous authorising paragraph. It is the general intention of this bill that the ILC would not retain an interest in land by granting lessor interests, such as a lease, where the ILC has itself acquired a full interest. This is demonstrated by the fact that the bill requires the ILC to grant an interest acquired for the purpose of making a grant within a reasonable time after acquisition. That is clause 191D(3)(b).

If we are to give people interests in land, we give them interests in land and we do not do it half-heartedly or in a fashion which leaves their land encumbered.

       <para>
        This amendment deals with the carrying on of land management activities with the agreement of holders of the land. It deals with proposed new section 191E(1)(c). This ensures that any land management activities in relation to the indigenous-held land is carried out under agreement with the holders of the land. The government has reflected this in 191E(1)(a), but I believe it has failed to carry it through to paragraph (c) of that.

         There is no reason why land management activities should be carried on by the Indigenous Land Corporation without the agreement of land-holders. I believe this has been overlooked and I think it is a point that needs to be remedied. If I recall correctly, during the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I put a question to Mr Dillon on this point and he believed that (1)(a) covered it. I will turn to (1)(a) and point out where I think the defect is. What we have is perhaps a different situation in (a) as opposed to (c). The section is headed `Functions', and it comes under `Land Management Functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation'. Proposed new section 191E(1) states, in part:

        So far, so good. There is nothing wrong with that. But then in (c) it says:

        to carry on other land management activities in relation to indigenous-held land.
       </para>

        I see a contradiction, because (a) is saying that the ILC carries on land management activities under agreements with the holders of the land, but then under (c) it can carry on other activities without the agreement of the land-holders.

         The problem the opposition has with that is this: why is it done in one subsection with the agreement of the holders of the land and not in the other subsection? What are these other land management activities? I believe that that is open to being misconstrued and really leaves it open-ended. It is the opposition's firm belief that any land management activities should be carried on by agreement with the land-holders.

         â€”I suggest to Senator Ellison in complete good faith that he reconsider whether he wants to proceed with this amendment, for reasons that I will now explain. It is a function of the very wide definition of `land management activities' which appears in proposed new subsection (5). If we look at land management activity without that definition, it does sound as though what we are talking about is essentially intrusive activities involving the management, in an ordinary sense of that word, on a particular piece of land. What Senator Ellison is saying is prima facie intuitively plausible in that context. But when we look at the definition of `land management activities', we see that, among other things, it contains over the page, on page 6 of the bill:

       <para>
        There are a lot of other things, such as providing training and providing environmental management services, which are more specific in character and which may or may not have relevance here, but certainly information. Contemplate a situation where the Indigenous Land Corporation, in the general exercise of its land management responsibilities in relation to indigenous-held lands, wants to disseminate information on land care to indigenous land-holders right across the country. To have to seek the agreement of all land-holders to that kind of aspect of a land management activity, bearing in mind that that is the sort of thing that is covered within the definition and that is the kind of thing that is intended, is in fact to impose a wholly unnecessary restriction. It is not the sort of thing that would be imposed on any other body with these sorts of functions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is for that reason that (c) is there in that form, in that kind of open-endedly expressed way. I think we can obviously rely on either the incapacity, on the one hand, or the good sense of the ILC, on the other, when it comes to seeking to impose some very intrusive land management activity on a land-holder without their agreement. That would be a senseless thing to do. But what Senator Ellison is talking about is adding a new bureaucratic imposition.

         It follows from the drafting of the bill that it is needed to have an open-ended clause in that way. If we do not have something in the functions clause, in 191E(1), which is broad enough to subsume this sort of thing that is covered by land management activity, then we would find ourselves in a situation where the corporation lacked the power to do certain things it might well want to do and which we might well want it to do, the classic case being the dissemination of information.

        That is something that should involve the consent of the land-holder because it is involving the land itself. That is why I say that when we look at the definition section in proposed subsection (a), that is a very different land management activity from simply providing services or disseminating information. So where we look at the definition of `land management activities', we are looking at a range, from (a) to (e). The definition in (a) starts with the `care or improvement of land', running right through to (e), `disseminating information'. That is quite harmless but could be of valuable assistance. But I am saying that on the question of how the land is used, the land-holder must be consulted and agreement obtained.

         May I put another way of solving the problem Senator Ellison is worried about? It really follows from the application of the general law of trespass. Obviously, if the ILC was wanting to go onto someone's land to engage in any of the intrusive land management practices that Senator Ellison is talking about, whether running a business or seeking to do anything else that operates against the spirit he has describedâ€”and if the ILC sought to do that without the consent of the land-holder in questionâ€”the ILC would be guilty of trespass under the existing general law. It is a reinforcement of the commonsense point I was making earlier. As a matter of practical administrative commonsense, we can assume that the ILC will not want to throw its weight around in that fashionâ€”and there is a legal inhibition on its doing so, without consent, in those situations. I do not think the opposition needs the extra protection of the amendment to cover that situation.

         â€”This is what I want to explain. The bill refers to a number of services which could be performed in relation to the land. It is quite clearly the case that certain technical services could mean, in the case of urban landâ€”not rural landâ€”the entry onto those premises by ILC officers to look at the structure of a building or at some other matter. In relation to paragraph (e) of that proposed subsection and subparagraph (vi) where there are areas of particular significance to a particular tribal group, dissemination of information about sites there and so on could be contrary to the interests of that tribal group and contrary to their religious views in relation to certain areas of land that are held.

         The Senate has to ask itself one question: what is the greater mischief? Is it the greater mischief that the amendment be made or is it the greater mischief that it not be made? I think that if Senator Evans's sole concern is in relation to paragraph (e) of (5), I would find it very difficult to imagine a situation in which the dissemination of information would happen without the agreement of the landowners. If the information is of value, surely the landowners would agree to the dissemination of that information. If that is the only concern of Senator Evans, it seems that little mischief will be done to the bill by adding the amendment proposed by Senator Ellison. However, if the amendment is not accepted, perhaps a greater mischief is done to the holders of the land in creating an implied licence for the ILC to interfere in the management of that land against the will of the land-holder.

         â€”May the Lord spare me this amateur hour bush lawyer stuff. I have to say that because what Senator O'Chee is saying really is absolute nonsenseâ€”nonsense on stilts as Bentham would say. For a start, there is not an implied licence being granted in a way that would override the normal operation of the general law, unless there is a very clear implication in terms of the legislative structure. If it were the case that land management activities were described in terms which referred only to highly intrusive physical presence situationsâ€”and then there was a clause like this in general termsâ€”there might be some point in what Senator O'Chee is saying. But when land management activities are described as an extremely broad spectrum of activities, only some of which are inherently intrusive in character, there simply is not the strength of the implicationâ€”or anything like itâ€”in the language of 191E(1)(c) that would override a normal principle of general law which operates to allow intrusion in land only with consent. So that is the first point.

         As to the balance of mischief that is involved in this, the difficulty is that proposed subsection (5) is only a definition subsection; it is not an empowering subsection. So unless there is some empowering language somewhere else in the bill, which empowers the ILC to carry out those land management functions as defined in (5), there is no point in having the definition. There has to be an empowering provision. So if we go back to the empowering subsection and the only empowering language is restrictive in character and requires an agreement to exist before one can perform the particular function in question, a very real restriction on the effective operation of the subsection is imposed. It is no good saying that there might be agreement to get information, or something of that kind. Yes, people might; but they have to go out first and seek it and acquire the agreement before getting into the business of disseminating it. It is not only information; it is services and training, it is paragraphs (c) and (d) as well as (e), that prima facie give rise to this problem.

         I am not accusing Senator Ellison in any way of seeking with this particular amendment to impose some new layer of unworkability in the legislation. However, I am saying that that will be the effect of it. I believe quite genuinely that the balance of the mischief here will work very much in the direction of inhibiting what all of us would regard as an entirely legitimate and useful function of the ILC. So I ask Senator O'Chee to spare us this kind of analysis. It really does not hold up. We should get back to the basics of the particular problem before us. I hope I can persuade Senator Ellison to waive his objections. I think Senator Harradine has seen the point and I would hope that Senator Ellison will too.

         â€”I know that Senator Gareth Evans is a very patient man so I assume that he will answer me fully in response to my query. I cannot understand why the perfectly appropriate phrase in paragraph (a), `under agreements with the holders of the land', is not able to be carried under paragraph (c), with the exception of those things in paragraph (5) that Senator Evans feels would not require the permission of the land-holder. Otherwise, the bill is actually saying that through the powers of 191E(1)(a) we can arrange for the carrying on of land management activities in relation to indigenous held land under agreements with the holders of the land, but that if we do not get the agreements, that is fine. With (c) we can carry on other land management activities in relation to indigenous held land, full stop. What a lovely out!

         I want to reinforce here that the reason for putting this in the legislation is that this is a government appointed body. It has a responsibility to the indigenous land-holders for whom it is facilitating the acquisition of land and the funds for the management of that land. There has to be a better explanation than the one currently offered to account for the anomaly between (a) and (c). If there is any specific clause where this can be carried on without the agreement, that needs to be explicitly stated so that indigenous land-holders know where they stand and this particular clause cannot be pulled on them if they have failed to make an agreement under paragraph (a). It is obvious that the Greens support this amendment.

That excludes the ogre, as I call it, in paragraph (a) because it deals with the use, care and improvement of the land, which is a little bit more than dissemination of services and information. I wonder whether the government, the Democrats and Senator Chamarette would be prepared to consider that amendment and whether they think it makes it clearer.

It has been clear from the outset that he has seen the problem in subparagraph (5)(a) but has not really seen a problem with this in the other areas. The areas I am talking about are subparagraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e), which talk about provision of services, training and information. I think we would be prepared to regard that as the real point of my concern.

         I also think that meets Senator Chamarette's original concern. I cannot see any way of driving a more complicated path through subparagraphs (b) to (e). They are all about either services, training or information and they are by definition the sorts of things that the ILC might well want to offer on a nationwide basis or whatever. They are all cases that may in practice give rise to the problem. They are not going to be activities performed in an intrusive fashion because of the point we made earlier on about the applicability of the general law. If we want to put beyond doubt the carrying on of the business side of things and say that that can only happen by agreement, I do not think there is any policy problem.

         Senator Chamarette's other point was about the ILC's functions in relation to land which is not held by indigenous people. Well, it has not got any, has it? The ILC's function in land management is confined to the management of indigenous held land, which is a broader concept than land just acquired under this act. It extends to land which is held on a pre-existing basis by indigenous people. The ILC has no management functions that I can recall so far as non-indigenous held land is concerned. So that is a problem that we need not spend any more time on.

         â€”Let us look at that diagram. What it represents as a graph is how much money is available year by year in the land acquisition fund. The graph has been done on a best case scenario. In looking at the $21 million that ATSIC currently expends on land acquisition, I have to say that we have heard from the commission that $9 million of that $21 million goes on management of the acquired land. If this land fund is being used for acquisition, we can assume that an increasing proportion of the land acquisition fund total will not only be taken up with management of the land that is acquired but, because the bill widens its application to all indigenous-held land, the fund will have a much wider scope than managing just the land which is acquired.

         Assuming there is a creeping in on the acquisition fund moneys of 10 per cent, we can also see from this diagramâ€”and this is, as I have stressed, a best case scenarioâ€”that by the year 2003 only a very small amount will be allowed for land acquisition right throughout Australia. It could well be postulated that, without any controls on it, the figure could be much less than this and the amount available for management could be far greater.

         So the purpose of this amendment is to state a principle that the management costs attached to the land acquisition fund should not swallow up the entire fund within such a short time that those people who are least resourced to be able to apply and who do not receive the kind of priority that they could within the first five or 10 years of the fund do not lose totally any capacity to be assisted. If we do not have such a control mechanism in this bill, within a certain periodâ€”within X yearsâ€”the whole $45 million that the government is committing from 10 years onwards will be used for land management only, and the land acquisition capacity will have disappeared. I welcome discussion on this point. I want people to take in the principle that is under consideration before I go on to speak further about this amendment.

My first view of it is that it would have to be regarded as an unnecessary fettering of the ILC. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) wants to accuse the coalition of trying to fetter the land fund and make it unworkable. We over here and the Greens know that that is not the intention of the coalition, and so do a hell of a lot of Aboriginal organisations around the country, as was shown at a media conference they held this afternoon.

         I think the point that Senator Chamarette makes, however, is a good one. In fact, I suggest that, if we wanted to make the graph accurate as the size of the land-holdings increased, there is no doubt that management costs may increaseâ€”and there may be very good reasons for that as well. I do not think Senator Chamarette or anybody here wants to say that the land management functions are any less important than land acquisition functions. Senator Chamarette is making the very good point that the amount actually available for land acquisition could be diminished.

         One of the very serious points raised by the Greens and by some of the Aboriginal organisations we have consulted with is the political con job, I guess, that is being perpetrated in relation to the size of the fund. The government would have the people of Australia believe that it is handing over $1.4 billion when in fact it is making a deposit into the public account and, effectively, all it is doing is increasing the money that the taxpayer or the government spends on land acquisition by between $21 million and $25 million a year. So it is a relatively small advance out of consolidated revenue for land acquisitions.

That should be made clear.

         The coalition would not be able to match the demands to increase the size of the fund, double the size of the fund and so forth. That is something that the coalition would have a lot of trouble with in the economic circumstances this government has placed Australia in. It would not be credible for the coalition, after calling for more fiscal restraint and bashing the government over the head every day about interest rates, to make a blanket promise to increase the size of the land fund.

         I think the sort of approach required, if I can be so bold as to speak on behalf of the coalition on policy in this areaâ€”it certainly is not my portfolioâ€”would be to say that, if the legislation were successful in the sort of form that it is moving towards with these amendments and it gets some runs on the board, a coalition government would like to look at the success of it in achieving the sorts of objectives we are building into it. At that stage we would of course look at the priorities for funding. Quite frankly, if the fund moves in the direction that our amendments are driving it,  with the support of the Greens, it could indeed be a very successful initiative for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and may well be deserving of greater funding.

         In relation to the point we are discussing here, I think the specific limiting to 10 per cent of land management appropriations within the overall annual budget may be a very unnecessary and potentially damaging fettering of the powers of the ILC board. Even though I appreciate what Senator Chamarette is getting at, I do not think this is something that will assist the overall objectives of the fund. I foreshadow that the coalition will oppose this amendment.

         I think a number of reasons should be added to that bald statement. The first is that there is a really rather depressing underlying assumption, I think, on the part of the Greens that land purchased with land fund moneys will never result in going concerns that actually generate their own funds for sustainability and growthâ€”the assumption being they will always be somehow dependent on ILC support and as more land is acquired more money, accordingly, will have to be spent on management. The assumption that land fund moneys, ultimately as a result of that process at work, are just about all going to be consumed by management is a pretty offensive assumption, I think, a paternalistic assumption of the kind that the Greens are constantly urging us to have no part of I think they are guilty of here in the underlying assumptions behind this chart they have put out.

         In any event, if we look back at the past, whatever might be the case in the future, we will see that it is the case that a great deal of the land that has been purchased for Aboriginal people had been degraded and was in an unproductive state when it was acquired. Some very large environmental tasks need to be addressed in relation to that existing stock of land, quite apart from any that might be acquired in the future. It really is important that the ILC has the flexibilityâ€”the practical flexibility as well as the charter formal flexibilityâ€”to address that particular environmental problem.

In terms of existing landâ€”indigenous-held land, which may need a grant, not just for environmental purposes but, to use the opposition's terms yesterday, in terms of the viability aspectâ€”it is not fair to assume that it does not have equal weight. It is not a view that would be shared by some Aboriginal people who have a property of some sort. To say that the figure should be 10 per cent is a little too inflexible. Maintenance and acquisition are important aspects, and for those who have a little pastoral property and nothing with which to develop it, I think it is a very important principle for them to have equal access to the funds.

I have asked the question on several occasions and the government has made no detailed investigation as to how much money would be required to redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people across Australia, and what proportion may be required to redress the legitimate management funding for the land that is to be acquired. The purpose of the amendment has nothing whatever to do with limiting management funding. It intends to put management funding where it belongsâ€”in government responsibility and in other responsibilities, and not simply into the land acquisition fund to the detriment of those people who have yet to acquire anything.

         If we say that acquisition and management have equal weighting, I feel there should be some kind of control mechanism in this legislation to say that the amount of the fund that is to be expended on management will never exceed 50 per cent. I believe we need some kind of control and it is not contained in these provisions. Not only is it not stated that there is some kind of control function to prevent the entire fund being used up for management, but it does not acknowledge how quickly that will happen. No research has been carried out into that aspect. The fund does not only address land which has been acquired in any one year and the management costs of that land. The fund purposes have been extended beyond any acquisition function to all indigenous-held landâ€”that is, land that is currently held.

         The basis I used for my proportions was the reality that ATSIC told me that out of its budget for land acquisition and management it used some 50 per cent on management of the land it acquired. So it is a reasonable assumption and has nothing to do with viability of properties. It is the reality that the current expenditure on land is approximately half the total amount. For example, out of the sum of $21 million for this year, a figure of $9 million is already allocated to management by ATSIC. It said it wanted to spend $15 million but could not afford that discrepancy.

It is something that needs to be looked at and we will seek to put in a new subsection 3B in amendment No. 49 and hope that the Senate will support it.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The other thing that should be considered by everyone on that side of the table, as I heard earlier in the questioning of the government, is the management side and things of that nature. Part of management also goes to dealing with capital and infrastructure. We must remember that, when we acquire on behalf of Aboriginal people different pastoral leases, farming properties and other bits of land around the country, most of these places are very degraded. Most of the infrastructure is very run down. It seems to me to be a very cheap way for most of the states and territories to get the Commonwealth to put capital into infrastructure in those areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on to make the point that we always seem to come back to relying on the responsibility of the Commonwealth and that he would not like us to consider this bill as the only opportunity for funds for management. He believes that we ought to be talking to state and territory governments about some pastoral leases and whether they are so marginal that they should be taken out of the pastoral estate because he says that they are a joke.

         Mr Ross asks us to think about the politics of not even requiring states and territories to have some responsibility for management functions in relation to Aboriginal held land. He goes on to say:

        You have had ministerial political interference saying that it will not be done because the land is held by Aboriginal people and, therefore, for ever and a day they will pour money in, because the Commonwealth has lots of money, to maintain the covenants on these leases.

       <para>
        There is a political dimension to this. I do not think it is right to simply look at this billâ€”inadequate as it isâ€”as the only source of moneys for management functions.

         â€”Could I supplement Senator Kernot's point with one further point that perhaps needs emphasising. The ILC, as a quasi-commercial body, will be able to access private sector sources of finance for land management, which landholders by themselves may not be able to access. It is not a question of this land fundâ€”which, by the way, is called the land fund, not the land acquisition fundâ€”being a finite pot of money, and the only money that will be available for acquisition, on the one hand, and management on the other; such that any money spent on management will necessarily diminish the pot available for acquisition.

         On the contrary, although some money will come out of the basic fund for management, as we have been discussing, the ILC itself will have access to other sources of funds. In particular, let us very much hope that a lot of this land can be obtained rather quickly on a commercially self-sustaining basis. Those remarks are in addition to Senator Kernot's point about the political desirability of the states and territories accepting some rather greater responsibility for the public sector component of management, and amen to that.

         â€”I will make a very brief concluding remark. I understand the points that have been made. I was making the point that, while management is important, there is no guarantee in this bill that there is acquisition money that will be ongoing. Senator Evans has reassured meâ€”though I do not know how much of a reassurance it isâ€”that such commercial activities will be carried on by the ILC that it will be able to get more money to fund management. However, I have not been assured that there will be any other opportunity for those people dispossessed of their land to actually acquire land, if they do not already have it, from any other source but this fund.

         Unless Senator Evans can reassure me on that, I will have to assume that this is it. This is what the Prime Minister told me was the major financial contribution to the dispossession side of the Mabo High Court judgment. He said it would meet the needs of 95 per cent of the Aboriginal people who would not stand to gain by the native title legislation. I think it is appalling.

         I believe it is rather inopportune for the minister to talk about a magic pudding when we have talked about the reduction in the tax base in this country.

         It is clear that there are problems with Australia's tax base. We seem to have followed the directions of the international money market rather than the needs of this country. It is true to say that there is not a magic pudding, but if we are making decisions to ensure that the magic pudding becomes smaller and smaller, and ensuring that the priorities go to other areas, such as assisting big corporations, then it is in the government's lap and not in the lap of the Greens or those people who are seeking justice from our taxpayers' money.

         â€”I will not hold the minister up for long, but as Senator Margetts entered the debate, I thought I might say something. I have been listening to the debate about land acquisition and land management. Surely, if we buy land that is well run down, as Senator Kernot said, we will need more money for management. If the land is so run down, we should get it at a give-away price. It is similar to buying a farm that is run down; we need to put a lot into it, so the price is down. We put money into it and we get it up to standard. If we buy one that is up at the top, we do not need to spend so much on land management or land improvement.

         Either we look at properties that are run down and pay little for them, but spend more on management; or we look at properties at the top and we do not have to spend much on management. We do not want to do both: that is, buy top pastoral leases and spend top money on management. I think these things even out like the ebb and flow of water between two tanks. It is the same with finance. Surely that is commonsense.

        What that means is that in no way should sacred matters be revealed. In the event that they do come up in the exercise of the ILC's performance of the its functions, then the ILC should at least let the minister know that there has been this issue. The ILC does not have to say what it is. The ILC does not have to reveal the nature of those sensitive matters, but it should simply keep the minister posted.

         We might have a situation where the ILC makes a decision which might be controversial. The decision might cause some interest in the media or in the public arena and, of course, the ILC is unable to come out and detail the sensitive issue would could not be divulged. At least if the ILC lets the minister know, then the minister is aware of what the ILC is doing. In a way it is a protection of the ILC because it means the ILC can at least tell the minister what is going on and why it is doing something or has taken a certain course of action.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I believe that is quite important because the minister could then put in his report, not the detail of the sensitive nature, that in a certain instance the ILC observed section 191F(4) of the act and accordingly reported to him, and that is the end of the matter. But people then know for reasons of that nature that a certain decision was made. I believe it goes to accountability. It is not a situation where the ILC might make a decision not to disclose something or, in keeping something confidential, it could attract criticism by people who do not really know why it is doing that and it is not at liberty to come out and say it.

         So that is the opposition's amendment in a nutshell. I do not think there is anything terribly controversial in it. It is not of great weight, but I think it just might afford the ILC an opportunity to express to the minister why it took a certain course of action. That at least gives it the protection of the act.

         â€”As Senator Ellison said, this is not one of the larger policy issues we are fighting about but, nonetheless, the government does not think this really achieves much more than adds yet another kind of obligation of an essentially bureaucratic kind upon the corporation in terms of the carrying on of its functions. The ILC cannot disclose the substance of something to the minister without being in breach of its obligations to keep secret sacred information. Just to report to the minister that it has a problem of this kind in respect of some sacred information is not going to add much to the minister's store of knowledge.

         If it is just simply a matter of giving the ILC an opportunity to give that information, then that is not an opportunity that it needs a statutory backing to exercise. If the corporation feels as a matter of desirability in keeping the minister informed that the minister should be aware of this sort of problem then, of course, the corporation can do so. But to create yet another statutory obligation really is just a part of what we have described as a sort of a drip pattern of, essentially, bureaucratic obligations which just make life unnecessarily difficult.

         â€”People do not normally fetter bodies that they create with reporting responsibilities, be they ever so minor, unless there is some very good reason for doing so. It cannot just be because it seems like a good idea to give it an extra job to do. People vest confidence in the boards that they create. They vest the responsibility for engaging in the management and policy decisions. To keep this sort of umbilical cord running unnecessarily between the ILC and the minister is to, we believe, go further than the policy needs demand or require.

         â€”My reply to that is that it is not often that boards are given this sort of statutory direction that they have to keep something which is sacred absolutely confidential. It is an unusual subsection. We do not find this in our everyday, common-or-garden variety piece of federal legislation. It is something which states that a board has to keep something confidential; that is, to keep it a secret. That is not normal in government. I am not saying that we are against itâ€”

         â€”Senator Kernot and I have both had an experience in another matter on this point. But here is a part of a statute which says, `Look, it's secret'â€”and we're not arguing with it being secret, but we're just sayingâ€”`Look, this is an unusual piece of legislation and we believe, where something is kept secret, that board should have a duty to report that it has exercised a function because of this requirement.' It does not go into why; it does not divulge this secret. It just says its function has been affected by this subsection.

         We just think that it goes to transparency in government, and that is the reason why we have inserted it. We would not have done it otherwise. I agree with what Senator Gareth Evans said. The average board is invested with a certain amount of autonomy and does not have to report, but I would like to see how many boards have this sort of requirement.

I cannot believe that Senator Evans is making such heavy weather of what I would consider is imperative that this legislation contains some recognition of the importance of sacred matters. I think it goes without saying that, while it may well be in some way a restriction on the ILC, it is a totally appropriate one, if it is a restriction, which goes in favour of the indigenous land holders, and appropriately so.

         So I think what we are forgetting, and I do not think any of us should forget it, is that this is a government body that is being set up. It is deriving funds from the public account. Its members are appointed so far, unless the Greens get support for our amendment for total indigenous representation on the board, it is not even a 100 per cent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander board. It is appropriate that there be some written guarantees that these matters are recognised to be unique and important. The Greens will be supporting it. I just say in passing that we seem to have skipped the Green's amendment No. 4, which actually fits in with this one. We will be putting that one next.

         â€”Where a body makes a decision which is based on grounds which it is not at liberty to divulgeâ€”much like the Foreign Investment Review Boardâ€”in a case where we all agree that it should remain secret, at the very least it should have a duty to advise the minister of the fact that it has had to exercise its function in accordance with this subsection. If we had a minister at odds with the ILC and there was no such requirement, it might well be that the minister was at fault or the ILC was at fault; there could be a communication breakdown between the two. There could easily be a public controversy over a decision made by the ILC and the ILC has failed to notify the minister. If the minister does not have that protection, he cannot answer in the public arena as to what is going on.

         Similarly, there could be members of the ILC who are against the minister and do not want to notify the minister, while some other members do. This requirement would mean that it would not be up to them. It would be mandatory for them to advise the minister of the day. I say to Senator Kernot that the present government will not be in power forever. She might want to reflect on how this might operate in the future. Everything might not be sweetness and light for all time. That is all I am saying. It is not a button off the shirt of the argument but it could save a good deal of strife.

        This amendment relates to the same clause. It relates to the requirement for the performance of the ILC to reflect social and cultural needs. The bill, as it was originally presented in the chamber, emphasises the economic benefits when the ILC performs its function. We believe it is heavily weighted to ensuring economic wellbeing. There are few references in the bill to building the social and cultural wellbeing of Aboriginal people.

         The Greens (WA) are concerned that the bill ought to give as much weight to social and cultural needs and employment skills and business opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as to economic benefits. It falls in line with the debate we had yesterday. It also emphasises the spirit of the bill and ties in with the amendment that has just been passed which recognises that there are other important spiritual values attached to the land for Aboriginal people which deserve not only respect in silence, but mention in such an important piece of legislation.

        These amendments relate to disposal of surplus land. They substitute a new subsection 191J(2) and consequential amendmentsâ€”191J(1)(a)(ii)(B) and 191J(1)(b). The bill permits the ILC or its subsidiaries to dispose of land that it no longer needs to hold. Only in the case where the ILC acquires land for the purpose of making a grant of interest to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the Greens (WA) believe that it is appropriate that relevant people and bodies should be consulted before the ILC disposes of any land. We believe that the bill should require consultation with relevant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders, or trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts before disposal of any land which has been bought specifically for grants to indigenous people.

         â€”We do not think this amendment is necessary but if there is a majority in favour of it, we will not pursue it to the point of a division. The power to dispose of surplus land will be used in the following situations: where the ILC has purchased a parcel of land, only part of which is required for granting to indigenous peopleâ€”part, for example, might be required to be sold to assist in the financing of the other part; where land which was originally purchased by the ILC is surrendered to the ILC for disposal on behalf of the land-holders; or when the ILC is unable to find an appropriate body to hold title to land which it has purchased.

But life is too short to engage in another major debate, if the passion for consultation which has been newly acquired by some in this chamber is going to have yet another manifestation.

         â€”I just wanted to clarify the position. Opposition amendment 15, which deals with 191J(1)(b), deals with the deletion of (1)(b) and then substitutes a fresh (b), which was, of course, dealing with the acquisition of interests by individuals. I thought that had already been carried. So that would mean there is a new 191J(1)(b). Senator Chamarette's amendment also seeks to omit 191J(1)(b), which has already been omitted.

         So really there is no need for Senator Chamarette's I2. Is that agreed? Senator Chamarette then goes to I1 and looks at 191J(1)(a) (ii)(B) and deletes simply `and' at the end. Is that right?

But the problem is that we have put in a new (b) in 15 so that `and' would have to remain, I think, if I read that correctly. I just wonder whether that is how Senator Chamarette understands it.

         Life is getting a bit difficult when we cannot even move into a give away without getting a bucket thrown on us. What we are trying to say is that the bill started out with an obligation to propose a national strategy and a set of regional strategies. There was anxiety expressed on the part of the Greens and, to some extent, on the part of the opposition that somehow the regional strategies with which people had a prior concern, because of the general belief that regional strategies were more likely to be responsive to the needs of people on the ground, might be swamped by some national strategy which was not as responsive by its very nature to the needs of people on the ground. So we had a whole set of amendments being moved in a rather complicated, tortuous way to try to somehow resolve this perceived difficulty.

         What we are now prepared to concede is that rather than creating the potential for such difficulty by having two simultaneous statutory obligationsâ€”to have regional strategies on the one hand and the national one on the otherâ€”we would withdraw the reference to a statutory obligation to prepare a national strategy. There may well be some view on the part of the ILC that there are some guidelines for the administration of the fund and the management principles and so on, which will sensibly be capable of being drawn up as a management tool and just as a rational way of organising its business. It may or may not want to describe those guidelines as elements of a national strategy. But it would be very difficult, I think we would concede, to accurately express in some single strategy document the needs and aspirations of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the way that was contemplated in the original bill.

         The Greens proposed that the bill be amended to require that regional strategies have precedence over the national strategy, and that the national strategy be constructed on the basis of the regional strategies. As I am saying, rather than getting into that sort of territory and having the possibility if we do that of having each one of the strategies being challenged by someone because all of this is a statutory obligationâ€”therefore it is justiciable and people do not like what has been produced and so onâ€”we are suggesting that it might be best to delete the obligation, the requirement, altogether for the ILC to prepare national strategies, such that regional strategies would now provide the basis for the ILC's decision making.

Clearly, there were concerns by the Greens and the opposition about the whole regime, and I am glad to see that the government has been constructive enough to recognise those. But the practical reality is that we were provided with this amendment but a few minutes ago.

So I am prepared to concede that part of the briefing we may have been given was to discuss the strategy. But the concept of getting rid of the national strategies is quite new to usâ€”only four or five minutes oldâ€”and we would take up Senator Evans's offer that we have time to discuss it. I think, broadly speaking, the idea is sound, but by doing away with the national strategies we may seek to amend our attitude to the way the regional strategies may work. We will need to see what is left when we implement the government's proposed amendments. I will give a commitment to the Senate and to the government that we will do so over the dinner adjournment.

         While Senator Evans did say that he would be willing to address this and we did see the amendments, we in no way agreed to them. So I have to inform him that the Greens actually do not support his amendments and we do not see getting rid of the national strategy as a real way out. It is something that he persists in wanting to use for the ILC. I quote his words, `Rather than getting into an overt structure which can be challenged, they just drop it out.' I am afraid I do not regard that as an equivalent reversal of priorities from regional to national.

         If we simply delete the word `national' without giving the priority to the regional level and we just say, `Well, no doubt there will be some kind of implicit national type of organisation for the ILC to be able to make sense of the regional strategies, but we do not need to actually put that in,' that is not an adequate response. So I think it would be a good idea over the dinner break for the government, the opposition and everyone else in the chamber to consider how we can best emphasise the regional importance of any strategy which is to be dealing with the land acquisition and management program.

This is meaning to serve the community and to assist it regionally, and to put the priority in that way is the only sensible way to give precedence to the needs of Aboriginal communities.

         The difficulty is that that is a sort of metaphysical conundrum that they create. There are general rules that are possibly perceived as applicable for the whole of the country. There will be standard operating guidelines, the kind of standard terms of conditions and so on that will apply in the absence of any other local consideration.

         A route is being opened up for unscrupulous individuals to convert Aboriginal land to cash. There is a total weakening of the accountability process. This is about giving land to Aboriginal people. It is not about giving a source of potential profit to Aboriginal people. There may well be circumstances in which that land will need to be disposed of by way of mortgage or, in special circumstances, for some other reason. I cannot think for the moment what that other reason might be other than as part of a reconsolidation of a pastoral propertyâ€”selling off one bit in order to acquire another. An arrangement of that kind may make sense. But if there is a good reason associated with the philosophy and proper implementationist legislation for a disposal to take place, it can be assumed that the ILC will consent to it, as is provided for.

So the provision is there in 191S and 191T for disposal to occur, but only with the consent of the ILC.

         Clauses 191S and 191T are the most objectionable parts of the legislation; they should be headed with the word `paternalism'â€”in capitals. This is the part of the legislation that Mr Dillon, probably with the benefit of hindsight, referred to when he talked at the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration about the assets of the ILC.

         The effect of the legislation is that the ILC will purchase the land. The indigenous land-holders can then use the land, but they are required to ask the permission of the ILC whenever they want to do anything with it. When it comes to selling the land or having any other dealings with it, they have to go to the ILC and ask for permission. When it comes to sale of the land, under section 191T they may then surrender their interests to the ILC, subject to the terms and conditions as agreed between the body corporate and the ILC. These are the sorts of provisions that make this act entirely paternalistic.

         We share with the Greens the view that when seeking to address the disadvantage of Aboriginals we should place a little bit of trust in them and a little bit of power in their hands. Yesterday, Senator Evans spoke eloquently when describing his friend who shared his home with him when he was doing his law studies. He spoke about his friend's intrinsic and spiritual need to get out of Melbourne and feel the benefit of his spiritual links with the land. Now Senator Evans is asking the committee to believe his assumption that people like his friend, Aboriginal people who have been fighting to gain land for generations, would seek to sell their land to make a quick cash profit. That is the very kind of paternalism that we in the coalition believe is the root cause of the failure of many of the Aboriginal affairs policies that have been visited upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians for the past 10 or 20 years.

Of course, 191S and 191T are the very provisions that ensure that we do not do that.

         As Senator Ellison reminded me a minute ago, only yesterday Senator Evans was saying that we cannot grant land to individuals because an Aboriginal man might marry a white woman. To him, it would be outrageous to think that the Aboriginal man might die and bequeath that property to his non-Aboriginal wife. When I suggested by way of interjection that they might have children and that the Aboriginal children might also benefit from the land, he said, `For the purposes of this hypothetical case, let's pretend they didn't have any children.' Of course, that is absurd.

         The reality is that, if an Aboriginal man has chosen to marry a non-Aboriginal woman, that non-Aboriginal woman has clearly become a part of that family and a part of that community. Under the entirely non-partisan view of what determines Aboriginality, that woman, for all intents and purposes, would see herself as part of the Aboriginal community anyway. So the minister drew an absurd concept, and it is equally absurd when applied to these provisions.

         We believe that if we are to empower Aboriginal Australians we should do so with goodwill and trust. If any Aboriginal person was to read these provisions carefullyâ€”as so many of the Aboriginals that we have spoken to over the last week have doneâ€”they would realise that these provisions severely restrict even their self-determination, to use that term. The provisions impose restrictions on the right to dispose of or charge property and they apply when the body corporate acquires an interest in the land. The body corporate must not, without the consent of the ILC, dispose of an interest or have any other dealing with the land. Further, if it does so without informing the ILC, the deal has no effect. That creates all sorts of other problems.

The opposition has given this matter due consideration; we have read the provisions up and down. We believe, as does Senator Chamarette, in the principle of giving Aboriginal people a say in what they do with their own landâ€”the sort of say that other Australians have, that our forebears had when they were granted or given land, that all other Australians enjoyâ€”

This legislation is effectively just that, a corporate structure. It does not have principles or objects. It just wants to own all the land.

This is what is so bizarre about this bill. The government pretends that it is setting up a regime to give land to the Aboriginals; it does not. It is setting up a land fund which is kept in the public account. It is not $1.4 billion. It is a new appropriation of just in excess of $20 million a yearâ€”approximately the same amount of money that we are appropriating to fund the Olympic gold medal plan so that our athletes can win some gold medals in Sydney in the year 2000. That is how much the new appropriation is. Then the government does not even give the Aboriginals the land.

         The Aboriginal Development Commission Act was a Fraser government piece of legislation and the first one that made it possible for money to be made available for the acquisition of land for Aboriginal people. That was then subsumed in the later ATSIC act. Both of those pieces of legislation contained provisions prohibiting the disposal of property so granted without the consent of the commission. Where were those principles that those opposite are articulating now when the ADC act was put down by their own previous government?

         The fourth principle is the accountability of statutory bodies. There is a horrible choice to be made here.

But we should think very carefully before we support amendments which have as their ultimate end point the easy disposal of that land stock. It undermines the purpose of the bill. I am not saying that people will acquire the land and seek to sell it within 24 hours or anything like that.

Unfortunately, I cannot speak on behalf of ATSIC, but maybe during the dinner adjournment I could get some examples. There are a lot of examples of where individuals quite knowingly take actions which are designed to do what Senator Gareth Evans is sayingâ€”that we should take on trust and maybe assume the right to make mistakes.

         â€”Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was making the point about the horrid choice, which is one we are often faced with in here, of competing principles. I was coming to the conclusion that, in pursuing the rights to self-determination of some, it is unfortunate if the end result is that we undermine the ownership of a resource by the many. That is why in my decision on this amendment I am more guided by the need to maintain the land stock and the appropriate accountability of the statutory authority and the `appropriate' use of public moneys.

When Senator Evans comes out with words like `taxpayers' money being thrown away' if Aboriginal people have the right to dispose of their land or to take out a mortgage or to change that land for another piece of land, I find that offensive. Those phrases are redolent of an interview I had with Howard Sattler on 6PR, where the same kind of usage of terms has to my mind a very offensive ring. Words like `we cannot risk the Aboriginal estate' and phrases like `the land stock' lead me to ask whose Aboriginal estate it is and whose land stock we are risking by giving Aboriginal people their own land.

         â€”I am very glad, but in order to make sure that Aboriginal people's land stays there, it is never given to them; they are simply allowed to use it, which fosters an illusion of possession which is not in reality full possession with no strings attached. It was pointed out earlier today that that is 20 years out-of-date paternalism. I believe it underlies the inherent fraud and paternalism of this bill. On the one hand, there is a `billion dollar fund' that never leaves consolidated revenue, that never leaves the public account, and there is a draw-down from it which does not go to Aboriginal people; it goes to non-Aboriginal peopleâ€”$42 million a yearâ€”in order to give Aboriginal people land. On the other hand, it is not given to them. We just let them use it, provided they meet the conditions and the requirements of the ILC.

         I am sorry, but that is not giving Aboriginal people the power and trust they deserve. If it is a risk, we should give them that risk. Before non-Aboriginal Australia gets too self-righteous about giving taxpayers' money in order to give the land to Aboriginal people, we ought to remember what Senator Campbell referred to in passing. Not many of us have actually bought our land. A lot of us have inherited land. Our ancestors were given land originally. They were given leases. There was the settlers scheme. Many families owe their current prosperity to land that they were given. Even if we were not given land, even if some of us bought land, just remember that nobody bought it from the original owners in the first place. So there is no harm whatsoever in giving it back.

         People have expressed concernâ€”which I have labelled paternalisticâ€”about this unwillingness to give back the land. Senator Gareth Evans pointed out quite correctly that there are some phrases in the ATSIC act that imply that land acquired through ATSIC funds cannot be disposed without permission. It is not mentioned in the Northern Territory land rights act, which is an interesting case for those people who are concerned that, if Aboriginal people are given land by the land fund, they will somehow dispose of it and lose it for their own community.

         There is one very easy non-paternalistic way out of it: support the amendment that the Greens will be presenting later on which allows native title to be revived. If we give them inalienable rights to their land we do not have to worry. It stays in the Aboriginal estateâ€”if one wants to use that termâ€”except that, then, the Aboriginal estate is owned by Aboriginal people. It is kept in the land stock, but it is kept in the land stock of the indigenous ownersâ€”the people who were here prior to European settlement. So there is a non-paternalistic way to guard and protect Aboriginal land for Aboriginal people to use. It is one which gives them back the rights we took from them when we stole their land in the first place and never paid them for it and do not rightly possess it now.

         These two clauses, which this amendment proposes to omit, are very important parts of this legislation. They show how truly flawed is any attempt by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to say that this legislation is a redressing of the dispossession of 200 years. If the Prime Minister and the government really want to do that, then they should match the rhetoric with some reality. That reality is missing, and it is missing in a very important way in these two clauses.

         As has correctly been stated by Senators Campbell and Chamarette, either land is given awayâ€”grantedâ€”or it is not. We are not having a Clayton's land fund. We are not having one in which the Indigenous Land Corporation is going to be the biggest land-holder in the country and hold land on trust inter vivos for some people who, it considers, cannot make those decisions themselves. That is what these two proposed sections mean. A look at the situation reveals that it is worse than paternalism; it is a collectivism, a communism, an absolute intrusion by the stateâ€”`the state will control this land so long as it suits us. We are not giving you the land; it will remain under our control. You get your pastoral lease, but it is not yours to have and to hold because you cannot get rid of it.'

Could honourable senators imagine other Australians being put in the position of not being allowed to sell their home without going back to the bank or, even worse, the government? What sort of country are we going to be living in? It is unAustralian and it is unfair. Either they are given land or they are not.

         As far as accountability goes, let me remind the government of opposition amendment No. 5A, which deals with the amendments to proposed new section 191D(2). It says that, where the Indigenous Land Corporation makes a grant of money, it may do so on terms. These terms and conditions could include the purpose for which the money is spent; that is, we can tell them, `We're giving you this money but you've got to spend it on this particular purpose. Nonetheless, it is yours, but it has to be spent on that purpose.' That section also addresses the issue of the period within which the money is to be spent. If the money is given to a corporation, it cannot sit on it so that the members of the corporation or the community do not enjoy the benefits of it. There must be a time period. The acquittal of the money spent is another condition.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is also the condition that there be giving of information in relation to the grant. Finally, if the grant is breached in any of its terms, the money becomes repayable. That is more than enough in relation to accountability. We allow terms and conditions not only for a grant of money, but also for loans and guarantees. A guarantee can be subject to such terms and conditions as the ILC sees fit. The same applies to a loan of money. Much like a bank, the ILC can impose its own terms and conditions but, once that is done, recipients are free to do what they will with the loanâ€”just as all other Australian citizens are free to do with it what they will.

         That is the thrust of our accountability. We are saying that we do not just give Aboriginal people land, money and guarantees holus-bolus. We have imposed conditions and avenues of accountability so that the recipients remain accountable for their actions in relation to the money received. That is done. That is all there in these amendments. But 191S and 191T tend to keep the strings over the land, so we end up with one of the biggest land trustees in Australia's history. With about $20 million a year, it is just going to keep adding to the stock. In fact, it will end up controlling vast tracts of land because the recipients will not be able to dispose of the land without getting the consent of this monolithic, gigantic ogreâ€”the ILC. The recipients will have to go to the ILC before they can dispose of the land. That is absolutely not on. The banks and interest rates we have now are bad enough.

         Government senators use these great terms from the preamble to the Native Title Act and say that they will form a land fund for dispossessed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But it is a land fund which is no land fund at all; it is just a method of collecting and accumulating land for a bureaucracy called the ILC. In true liberal terms, we believe that a decision should be made whether to give or not to giveâ€”we either give these people the land or we do not. It is Sydney or the bush. `If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.' There is no halfway. Once the decision has been made to grant these people land, it should be done.

It is not divesting of the land in its natural form. There is no divesting of an interest. These people hold this interest in the form of a trust. That is all it is.

         But I have no doubt about the effect of supporting a combination of the amendments moved to allow grants to individual Aboriginal people. The ability to dispose of the land and make a windfall profit from it 24 hours after they acquire it would be an absolute disaster in the administration of this scheme. That is the heart of this amendment, and the government is right to oppose it.

         Finally, I will deal with a number of references to paternalism made by Senator Chamarette. Senator Ellison used to death all the high-flown and high-blown rhetoric about paternalism and so on. There is one fundamental flaw in his argument about paternalism in this regard; that is, this is a structure uniquely for the benefit of Aboriginal Australians and no-one else. There is no valid comparison with how the government would deal with non-Aboriginal people in respect of the control of the land. As Senator Gareth Evans pointed out so succinctly and correctlyâ€”I was in here listening to him before dinnerâ€”these are grants that are rightly and properly given to Aboriginal people which non-Aboriginal people simply do not get the benefit of. So these constant cries of paternalism are false indeed.

Senator Ellison is putting conditions on grants of money. But, in most cases, the land will be acquired directly by the organisation itself without grants of money. His amendments do not go to placing conditions. Indeed, he has not even canvassed the conditions in terms of the acquisition of the property and how long it would have to be held before it could be disposed of. His assertion, by way of interjection and the contribution he has just made in debate, that his amendmentâ€”which relates to grants of money, not landâ€”would somehow control an irresponsible disposition of property for windfall gain is not correct. He should look at his own amendment.

         We were going to include provisions whereby the ILC would need to register caveats when it had interests in the land. When we read the bill closely we see that the ILC has an interest in land everywhereâ€”it has an interest in every single piece of land. I finally found the passage quoting Mr Dillon at the committee hearing the other day. Senator Chamarette will remember him talking about the assets of the land fund. I will repeat what he said because it is very important that people understand that the ILC will maintain an interest in every single piece of land that it purchases in perpetuity. Mr Dillon was asked about the assets of the trust when Senator Kernot, I think it was, was raising doubts about whether the fund was worth $1.4 million. He said:

        He qualified it there. I am sure Senator Collins will seek to make that point. Senator Kernot has raised, probably privatelyâ€”I am not sure whether she referred to it in her contributionâ€”that this is an abrogation of all of the things that the coalition has ever said about accountability and ATSIC. Senator Evans made this point before dinner. The reality is that many of the land acquisition programs run by ATSIC have created disasters. Senator Panizza has been most astute in questioning ATSIC about the expenditure of money and how some of the pastoral leases have not been run properly.

The reality is that by taking this traditional approach whereby people buy land but do not have control of itâ€”clauses 191S and 191T ensure that these strings are attached to the land in perpetuityâ€”it is saying that we do not trust the Aboriginal people to do the right thing. Senator Collins is quite right: just like with any other human being, we are going to find people whom we can trust and who will do the right thing and people to whom we can give some responsibility. Of course, there will be Aboriginals, as there are in so many ATSIC cases, who will abuse the system. But, quite frankly, having the ILC maintaining control over the land is not going to solve that problem. If the ILC is the ultimate landlord in perpetuity, it is not going to stop Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders from abusing the system, as some of them doâ€”thankfully a minorityâ€”under the current land acquisition programs of ATSIC.

         Senator Ellison quite properly pointed to the fact that the accountability provisions put inâ€”they are actually government amendments which were further amended by the coalition in relation to the grants of money, guarantees and loansâ€”are a serious measure to ensure that those grants, guarantees and loans are provided on terms and conditions that are fair to all the parties. What is envisaged is that when we give a grant of land, which is the first step as Senator Collins quite properly says, it is not the end of the bargain. This act quite properly envisages that the ILC will have an ongoing involvement in helping with land management, consultancy, training and educationâ€”helping by making available loans, grants and guarantees.

         I will deal with the point I was dealing with first. Senator Collins did not understand, so I will address it again. The fact is that Senator Ellison quite properly pointed out that there are accountability provisions relating to grants of money and guarantees and loans. Senator Collins agrees with that, but he is saying that there is a distinction. He is quite right. The opposition is saying that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be able to make decisions in relation to their land and they should be their decisions. It does not stop there. If Senator Collins is saying that most of the time the land acquisition fund will give land to Aboriginals and say, `Good on you, off you go'â€”

They are important because in many cases the ILC will have a continuing interest because it will give loans to people who have land, it will give guarantees, it will give grants of money and it will be involved with management, advice, education and so on. That is the proper function, which the bill envisages. That is the point Senator Ellison was makingâ€”a very important pointâ€”that all of these things are accountable on what, we hope, most closely approximate normal commercial terms and conditions.

Of course, that, as Senator Harradine said by way of interjection, is a matter of trust. Under the government's billâ€”and I refer Senator Collins to proposed new section 191S on page 13, under the heading `Purported disposals to be of no effect'â€”they could actually be granted the land one day and dispose of it the next day.

That relates to the question of strings being attached to the grant of money. We can give money to people, they go down the road, they can spend it, they can gamble it or whatever. A grant of land is something different. That means a transfer of title that goes into a person's name.

         In the amendment referred to by Senator Collins we have said that the Indigenous Land Corporation, when making that grant, has to ascertain that it advances or promotes the viability of that communityâ€”and we look at health, housing and everything else. When we make that grant to the individual, the groupsâ€”and of course the ILC no doubt would make this choice very carefullyâ€”we do it with those criteria in mind. If people then want to divest themselves of that land at a later stage, they exercise a right like any other person in Australia. In fact, if it was Redfern, Sydney, one would hope they would not keep the land for ever.

        This amendment deals with the public knowledge of the effect of section 191S on interests in land. We started with the same position as that of the opposition in seeking to lodge a caveat. We have received legal adviceâ€”I would be interested in the opposition's comments on this adviceâ€”that interests in land as proposed by the opposition's amendment can be registered only under the laws in each of the states, which is why we have gone with the register idea rather than the caveat idea put forward by the opposition.

         Our concern is about the selling and mortgaging of land.

We have drafted an amendment that seeks to fix this problem without prescribing unnecessary conditions on the ILC.

Had the amendment been carried by the committee, the opposition envisaged that the use of the caveat systemâ€”we will have to deal with the point that Senator Kernot raisedâ€”would have had relevance to loans and grants of money. So the general thrust of our amendment now needs to be altered. I suggest that coalition amendment No. 27 be deferred until later in the evening.

A special notification provision was needed because there was a special limitation on the capacity to alienateâ€”that is, the special limitation of 191S and 191T. If that special limitation is taken away, there is nothing different from the application of the ordinary land law, and caveats are applicable in the ordinary wayâ€”ordinary charges over land.

         As we heard during the hearing of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on this bill, this measure is designed to meet the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Marshall Perron. When speaking during the second reading debate, Senator Tambling tabled the correspondence in which the Prime Minister gave a commitment that any land acquired through this land fund would not be able to be used under the Northern Territory land rights act.

         This amendment seeks to remove the restriction on claims under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. I have made it clear to the Northern Territory land councils that the Greens (WA) thoroughly disapprove of the arrangements that the government has reached with the territory government over land acquired under this bill. We have also made it clear that we disapprove of the split of moneys between the ILC and ATSIC, which is designed to escape from the deal that the Prime Minister made with Marshall Perron. However, it would be churlish, to use one of Senator Evans's favourite words, and ungenerous of us to remove the split unless proposed section 191U is also removed. If we are successful in deleting this section, we propose to alter the bill so that, as of the beginning of financial year 1995-96, all land fund moneys should be made to the Indigenous Land Corporation and not ATSIC. Later in this debate we will also move an amendment to remove the sunset clause from the Northern Territory land rights act.

         This whole issue throws into the spotlight the issue of the sunset clause on claims under the Northern Territory land rights act. That will be in three years time; the split goes for three years. The whole reason for diverting half the money through ATSIC would appear to be to maximise the amount of land acquired in the Northern Territory in the next three years so that it can be claimed before the sunset clause comes into effect.

         I was shocked to discover that it was the Hawke government which moved to place a limit on the time available for claims under the Northern Territory land rights act. I was also shocked to find a total absence of any opposition in either house of the parliament. Why should there be a limit on the time available for land to be claimed in the Northern Territory? Why should this bill make it inappropriate for acquired land to be claimable under the Northern Territory land rights act? It is an outrage, and the purpose of this amendment is to address that matter. Whether or not the amendment is passed, it should go on the public record because it exposes for all to see the kinds of deals that underlie this piece of legislation.

         â€”The government opposes this amendment. I think the background to it is well known. The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act, although pastoral leases purchased by the corporation will be eligible for conversion to native title under section 47 of the Native Title Act. There are no barriers to land acquired by ATSIC being claimed under the land rights act prior to the cut-off date for claims, which is 1997. This is just a matter of getting a reasonable balance between the competing claims and interests here. We are not prepared to allow the potential for open slather on conversions to inalienable freehold prior to the cut-off for claims. On that basis we oppose this amendment.

         It needs to be remembered that already nearly 40 per cent of land in the Northern Territory is held by Aboriginal people under inalienable title under the provisions of the land rights act in the Northern Territory. It is against that background and in that context that this particular limitation has been introduced. It is obviously a reasonably sensitive issue, not only as between the Commonwealth and the territory government but also with the Aboriginal people themselves. It is one of those provisions that have been seen to be a reasonable compromise between the competing claims and interests that are involved. Accordingly, we recommend the clause to the Senate in its present form and oppose the amendment.

         â€”The coalition will oppose the amendment. I think the crux of it is that it seeks to give, even though in only a limited way, effect to the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Northern Territory government. I have already pointed out in my speech in the second reading debateâ€”I think Senator Tambling did as wellâ€”that that promise to the Northern Territory government has been avoided by ensuring that half the money goes to ATSIC and half goes to the ILC for the first three years until the date of the sunset provision. That is the coalition's position, and I will not delay the Senate any further by debating the amendment any longer.

         â€”We have a realignment here. The Australian Democrats will support this Green amendment. I would rather give effect to the rights of Northern Territory Aboriginal people than to the agreement between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. But I foreshadow that I do not support any changes to the transitional funding arrangements with ATSIC.

        It then goes on to talk about the responsibilities of the board. The opposition seeks to say in 191V(2)(a) that the chairperson is appointed by the Prime Minister; in (b) that the deputy chairperson is appointed by the Minister for Finance; and in (c) that the commission chairperson, or a commissioner, is nominated by the commission. Proposed new section 191X(1) states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        An Indigenous Land Corporation Director referred to in paragraph 191V(2)(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), or (g) is to be appointed by the Minister. . .

       <para>
        We would substitute `Minister' with `Prime Minister' and `the Minister for Finance', as the case requires. We are saying that there has to be a split in the appointment. At the moment the bill says that the minister appoints the chairperson, the deputy chairperson, the ordinary member in (d), another ordinary member in (e), a further ordinary member in (f), and the remaining ordinary member in (g). We say that is just too much of the situation of putting all one's eggs in one basket. We are saying that the Prime Minister should appoint the chairperson and that we should have diversity in the executive as to who makes the appointments to the board.

         I suppose it could be said by those who are quite cynical that this would not make a jot of difference because the government would get together and appoint whoever it wanted. Nonetheless, it does provide for a diversity in the appointment. Of course, the commissioner in paragraph (c) is not the commission chairperson but the commissioner nominated by the commission, which means that there has to be an election of some sort.

         It might be worth while considering Green amendment M9 now as it deals with this very point. That amendment stated that the person to be appointed was to be elected. Senator Chamarette might be able to assist us there. The opposition did not have any trouble with that.

         The thrust of these amendments is to have diversity in the people who make appointments to the board. Much has been said about the board appointments. Another amendment circulated deals with the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people appointed to this board. We believe this board should not be just a lap dog for the government. We believe this board should represent all sections of the Aboriginal community or, if not, as much as possible.

         We realise that is a fine ideal but hard to achieve. This has been a problem, as seen in the current problems with ATSIC, in that we need to have diversity in representation. But to start with, we need diversity in appointment. The Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister could well have someone that they respectively would wish to appoint. Therefore, all power will not rest with one person. That is the basis of these amendments.

         I think this amendment just misunderstands a little the way in which things operate in the real world of executive government; namely, these appointments are all the subject of cabinet approval. It is not a matter of the individual minister doing his own thing. Statutory appointments are the subject of cabinet approval and endorsement, so there is a collective input whoever notionally or nominally has the nominating responsibility.

         That does cut across the normal provision whereby the minister who, under the administrative arrangements order, is responsible for administering the act in question has the basic responsibility for administering all of it and performing all the functions that have to be performed by individual ministers.

         It is just a bit of a slight, in a sense, to identify another minister as being responsible for particular appointments. Not only is it a slight to the administering minister, but it also, as I began by saying, does not recognise the reality that in any event these appointments are cabinet appointments anyway. That is why we would prefer to stick with the original language in clauses 31 and 32.

         As to the reference to an ATSIC chairperson being an automatic member of the board rather than a commissioner not being the chairperson, we just think it is appropriate that the chairperson be on the board, given the consultation that will need to occur between the two organisations.

         There is already provision for an ATSIC commissioner to be appointed to the board, as I think Senator Ellison acknowledged, although there is some disposition to delete or amend that, which we will be debating later on. I do not pretend there is a gigantic issue of principle here. I am not treating every one of these amendments as being of the same degree of significance in terms of their impact on the legislation, but I do not really think this adds anything. In fact, it takes a little away from the legislation. So we do oppose it.

We think it reinforces the fact that this is a government board and a government operative and is not a valid way to make the appointment.

        This clause omits the need to consult the Minister for Finance on the appointment of the director of the ILC. I have already stated my reasons for that. I know Senator Gareth Evans regards it as churlish. It is unnecessary and I do not see why it should be included. As he pointed out so clearly when the amendment was moved by the opposition, even if the Prime Minister made the appointment, it would be through the minister and then, presumably, there would be a capacity to consult that does not have to be written in. I am sure he will be amazed at my flexibility in this regard.

         â€”It is perfectly true that it does not need to be written in because, as a practical matter, one would expect that consultation to occur, even if it is only across the cabinet table when the appointment comes for endorsement by the cabinet, as I said was the practice. However, it is not unusual in legislation where very large sums of money are involved for an explicit consultative provision to be written in with the Minister for Finance just to ensure that the disposition of that money is properly done. The ILC will be responsible for the expenditure of very large amounts of money. Proposed section 191X(4) of the bill provides that, among the expertise of the directors of the ILC, there has to be experience in business or finance management. It is therefore appropriate, as we see it, that the Minister for Finance should be consulted on the appointment of directors of the corporation and that particular statutory attention be given to that consultative process in this context. It is not a world shattering matter were this to come out, but I indicate the government's position and the reasons for it.

        I want to go right through the series M amendments. I have already discussed with Senator Ellison the fact that, if they are agreed to, they will supersede the opposition's amendments Nos 35 and 36. If they fail, then the opposition is free to go ahead with its amendments Nos 35 and 36. Amendment M1 requires that all ILC directors be Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. I want to correct an error in my earlier remarks in relation to new amendment M9, which is about a minister appointing elected commissioners rather than appointing commissioners. I said that was a consensus decision.

         This particular issue is that all ILC directors are to be Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. This was the request of all the people at the Melbourne meeting. They felt that, if it were going to be an appointed board, then at least all the members should be Aboriginal. I think that people felt it was offensive in this day and age to imply that two of the members should be non-Aboriginal because Aboriginal people may not have all the skills that were required. The Aboriginal people at that meeting felt assured that the finance and accounting skills to meet those needs could be found within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and they specifically asked me to put that. So I am moving that amendment and I will be calling a divisionâ€”well, I may not call a division but I will if there is any disputeâ€”because I think it is important to put that on the record for the Aboriginal people at the Melbourne meeting.

         â€”About which I do not think there is any contention, but we can sort that out when we get there. I wish to respond to M1â€”which is the only amendment in front of us at that momentâ€”which removes the provision of a chairperson and at least four others, and substitutes a requirement that all of the corporation board members be of indigenous descent.

         The bill makes it possible for all board members to be indigenous but does not make this a requirement. It is likely that the board will be all indigenous when there are indigenous people with the appropriate level of expertise available to be part of it. There may be circumstances in which it may be helpful to the ILC to use the skills and experiences of non-indigenous experts in a situation where there are perhaps insufficient indigenous people available to play that role. It is helpful for there to be that extra degree of flexibility.

         In this respect, the bill is based on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Indigenous Commercial Development Corporation model, which provides that at least five of the nine board members must be indigenous. It is the same principle. It is important to note that, in the context of that corporation, some quite crucial contributions have been made by some of its non-indigenous members who have been appointed because of their expertise in financial and business matters. I am thinking in this respect of people like Mr Brian Wright of the Commonwealth Bank; Lawrie Willett, who is head of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd; and Professor Bob Walker, who I guess would be acknowledged to be Australia's pre-eminent independent expert in public sector accounting.

         As it stands, we see the bill as providing the correct balance between, on the one hand, the need for obviously indigenous direction and self-determination but, on the other hand, the need to absolutely ensure that the appropriate expertise is available for appointment to the board. It is to be very much hoped that that expertise would be available within the indigenous population. If it is, it would be perfectly appropriate for the whole board to be constituted in that way. I think most people would argue or acknowledge, even if this was not the message which came from the meeting to which Senator Chamarette referred, that there is virtue in flexibility of this kind at this stage at least of the evolution of this institution.

         â€”The coalition opposes this amendment very much for the same reasons as Senator Gareth Evans has articulated. We share the view that the bill clearly provides that all members of the board could be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. We share the view that it may be desirable that that occurs.

         I think this amendment is an unnecessary restriction. As Senator Evans quite properly pointed out, it may be advantageous to the board and, therefore, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they avail themselves of the expertise of some non-indigenous Australians when the board is first composed. We support wholeheartedly the scheme in the bill which provides for a minimum indigenous involvementâ€”a worthy objectiveâ€”but we will not support the Greens' amendment that would mandate that all board members be Aboriginals.

         â€”The Democrats will not support this amendment either. I agree that the possibility for all members to be indigenous already exists. In saying that I will not support the amendment, I in no way make an assumption of a lack of expertise in the indigenous community. I just prefer the model that is put forward.

         â€”I support this amendment. I see a distinction between the responsibility of decision making and the advice that is put into that decision making. There is nothing to prevent, and everything to suggest, that persons who are appointed to the board secure expert advice. That expert advice can come from anywhere; it can come from people who may be Aboriginal, and it can come from people who may not be Aboriginal. That is not the issue. The issue is who makes the decision. When setting up a body like this, in my view, the people who ought to make the decision, or be seen to be making the decision, are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. In short, I support the amendment moved by Senator Chamarette.

        Part (b) is also covered in the opposition's amendment No. 35, so I will quite understand if the opposition wants to vote for its own amendment and not support this one. But it will clarify matters if I present the amendment as a whole and get a response to it from the committee. Basically, we want to ensure that the board has people on it who have appropriate business qualifications, but without being too prescriptive. We want there to be a requirement for the minister to have regard to ensuring there is a broad representation of relevant indigenous people who have a representative function within the Aboriginal community. This, again, was a change to our previous amendments at the request of Aboriginal people.

         â€”The government opposes this proposal from the Greens. It simply adds three additional requirements for election to the ILC board, all of which the minister must be satisfied on. In doing so, we believe it imposes unreasonable restrictions on the discretion of the minister in making appointments. The problem is that, while on the face of it each of the additional proposed tests is fairly innocuous looking, they are really of extremely uncertain ambit and make it very, very difficult to know what exactly are the considerations that the minister is supposed to be taking into account in determining, in this instance, whether a person is `broadly representative' of the interests of the Aboriginal people to whom the part is directed.

         For a start, how is it possible for one person to be broadly representative of both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the qualification requires? Just to ask the question makes clear the problem. The amendment requires that, in addition, a person has to satisfy all three of these criteriaâ€”not only to be broadly representative but also to have satisfactorily performed his role and to perform his function satisfactorily in the future. We need to have the foresight of the Hebrew prophet combined with the capacity of an Einstein to identify the way in which someone will satisfy these criteria.

         A real paragon is clearly being sought. We are all in favour of paragons being appointed to boards, but it is a bit difficult to find them. The problem in opposing these sorts of criteria is that they either mean something, are potentially enforceable and require a lot of heartache in making them work or mean nothing at all and are simply cosmetic additions of an unnecessary kind. For all those reasons we believe that this amendment is misconceived and ought not to be supported.

She would probably be a very fine person to be appointed as corporation director, but she would not necessarily satisfy that particular category because she has not been involved organisationally, if you like, in the Aboriginal community. I suppose it depends what is meant by `organisational' too.

         â€”I will quickly put the coalition position. Very much for the reasons that Senator Harradine has already articulated, we would prefer the Senate to support our amendments 35 and 36. In part, our amendment 36 seeks to achieve one of the principal objectives of M2A, part (a). But the reservations that Senator Harradine and particularly Senator Evans have alluded to would make us prefer the other. For that reason, the coalition will not be supporting this amendment.

         I think the amendment is just a little bit too restrictive, particularly because, as Senator Harradine said, when we are looking at someone who has performed a representative role we can envisage that there are a number of people who would serve on boards. Board directors do not necessarily represent anyone or have to have had experience in representing anyone. They genuinely need experience in decision making and various other forms of experience. A representative role may not be a valuable prerequisite, even though for some people on the board it will be; they would have had representative roles. That is the reason we prefer the wording of our amendments Nos 35 and 36. That is the way we will be proceeding on the vote.

Senator Campbell has foreshadowed that he wants to deal with them both together.

        I think we have already debated this amendment. The fundamental change to the bill is, from memoryâ€”we drafted this a long time agoâ€”that it ensures that there are at least two people with some business and financial skill. It does not take away from any of the other provisions in terms of the government's wording. It is identical to the Greens' original amendment M2.

         He will presumably be elected next time round in 1996. At least there will not be any non-elected people on the board of ATSIC then. At the moment, it is pretty clear that what is involved here is something that is not especially a matter of principle but something which is very much a matter of Aboriginal community politics. As such we do not think it is a particularly attractive amendment, despite the appeal to principle and democracy that has been uttered by the Greens on its behalf.

         My point is that because David Ross is an appointed commissioner this may exclude him from one place on the board, but there are still quite a lot of other places on the board. There are nine people in total on the board. There is no reason he could not be appointed on some other grounds. I do not think there is a fundamental objection to David Ross. If people really wanted David Ross on the board he could appointed to one of the other eight positions. I may be wrong.

There does not seem to be any good reason we would go to the trouble of amending the legislation to expressly exclude a non-elected commissioner, particularly since all commissioners are going to be elected after 1996 anyway, unless people had in mind that they want to exclude from that slot a particular non-elected commission. There may be a claim that it is for highfalutin, democratic, principled sorts of reasons but I think we all have a rough idea of the provenance of this particular proposal and it ain't very savoury.

I cannot see why the minister objects to that, and it is very unfair to characterise this in the way he has.

         One issue was the transfer of funds to high risk property investment. One may ask whether it was prudent to increase the investment in the unlisted property trusts by $450,000. In an article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday Mail
         </emphasis>
         on 23 October 1994, Mr Meek stated that, in June 1990, when the superannuation funds were first invested, the property trusts had a liquidity of only 4 per cent. An article published in the 20 July 1990 issue of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Business Review Weekly
         </emphasis>
         compared the liquidity of 22 unlisted property trusts and identified the Northern Securities trusts as having the fourth worst liquidity.

         One month later, in August 1990, the fund manager and trustee suspended repurchase requests, evidently in an attempt to overcome the liquidity problems. In light of these events, it becomes obvious that it was imprudent to substantially increase the superannuation fund's exposure to what had become an illiquid and high-risk investment. Again I ask: who was responsible for that decision?

         Another question that needs to be answered is: why did the property trusts perform so badly? The answer becomes self-evident when we look at the movement in unit prices over the period. When the superannuation fund's cash was first invested in the property trusts in June 1990, the value of growth units was at an all-time high of $1.18. Six months later the value peaked at $1.19, and from then on it was all downhill with the unit price dropping to 58c at June 1993â€”less than half what they were worth when the superannuation fund first bought into them. What went wrong?

         in August 1994, Mr Meek suggested that the vast majority of property trusts suffered declines in value during the period in question. I believe that the problem is not just a simple case of decline in general market conditions. In general, my concerns relate to the timing of property valuations and write-offs of capitalised expenses.

         I will not go into specific details, but will use the write-off of development costs to demonstrate how a drop in unit values was caused by management decisions, not market conditions. The write-offs relate to a property development for which expenses of $3.5 million were capitalised over a number of years prior to December 1990. That development did not proceed and these capital costs were written off over subsequent years.

         This means that in 1990 purchasers of property trust units paid an extra eight cents per unit for the value of the development costs. When that value was subsequently wiped out with the costs write-offs, the value of the units held by those unfortunate unit holders also dropped.

         Finally, an alarming aspect of this saga was the apparent failure of the watchdog, the auditor, who should have alerted the employer and relevant authorities to the problems. The Norsec super fund's accounts for December 1991 and June 1992 showed that the auditor, Kendalls KBM, issued qualified audit opinions for both periods, citing breaches of the trust deed and Corporations Law which were caused by investments in associated trusts exceeding the covenanted limit of 30 per cent. Yet the auditor had not qualified the earlier June 1991 accounts, when there had clearly been similar breaches. The 30 per cent limit was also exceeded in the very first reporting period in June 1990. Did the auditor qualify that report? I do not know the answer to the question, but I suspect the answer is no.

         It appears the auditor was catnapping for the first 18 months of the fund's operation and then suddenly woke up to the fact that things were not as they should be. Unfortunately, particularly for the members of the fund, by that time the damage was already done. Had the auditor been doing the job properly and issued qualified audit opinions on the accounts for the earlier reporting periods, the employer and the ISC would have been alerted to the problems earlier, and perhaps would have taken action which may have avoided some or even all of the losses. The Senate will understand my apprehension about the safety of superannuation funds given the evidence I have placed on the public record on three occasions in the past few weeks.

An investigation of SSPAAC by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations was subsequently carried out. The Registrar then determined that a provisional receiver be appointed so that SSPAAC could be liquidated and its remaining assets be secured by ATSIC. Following a Federal Court hearing held on 27 September 1994, the court ordered that SSPAAC be wound up. A liquidator has now been appointed for this purpose.
