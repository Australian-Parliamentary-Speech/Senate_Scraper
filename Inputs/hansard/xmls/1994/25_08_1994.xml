        The regulations vest a number of discretions  in the Commission. These include r.2.19 (authority to fix a longer reporting period); r.2.64(d) (Commissioner may require information concerning non-compliance); rr.4.10 and 4.11 (notice to a trustee to dispose of units, unless the Commissioner otherwise directs); r.6.01(5) (Commissioner's determination that a person is suffering financial hardship); rr.9.24 and 9.44 (programs approved by the Commissioner as alternatives to winding up); r.10.06 (approval of Commissioner to depart from operating standards); rr.12.05(5) and (6), r.12.06(5) (approval of proposed element or proposed assumption); r.12.11(3) (extension of time for notification of prescribed events); rr.12.12, 12.13 and 12.14 (approvals relating to transfer of certain amounts between funds and revocation of such approvals); and Schedule 1 Parts 1 and 2 Items 105 and 205 (lump sum approved by Commissioner for purpose of relieving hardship).

        The decisions in rr.12.12, 12.13 and 12.14 are subject to reconsideration and AAT review. Also, the parent Act makes some provision for review by the AAT. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on whether the remaining discretions, some of which could affect the operation of funds and the rights of members, are subject to AAT review. If not, the Committee would appreciate the reasons for their exclusion and for confirmation that the exclusions are within relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council and the Attorney-General's Department.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thank you for your letter of 12 May 1994 concerning Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations, Statutory Rule 1994 No.57 ("the Regulations").
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        2. I note that your committee asked whether certain discretions included in the regulations are subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (`AAT') and (if not) the reasons for the exclusion, and for confirmation that those exclusions are within relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council and the Attorney-General's Department.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        3. As you note in your letter, the Supervision Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 ("the SIS Act") makes extensive provision for review of decisions under that Act. More limited provision is made for AAT review of decisions under the regulations. In the second paragraph of your letter, you specify a number of regulations under which decisions are to be made. You are correct when you indicate your understanding that only regulations 12.12, 12.13 and 12.14 are subject to AAT review under the regulations. The remaining regulations listed in the second paragraph of your letter ("the residual regulations") are not.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        4. Generally the decisions provided for in the residual regulations are to some degree indirectly subject to AAT review. This is because any failure to comply with the Commissioner's decision made under any of the residual regulations, is enforceable against a superannuation fund only by using the powers provided in the SIS Act itself. Comprehensive provision for review of these decisions is made in section 10 of the SIS Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        5. The decisions to be made under regulations 4.10 and 4.11 are good examples of this kind of "indirect" reviewability. The decision to issue a direction under these regulations can only arise where the Commissioner has given a notice to the trustee of a superannuation entity stating that it is not a complying superannuation fund (under s. 40 of the SIS Act). The decision under s. 40 is in itself reviewable (see the definition of "reviewable decision" in s. 10 of the SIS Act) and if the decision is overturned by the AAT, then the basis for making a decision under regulations 4.10 and 4.11 disappears.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        6. The relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council and Attorney-General's Department are applicable in relation to the residual regulations as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        A. They are decisions which operate in practice for a very limited period of time . . . . . . . [see "Guidelines on Administrative Law Aspects of Legislative Proposals", Attorney General's Department, May 1991 (`the Attorney-General's guidelines'), paragraph 27.4.]
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        7. Regulations 2.19(3) and 2.64 appear to fall into this category. In each of these cases, the decisions are made in relation to actions that must be taken by superannuation entities; failure by the superannuation entity to do what is required of it is likely to adversely affect the interests of members. In each case, were a decision of the Commissioner to be subject to review by the AAT, then the delay would be likely to defeat the purpose to be served by the provision and by the Commissioner's decision.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        8. There is a related category which is arguably subsumed within this first category, consisting of that class of decisions where delays by trustees would be likely to prejudice the interests of members of superannuation entities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        9. All of the relevant regulations govern the conduct of trustees of superannuation entities, but the consequences of conduct by trustees which contravenes the regulations fall largely upon members of the funds. Thus the result of any application to the AAT for review by the trustees (with inevitable delays in resolving the application) will in most cases be to prejudice the interests of the members. For example, under regulations 9.24 and 9.44, the discretion is only to be exercised where winding up a superannuation entity is contemplated and the responsible actuary has recommended a specific course of action to the trustee. Where the actuary's recommendations are approved by the Commissioner, the trustee must follow the specified course of action. Where a fund is in this situation, any delay (such as that occasioned by an AAT application for review) is likely to prejudice the interests of members of the fund in having a speedy resolution of the fund's financial difficulties brought about. For that reason, AAT review appears inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        B. The decisions are of a preliminary nature or a procedural kind having no substantive effect [see Attorney-General's guidelines paragraph 27.4; and Annual Report of the Administrative Review Council 1992-3, Chapter 7, `Guidelines for determining whether the exercise of a decision making power is appropriate for external merit to review', (`the ARC guidelines'), para 7.34]
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        10. The decisions under regulations 12.05(5) and (6), 12.06(5) and 12.11(3) fall into this category. The decisions to be made in relation to regulations 12.05 (5) and (6) and 12.06 (5) are made in relation to the calculation of `pre-l July funding credits'. Those calculations are relevant in two contexts; firstly, the transfer of such funding credits pursuant to Part 12 of the regulations (the ultimate decision about which is made reviewable by regulation 12.17) and the determination of the amount of pre-l July 1988 funding credits for the purposes of section 342 of the SIS Act. The relevant parts of Section 342 are made reviewable under the SIS Act (see the definition of `reviewable decision', in s.10, sub-paragraphs (ze) and (zf).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        11. The decision to be made under regulation 6.01(5) (and Schedule items 105 and 106 relate to this) may also be seen to fall into this category. Under regulation 6.01(5) the Commissioner must decide whether a person (a member of a superannuation fund) is experiencing "severe financial hardship"; if the member is experiencing "severe financial hardship" then preserved superannuation benefits can be released to that person to alleviate the hardship. However, the Commissioner does not make the ultimate decision whether the benefits will be released; it is up to the trustees of individual funds to determine (in the exercise of their discretion, if any, under the trust deed or other rules of the fund) whether they would pay any benefits in question to the member of the fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        12. There are also some cogent reasons why review of decisions under regulation 6.01(5) (and Schedule items 105 and 106) by the AAT would be inappropriate and unnecessary. The ISC has implemented and is operating a two tier internal review system in relation to decisions of this kind made under the (now largely) superseded legislation, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 (and regulations thereunder). The same internal review system will continue under SIS. The original decision as to whether the ISC would object to the fund releasing preserved benefits (or otherwise) is made at regional (State) level. An internal review is provided at regional level, by officers who had no involvement in the original decision. A further internal review is provided by a unit within the Central office of the ISC (and again by officers uninvolved in the original decision or its initial review).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        13. The ISC receives annually about 32,000 applications for release of preserved benefits. About 75% of those applications are successful at regional office level, and of the remainder which are reviewed within the Central office, about 50% are successful. Most of the decisions (about 55%) involve amounts of less than $2,500 and it is fair to say that where financial hardship is in question, speed in resolving the dispute (if any) is essential. It seems unlikely that an AAT review process (with its inevitable delays) could provide a sufficiently quick resolution of these claims to alleviate the hardship upon which the claims are made. In circumstances where the Commissioner decides that the person is not experiencing "severe financial hardship" the Ombudsman has the jurisdiction to scrutinise these decisions and has done so, on a number of occasions. The ISC and the Ombudsman have recently established procedures whereby applicants (for release of benefits on financial hardship grounds) who are unsuccessful on their last internal review will be informed of their right to approach the Ombudsman for external review.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        C. Decisions of a law enforcement nature . . . [see Attorney-General's guidelines, paragraph 27.4; ARC guidelines paragraph 7.37]
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        14. The decision to be made under regulation 10.06 appears to fall into this category. Regulation 10.06 provides for certain operating standards which must be followed by `eligible rollover funds', unless the Commissioner approved departure from those standards. The Commissioner's decision is essentially whether or not to enforce the operating standard.

        16. Should the Committee have any remaining concerns regarding non-reviewability of any decisions, I would be pleased to hear from you further.

        New Schedule item 32A confers a discretion on the Commission to decide whether a company is operating solely as a trustee of a regulated superannuation fund.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Regulations several times mention a program of vocational rehabilitation and r. 5(a)(ii) refers to a program of vocational rehabilitation approved by the Repatriation Commission. This appears to imply that the Commission may exercise a discretion to approve or reject courses or presumably approve courses previously rejected or reject courses previously approved. This could have important financial and other consequences for veterans. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether r. 5(a)(ii) is the only legislative reference to approval of courses and whether there is AAT review, similar to the appropriate review provisions of other discretions in the regulations, of decisions to reject courses. If there is no AAT review it may improve the rights of veterans if you undertook to provide such review.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In that letter you requested my advice as to whether the reference in regulation 5(a)(ii) to the Repatriation Commission approving a vocational rehabilitation program for the purposes of the vocational rehabilitation allowance is the only legislative reference to approval of programs. This is the case.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The second issue you raised is the issue of whether or not a person has any right of review by the AAT if the Commission rejects a vocational rehabilitation program. Review rights exist in relation to the assessment of the reduction of a person's income as a result of undertaking the program of rehabilitation (regulation 7) and in relation to the calculation of the amount of rehabilitation allowance to be paid to a person (regulation 8). As the regulations are currently drafted there is no right of review by the AAT of a decision to reject a vocational rehabilitation program for the purposes of rehabilitation allowance.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Originally it was considered that, as the Regulations would confer a discretionary power on the Commission to confer a benefit over and above the entitlements already provided under the Act, such a review was not warranted. Viewed from another perspective, if the Commission rejected a rehabilitation program, that rejection would not in itself result in any diminution of the person's ongoing right to pension.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This is consistent with the fact that section 106 is a special section, intended for limited use and entirely as the Commission deems fit. It contains no indication that decisions taken under it are to be subject to review, in contrast to very specific provisions elsewhere in the Act. It provides:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         (1) Subject to sub-section (2), the Commission may, in such circumstances, and subject to such conditions (if any), as are prescribed, in its discretion, grant to a veteran, or to a dependant of a veteran or deceased veteran, assistance or benefits of such a kind, and of such an amount or value, as it deems fit in all the circumstances of the case.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         (2) The Commission shall not grant assistance or benefits to a person under sub-section (1) in circumstances in which the person is eligible to be granted an allowance or assistance under another provision of this Act.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I have reviewed this aspect of the Regulations and have arranged for an amendment to be made to take account of the concerns raised by your Committee. I have also asked that the impact of the review right on the scheme be examined at the expiry of the Regulations in December 1995.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The amendment will provide that a decision of the Commission to approve or to reject a vocational rehabilitation program for the purposes of rehabilitation allowance will be required to be notified in writing to the person concerned. This written notification will be required to include reasons for a decision not to approve a program for the purposes of the rehabilitation allowance. The amendment will further provide that such a decision will be subject to review by the AAT.

         On 29 September 1993 the Senate set the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade the task of inquiring into sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force. As part of that task the committee was to inquire into allegations about certain events on the destroyer escort HMAS
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Swan
         </emphasis>
         , how these events were handled and the way the navy as a whole responded to the challenge of fully integrating women into the services. The terms of reference further required the committee to inquire also into sexual harassment in the other armed services.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The initial expectation was that the committee would present its report in early 1994. This did not prove possible for several reasons. While on the face of it sexual harassment appears to be a straightforward matter, the complexity of the issues raised quickly became evident as evidence was put before the committee. Paradoxically, the committee had both an overload and a lack of evidence. The committee had available to it an enormous amount of detailed documentation associated with the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Swan
          </emphasis>
          allegations. This included full transcripts of all the preceding interviews and inquiries, extensive internal navy documentation concerning the handling of all these matters, as well as submissions from many of the individuals affected.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The shortfall in evidence became evident when the committee sought to inform itself about the wider incidence of sexual harassment within the navy, the ADF and society as a whole. Various studies and surveys have been conducted. Regrettably, very little in the way of reliable statistics or hard data is available. What little is available is often distorted in the media, with some dramatic claims getting more attention, with little regard for the complexity of the issues involved.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The concept of sexual harassment appears simple, but it is not simple. A very wide spectrum of behaviours can come under the term `sexual harassment'. They range from the most brutal physical assault to mildly offensive sexist banter. An important aspect of the term `sexual harassment' under the Sex Discrimination Act is the prominence that is given to the subjective response of the person claiming sexual harassment.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is very difficult to reach any definitive conclusions about the incidence of sexual harassment in the ADF. As in the community more generally, sexual harassment is a problem, and it is a problem that has not in the past been adequately acknowledged. There is no solid evidence to indicate that the extent of the problem is any worse in the services than in the community at large. The statistics are simply inadequate.

        <para first-indent="16">

          One academic expert said that the ADF compared favourably with other areas where women have entered previously male-dominated workplaces. Others argued that it was more difficult to register a complaint in the armed forces than elsewhere. Better monitoring is clearly necessary. The present very broad definition complicates to a considerable extent the whole question of dealing with sexual harassment.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In the committee's view, it is important that sexual harassment of different kinds and of different severity be dealt with in different ways. Abuse, such as sexual assault and demands for sexual favours and threats if such favours are not granted, requires a different approach from the approach necessary to deal with more general hostility towards women serving as equals in the defence forces.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          By not distinguishing more clearly between the different kinds of sexual harassment and by leaving the boundaries of what constitutes sexual harassment unclear, the Sex Discrimination Act as it now stands creates confusion and uncertainty, generates apprehension and has dysfunctional consequences. In the case of the navy, for example, evidence to the committee indicates that the present situation can interfere with team spirit and can work against the full acceptance of women as equal partners on the job. Education of personnel can help alleviate the problems but not eliminate them.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee has therefore recommended that the definition of sexual harassment under the Sex Discrimination Act should be refined to indicate that some forms are more serious than others. The committee also recommends that the act should indicate more clearly that the more serious forms of sexual harassment are dealt with more severely than others.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee accepts that this is the approach that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner in all probability adopts in the mediation and conciliation of cases that come before her. The difficulty is that the community, and that includes members of the Defence Force, knows very little about the way in which most sexual harassment cases are dealt with. It is this widespread lack of knowledge that leads to misperceptions, unnecessary apprehension and resentment.

          The third element of recommendation one is that the complainant should, where possible, inform the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour is offensive. This is closely related to the committee's second recommendation. This would require the employer to assist the person who feels he or she is being sexually harassed to let the alleged harasser know the effect of that behaviour. Together, the recommendations are aimed at greater clarity for all concerned about what constitutes sexual harassment. Just as importantly, they are aimed at bringing to light problems before they escalate into major disputes, with severe damage to all parties. It is aimed at resolving issues well before they turn into legal battles for compensation or, should I say, newspaper headlines.

          Several of the committee's other recommendations are aimed at ensuring that the Defence Force has in place better mechanisms for resolving potential sexual harassment cases before they escalate and seriously damage the individuals involved. The personal experiences of sexual harassment of women in the navy who gave evidence to the committee varied. The women also varied in their capacity to deal with such harassment.

          The committee is of the view that there is a pressing need to increase the skills of all personnel to deal with sexual harassment, whether as a supervisor or as a person directly affected. It is particularly important to assist personnel to deal with less serious kinds of sexual harassment at the personal level before the situation escalates and gets out of hand. Once sexual harassment reaches a point where a formal complaint is seen as the only option, the chances are that all the parties involved will end up being hurt or damaged.

          The committee concluded that the main management tool for dealing with personnel issues in the navy, the divisional system, is not an adequate mechanism for the management of sexual harassment, or indeed harassment of any kind. There must be avenues other than the normal chain of command for individuals to turn to if they encounter sexual harassment. This is particularly important if the harasser is higher in the hierarchy and especially if he or she holds one of the positions in that individual's chain of command.

          While there is room to improve some of the activities that the navy has undertaken, and recommendations to this end are included in the body of the committee's report, the main thrust is in the right direction and the necessary commitment at the highest levels of the current leadership is evident. The committee is not satisfied that the same can be said for the other two services. The committee believes that the action plan put forward by Headquarters ADF must be implemented more quickly and must be seen to have the wholehearted support of the leadership of each of the services.

          Both the navy's board of inquiry and this committee's inquiry are a direct result of the complaints Dr Wheat made in her letter of 25 November to the then Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel and the subsequent publicity that was given to her case when the board's report was leaked to the media.

          The board's inquiry focused the attention of the navy's leadership on serious shortcomings in navy's corporate approach to the integration of women into the navy. It brought home to the navy's leadership the realisation that they had misjudged the nature and extent of the educational process that all members of the navy had to undergo to deal with the major change that the full integration of women into the navy represented.

          The committee examined closely the actions that the navy leadership took following the board's inquiry. To its credit, the navy took a series of very important steps, culminating in the endorsement and implementation of the good working relationships program. The program clearly has had the full backing and active involvement of the Chief of Naval Staff. The continuing commitment of the leadership to the program is essential if the navy is to meet the challenges that the integration of women into the services present.

          It is the committee's view, however, that in its determination to make up for its failure to anticipate fully the measures and effort needed to ensure the smooth integration of women into the navy, the navy leadership erred in the severity of the disciplinary action it took against individuals involved in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Swan
          </emphasis>
          incidents. The consideration uppermost in the navy leadership's mind appears to have been to send a strong signal that the kind of behaviour that had occurred on the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Swan
          </emphasis>
          would not be tolerated. The method chosen was the most severe administrative measure available, censure by the Chief of Naval Staff. The decision to send a signal by this means ignored the extent to which adequate steps to prepare all personnel—from able seaman to captain of the ship—had not been taken. A strong signal was needed, but a more appropriate and timely way of making clear to all that sexual harassment would not be permitted should have been used.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The evidence presented to the committee during this inquiry also made it clear that many of the difficulties that Dr Wheat encountered on the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Swan
          </emphasis>
          were by no means unique to the

           Swan
          </emphasis>
          , nor even confined to female personnel. The navy picked out the command and personnel of one ship for punishment for not dealing more adequately with behaviours that, in one form or another, have put many navy personnel under stress. This is seen by the committee as neither equitable nor effective in bringing about change for the better in the long term.

I wish to commend the chairman and the other members of the committee: Senator West, Senator Burns, Senator Woodley and my close colleague Senator Ellison.

I believe it will also be read by defence services in countries overseas. Australia is establishing, not least in navy, a benchmark of good practice, now that these tragic events of 1992 are behind us. The response by navy and the reinforcement in the 42 recommendations of this report will be of great importance as a benchmark for looking at these matters in the future.

          This is an unanimous report. We are all alike in reinforcing that the defence services of Australia are for men and women alike. It is right that women are to serve in the navy and on ships at sea. It is impossible for women to have an opportunity of authority within the armed services if they do not gain experience at sea. We are critical, and the navy itself is critical, that in the years leading up to 1992—and to some extent this is a reflection on the government of the day—there was tardiness in getting in place the necessary transitions to ensure that women would be successful at sea. There is a corporate responsibility in navy, paralleled in army and air force, which, we point out very explicitly, had inadequacies in the years 1989, 1990, 1991 and, especially, 1992.

          This matter arose with regard to behaviour on one ship at sea in a four-month tour to Asia in the middle of 1992. There was unacceptable behaviour in the officers' wardroom and, in particular, unacceptable behaviour by one officer. There was bullying in another area of the ship by one petty officer. Critically, this involved two able seamen, both women. It was a hellish bullying of these two women. That was the finding of the board of inquiry and it is the finding of this committee. We have recommended that the navy's tactical electronic warfare support section be completely reviewed to ensure that there is nothing of this behaviour possible in the future.

          The third incident was a charge of sexual assault—or, as reported in the media, rape—on one officer by another. This is fully reviewed, especially in chapter 7 of this report. We addressed all terms of references given to us by the Senate at the suggestion, in part, of the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, and, with additions, we widened that inquiry to army and air force, which was the suggestion of the Senate. The fourth incident involving the HMAS

          In retrospect, the concreteness of these incidents involving men and women on one ship at sea not only gives a spur for navy to get it right and a spur for this Senate inquiry, but it also gives a series of real life examples, discussed in the report, of sexual harassment generally and sexual assault, and all the appropriate educative means to minimise and even eliminate them from every part of Australian life. It also gives a spur for appropriate investigative, prosecuting and disciplinary procedures to deal with these when they arise.

Amongst our papers tabled here today is the full transcript of the court martial and the full transcript of the board of inquiry. It is impossible to understand the report without recourse to all of the papers that were before us.

          The media became involved in September 1993—partly as a political instrument for some of the aggrieved parties. The media's reporting was extreme, exaggerated and misleading to the Australian public and it was with some of those bells ringing in the public's mind and, indeed, in the government's mind, that this matter had to be cleared up. The Senate committee system has the appropriate clout—the appropriate authority—to deal comprehensively with a situation that needed a further inquiry to settle the matter. We have dealt with the misleading by the media—there is still in the Australian public a caricature of the events in navy of 1992 which is wrong—and have sought to set out the facts. We not only give our 42 recommendations and our clear findings, but also give the reasons for our findings.

          I will list the recommendations that I find most significant. Recommendation 1 is that there needs to be an assessment of the hierarchy for complaints about sexual harassment and the appropriate responses, depending upon the level or degree of harassment. That also relates to recommendations 9 and 21. No. 5 recommends that whenever there is a board of inquiry the participants be informed as to what happened to their evidence and their contribution. Recommendations 10 and 12 are about improving selection and training procedures before men and, especially, women go to sea. Recommendation 14 calls for a complete review of the navy's tactical electronic warfare support section.

          —I am pleased to be able to be part of this report on sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I am not pleased, however, that the incident took place and that there was a need for the committee to have to look at this issue. It became very clear from the work of the committee that the incidence of sexual harassment and discrimination is not very well known within the ADF or within the general community. Sexual harassment and discrimination is alive and well out there in the general community. People who say that they belong to large organisation that do not have harassers in their employ and that there is no discrimination are having themselves on.

          The committee was very honoured to have appear before it several times both the previous and current chiefs of the naval staff. We thank them very much for their appearance. They made an excellent contribution and they also recognised the failings of their force. It takes substantial character to say, `The group that I lead has erred.' The chief of personnel for the whole of the Australian Defence Force also appeared before the committee. I found it a little upsetting that the chief of general staff and the chief of the air staff did not also appear before the committee. Whilst we know that they support the integration of women into their forces, they did not appear before us to provide that very positive and public commitment. Having been around ADF ranks and having spoken to people over a number of years, I know that those people also certainly share a very strong commitment to women in their forces. However, it would have been nice if they had been able to publicly demonstrate that.

          There are many recommendations of which the Senate has already been told. I hope they will all be acted upon, because we have looked very carefully at this issue. Sexual harassment is something that exists in all areas. It is a pity that it does. It is a form of sexual discrimination and must be recognised as such. One has to wonder at some people who say that they do not understand quite what is sexual harassment and what is not—as to what sorts of behaviour they would expect is appropriate for their spouses or their children, particularly their daughters, in their own homes. One wonders at the extreme edge what sort of dysfunctional families we may be dealing with there.

          We were also able to participate in a half-day seminar run by the navy called `Good Working Relationships'. This is the navy's answer to assisting in overcoming this issue of sexual harassment. These are excellent programs that are run with a mixture of officers and other ranks and they explore very well the issue of sexual harassment and what is appropriate and inappropriate behaviour. That is a very positive initiative on behalf of the navy. I would urge the other two services to implement a similar program.

          This report highlighted the problems that were experienced by Dr Wheat because she was a direct entry into the navy, which means that she came in not quite off the street but with a minimal amount of training and was sent to sea. People coming in with direct entry are very positive in that they provide a fresh input into the services. However, they have missed out on a whole learning process about the culture of the organisation and also how a more junior person is able to say to someone of greater seniority, `Excuse me, that's inappropriate behaviour' or `I don't like it.' Most people I have met within the armed forces are able to say that quite well.

          However, there comes a time when the person is in such a senior position or is of such a personality that one cannot say, `Excuse me, that behaviour is not acceptable to me.' The ones that I have the most concerns about within the armed forces are the more junior people. We are taking people into our armed forces at age 18 and placing them in a very hierarchical situation. We are expecting people not to discriminate against them and not to harass them. However, with 70,000 employees there must be the odd person who is going to do that.

          It is very important that the armed forces have already done something about this problem, with the appointment of sexual harassment officers and equal opportunity officers. But it is very important that the name of the contact person becomes very well known to those people, almost as well known as where and how they place their gear when they are packing up or doing other daily procedures, so that they know that they have some redress and some recourse.

          This is not to demean the chain of command or mean that they should step outside the chain of command unnecessarily, but it does mean that, if somewhere in that chain of command a person is being harassed and discriminated against, that person can actually sidestep that issue and overcome the problem. Certainly, the senior officers do not want to see that happen and, I am sure, would not feel that the chain of command is being broken inappropriately when that type of thing happens.

There is no way that an 18-year-old person who has done only the elementary training is able to say to someone with the rank of petty officer, chief petty officer or warrant officer, `Excuse me, but I don't like that. Don't do it.' Those people must be concerned that it will have ramifications for their careers. Likewise, I do not know how anyone can say to a general, an admiral or an air marshal, `Excuse me, sir, but I don't find that behaviour terribly appropriate either. Would you please not do it in my presence.' Those people are in very senior positions and it is very much the power issue.

I have some reservations as to whether this is the best utilisation of resources—whether one 008 number across the three services would be a better use of resources. It would stop duplication and enable them to extend the number of hours for which the 008 number was available. They would also be able to have people with greater expertise staffing those phones.

We know that women have not yet reached star rank—the admiral, general and air vice marshal ranks. There is one female navy captain. The latest figures I have show that there are two female army colonels and no female air force group captains. So they all have a long way to go in answering women's needs for promotion and to remove what would appear to be some discrimination there.

What will happen is that no more senior positions will be available across the armed forces, but more people will be competing for those positions. That will be very good for Australia's defence forces because we will have the best brains available.

          We need to understand that sexuality is something which touches people at the deepest point of their lives. Human relationships very often are what make or break people's understanding of who they are. An author on counselling, Clinbel, wrote words to this effect, `To love another person is to give that person a weapon for one's greatest hurt.' I believe that to be true, for the area of sexuality is an area which really does underline such questions as: who am I? What is my future? How can I relate to another person? The agony for people of being unsure in this area of life is something that is all too obvious not only in counselling but also as we worked our way through this particular inquiry. What is trivial to one person may be of absolute significance to another person. What seems clear to the non-involved person and of little significance may be experienced by the involved person as chaos and absolute disorientation. As we worked our way through the inquiry we were certainly aware of those sensitivities.

          I commend the officers involved in the half-day good working relationships seminar because I have been involved in many such seminars and this was as good as the best of any that I have attended. I have great confidence, therefore, in the continuation of that program. However, I do not believe that the other two services, the air force and the army, have taken this issue as seriously within their own ranks. I say to them: do not wait until it blows up in your face. Take the issue as seriously as the navy has done and begin to address the situation as well as the navy has done. I quote from one part of the report in which the culture of the ADF is described. Page 304 of the report states:

         I am not so sure that that is simply a description of the ADF. I fear it may also be a description of Australian culture in general. I hope that not only the ADF but all Australians will begin, if we have not already begun, to address this issue within our own culture as a people. Australians do not communicate well, particularly Australian men. We need to work on our feelings. One of the common T-shirt slogans that I have often seen is, `Just do it'. I say to the Senate that just doing it is not enough. We need to learn to verbalise and communicate, particularly in the area of sexuality. We need to deal with the brokenness in our own human relationships in this area of life and we must help others to find wholeness in this sensitive area.

          —I will not say a great deal on this matter. Much has been said that I support and agree with. But it became fairly clear as the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade progressed, bearing in mind some of the public utterances in the press for some time, that it was not just the question of sexual harassment that had been a problem for the defence forces; rather, it was a question of harassment of both sexes by officers at some levels—and even harassment by people in other ranks towards each other.

          The development of protective measures against sexual harassment in the general community, in my view, has led the developments in the navy—and certainly to a greater extent in the army and the air force. But the very open and constructive way in which the navy dealt with this particular problem, and the information it willingly provided to us, augurs well for the future in regard to building a cohesive and cooperative defence force, so that people in the force have respect for each other.

          Over the years there have been many bullies in all the arms of the defence forces and while to some extent they might have been supported by a particular culture and certain senior officers, I am sure that many in the hierarchy disapproved of that. I believe that there is a development taking place and this inquiry, and the responses to its position, will help to change that culture and to eliminate the attitude of bullying, whether it be male or female. Some females in their evidence indicated that really it was no big deal that somebody might say something that was offensive to some people and not offensive to others. But, really, it is not a kindergarten; they are all adults. That may be so, but the defence personnel must be required to act towards each other, male or female, in a way that gives no offence to each other and to be considerate and concern themselves that each of those persons may be sensitive.

          I believe that the inquiry was a very appropriate one at that time and that the content of the inquiry when read by people generally in the community will give them a feeling of confidence in the future of the defence forces. But it will also raise an expectation that the developments that have taken place up until this time against those people involved in sexual harassment will continue—as I believe it will, based on my experience in this particular inquiry. I think the recommendations are sound and should be followed by those whose responsibility it is.

          The report clearly supports the actions of Captain Mole. He suffered very much in the eyes of the public. The public accounts of his actions have not been helpful at all to his career. I think his career has clearly suffered and been prejudiced as a consequence of that reporting and I say quite unambiguously that he suffered also at the hands of his superior officers. I believe this man has been unjustly treated. By all accounts Captain Mole has had a blemish-free career as a professional naval officer. He did everything required of him. He used every avenue that was available to him at the time, and he used it of his own volition, without being pressured into it.

I hope that the recommendations of the report are accepted by the Chief of the Naval Staff, that Captain Mole's career, in so far as it can be restored, is restored and that this Australian naval officer goes on to complete his career with the RAN with as much of this as possible put behind him and without carrying that baggage into the future.

          The matter of sexual harassment is enormously serious, and it is more acute in the services than it is in civilian life. It is perfectly true, as Senator Woodley said, that sexual harassment occurs in all levels of society, but it is different and in a way it is far more important in the services than in civilian life. In the services, the members of that service live together. They do not go home at the end of the day to homes, flats or apartments. They live within a camp or they live on a ship. They never escape the contact of their companions in the service, and they never escape the authoritarian air. Even if someone does not exercise their authority excessively, there is an implied power given to superior NCOs and superior officers which bears on those under them. So the environment in the services is fundamentally different from that in civilian life.

          For millennia the services have been single sex. They are involved in what is often the unpleasant use of maximum force. Up to recent times it has always been, in western cultures, a male preserve. A lot of the things that people are required to do in the services, because of the nature of the tasks, require attitudes which could fairly be described as hard and insensitive. I think it always must be so, given the nature of the tasks of the defence forces. To introduce women into that environment and this background requires care and a great deal of thought.

          Women have not always been banned from ships. In fact, the old expression `show a leg' comes from the fact that women used to live on board ships when navy ships were in harbour, and when the watchkeeping officer went along to turn the watch out he required the occupants of the hammocks and the bunks to show a leg. If it was a smooth leg without any hair on it, it was a female and she did not have to turn out for watchkeeping duties. That is where that expression came from. But, certainly, in recent times women have not been at sea.

          Clearly, I think, the navy moved into the deployment of women at sea with undue haste and some measure of blame has to be attributed to the Chief of the Naval Staff at the time, who was too eager to comply with the government directives, instead of taking care to see that the procedures were in place—both physically, with respect to the resources on ships, which were never designed initially for females; and culturally, to ensure that the cultural attitudes of the male naval personnel were addressed and prepared before that happened.

          —I said that. I am at a loss to understand why Senator West should try to interject when I have said that sexual harassment is a serious matter in the services. It is serious because it affects the very purpose of the existence of the service. Sexual harassment, of course, is a matter of manners; it is not a matter of legislation. You cannot legislate to make people be polite. It is not fashionable in Australia to talk about manners today, but manners are the lubricant which allows people in society from different educational, social and ethnic backgrounds to come together and work happily and constructively as a team. So the importance of manners cannot be minimised, yet this is never mentioned in the whole of the sexual harassment field. Within the services manners are important.

          The other really crucial issue in the services is that people work as a team. Not only the lives of individuals but the success of the operation turn on the team holding together. It does not matter whether it is an infantry section, an air crew or a ship's company, it is just stupid administration and a gross reflection on the officers or the NCOs in charge of that unit not to have the team working as a cohesive unit, with one supporting the other. The whole reason for individuals coming together as a service unit fails if they do not have that mutual trust and support, one with each other.

But the whole matter has not been concluded. We are on a path that will evolve over the years ahead. We need sensitive and rapid response to changing circumstances, being mindful always of the reason why those men and women are in uniform serving Australia.

          I was very interested to have a quick look at this report when it was tabled just 40 minutes ago. Obviously, in the time I have had available, I have had no opportunity to look at it in any other than a cursory fashion. I did, however, refer to chapter 7 of the report and, in particular, the recommendations arising from that chapter. It is obvious that careers and entire lives can be adversely and seriously affected where censures and disciplinary action are taken against members of the military forces. But where these censures are inappropriate, it is often difficult to rectify them as I understand, again from a very quick reading of the report, that there is no appeal.

          From a quick reading of the report, it is obvious to me that the recommendations show that the committee has some very real doubts about the censure of Captain Mole. The committee has taken the rather unusual but very deliberate step of recommending a review of the censure against Captain Mole in particular, and of other personnel more generally. This is very important and needs highlighting, particularly in the light of the very unprofessional and sensational manner in which this whole matter was reported in the popular press. Both the chairman and the deputy chairman have made reference to that aspect. I think it is important, therefore, that the committee's recommendations in relation to the senior officers be highlighted.

          I note the deputy chairman's personal remark that Captain Mole should be promoted. Whilst I acknowledge that that is a personal private remark by the deputy chairman and that it is for the navy to deal with promotions and not this Senate, I do think it is interesting that the deputy chairman was occasioned to make that remark. I note recommendation 25 and particularly the second part of it, which says:

It is a very considered report.

        HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill makes amendments to a number of acts within the Human Services and Health Portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen.

        The pathology amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and correct anomalies to clarify the supervision definition for the rendering of pathology services, restate the original intention of the pathology licensed collection centre scheme and remove the redundant references to temporary pathology collection centres since these licences ceased to exist on 1 February 1994.

        The amendments to the definitions of `general medical services table' and `pathology services table' under subsection 3(1), the amendments of sections 4 and 4A and the repealing of Schedules 1 and 1A of the Health Insurance Act 1973 are to avoid the need to reprint the lengthy Schedules in reprints of the act. The Schedules repeat the content of the general medical services table and the pathology services table which are made or amended, and published, regularly, in the form of regulations under the act.
       </para>

        The amendments to paragraph 16B(11)(d) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 provide for the extension of the "sunset" provision by two years to 1 January 1997 with provision to extend that date by regulations. Under the current "sunset" provision, from 1 January 1995, medicare benefits will no longer be payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by medical practitioners who were exempted by the "grandparent" provisions in the 1991 amendments dealing with "arms length" requesting of these services. An extension will allow for the continuation of the payment of medicare benefits for R-type services in these circumstances.

        Paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Hearing Services Act 1991 defines those who are eligible to receive Commonwealth hearing concessions from Australian Hearing Services.

        All references except for one to the term "in-patient" have been replaced with term "patient" in both the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. However, the substitution has not been made to subsection 4(1AA) of the National Health Act 1953. The amendment I am proposing is a "house-keeping" type duty which will remove an anomaly that exists in the act. The proposed amendment does not alter the intent of subsection 4(1AA) which pertains to the rendering of a pathology service in a hospital or day hospital.

        A second change is to permit the substitution by a pharmacist of a brand of a pharmaceutical benefit other than that ordered by the prescriber, subject to conditions agreed to by the Australian Health Ministers Conference.

        Liability to pay levy on leviable products will arise when a producer of products presumed to be produced in Australia purchases certain prescribed goods for use in the production of those products.

         I was picking up some of the points which had been made by the opposition in which it was positing that Australia, under its state governments, was looking after the environment extremely well. I was making the point that that flew completely in the face of all the evidence. Land degradation continues apace in Australia despite the efforts which have been made to reverse it. Salinisation continues. We have the worst loss of species of any of the developed countries in the world. We have feral animals charging right across the landscape, creating enormous havoc and not, of course, being confined by state boundaries. We have water quality deteriorating.

         Yesterday, Senator Knowles claimed that somehow or other the states were doing a good job. That was simply a nonsense. Moreover, the second leg of Senator Knowles's argument was that the need for regional differences was to give ordinary citizens a chance to have an input at the local level—at the state government level. Again, this flies in the face of the survey to which I drew attention in my speech at the second reading stage: the ANOP survey in 1991, in which people were asked whether they supported national—and I stress `national'—environmental standards being set by the Commonwealth. Over two-thirds of the public of Australia, 68 per cent, including people from all states, argued that yes, the Commonwealth had that responsibility.

         These are the reasons, quite contrary to the spurious and rhetorical statements made by the opposition, why we should have national standards set by the Commonwealth government—but with the opportunity for input. Yesterday, Senator Sherry asked whether Senator Knowles had even read the legislation. There are sections here which clearly allow for public input when the national EPC seeks to promulgate a new standard. Those provisions are framed in such a way that they provide for the states, local government, conservation and other interested groups, and individuals, to have an input. But I stress that it is not appropriate to give the states the right of veto. I want to return to this point in a moment.

         That leads on to the second of those changes which we are recommending, that is, the provision for non-government environmental organisations to have observer status—and I stress `observer'—on the National Environment Protection Council. That is extending the concern which the opposition has expressed in relation to the public having an input to this process. This would be an additional facility by which the non-government organisations could have an overview of the deliberations.

         The bill says that the council, in dealing with environmental impact statements and in dealing with submissions from the public in relation to these promulgated standards, must take these things into consideration. It is appropriate that non-government organisations have observer status to see that that is properly administered. That observer status would guarantee that those things were properly considered, that those submissions were taken into account, and that the processes of the EIS were properly considered. That is a further mechanism which would meet some of the objections which Senator Knowles and other members of the opposition mentioned yesterday.

         The amendments that the Greens (WA) will be moving seek to remove the need for an impact statement prior to making any national environment protection measure. Instead, the council would be obliged to publicly call for submissions and take account of any submissions that are made to it. The reason for this is that we feel that, in a situation where the council is virtually taking away a legitimate authority of the federal government to make national standards, we should at least prevent economic and social impact justifications by the states having precedence over the importance of the environment protection measures.

         In relation to the reference to regional environmental differences in Australia as an essential plank in the legislation and the recognition—this is very important—of the diversity of Australian environments, what needs to be pointed out to Senator Coulter is that `regional' in this context does not refer to states. In all states there are some relatively pristine environments as well as, as all senators would be aware, some significantly degraded environments. These factors need to be taken into account in the setting of sensible national measures.

         Senator Coulter also raised the issue of the role of non-government organisations and their representation on the NEPC committee. It is worth my drawing to Senator Coulter's attention clause 21(2)(b) which requires the council to report to this parliament on submissions received from NGOs and also on their responses to those submissions. It needs to be remembered that this legislation gives effect to an intergovernmental agreement—the point that Senator Coulter has stressed in his contribution. The protocol for consultation by the NEPC, endorsed by COAG, requires that in addition to the references in clause 16 of this legislation, the council will initiate discussions with all relevant NGOs at an early stage and will seek input into the development of the measure. I think the government has been sensitive to the needs and requirements of NGOs as we have looked at the development of this legislation.

         The final point that Senator Coulter canvassed in his contribution related to the issue of states being penalised for withdrawal from the agreement. That ignores the reality that Australia is a federation. This bill simply gives effect to the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, which is an agreement developed by consensus with state governments and endorsed, as senators would be aware, by COAG. Those are the substantive points that Senator Coulter made in his contribution. He indicated that they are the fundamental basis for his determination to amend the preamble and the other consequential amendments that flow from that course of action.

         In relation to the general thrust of the arguments that Senator Chamarette presented to the Senate, the preparation of impact statements in developing national environmental protection measures is consistent with the IGAE, which sets out principles of environmental policy.

His example, which was not well developed, was about pristine and degraded environments. I hope he is not suggesting for one moment that we set lesser standards in relation to degraded environments or that we set standards which would allow those pristine environments to be degraded to some sort of a standard.

         It is certainly true that we have near pristine environments and degraded environments; but it seems to me that the more closely we look at those situations, the more we will come to the conclusion that we need to maintain high standards and to ensure that those high standards are applied to those degraded environments so they do not remain degraded, but come back to a better environment. The minister did not develop that argument but the implication behind that example is that one would accept lesser standards for some areas than others. The opposition amendment states:

         That argument which the minister has put up simply does not wash. It underscores again the totally inadequate nature of the process on which this federal government has embarked under the rubric of federalism, when in fact it is clearly sidestepping the responsibility it has in relation to proper environmental standards. It is sidestepping those because it is giving itself a way out. It is not accepting the fact that with very few exceptions—this was mentioned in my speech—it does have very considerable powers under the constitution to act in these areas.

         Many of these standards will relate to the actions of corporations and, under the corporations power, it does have the power. Contrary to what Senator Knowles was saying, I was not in any way extolling the virtues of Commonwealth-state interaction in an antagonistic sense but simply pointing to the Tasmanian dams case as an example. The High Court found that the HEC was indeed a corporation and that therefore it came under Commonwealth powers.

         As the minister knows, there is a section in the ozone protection legislation, which the government itself formulated, which is absolutely and exclusively based on that head of power in the constitution. And it has never been challenged. So I simply make the point that the Commonwealth does have the power. What it lacks is the political will to take up that power and institute proper national standards—admittedly, through processes of consultation and everything else which allow the states and other groups to come in. But at the end of the day the Commonwealth has the power and the responsibility. It is sidestepping that responsibility because it does not have the political will. That is the point that I think needs to be stressed.

        Previously, clause 2 of the NEPC Act stated that the act commenced on a day to be fixed by proclamation. Paragraph 6 of drafting instruction No. 2 of 1989 suggests that an open-ended power of proclamation may be warranted in unusual circumstances where the commencement depends on an event the timing of which is uncertain, such as the enactment of complementary state and territory legislation.

         Although paragraph 6 of the drafting instruction appears to apply in the case of the NEPC bill, the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills has indicated that it would be preferable for this act to be automatically repealed if it has not been proclaimed within 12 months of royal assent. This recommendation by the Senate committee in fact has been endorsed by this proposed amendment to clause 2.

         I accept what the minister says. It is inevitable that an amendment like this be passed because of the very structure of the bill and the very nature of the process by which this bill has come into being. The process is flawed. The structure is flawed. I repeat: the government should rethink its approach to this. It should move away from the intergovernmental agreement. It should be moving to pass strong national legislation in this area by using its undoubted powers. It should certainly be consulting with the states but not giving the states that right of veto. This is simply the written word which sets down on paper in concrete form the abject failure of this process to deliver what initially many of us hoped would come out of the establishment of a national environmental protection council.

         As Senator Faulkner has said, it is an agreement. Australia is a federal system. There are state governments. There is a federal government. This includes the agreement of the 900-odd local authorities around Australia as well. For that reason, it is obvious that this needs to be done. I also indicate that we, quite obviously, will be supporting it and taking into account the recommendations of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.

I am saying that this whole process was entered into as a way of establishing an escape hatch. That escape hatch has already been used by Western Australia. It has been used by every government in Australia with respect to the agreement, which I read out a moment ago, to greenhouse gas emissions. It is not worth the paper it is written on. The process might be that we go back and get some other agreement. But out of that agreement has to come the recognition that, given consultation with the states, ordinary people, interested parties, industry and everything else, nonetheless the federal government is the one that ultimately must be setting these standards and accepting the responsibility for them.

         The process is fundamentally flawed. We have gone into that process for reasons which are disreputable and nefarious. Clearly that process is not being adhered to by a number of the parties to the agreement. It is not going to be adhered to in this case. We are now debating a let-out clause in this bill. That provides a very good reason why that whole process should be reconsidered and simply not slavishly given effect to.

         One understands where the opposition is coming from. It wants this very much because it is quite sure that every part of this legislation—lock, stock and barrel—will fall over within the next 12 months. That is why the opposition wants it. It wants its mates in industry to have a free go without being fettered by these sorts of standards. That is where the opposition is coming from, and that is why it is supporting the legislation. The government should be aware, and I am sure it is aware, that that is the motive of the opposition.

As I said in the second reading debate, the reason for that is that it would not be sensible or practical to require identical environmental protection measures in all parts of the country because it is simply not possible. I understand that the wording of our amendment was prepared by the shadow minister, Mr Ian McLachlan. I am informed by him that the wording is taken from a speech made by a federal environment minister. I think it was Mrs Kelly. I might stand corrected; it may well have been Senator Faulkner.

There is a letter from Senator Faulkner to the Western Australian environment minister. I understand that Senator Faulkner circulated this letter, so we are not breaching any confidences. Senator Faulkner said that it would not be sensible or practical to require identical environment protection measures in all parts of the country. We agree with Senator Faulkner. That is why we thought it would assist the bill. It would assist the intention of all parties. It would certainly assist the intention of Senator Faulkner if what he said in letters to premiers was included as an object of the bill. It was for that reason that we have moved this amendment.

Presently, clause 3 follows the objects clause of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment.

         The proposed amendment to clause 3 could rule out national environment protection standards which are by their nature prescriptive and in many cases would be addressing human health concerns. The act already contains a degree of in-built flexibility. For example, only standards, by their nature, require strict uniformity. When developing NEPMs the council must have regard to whether a standard, a goal or a guideline is the most effective means of achieving the desired environmental outcome. Hence, the process for developing NEPMs already allows harmonisation as opposed to strict uniformity where appropriate.

I am not aware that I have been responsible for making that letter to Mr Minson public; indeed, I believe I have not been. But, as it has been quoted by a number of senators in the second reading debate on this bill, it is worthwhile quoting in more detail part of what I said to Mr Minson, which I do not believe breaches any confidence.

        The objectives of the NEPC do not require identical measures in all parts of the country any more than state legislation requires identical measures across a state, nor would it be sensible or practical to seek to do so. Measures targeted to protect national parks and relatively pristine environments would, if applied universally, disrupt or prohibit economic activity. Conversely, measures targeted to stabilise environments degraded by economic activity would, if applied universally, fall far short of those required to protect environmentally sensitive areas.

         NEPC aims to achieve equivalent protection and is required to take into account regional environmental differences in the determination of national environment protection measures. This requires a balance between the interests of environmental diversity and the requirement for uniformity in critical areas affecting human health, eg, drinking water quality, air quality. Nor would it be possible to give effect to national measures through ANZEC, a ministerial council without executive authority. A national legislative scheme is required both to confer upon NEPC the executive authority to determine national environment protection measures and to ensure automatic and concurrent application on national measures as valid law in each jurisdiction. There is no practical alternative.

It is something to which the opposition has drawn attention, we have certainly drawn attention to it in the past, and I drew attention to it in the earlier parts of the debate on this bill. Here we have an intergovernmental agreement, and a bill which comes from that, and we are being told by the minister that we cannot change one full stop and one comma.

         In other words, the democratic process of the committee is being bypassed because of the requirement to fulfil agreements which have been entered into quite outside the democratic process. I find that quite objectionable, and I certainly find common ground with the opposition with respect to that aspect of what the minister said. Too often—and increasingly—we are finding this not only with respect to intergovernmental agreements within Australia but also international agreements. I will be very interested to see what the opposition does when we deal with some half a dozen or so amendments to Australian legislation which come out of the intergovernmental agreement known as the GATT agreement and whether it takes the same position of objection.

         In relation to the second point which the minister has made, we strongly support the minister's position and we will oppose this amendment. It significantly weakens the legislation.

         Recently, we went through the process in relation to uniform standards for the labelling of agricultural and veterinary chemicals which, until fairly recently, was a state matter. Industry itself was wanting uniformity. It is crazy to have these variations. It is not in the interests of either the environment or industry. It is far better to have the greatest degree of uniformity as is achievable. The wording of the opposition amendment clearly provides an enormous loophole through which any state could jump and jeopardise the establishment of any of these standards or processes. Therefore, the Democrats will not be supporting the opposition's amendment.

         —The Criminal Code Bill 1994 and the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 are easily, and quite properly, dealt with together. The coalition parties are in support of both of these bills, but we do have some concerns. It might be helpful if I outline the basis of the Criminal Code Bill 1994. Obviously, it concerns Commonwealth criminal law, which encompasses offences created by federal legislation and regulations, and the principles of criminal responsibility applicable to those offences.

         There are, however, some difficulties with our federal system, and I will briefly outline some of those. At the state and territory level, there are two main approaches to criminal law—the common law approach and the code approach. Criminal law in New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and my state of South Australia is based on the common law approach. In those jurisdictions, while there are obviously a significant proportion of offences that are contained in specific acts and regulations, many are nonetheless based on non-legislative common law principles. On the other hand, criminal law in Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory is based on comprehensive codes. There is no recourse in these jurisdictions to common law.

         In the early years following Federation, most criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act 1914. That has now changed and criminal offences are contained throughout every conceivable area of Commonwealth legislation. When a person is charged with a Commonwealth offence in a state or federal court, principles of criminal responsibility need to be applied when determining that person's guilt or innocence.

         At present, the principles applicable to Commonwealth offences are disparate and unsatisfactory. That is because common law principles apply if the offence is contained in the Crimes Act 1914. For the remainder of Commonwealth offences—and I understand this is the majority—the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that the relevant state or territory laws apply. That means that two people convicted of the same Commonwealth offence in different states may be subject to different rules. Those rules can have a substantive impact on the outcome of any prosecution.

         The Gibbs review of Commonwealth criminal law recommended that there be general principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law. This legislation represents the first phase in the implementation of that recommendation, which is expected to take five years. My understanding is that, in order to achieve consistency while the reform process continues, the government has determined that there should be an interim position whereby common law principles are applicable to all Commonwealth offences. That requires an amendment to the Crimes Act 1914, which is included in the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 which we are debating cognately with the Criminal Code Bill 1994 today.

         Ultimately, the reform agenda is much wider than an attempt to codify Commonwealth criminal law. The aim is to achieve uniformity across all jurisdictions of criminal law principles by the year 2001. That goal has been endorsed by SCAG, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. SCAG has established the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee made up of criminal law experts from various jurisdictions. The government has indicated that that committee has developed agreed principles for an Australian model criminal code, and a draft is expected by 1998.

         This legislation sets out principles of criminal responsibility which will apply to all Commonwealth offences within five years. These principles are contained in chapter two of the code. I could go into the details of what is in the Criminal Code Bill, but it might be more appropriate if I go straight to the concern that we want the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to look at. I understand that other parties have broader concerns with the code and want the whole bill referred to the committee rather than asking the committee to look at one part.

         We are particularly concerned with part 2.5 of the Criminal Code Bill, which deals with corporate criminal responsibility. As we understand it—by what the government has indicated in the bill—part 2.5 of the bill takes corporate criminal responsibility a step further than the Tesco case. That is a significant step to take, and we certainly think it is worth hearing the views of a broad range of people in the community who might be affected.

         We understand that corporations are designed so that numerous people—namely, the shareholders—can pool their assets, make investments and work as a company. The intention was not to establish a separate corporate self to act as a veil to criminality so that people would be able to get away with things as a company because of the difficulty of proving who was responsible for what. There are difficulties there.

         In the explanatory memorandum, an example is given which states that if the paperwork for a firm says that employees have to obey all of the relevant occupational health and safety guidelines, but it is a known fact within the business that if an employee ever shuts down an assembly line, turns off a machine or whatever in order to comply with those guidelines and costs the company money, it will be `See you later, alligator.' A way will be found to get rid of that employee, who would lose his or her job. In other words, the culture says, `Look, we know what the law says but, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, don't do that because you're not going to get on or, worse still, you're going to get the sack' in the event that a person actually obeys the law. Nobody could agree with that as being an acceptable approach to take. But, on the other hand, a line has to be drawn somewhere.

         Sadly, that is not the view taken today. Corporations' senior management and board members are basically regarded by many as those who are out to put their snouts in the trough, to squeeze money out of the company, and who are interested not in the shareholders but in themselves. Management buy-outs, of course, invite that kind of speculation, as does insider trading and that type of activity. The whole business has changed: years ago, when I was much younger, being a corporate director had some status and was something in which to take some pride. It is now something which is quite tarnished, not the least by the activities of some corporations during the 1980s.

         We understand all of that, but in the end someone is sitting there as a director and all sorts of consequences flow for that person if the corporation is found guilty of some criminal activity. The question that we want looked at is: just how far can that go down the chain? How far down the chain could some criminality be that is in the end going to come back and affect the director of the company? It is not in anyone's interest and, of course, it is not in the public interest to have corporations encouraging a sort of criminal culture with respect to certain aspects of their work. Nor is it in our interest to have corporations bereft of talent because people who do have talent will not take the risk.

         I know people who have been offered board positions; and they think more than twice about whether they will take them because of the responsibilities placed on them and the risks they run, over and above just diligently doing their own work. This extension makes people who understand the balance, those two arguments, and who can see both sides of it very apprehensive. For that reason we want the section on corporate criminal responsibility referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee for investigation.

         Other than that, we are supportive of the prospect of having a code. I do not think I have been able to find a criminal lawyer who says, `No, we want to stay as we are.' Wearing my other hat on the cost of justice committee, I hear time and again about the very great expense of the differences in laws all over the place and the complications. We just have to try to simplify these things. If this is a step towards that, well and good.

         Let me turn briefly to the Crimes Amendment Bill that goes with this. The government has apparently determined that some of the areas of reform contained in the criminal code should be implemented in the short term. One is the age of criminal responsibility. The provisions in this bill standardise the current situation such that persons under 10 years will not be liable for offences under Commonwealth law.

         The law of attempt is dealt with. The provision requires that the conduct said to constitute the attempt must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The provisions allow a conviction even where committing the offence is impossible. I understand that a simple way to explain that is that, if someone tries to pick a pocket and there is no money there, they are still a pickpocket and they were still trying to pick a pocket, so we should still be able to have a go at them in the sense of `attempt'.

         Also the law relating to conspiracy is dealt with. The provisions here aim to reduce the abuse of conspiracy charges. These provisions apply only where the offence to which they relate has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of more than $20,000, and proceedings may be commenced only with the consent of the DPP.

         We do note that the Criminal Code Bill does not come into effect until five years after the code receives royal assent. This matter was picked up by the scrutiny of bills committee and, indeed, it caused us some concern. If it should lie on the table for that long without being implemented, the question arises, obviously: why do we not just have an exposure draft? The minister explains that it is necessary to have a definitive view on the table, as it were, and to test the acceptance of the provisions in the bills by parliament. We accept that view.

         We welcome the reference of these bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs because, while we understand that the government has undertaken considerable consultation with the profession and with community groups, the report on those consultations was made available, as has the digest, only a couple of days ago.

         Briefly, the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 deals with a number of areas which the government feels should become law in the short term and not be put off for five years. There are three main areas. Firstly, the age of criminal responsibility: proposed section 4N provides that a child under 10 years of age cannot be liable for an offence against the law of the Commonwealth. Proposed section 4N(1) provides that children aged 10 years or more but under 14 can be criminally responsible for an offence only if the child knows that his or her conduct is wrong. Previously these provisions varied across Australian jurisdictions, so these reforms will help to provide greater consistency in determining a basic age for criminal responsibility.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second main area deals with what constitutes an attempt to commit an offence and the consequences that arise from undertaking such an attempt. The bill specifies that, to be found guilty of attempting an offence, the person's conduct must be more than merely preparatory. That test is obviously designed to catch cases where the defendant has the necessary fault element and has taken a step beyond mere preparation towards the perpetration of the offence without actually committing it.

         The third main area of the bill deals with what constitutes conspiracy, defining it in three subclauses to clause 73, and it appears to have been drafted in a way that discourages overuse. In general terms, the Australian Democrats welcome the provisions but, as I said before, I welcome the opportunity to test the views of the profession on these matters.

         The Criminal Code Bill 1994 will apply to all offences under the code, and to all other offences on or after the day occurring five years after the code receives royal assent. It deals with circumstances of criminal responsibility. The area of corporate criminal responsibility certainly needs some closer examination. The bill maintains certain defences for companies but makes companies accountable for general managerial responsibilities and policy. It provides that negligence may be proven by failure to provide adequate communication within the body corporate.

         Part 2.6 speaks of proof of criminal responsibility and sets out the relevant burdens of proof to be discharged by both the prosecution and the defence. The Australian Democrats welcome the bill which sees the beginning of a new era for Commonwealth criminal law by ensuring that those who are accused of federal offences are subject to the same law in all Australian jurisdictions. As the government has acknowledged, however, there are mutually opposed views on some aspects of the legislation and many of these are likely to generate considerable comment during this stage and after they have been passed.

         —The opposition will be supporting this bill. In our view, the bill effects a number of useful changes. It will limit the status of approved joint ventures and consortia to a period of three years with a discretion for Austrade to extend the approval for subsequent three-year periods, but limit the number of grants to those bodies to a maximum of five. It will tie export grants more closely to the actual time spent on promotional activity than was previously the case. It will extend the period required by Austrade to make relevant enquiries for the purpose of deciding whether to grant approved status to a joint venture, consortium or trading houses from 30 days to 60 days.

         It will strengthen Austrade's powers to reconsider, vary or cancel the approved status of these bodies, having regard to the granting of export grants. It will provide a framework for the establishment of a system of accreditation of consultants engaged in the preparation of EMDG applications on behalf of business. As I said, the opposition believes that these changes are worthwhile and they therefore have our support.

         —The Australian Democrats support the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1994 with one exception, and I will come to that in a moment. Generally speaking, the bill has six purposes. It extends the investigation period for approved joint venture and consortium applications and approved trading house applications from 30 days to 60 days. Further, it limits the life of the status of these consortia to three years, with a discretion in Austrade to extend for another three years.

         It then limits the maximum number of grants payable to any joint venture consortium to five—and that to us is the contentious provision. It also provides for an ongoing review of the status of these bodies, and it ties the overseas visit allowance more directly to specific promotional activity and provides for accreditation for consultants.

         Taking the last point first, there is no objection to the accreditation of consultants. It can only be of benefit to companies operating in this area to be able to choose from a range of consultants who have been accredited. We certainly support that.

         There can also be no objection to the provisions which ensure that the support funds are not misused by tying the visits specifically to days which can be defined as activity days or bridging days. That clearly is also accepted. One can have little objection to the provisions relating to the ongoing review of the status of both approved trading houses and approved joint ventures and consortia.

         However, the Australian Democrats have some concern about the extension of the investigation period for approved joint venture and consortium applications and trading house applications from 30 days to 60 days. It is somewhat surprising that Austrade, which claims to have reviewed its management procedures and streamlined its activities, cannot assess an application within 30 days. We are told that this in part is caused by the bunching of applications close to the closing date. The question arises why this could not have been dealt with by staggering the closing date; having it twice a year, which I understand was attempted but which fell down because the payment of grants was still delayed until the whole period elapsed. Obviously, companies were not impressed by that.

         Surely it should have been possible to make arrangements within the management of Austrade to keep the target of 30 days rather than extend it to 60 days, placing an additional burden on small business, in particular, in delaying crucial decisions which relate to their business activities. The reality is that if that additional time is not provided to Austrade there will be a trend to reject applications where there is some doubt about their detail rather than approve them. It would be to the detriment of small business if that particular provision was not approved. Therefore, we will not attempt to change that and will vote to pass it. However, I again place on record our disappointment that a more appropriate solution to this problem could not have been found.

         One provision that is causing us a great deal of concern, however, is the attempt in this bill to limit the maximum number of grants payable to a consortium to five. The reason given for this is that large companies—those large enough to make an application in their own right—are double dipping. They are applying once as members of a consortium and, when they have exhausted the eight applications that they are currently entitled to make, they apply again as individual applicants.

         This problem could surely have been solved in a different way. Surely the government could have found a different way to prevent this double dipping by major companies. By addressing the problem specifically, the government could have defined the size of companies that are able to join a consortium in such a way as to exclude large companies. Alternatively, the government could bring in a provision that a company which has made an application as part of a consortium would have that application counted when an assessment is made of the number of applications that that company can make in its own right. It is for that reason that I foreshadow an amendment knocking out the two clauses in the bill which specify this.

         We have had some discussions with the minister, the minister's office and the department. I understand that the force of the argument that I am putting has been recognised to some extent at least, but so far we are not certain what the government will do. The suggestion that I put to the government and to the opposition is that they should think again. Why should small business be disadvantaged because some big companies are rorting the system? The government is essentially disadvantaging small companies.

         —The coalition is supporting the Australian Trade Commission Amendment Bill 1994. Very briefly, it implements changes to the parent act consistent with the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The bill removes the age restriction on the appointment of part-time members to the board of the Australian Trade Commission. The effect of the bill is that part-time members may be appointed to the board after attaining the age of 65 years or for a term to expire after a member attains the age of 65 years. This strikes a blow against the evils of ageism. We on this side of the chamber do not believe that somebody who has attained that age has necessarily lost the faculties needed to do a good job. We are therefore pleased to support this legislation.

         This correction arises because of Senate amendments to the latter bill which resulted in that bill being renumbered.

         —I would like to address the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill in some detail. It is a classic example of the hypocrisy of the Keating government. Let us go back to July of this year when the Business Council of Australia was calling on the federal and state governments to make the Hilmer report proposals on exposing government enterprises to competition the top priority for economic reform. We all know that this government has had an abysmal track record in terms of micro-economic reform. It has repeatedly caved in to vested interests and trade union pressures. The privatisation of Telecom seems to be off the agenda altogether, despite Minister Lee's flirtation with such ideas as asset stripping. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would undoubtedly love to get his hands on the proceeds of a Telecom sale, but we are not going to see the privatisation of Telecom this side of the next election.

         We do not have to go terribly much further down the track of the government's abortive attempts at reform to remember the way in which Senator Collins managed to make such a meal of the waterfront; promised to resign within 12 months; failed abysmally; and then, of course, could not walk away. In every respect, the government has had this challenge before it and that is why the Business Council came out and said what it said. The Prime Minister in turn then said:

       <para>
        The Keating approach has been largely to say that it is all the fault of the states for not proceeding fast enough with microe-conomic reform. They are the ones that have got to make the running in terms of Hilmer.

         On 19 August, less than a week ago, we had Mr Keating going up to Darwin and pontificating about the absolute necessity for micro-economic reform, particularly exposing government business enterprises to the challenge of change and saying such things as, `the federation is not a device which is about aggrandising the status of the states.' A Labor federal government was going to a group of largely Liberal-National Party states—that is, nominally pro-market governments—and saying, `Please embrace the markets.' Mr Keating said:

       <para>
        There is a real test there. A federal Labor government is saying, `We want you to embrace competition and market policy.' There it is: the Prime Minister is setting the high jump bar firmly in front of the states. But where is he when it comes to these sorts of reform? The answer is absolutely nowhere. On 15 November 1992, after deferring the matter on a number of occasions over a three-month period, cabinet finally decided its formal response to the Industry Commission report No. 28 on mail, courier and parcel services, which had been released more than 12 months earlier. The government's response was its first major opportunity to give effect to the report of the Hilmer committee which had recommended an extension of competition policy to government business enterprises and that it demonstrate the nature and extent of its claimed competition credentials. I will come to the detail of what the Industry Commission recommended in a moment.

         But suffice it to say that the Industry Commission recognised Australia Post as one of the last great sheltered business enterprises in the country, particularly one of those over which the Commonwealth has absolute and total responsibility. The commission was clearly urging the government to take action to free up the market for the benefit of consumers. However, in the face of a concerted campaign of opposition by Australia Post and the Communications Workers Union, the government chose to opt out of adopting the Industry Commission's major pro-competitiveness recommendations and instead settled for a toe in the water approach, which even a press release from the then minister responsible, David Beddall, described limply as `a gradual and measured approach to reform.' If ever there is a formula for capitulation, it is that—no revolution there. The hard decisions were deferred until after a 1997 review.

         The main issue was reserved services protection. By far the most important proposal concerned changes to Australia Post's standard letter monopoly. The Industry Commission's preferred approach was to reduce the weight limit for protected articles from 500 grams to 250 grams from 1 January 1994—we are already nine months behind schedule—and then lower the rate of protection from its current $4.50 per article so as to bring it into line with the existing standard letter rate of 45c. This would have eliminated the monopoly in one fell swoop but would also have posed significant problems in terms of Australia Post's community service obligations, particularly in respect of rural and remote areas. The Industry Commission recommended that these be funded directly from the budget.

         However, it virtually conceded that its preferred option was basically an ambit claim, and that the more realistic fall back position was in conjunction with the lower weight limit to reduce the minimum rate, which competitors must legally charge, to carry articles from 10 times the standard rate—$4.50—to a rate of $1.20 per article. The commission also recommended that this rate be further reduced by 10c a year over the next five years until a rate of 70c was reached by 1997. It recommended that a full review should take place at that time to determine the system which would apply beyond the year 2000.

         At that time it recommended a full review should take place to determine the system which would apply beyond the year 2000. As expected, the government completely rejected the ambit claim, but also effectively rejected the softer rate reductions; with the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, arguing for the Industry Commission recommendation but being opposed by senior non-economic ministers such as Senators Ray, Richardson and Collins—and no doubt Senator Schacht would have done if he had been allowed into the cabinet room for a moment—as well as Mr Beddall.

         The cabinet on that basis agreed on a compromise rate of $1.80 with no further phased reduction. Despite this being presented as a significant reduction from ten times the standard rate to four times, in fact it is a Clayton's cut which is most unlikely to put any significant pressure on the current monopoly. Overseas experience, particularly in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, has graphically demonstrated that the gap must be quite narrow before effective competition enters the market. In discussions with the Industry Commission in May 1992, New Zealand Post indicated that the present margin of 35c—that is, less than two times its current standard letter rate of 45c—provided sufficient protection from potential competitors to maintain its ability to provide a universal letter service. That assessment of the situation was confirmed by my office with the New Zealand Ministry of Commerce.

         Clearly, everyone who is serious about reform of the postal service would acknowledge that if one really wanted to expose Australia Post to any meaningful competition in relation to the reserved standard letter service one would need to come much closer to two times. Yet what the government has got is four times, with no phasing down—in other words, a complete and utter cave-in.

         What a farce that makes of a Prime Minister who wanders around the country beating his chest, giving lectures to the states and pretending that somehow he is the champion of micro-economic reform. The fact is that he is a total and abject failure. He had the opportunity here to do something about it, and he failed. I do not blame Mr Lee, because Mr Lee does not make any decisions off his own bat. We know the deferral of the cultural statement this week—for the fourth time—was entirely because the Prime Minister decided that, as he is delivering it, he had to be satisfied with it. He did not like Mr Lee's draft and he wanted to rewrite it, so it has been put off. That is a pattern of behaviour that we have become quite used to. It is not really Mr Lee's fault. It is fairly and squarely the fault of the person who has the gall to get up and pretend that the federal government has been making any running at all on micro-economic reform.

         Not only have they squibbed the acid test when it comes to reserved services protection, they have actually been backsliding ever since. Let us go to some of the other changes; for example, bulk interconnection. Private carriers are currently only allowed to interconnect with Australia Post at the mail exchange closest to the address of the sender. For example, if a Canberra based firm has bulk mail to be delivered in Perth, its private carrier must lodge the mail at the closest Canberra mail exchange to the sender. The company is legally not allowed to use the private carrier to carry the bulk mail to Perth and then have it lodged at an Australia Post mail exchange. The Industry Commission recommended private carriers be allowed to interconnect with any Australia Post mail exchange between sender and receiver up to the location of final sort before delivery, thereby reducing Australia Post's advantage in being the only service to provide nation-wide coverage.

         It ought to be blindingly obvious that what we have in place at the moment is a whole series of Byzantine restrictions simply designed to protect the monopoly of Australia Post, and presumably those employed by it, despite the fact that consumers are the ones who then have to bear the burden. If the government is serious about trying to give business a fair go, if it is serious about businesses as the job generators, if it really wants to be export oriented, then the main thing it should be doing is looking at ways in which it can reduce the cost of business inputs. The government has not done it anywhere near fast enough in telecommunications, and here it is squibbing the challenge once again in relation to postal services.

         The government rejected the Industry Commission recommendation and instead embraced Australia Post's position, which was to accept interconnection on the basis that mail is pre-sorted and then lodged at designated mail centres. My understanding is that Australia Post plans to have only 43 designated mail centres throughout the country, which will be very limiting. It is reasonable to accept that bulk mail be lodged only at mail centres rather than at every post office in the network, which may not have the facilities to deal with bulk mail, but it is certainly not reasonable that interconnection should only be allowed to take place at a few designated centres. It is possible that Australia Post could designate all 43 mail centres in one or two cities, which would not inject much competition into the system at all. It ought to be a matter of commercial negotiation.

         These provisions will, in effect, further limit the number of items on which there can be competition. Quite rightly, a number of organisations have been greatly concerned that this is a classic case of backsliding, despite the fact that the minister claimed in his speech on the second reading that the reforms in the bill will provide a competitive discipline to ensure that services are provided efficiently and economically. So we oppose those provisions to the extent that they restrict current practices. At the very least what the government ought to be doing is legislating to formalise arrangements that have been in place to this point.

         The same goes for the contracting out for document exchanges. The exemption provisions will allow organisations to contract out the carriage of letters between officers of the same organisation. An exemption will be inserted to allow the movement of documents as part of a document exchange service. However, documents will no longer be able to be carried from one document exchange service to another or to be delivered directly to the addressees of individual members, even though this practice has been widespread for some years. The Victorian government is presently investigating whether the definition of `organisation' will prevent it from continuing to use a non-Australia Post carrier for its inter-departmental mail. It would be the height of absurdity if the result of this bill is that it is no longer possible to transport mail between government departments via a courier service. Yet the government has shown absolutely no interest at all in trying to clarify the situation, let alone liberalise the regime. Accordingly, we will be moving amendments to ensure that current practices are not limited.

         There are other recommendations in relation to the disclosure of Australia Post information which I do not think are contentious, such as the opening and examination of mail and the carriage of dangerous goods. There is, however, one other provision which I think is of concern. Australia Post will no longer be required to have a government board member and I think that is right and proper otherwise it is very difficult to argue that it has any degree of independence or managerial autonomy. The managing director will be appointed by the board, not the minister; however, the minister may terminate the appointment of any director on the board.

That is an intolerable situation to allow. As a result, we will be moving an amendment to remove that power to terminate the appointment of any director on the board. It is a very dangerous precedent that should not be supported. If it was a provision in relation to the ABC board, perhaps it might have a little attraction; but it is not.

I think it would respond positively to further competition. It would rise to the challenge. The problem is, as it would well know, this government is beholden to the TWU. This government is really interested in paying off its mates; it is not particularly interested in any significant micro-economic reforms.

         Finally, the Industry Commission recommended that where roadside delivery is only once a week it should be increased to at least twice a week. We have long held the view that twice a week is the least that can be reasonably expected in rural and remote areas. In our regional communications policy at the last election, we made a commitment to increase the maximum once-weekly service to rural and remote Australians to a twice-weekly minimum service.

There is no reason why  the government should not go down this path and there is no attempt to justify ignoring that recommendation. So we will move an amendment to expand Australia Post CSOs to make it a requirement that that obligation should be enshrined in legislation.

         I conclude simply by saying that this is the crunch and the government has failed the test abysmally. In terms of the government's response to Hilmer, we had the perfect opportunity to deliver the goods, not just by giving the states lectures about how they ought to lift their game but by setting a very specific example. Australia Post is entirely the responsibility of the federal government. The federal government knows full well—it has been told so by the Industry Commission and anyone else who has looked at the area—that there is absolutely no justification these days for the sorts of protections that are in place at the moment. It has paid that lip service. At best, it has reduced the reserved services protection down to four times which will make absolutely no difference. It has actually done worse in terms of liberalising competition in a number of other significant areas. If this is the best that Mr Keating and the government can do, all I can say is it is going to be game, set and match to us when it comes to micro-economic reform credentials at the next election.

It is surprising that the government has not done this. It claims it is in favour of micro-economic reform. Australia's postal services are completely under the control of the federal government. Yet in this area where the government does have complete control it is surprising to see that this bill—now it has finally been presented—is so timid in its approach to opening up postal services to competition.

In light of that speech, which was referred to by Senator Alston earlier, it is indeed surprising that the federal government has not gone further. What this bill is going to do is maintain the postal services restrictions, blocks and impediments to fair and open competition for private operators.

         The bill claims that there is no direct financial impact from this legislation. I find that surprising. Were one to even slightly open the door a little further to competition one would have thought that that would have some effect on Australia Post's revenue share. Dividends and tax receipts would be affected as certain reserve services are removed. As private operators win market share, that would obviously affect revenue going to Australia Post. It may be that this could be made up from micro-economic reforms and greater efficiencies, but one suspects that that will not happen because of union opposition to certain measures that might help Australia Post balance out the loss of revenue in other areas. The upshot of all of that is that the revenue will go down. So the government should not argue that this bill has no financial impact.

There was another recommendation that the standard letter price rate gap remaining to Australia Post be reduced greatly. It now stands at five times the standard rate. That sort of gap fairly obviously is a huge restriction on competition. The Industry Commission recommended a much narrower gap, but the government has not moved in that direction.

         The bulk mail interconnection service in clause 14 is another major problem. Private operators are concerned about disappointing discount rates offered by Australia Post for the interconnect facility with their networks. There is some doubt that private operators would actually use it because they are so high. As we move into the new information age this sort of thing, where private operators are restricted from interconnecting, is a huge brake on competition and the development of industry. Australia Post and, particularly, the government should reconsider this measure. They could take a leaf out of the telecommunication groups in this country where we have some real competition between Optus and Telecom. We need more of that sort of spirit through the postal facilities as well.

         One of the aspects that Senator Alston referred to, which is a great worry, relates to the Australia Post board. The bill does remove some government controls; again, this seems to be a lot of window-dressing. It is true that there is no government appointment to the board. The managing director is appointed by the board, not the minister. But, of course, the bottom line is that the minister has the power to terminate any board member's or director's position. This, of course, gives the minister draconian control and is something that really should be removed. One of the basic services of a post office is the sale of stamps. There is no sale here other than the usual retail price. There is no discounting allowed and this, of course, hampers genuine competition. The stamp rate has been fixed at 45c and this is locked in to 1997. Again, no competition is allowed.

         In summary, the bill does have some welcome measures in that it does slightly open the door to competition. A lot more could be done. We really need, in the new information age, a vigorous and competitive postal service. This bill starts down the track, but the government does not go far enough. We invite the government, over the coming time, to reconsider its approach. In the areas that I have indicated, greater competition is needed to do this. Otherwise the industrial dinosaur that is Australia Post will be largely bypassed by what is going to happen in Australia with the development of the new information age.

         I just want to say, after hearing Senator Alston's contribution, that it is riddled with great contradiction. He is arguing that there has got to be greater competition for the post office, all over the place, but he refuses to deal adequately with the issue of the community service obligation. I think that is also the weakness of Senator Tierney's comments, though I must say that Senator Tierney made a more rational attempt to explain his case with more detail than the rantings of the boofheaded contribution from Senator Alston, which was full of rhetoric and all it was doing was `slagging', to use that term, Australia Post. I do not think that is fair to Australia Post, to the staff and to the contribution it makes to Australia.

         He got on to the Hilmer debate. Every commentator, other than Senator Alston, quite rightly pointed the finger at various state premiers last Friday for not biting the bullet on taking up the Hilmer theme on competition. We would point out that, even before this bill, 40 per cent of the revenues of Australia Post are subject to competition. With these amendments, that will become 50 per cent. There is no doubt that most of the state government run monopolies have not one percentage point of competition for their revenues. They are 100 per cent state owned monopolies. To compare the Australia Post situation with the situation of any of the state monopolies is absolutely wrong. We reject those remarks. I think Senator Alston was trying to deflect attention from the appalling performance of a number of Liberal premiers last Friday.

         We believe that this bill is achieving that balance between competition and the needs of the public through community service. That will always be the case. I find it particularly odd that the opposition, which claims to speak for rural Australia and regional Australia, would denigrate the post office. If one goes to regional and rural Australia, one will find that every community will defend the retention of the Australian post office. They want their post office to continue. They want to maintain that building in the main street. What Senator Tierney was talking about or, in particular, what Senator Alston was rabbiting on about would mean an absolute certainty that many more of those post offices would disappear because of what the opposition is proposing.

         —Absolutely. I think this is the great myth of the opposition. At one stage it is claiming the virtues of competition but I bet two bob to London Bridge that, if a country post office in the wheat belt of Western Australia was being closed because competition had meant it had lost business, Senator Panizza would be the first to jump up with a petition questioning parliament saying, `Retain my post office at Southern Cross' or `Retain my post office at Doodlakine' for Senator Walsh. They would be the first in here complaining, `Why is it being closed?' The reason they would be closed would overwhelmingly occur if we adopted the opposition's policy. So this government is getting the balance right between having a competitive post office, customer related, and meeting the community obligation. The opposition has not got it right; it cannot have it both ways.

         This is typical of the opposition; it always argues theoretically for complete competition but when the first bit of heat occurs that may affect something in the rural community it jumps up and wants another subsidy, more underpinning, more public money to be provided. That is what the opposition is on about. It keeps putting that view in the rural areas in particular. We are not going to buy its story; we are not going to buy its policy because we know rural and regional Australia will be the most affected by the policies—as far as I can understand them—outlined by the shadow minister, Senator Alston.

         As minister for small business, I want to give two examples that may surprise honourable senators opposite about the way Australia Post is serving the community. A few months ago I visited a firm in Melbourne called Billiecart Clothing Co., an Australian owned company that makes clothing for children between the ages of six months and 11 years of age. It sells its clothing not through retail outlets—it is Australian made—but through the technique of party selling. There are salespeople in the community selling it directly to the customer. The company has a turnover of many millions of dollars a year and sells hundreds and hundreds of thousands of items.

         I said, `I can understand all that but how do you distribute your product? How do you get it out from your warehouse once it has been ordered all over Australia?' The answer was, `Very simply: we use Australia Post. It is the most efficient, cheapest system there is. Every month, every week, every day, we put it in express packs and packages. The post office comes and picks it up here as part of its customer service and delivers it to post offices all over Australia where our salespeople pick it up.' It is guaranteed delivery that meets customer need. The company said, `It's the best system going. It is cheaper and more competitive than any other.'

         More recently, I visited a small Victorian aerobics-wear manufacturer on Phillip Island. That company sells direct to aerobics instructors in gymnasiums all around Australia. I said to the manager, `How do you deliver the product?' He replied, `It is very simple. We deliver it all, within two days of orders being received, through the Australia Post express post system. We never have a problem. It is the best system going.' I asked the manager how he got on to that and he said, `Initially, I would go down to the post office on Phillip Island, go up to the counter with a bundle of packages and pay the money. The packages would then be delivered. The postmaster said to me, "This is taking up too much time. Let us work out a system. We can come in and pick it up from your factory and we will deliver the packages".' So this company can deliver its products to practically everywhere in Australia within two days. The manager went on to tell me that his company is also exporting to Hong Kong and Singapore, and that through Australia Post he can get his product into Hong Kong and Singapore within three days of receiving an order.

As he is a Western Australian senator, he was obviously aware of the success of the new Australian shipbuilding industry, much of it based in Western Australia.

However, what is not well known is that shipbuilding by private industry is now one of Australia's most successful export industries.

         In 1993-94 the industry was valued at over $300 million with exports at around $260 million in the same period. The Australian shipbuilding industry is a mixture of large and small companies such as Transfield and ADI, as well as Oceanfast in Western Australia and Incat in Tasmania. The industry is located in all states, and is a major employer and generator of wealth for Australia.

         Yesterday the Australian Shipbuilders Association, in conjunction with my department, held a seminar to discuss the future plans for the industry. Over 100 people attended here in Parliament House, and they adopted a strategic plan with a vision for what the industry wants to achieve by the year 2000. The major plan is that in the fast shipbuilding area—the fast ferries, aluminium built ships—they want to maintain the advantage they have in the world marketplace. What is probably not known in Australia is that we have 30 per cent of the world market in aluminium fast ferries. We have that advantage because of our world competitiveness, our innovation and the good management of those firms right around Australia. Yesterday the industry adopted a target of achieving $1 billion worth of exports by the year 2000. It believes it can be achieved, but it will only be achieved if the industry maintains its innovative edge in ensuring that all the best methods are put together.

         We in the Australian government support that initiative. We believe that, as the industry makes the effort and the commitment, we are there to assist it. One of the first things we will be doing is establishing a secretariat within the Australian Shipbuilders Association to bring together through the networking process many more Australian industries which probably do not realise that they have a potential to be involved in this expanding export industry of Australian ships.

         One of the areas we will be particularly looking at is the development of the ship of the future, looking into whether we can adapt ferry construction into building fast freight ships travelling at similar speeds—30 or 40 knots—between Australian ports. We will look at selling those as regional container ships within the Asia-Pacific which has an enormous demand for such ships.

For example, one of them is Oceanfast, the luxury shipmaker in Perth. It employs all-Australian artisans, tradesmen and craftspeople to fit out its ships at top quality, and this has had a spin-off into other export markets. All in all, this is a great success story of which the industry is proud. It is not sitting on its laurels; it is going ahead to achieve $1 billion worth of exports. Despite Senator Kemp, I think most of the rest of the opposition will support that target.

         —I thank Senator Baume for another free kick. The facts are that in 1991—and this is on the record in terms of how responsibly we have acted in this position—I negotiated a 49 per cent sell down with the relevant parties. We conducted a scoping study that has been quoted by the opposition. The scoping study recommended that it should be a 100 per cent sell down, not 49 per cent. Immediately following that, the then minister, Senator Cook, jointly with the Treasurer, took a submission to cabinet proposing the 100 per cent sell down. A due diligence process was invoked as a result of that. The results of that due diligence process are now on the table.

It was the second such forum to have taken place since the first was initiated as a result of an agreement between President Suharto and Mr Keating a couple of years ago. It took place over the last two days in Canberra. It brought together four key Indonesian ministers and a total, putting them altogether, of 11 Australian ministers to review progress right across the bilateral relationship but with a particular focus on the economic and commercial relationship. Indonesia is only one of three countries with whom we have these regular ministerial, all-in exchanges of this kind.

         The striking range of the practical progress that has taken place under the umbrella of this ministerial forum certainly confirmed its value. Over the last two years the forum and its working groups established under it have resolved a number of market access issues, facilitated trade and investment and promoted industry collaboration. More specifically, under the umbrella of the forum, a business mission and a trade exhibition took place with the Australia Today, Indonesia 94 promotion and new joint ventures have been established—for example, in horticulture, cattle breeding and marine engineering. A bilateral agreement on scientific research and technology development cooperation has been signed and a memorandum of understanding on a marine engineering feasibility study.

         To get a representative picture of banks' overall margins, it is necessary to look at average interest rates received and paid. It is not sufficient simply to subtract a deposit rate from a lending rate, as this does not take into account the long duration of loans and deposits. The figures quoted on new deposits, for example, do not reflect what a bank is still paying on its longstanding deposits which are often fixed at higher rates. A better measure is the banks' domestic interest rate spread. This is the difference between the average interest rate received on all loans and investments, including non-accrual loans, and the average interest rate paid on deposits, including non-interest bearing accounts.

         The other factors in this consideration should be that all the banks, fairly uniformly, suffered a sharp fall in profits over the 1990s, badly affecting their shareholders. As well, housing rates in Australia are now at their lowest for many years, and obviously customers have clearly benefited from that. Housing rates have not moved upwards since the change in the cash rate of last week, so housing rates still are at the same levels as they were before.

         The next point I should make is that it is difficult to make accurate comparisons between banks' margins in Australia and those overseas, given the limited data and widely differing financial systems. Allowing for those differences, if we do make a best analysis of how we perform in our banking system compared to other countries, Australia comes in the middle of a comparative group of other countries.

         The extent to which domestic margins are higher than overseas margins for Australian banks reflects in part the higher cost structure for Australian banks. One of the factors that that is due to is the extensive branch network over the massive geographical land mass that they have to retain in Australia. I must also point out that all major banks are currently restructuring to reduce costs and improve efficiencies.

         The Australian banking system is highly competitive, as indicated by various fee free or low fee offers that they make, as indicated by new products on offer to bank customers themselves. I think that is going to be underpinned to some extent by the entry of foreign banks as well. In addition, by ensuring that banks disclose the terms and conditions to customers when they make their banking decisions, the code of banking practice will operate to increase competition further, placing downward pressure on margins.

         As to the question of whether this is market failure, I point to that part of the Treasurer's advice that this is still a competitive banking system and that steps have been taken by the government to ensure that it is. I think the steps taken by the Prime Minister to encourage the banks not to increase interest rates in view of the change in the cash rate represents exactly the right sort of jawboning that a government should do in a free enterprise economy like this where we have a competitive banking system.

         As any television viewer or newspaper reader would know, there is competition between banks for mortgagees' trade at present.

Iraq did not attempt to divert significant amounts of material under safeguards, but what it did do was to pursue, as I said, a separate clandestine nuclear weapons program.

As to the effectiveness of these controls on Australian uranium exports, we have in place, as honourable senators ought to know well by now, a stringent safeguard system for Australian uranium and other nuclear material and technology to ensure that they are only used for peaceful, non-explosive purposes.

We reserve the right to very careful selection of our bilateral safeguards partners.

The non-nuclear weapons states had to feel they had some benefit from the deal in getting access to technology, and the promotion of effective use of that technology was one of the things they demanded as the price for participating in what has been a very successful non-proliferation regime.

         —I think Senator Tierney will find it most unwise to take at face value what Mr Peter Costello said about these particular matters—I think he is quoting from that press release. When we look at the terms of the RBA annual report, we see that it is perfectly clear that the RBA supports the government's deficit reduction commitment of around 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97, observing that the achievement of that target will have an important bearing on the level and composition of growth in the years ahead.

         Senator Tierney is no doubt referring to the RBA's comment about `achieving—and hopefully doing better than—this planned reduction in the deficit.' That should not be construed as in any way a criticism of that objective that we have mapped. If senators read the context of the report, they will see that that is the single such phrase in the entire report, amid acres of pages of print—trees full of print—applauding the quality of the government's macro-economic achievement and the bank's confidence that these targets will be met. They will make the difference we are saying they will to the effective performance of the Australian economy.

         Being economists, they are no doubt a bit wistful and they would like a bit more, if possible, off the budget, but they are leaving it to our judgment and they are accepting that the target, if reached, will do the job that we have said it will. What is that job?

         —I have read it, more than you have, Elmer, I bet. As outlined at budget time, the forecast deficit for 1996-97 is now less than one per cent of GDP and the budget is expected to return to surplus soon after. The OECD regards that commitment as realistic. It has noted that it will take us further than most of the countries in the OECD list.

         The RBA's overall assessment of the economy is extremely positive—and so it should be—and it is in accord with the government's. GDP grew by about 10 per cent from mid-1991 to mid-1994, well ahead of the recoveries in most other industrialised countries. Private consumption rose by three per cent in the last financial year, the strongest growth in four years. Not only are the preconditions for investment in place but today's figures on business investment show that it is growing strongly, with capital expenditure increasing by eight per cent in real terms in the June quarter, with this strong investment growth driven by a broadly based 14 per cent increase in expenditure on equipment, with investment in equipment now at its highest level since the September quarter 1990. The conditions are in place and that investment, as we said it would, is now coming to be put in place.

         The labour market firmed appreciably over the last financial year, with private sector vacancies rising to their highest levels since 1989 and 200,000 new jobs being created between September last year and June this year. The current account deficit grew only marginally. The manufacturing sector performed well in 1993-94, with output growing by around 10 per cent and exports by about 18 per cent. Net foreign debt has declined from 41 1/2 per cent as a proportion of GDP in mid-1993 to an estimated 38 1/2 per cent in the middle of this year. There are few signs at all of any actual pick-up in the rate of inflation, with the headline inflation under two per cent now over the last two years and underlying inflation around two per cent for the past three years, with the impetus for price increases from labour costs remaining extremely subdued and good overall productivity performance offsetting earnings growth and contributing to that outcome.

It has certainly not been the case on any of the trade missions with which I have been associated that the business participants have been other than hardworking and diligent on behalf of the shareholders they have represented.

         As far as working diligently on behalf of the people they represent, I think the depiction is dead wrong. The business people who have travelled with me on trade missions and trade fairs, and people with whom we have had subsequent consultation, have indicated that they value the opportunity to participate, provided the trade missions and trade fairs are well structured and well focused—as was the trade mission associated with Australia Today, Indonesia. Over 300 went on that trade mission and I think it was the biggest body of Australian companies ever to travel overseas. There was great Indonesian interest and enthusiasm for the associated business forum. Far from not being a positive contribution, over 650 Indonesian business people attended and established important networking opportunities for Australian business.

         It is difficult to quantify the trade benefits that flow from those missions because they occur in a context of other activity, and businesses are not always enthusiastic about telling the world and their competitors about the details of contracts into which they are entering or thinking of entering. But, from the consultations that have already taken place, we are aware that, as a result of the business mission to Indonesia associated with Australia Today, Indonesia, $180 million of firm new business between Australia and Indonesia has been signed. That means good exports and good jobs for Australians providing those products. At least another $230 million of new business is almost finalised, and businesses are indicating to us confidence in that.

We have not been able to consult with every business, and of course many of the contacts that were made will take much longer than this short period to come to fulfilment. But we already have $410 million worth of established or reasonably firm business signed, which means extra exports for Australia and extra jobs for ordinary Australian men and women working in the factories and service industries of Australia and seeking to provide opportunities for their families. They are getting a better opportunity to do so. The benefit is to the Australian economy and to those farming, manufacturing and service families working in small and large enterprises around Australia.

According to the most recent update this morning, the New South Wales crop is expected to be about 20 per cent of last year's crop. It will be about a million tonnes instead of about five million tonnes last year. The Australian Wheat Board initially downgraded the national estimates on the wheat crop from 18 million tonnes last year to 12 1/2 million tonnes this year, and has now further downgraded it to 11-plus million tonnes. Fortunately, Western Australian farmers in the last few weeks have received some very helpful rain. I was talking to Senator Panizza about this privately yesterday.

         This initiative by the government has prevented tax avoidance. Essentially, employee share acquisition schemes were being given to senior executives and highly paid employees of companies, often on the basis that their tax liability was deferred until retirement in order to minimise their tax payments; and the shares did not have to relate to the particular company that employed them, but could relate to the shares of other companies. The changes the government has introduced are to overcome both of those things. That is an appropriate and responsible action by the government.

         The changes announced in the budget will subject remuneration provided to employees through employee share acquisition plans to fringe benefits tax in the same way as other forms of non-cash remuneration but with two important exceptions, which should be noted. Employees taking up shares in their employer company will be able to utilise a $500 per year tax exemption or a $1,500 per year tax deferral for up to 10 years. That is, employees will be able to receive $500 per employee per year in the form of shares tax free or obtain a tax deferral of $1,500 of shares per year per employee. Secondly, these concession schemes will be subject to a range of conditions to ensure that they improve workplace productivity.

         Giving shares to senior executives and highly paid employees does not enhance workplace productivity or improve the industrial relations situation in a company. It does not give employees in a company a sense of ownership and control of their company. But the changes we have made will be conducive to that. In particular, the concessional tax arrangements will be available so long as the shares are those of the employer company and they are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees equally. I am not sure I have answered all the questions I was asked, but I think I have covered most of the ground in the questions by Senator Spindler.

         The Government is aware of the increasing cost of medical indemnity particularly in relation to some specialities and GPs who practise obstetrics. These increases have related directly to a move by Medical Defence Organisations (MDOs) away from a single common contribution rate (mutuality) towards a specialty type of risk rating, at the same time as MDOs have attempted to improve the level of funding of past liabilities. These liabilities occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the frequency and size of claims did increase dramatically but contributions were not adjusted to meet this liability.

         Data do not show a significant decline in the number of specialist obstetricians in recent years as medical defence premiums have increased. However, there has been a continuation of the long term reduction in the number of GPs providing birthing services. In the period from 1988 to 1992, during which time there was a dramatic rise in the cost of indemnity, there was a decline of 732 in the number of practitioners delivering babies in the private sector—687 of these were GPs. This trend is of particular concern for rural areas where access to specialist obstetricians is limited.

      <para>
       As to (a), the government, consistent with extensive past practice, has no intention—Senator Alston will be unsurprised to hear—of producing the advice prepared by the Attorney-General's Department for the Treasury. As the Attorney-General said in the House:

        Let me take this opportunity, however, to say that there is no lack of certainty about the formal constitutional powers of parliament to order the production of documents, nor about the ability of a house to enforce its orders or those of its committees. What is in issue is whether such powers should be exercised when there is a conflict on whether particular documents should be produced, and that is ultimately a matter of politics, not of law.

        Let me briefly go through the main points. Firstly, section 49 of the constitution enables this parliament to declare its privileges, but subject to such declaration—for example, as in the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987—that the privileges of this parliament are those that applied in the House of Commons in 1901. Secondly, those privileges clearly included the right to institute inquiries and to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.

        Thirdly, they also included the right to regulate its own internal affairs and procedures free of interference of the courts and the right to punish by committal persons guilty of breaches of its privileges or other contempts. Fourthly, although in this parliament we have made some variations to the 1901 regime—for example, by abolishing contempts by defamation in section 6 of the 1987 act and the power to expel a member from membership of the house in section 8 of that act—and while we have required specification of the `cause' or the reason for any penalty of imprisonment imposed by a house and made provision for the consequent review of that by the courts, the legal powers of the parliament to order the production of documents and to enforce such an order, ultimately by imprisonment, remain in all their glory.

        The second last point is that those legal luminaries, Attorney-General Senator Ivor Greenwood QC and Solicitor-General Bob Ellicott QC, dealt with this issue very well in their paper tabled in October 1972. They said:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The power of the Commons to order all documents to be laid before it which were necessary for its information was unquestioned . . .

       And again:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . although the power was absolute, the House of Commons did recognise by its practice that it should not require the production of documents in all cases . . .

       Then again:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Because the power of Parliament to require the production of documents and the giving of evidence is, for practical purposes, unlimited, the extent to which a House requires the giving or production of executive information will necessarily rest on convention.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       That is the Greenwood and Ellicott paper of October 1972. In that paper, Greenwood and Ellicott addressed the issues raised by the case of Conway v. Rimmer; but, in the end, concluded:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       On this matter it is not easy to express a view which will satisfy the varying points of view on the question of the desirability of making executive information available. However, against the background of a system which is based on party Government and the responsibility of Ministers to parliament, we think the preferable course is to continue the practice of treating the Minister's certificate as conclusive.
      </para>
      <para>
       They noted that, in making such decisions, ministers would have regard to `the two aspects of public interest involved, that is to say, the public interest in withholding certain information and the public interest in Parliament and its Houses being adequately informed'. Although the Greenwood and Ellicott paper predated Sankey v. Whitlam—that well-known court case addressing the issue of the court's willingness to look at this kind of case—that does not take away from their conclusions, in particular the conclusion that the issues we are dealing with relate to convention, not law.

        Last of all I want to mention the definitive report on this whole subject—the final report of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege tabled in October 1984 which, I emphasise, was very much a bipartisan effort. We—and I say `we' because I was a member of that committee—looked hard at the implications of the case of Sankey v. Whitlam, in which the High Court asserted its rights to examine documents in dispute in litigation. We looked at the mechanisms adopted in some other parliaments and concluded that they were unacceptable. We considered the government guidelines for official witnesses but, in the end, concluded in the following terms—as I recall, it is paragraph 9.15:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       However ingenious, guidelines can only reduce the areas of contention: they can never be eliminated. This follows from the different functions, the inherent characteristics, and the differing interests of Parliament and the Executive. In the nature of things it is impossible to devise any means of eliminating contention between the two without one making major and unacceptable concessions to the other. It is theoretically possible that some third body could be appointed to adjudicate between the two. But the political reality is that neither would find this acceptable. We therefore think that the wiser course is to leave to Parliament and the Executive the resolution of clashes in this quintessentially political field.

       I am grateful to the minister for finally coming clean and acknowledging the sordid reality that this is indeed simply a stark political exercise. For months we had the pretence that the government had a legal justification for what it was doing—that somehow it had contrary legal opinion which presumably would explain, or throw some light on, the reasons why it maintained that public interest immunity applied in this instance, or the extent to which the powers of the committee were limited.

        Senator Evans is now telling us that it is simply an exercise in naked power—the government is the government and, therefore, it has no obligation to justify itself other than, as he describes it, saying that it was a matter of politics. That is not a good enough explanation. One might as well say that Mr Keating's secret deal with Conrad Black, or at least unilateral promise of favours, was a matter of politics. That is in no sense a justification or an explanation of the true nature of public interest. That is what this ought to be all about.

I said that the rapid deterioration in the performance of ANL over the past year was due to those factors. I went on to say, `The company's poor performance has come about from deteriorating results in the company's presence in the Europe and north east Asia liner shipping trades. For example'—and Senator Alston referred to it—`$18 million of the projected $25 million loss in shipping for 1993-94 came over the last six months.

         What I said to the Senate was that the performance has been bad over the last year and that $18 million had been lost in the last six months. What I was referring to was the deteriorating condition of the company's losses, their bottom line. Some people in the company have contended—and I can understand why they have done it; they want to put the best face on it they can—that the reason for that deterioration was that there was a loss in the company's goodwill caused by the government's announcement of the sale and the government's announcement of the due diligence process.

         Senator Alston should at least bother to read the whole speech or perhaps even half a dozen paragraphs each side of the marked paragraph that he just reiterated like a parrot. He would see that what Mr Brereton said totally supports and confirms what I said in the Senate. As I said before, I can understand why people in the company would want to put that view, but I agree with Mr Brereton. It has not been due, sadly, to any loss in the goodwill of the company—in other words, their customers not dealing with them any more because the government has announced a trade sale and a due diligence process. It has unfortunately been due to the very conditions that I pointed out; in other words, conditions, as I told the Senate, beyond the company's control.

That is correct. But, in the view of the minister—and I support his contention—it has not been due to a reduction in the value of the goodwill, that is, the traditional customers of ANL staying away from it and not dealing with it. I say to Senator Alston that that is what goodwill is. Perhaps Senator Baume can explain it to him. It is not as a result of the government's due diligence process.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day, relating to the Australian National Line.

        It is interesting to note that Senator Collins, as always, does not want to hear an answer from someone who has the temerity to respond to him. We got used to this during the pay TV debate. The louder and more abusive he got, the more we knew he was on the back foot. Now he has left the chamber; obviously he will never learn.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I will make a couple of brief points. Senator Collins seemed to say—in a remarkably incoherent fashion—that somehow goodwill has nothing to do with the level of losses. He then sought to invoke Senator Baume as one who would correct me in terms of the definition of `goodwill'. I know that Senator Collins failed law, but I would have thought that he might know a bit more about accounting. He claimed that goodwill was effectively the level of customer demand. That is an extraordinary proposition. For the record, and for Senator Collins's benefit, Senator Baume would define `goodwill' as `the difference between book value and market value'.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It ought to be a fairly obvious proposition—even to Senator Collins—that if a company sustains a dramatic increase in losses, the value of that company is thereby reduced. After all, if it is a high profit earner, it is worth more. People will pay for all of those things that contribute to goodwill—whether it is a brand name or something else. It is usually the bottom line above all else.

         The value of the company is crucially dependent upon its profit level. If it has deteriorating sales, if its revenue is down and its expenses are up, the bottom line will be affected. When there is a dramatic increase in losses to the point where $18 million out of $25 million occurs over a period of six months, I would have thought that it was blindingly self-evident that that must lead to a commensurate deterioration in the value of the corporation.

         There is no question of my staff not doing the work on this one; we examined this carefully before I came into the chamber. I had this quote before me when I asked Senator Collins my question—unlike Senator Collins, who claimed to have sought advice from others, but clearly had not bothered to refer to what Mr Brereton had said because he said that he would check it. Mr Brereton said:

        He is clearly saying that the losses have been there for a long period and at pretty much the same level and, therefore, goodwill has not deteriorated rapidly. What is so interestingly coincidental about all of this is that the Brereton thesis just happens to coincide nicely with the period when he was not the Minister for Transport. In other words, if nothing much has happened over the last six months that he has been in charge, it is clearly the fault of his predecessor—Senator Collins.

One does not have to be too smart to work out what is motivating each of them, but the fact is that there is an absolutely irreconcilable difference between the propositions that each has advanced to the Senate.

         In the spirit of the charity that Senator Collins advanced, I do not accuse him of deliberately misleading the Senate either. I simply say that his appalling lack of understanding of accountancy should be no excuse for not being prepared to take a considered view of the matter. Accordingly, it is a matter of regret that he simply has to resort to abuse in the way that he does. We are used to it. We have seen this over a period of years. We know that the more he does it and the more bluster and aggression he shows, the more likely it is that he does not have much to fall back on. But that, in itself, is no excuse. All I can say is that he ought to spend a bit more time reflecting on the issue. He should get some decent outside advice and come back into the Senate next week and give us a real explanation of the discrepancy.

         —I rise to support Senator Alston in outlining how little Senator Collins—if only he were here—understands about the real world, and how little he certainly understands about the word `goodwill'. I suppose most people would not think of applying that word to him or to the way he has administered his various disaster departments over the last few years. The fact is that this company, ANL, has an item called `goodwill' in its balance sheet under the heading, `Intangibles: Goodwill on consolidation: Less accumulated amortisation', and the net figure is $2.24 million.

         In that particular instance, this particular goodwill and consolidation means the excess of the cost price of those assets over their book value. That is a specific and clear statement. Goodwill is the excess, if you like, in this case, of the cost over book value. It is, in this instance, a clear and precise accounting principle. When we pay goodwill for a company, we are paying more than the book value of that company says it is worth. It is the difference between the book value and the market value, as Senator Alston quite properly said.

         When Senator Collins uses the word loosely, as I believe he wants to, I presume that he means something else; and I am not quite certain what it is. I think he means the goodwill of the customers in the sense that they are still prepared to use ANL—with, I might say, diminishing rewards to ANL. He means that the customers are still prepared to use ANL. That is not what `goodwill' in any financial sense means. We can see as a clear example of goodwill how nonsensical it can be and how it can evaporate, as Senator Alston said—

         —Exactly. If the company is doing well, people are prepared to pay more than the book value of the assets to acquire it. If it is doing very badly, as ANL is, there may be a negative goodwill; one would be able to buy the assets for less than their book value. That is the essence of the point that Senator Alston has been trying to get through the fairly strong and significant incompetence and lack of comprehension of the minister. This is very worrying. Here we have a minister who is supposed to be in charge of this government business enterprise and who does not understand how businesses work. I understand now why, given admittedly the stimulus of drought, he managed to do so badly as a rural businessman.

         We can see very clearly the impact and significance of goodwill and how ephemeral it can be. When Mr John Brown, for example, effectively sold his piggeries to Mr Keating, there was a $4 1/2 million goodwill element in it. In other words, Mr Keating bought what could be loosely be described as a pig in a poke. The company structure that he bought involved $4 1/2 million worth of goodwill. No-one, after that group's years of losses, would say that that goodwill exists. In fact, the directors themselves have been steadily writing it down each year.

         Let us get this clear: there is no doubt that over recent years the goodwill element—in other words, the preparedness of people to buy ANL at a higher price than the value of its assets—would have deteriorated to a situation where it is now reported that it could be sold only for a lot less than its book value and, in other words, has massive negative goodwill. Everything that Senator Alston said was exactly right. What Senator Collins said was, I presume, the result of incompetence and ignorance. I hope that it was not the result of his knowing what it was and setting out deliberately to mislead the Senate.

        I had asked Senator Collins whether he would take responsibility, and I notice that he is not prepared to take enough responsibility to be in here to hear the proper reply to his improper response and respond to the debate. I asked him whether he would do the decent thing and take responsibility for the catastrophic collapse of ANL. I asked that of him because he keeps on saying that the inability to sell ANL is because of deteriorating problems internationally and that everyone is suffering. But he then goes on to say, `And in particular, in the last six months.' In that case, let us have a look at why nothing was done. I ask: why was nothing done for so many years? Why was nothing done after the 1991 budget statement? That states:

         The fact is that it now appears, from everything that Senator Collins has said, that this 1991 budget announcement was phoney, that the government had no capacity or intention to sell ANL at that time. We know perfectly well that the government knew what the loss level was at the time. I believe that Senator Collins—I think this is now evident from what we have seen here—simply put in the 1991 budget something that was incapable of happening. In order to dress up that budget he put in a receipt that was never capable of being achieved. That kind of deception is intolerable.

        This parliament has every right to ask: why did the minister not do something about this when he had the chance to sell ANL? Was it because the unions would not let him?

         —The dire shortage of general practitioners in rural and regional Australia is an issue that must be addressed substantially in a bipartisan fashion. All governments and health professionals must work to help solve this ongoing crisis. Today, over 40 per cent of medical students seek to be specialists. The dissatisfaction with general practice is widespread and entrenched. This dissatisfaction is most clearly demonstrated in rural Australia, where little more than 10 per cent of Australia's GPs service 30 per cent of Australia's population. The expert view is not that we do not have enough doctors; it is just that they are not where they are needed.

         What are the causes of this decline? There are three main reasons. The first is social isolation, especially for those brought up in metropolitan areas. The second is professional isolation, and the third is the level of remuneration obtained by rural GPs. All three factors intertwine.

         On social isolation, there is the difficulty of finding suitable employment for spouses, the difficulty of making new friends, and the isolation of families when they are used to greater opportunities elsewhere. Doctors, like policemen and even politicians, are never off duty. A visit to a pub or a club always means free professional advice to their fellow drinkers. There is the lack of appeal that rural Australia might initially have for young women doctors, who now make up about 50 per cent of medical students. There is the problem that there are virtually no holidays because of the difficulties of acquiring a locum. There is often a limited choice of education for a doctor's children and the substantial extra cost of boarding, which may be the only option available to them. Generally, there are the distances involved—the impact of the tyranny of distance so understood by all of us who live outside the metropolitan areas in this country.

         Professional isolation is felt by rural GPs. It is very difficult for a medical education to prepare GPs for the professional isolation and emergencies they often face alone. The level of income for country GPs may not be commensurate, often for working 24 hours a day. This occurs for a couple of reasons. GPs get proportionally a lower percentage of the medical dollar compared with specialists and country GPs are doing less procedural work. In other words, they are not delivering babies or fixing broken legs as often as they used to, because of the move towards specialisation in medicine. This increased amount of consultation in general practice provides for a lower income. Overall, for them to provide to their families the sort of standard of living they would be able to provide elsewhere means that there is a requirement for a substantial financial incentive in addition to everything else.

         There are a number of possible solutions. The rural incentive program, which subsidies a doctor's move to a country area, should be made more attractive. Medical schools could allocate a percentage of their annual intakes to students from rural backgrounds, but this has obvious problems. Now, with the introduction of pre-medical degrees beginning at Sydney and Flinders universities, there may be a way to address this imbalance. Doctors can be encouraged into the bush through specific rural training. A good example is the Tamworth rural doctors training unit, which is doing just this in its four-year vocational training program for rural general practice. It is a first for New South Wales and the second such unit in Australia, for which the people involved deserve rich praise. There are 13 young doctors training at Tamworth at this time, out of a total of 20 in the state.

         There is now a national association of 10 to 12 rural training units, with units also at Wagga and Dubbo in New South Wales, and 85 young doctors Australia wide. This is being expanded. I am not saying that all these doctors will stay in country areas. However, overseas experience has shown that more of them will stay in general rural practice after experiencing country life during their training period. It becomes very attractive to some.

         On another front, there should be increased funding for locum schemes to allow overworked rural GPs to take a break for extra training or just a holiday. Unfortunately, there is a belief that market forces will push GPs out to country areas. This has not happened. We have to ensure that people making decisions in relation to rural health policy know what they are about. The problem must be approached systematically.

        Intertwined with this issue of rural health is the need for uniform state and federal legislation to address the ballooning medical indemnity costs.

If we do not do something about rural GPs, country people will continue to suffer. The system is not equitable, and the only saviour might be to have the flying doctor servicing a large part of the inland, not only our outback, as part of our folklore.

         —I think this debate today is interesting. That might be the best way I can describe it. Senator Sandy Macdonald has worded his call for a matter of public importance in a curious way, but I presume he is concerned about the declining number rather than just noting it. I take that from the tenor of what he has been saying.

         I think it is always timely to talk and think about what is happening in various regions of Australia, particularly rural Australia. The point Senator Macdonald raised about general practitioners in rural Australia is well worth our thinking about, particularly in the light of what the government has done, is doing and will continue to do to restructure general practice and assist doctors to either return to general practice in rural Australia or consider moving out there and taking it up.

         I do not think it is possible to talk about health care in rural and regional Australia without talking about allied health professionals. The government wants to contribute to this debate this afternoon by my making some more generalised comments and commenting on particular details of the funding. Then Senator West will take up the issue of allied health professionals and, very high on the list, the great contribution to good health care in rural Australia of the nurse, and Senator Murphy will follow by picking up Senator Macdonald's points about other matters, including indemnity.

         All of those are very important issues—there is no doubt about it—but it is also important to recognise that the government has known this, accepted it and addressed it. In fact, Senator Macdonald can raise many of the issues and points that he did precisely because this government has actually already put funding into them.

         It is true, first of all, that the number of medical practitioners in rural areas is in fact not declining but has stabilised. There was a slight increase in the number of doctors in rural and regional Australia in the early 1980s. In fact, that figure has not changed terribly much since 1984, but it is certainly not declining. We have an insufficiency of general practitioners—I think everyone would agree that it would be better if there were more doctors—but, as Senator Macdonald has already said, we cannot force doctors to go into rural or regional Australia. This government has recognised the problem and is providing a number of different kinds of incentives.

         I cannot, in the time available to me, cover all the points Senator Macdonald has raised, but I think it is important to recognise that we need data and facts about the numbers of doctors and the services that are being performed in these areas. We have to recognise that there are relocation grants, one-off incentive grants of $20,000 to GPs to assist with the relocation. Also, there are training grants, individually based grants of up to $50,000 for relocating GPs—particularly to rural areas but also to very remote areas.

         I think it is important to know that under this scheme two doctors have gone recently to Utopia and Kintore. Indeed, for the record, I believe these are the places visited by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, in recent times. Perhaps he forgot to come back and give that piece of information to Senator Macdonald. But it is important to know that those relocations are happening. In fact, the relocation grants, the training grants, are making a great contribution to those changes. Those people are moving out there.

         It is interesting to note whether it is just money. I am not sure, but I think Senator Macdonald alluded to the training of doctors and whether or not they have the confidence and the skills to practise some of the procedures and other things that are required of a general practitioner—all the way from setting bones and attending car accidents to delivering babies and so on. A lot of doctors and medical students have reported that they are not sure they would like to be left to do those things in an area where they did not have somebody down the phone that they could ring up or refer to, either for themselves for professional assistance or for the patient. This puts a tremendous pressure on doctors and students and I think it is actually one of the things that are now being addressed, perhaps not sufficiently, in undergraduate courses.

         So we do want to pick up a number of things to encourage doctors to return to or go to rural and regional Australia. One is seeing whether we can select medical students from those areas or encourage people from those areas to consider taking up medicine. Another is changing some of the undergraduate teaching and focus so that all of the students coming out of our medical schools have that kind of new confidence and a wider range of skills.

         As for medical indemnity, the points Senator Sandy Macdonald raises are important, and the answer incorporated today addresses most of those issues. I find it very interesting that, at the same time as the number of doctors providing obstetric care is significantly declining, we have a very significant resistance to alternative carers, particularly midwives, who have been able to provide very adequate delivery care. That has not been taken up in very significant numbers, at least in a number of places. Indeed, it is being fought rigorously by the college of obstetricians and gynaecologists.

         So we have a solution that may well pick up one of the problems of care in terms of having assistance for parents, particularly women, at the time of delivery, but that is being resisted. The doctors seem to be saying, `We do not want to do it, there is a danger that we could be sued, there are very large costs entailed and we are not sure about the competence,' while down the road there are nurses and midwives who are saying, `We are very comfortable doing it,' yet they are being opposed and resisted.

         One of the interesting things about this has been the federal government's response through incentives: the relocation and training grants, the remote area grants, the continual medical education and particularly—this is the other point Senator Macdonald mentioned—the importance of a good locum service. We cannot have doctors who do not have that confidence. It might be an even greater requirement for those doctors who are just going to drop into a practice without necessarily knowing that local community and so on. The locum service for rural Australia is a very big challenge, I think. The government is picking up and addressing that, along with undergraduate support.

         I believe there is a need for recognition, as Senator Macdonald said in relation to programs in New South Wales, by doctors themselves that they have to change their thinking, approach and attitude. There is evidence that those things are changing a whole lot. I know that in my own state there are very significant incentives for doctors to relocate all the way to Port Pirie. Some people would say that Port Pirie does not even deserve the title of rural and regional. It might be regional, but it is not too rural or isolated. So far there is nobody prepared to make that move while, on the face of it, the financial incentives are very significant indeed.

         It is also very clear that we cannot do this without the cooperation of the medical profession. I have been around over the last 11 years, since the medical profession was definitely against us, digging little trenches around the place and not wanting to talk to government at all. It is since we have got rural doctors, the AMA and government working at trying to get the best outcome that we have seen those changes, the best cooperation.

         I think the rural general practice changes fit very well with the restructuring of general practice across urban as well as rural Australia. I think these are the things we need to encourage. We are talking about a different kind of doctor, a more confident and more skilled doctor, and one I hope who has no trouble at all working with his or her professional colleagues out there—in particular, the great nursing profession, which has been out there when the doctors have been inclined to leave. While Senator Macdonald does well to draw attention to a challenging problem, I am delighted to have the opportunity to tell him that the government has known about it, has been talking about it and is addressing it.

         —I too have taken a strong personal interest in the declining number of general practitioners prepared to practise in rural Australia, and I thank Senator Sandy Macdonald for bringing the matter before us today. It is a matter on which I have spent considerable time over the last 2 1/2 years. I have travelled extensively in rural South Australia, and in particular I have talked to GPs, specialists, specialist doctors, hospital administrators and directors of nursing, as well as to people in hospitals and health centres.

         In my home state of South Australia over the last three years we have managed to bring the vacancies for doctors down from 30 to 25. The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) has given us some examples of how the federal government has been working to help in this regard, one example being rural practice grants. In particular I commend those working at Modbury Hospital in the rural practice unit. There is certainly a lot being done in South Australia but unfortunately we are barely holding the tide. We are looking at a situation where many doctors are approaching if not retirement age then certainly burnout age. They are looking forward to greater periods of time with growing families and also to greater leisure time for themselves.

         As Senator Sandy Macdonald has already said, Australia-wide we have somewhere between 400 and 500 vacancies for general practitioners that cannot be filled. At the same time we remain in a situation in some suburban areas—my home state, the eastern suburbs of Adelaide, for example—where we are well and truly over-supplied with doctors. It is not just a rural problem. In Adelaide's northern and southern suburbs there is also a drastic shortage both of doctors who are prepared to practise there and locums who are prepared to go there to fill in.

         This is not a problem we can simply lay at the feet of federal government. I emphasise the role that a couple of state governments are playing in this area. Shaking the foundations of rural hospitals is perhaps the quickest way to make sure that doctors do not want to go to rural areas and also do not want to stay. The closing of rural hospitals has already occurred in my home state, and it is a problem, but there is also the threatened downgrading, downsizing and underskilling of rural hospitals. I recently visited a hospital where there is only one nurse on duty at night. The stress on the nursing staff as well as on the medical practitioner can best be described as extreme.

         As Senator Crowley has already said, this really does not come down to just money. In some parts of South Australia we are looking at packages where up to a quarter of a million dollars has been offered for a doctor to practice there. We are looking at rural communities offering housing and family incentives such as support for the children to go away to school, but still they cannot get a doctor. From surveys of doctors, both those practising in rural Australia as well as those who do not want to go there, we see a list of problems which includes the inability to get locum relief; the lack of opportunities for spouses in regard to employment; social isolation of the spouses; and also their own future medical education as they are worried they will never be able to get away to upgrade or update their skills. There are also concerns about their current levels of expertise.

         I will return to this later on, but there is a problem with trying to attract the right quality of doctor into rural Australia. There is also concern about educational opportunities for doctors' children, particularly post-primary education.

         So what are some of the possible solutions? In the four minutes I have left I will briefly run through a few of them. In regard to training schemes, I will look at what is happening at Modbury and at other suggestions for supporting rural students to study medicine. It is a great idea but with the rural crisis many students out there cannot get Austudy and, if they can get Austudy, their families still cannot afford six or seven years of income and housing support for them to go and study medicine, despite the fact they have the points at matriculation. We are looking here at some sort of Commonwealth program that will either offer scholarships or some other level of support for rural students who have the qualifications but not the finance to study medicine.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Whilst I do not support these kinds of suggestions, I think we need to run through them. It has been suggested to me that we may need to change the immigration laws to enable doctors from other countries to fill some of the vacancies. One of my problems here is that we are often attracting doctors who are desperately needed—often in rural and remote areas—in their own countries to meet a problem here that we should be able to solve ourselves.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Then we can move to specific Commonwealth action as opposed to just offering incentives. We need to have a very close look at what state governments are doing with rural hospitals. Yes, that might mean taking over the funding of some of these hospitals. If that is what it means, so be it, if we are to ensure services in rural areas.

However, we have to face the fact that we are barely stemming the tide. We are treading water in most states. In some states, such as in the Northern Territory, we are not able to do that.

         Australian taxpayers are contributing to the education of these people, in many cases for seven or eight years, and all taxpayers are entitled to benefit from the kind of money we are putting into medical students. I think we would have to say that there is a limit to how much taxpayers' money one can look to by way of incentives and grants. Perhaps we could start to look at the possibility of bond schemes or other ways by which we could directly tie doctors after graduation to a set number of years in rural areas.

         Following on from the minister's comment about a basket of services, perhaps greater authority should be given to nurses to prescribe certain drugs or to conduct certain medical treatments without medical supervision.

Hopefully if that is successful we will see an immediate spread of those opportunities across rural Australia.

         I guess this is fairly controversial, but there is also the possibility of allocating some Medicare numbers. Rather than allow doctors to come out of college and decide they want to set up in Toorak, Paddington or somewhere else, they should simply be told very clearly that there are no vacancies in those suburbs. It is done in the cases of teachers and other professionals. We have to look at Medicare provider numbers as a last resort if we cannot get doctors into these areas. Some of these are not terribly palatable solutions, but I think we are fast reaching the point where we have to acknowledge that the free market and the incentives have not worked and that if we are to get medical services into areas of Australia that critically need them then the Commonwealth government really has to take some action.

Approximately 30 per cent of Australia's population lives outside the capital cities, and that population is serviced by 10 per cent of doctors. There are 4,600 general practitioners in rural and remote areas.

         Similarly to the other states that have been quoted by honourable senators, Victoria needs somewhere between 60 to 100 rural GPs. There are between 200 and 500 vacancies for rural general practitioners in Australia simply by way of placements and replacements. Medical schools should aim for something like 40 per cent of all graduates to take up a rural career to replace doctors who are either moving into retirement or who are not taking up those placements to start with. Not only that, the average age of general practitioners already in rural practice is rising. For instance, in my own home area of south-west Victoria 30 per cent of general practitioners are over the age of 55. We can only ask: `In 10 or 20 years, who will replace them?'

While I applaud and recognise the package of health services that is provided by the health professionals mentioned by Senator Crowley, it will never replace the ideal of a doctor. Why do not medical graduates want to go to the country or, indeed, stay there? The attrition rate is something like 20 per cent within five years of arrival. So even when medical graduates get there, they do not stay for very long.

There are few students in current medical schools with  rural backgrounds and, as has already been pointed out, country students are at a disadvantage in getting there.

         What has the government done? Senator Crowley has already mentioned the rural incentives scheme and I will not bother to go over the details of that. However, it should be evident that money by itself is not enough to overcome the disadvantages of rural life for GPs and their families. Some of the measures introduced to correct the oversupply, such as the limitation of entry of overseas-trained graduates, have adversely affected rural communities which relied on this source for temporary relief and locums.

         It is acknowledged by the medical community itself that financial incentives alone will not work. The rural incentives scheme is largely paying those to relocate who will relocate anyway, and not enough general practitioners are taking up the offer. I gather that there is still $23 million in the kitty for this year and that only 23 doctors nationally have taken up the offer. That will not go far in addressing the shortage that I referred to earlier. It is not working, but there has been no appropriate evaluation to show why it is not working.

         It may be more hopeful to look to those entrants to medical schools who originally came from the country. A University of Newcastle study has preliminary data which suggests that students from rural origins are more likely to make their careers in rural locations than those who grew up in the cities. In addition, as has already been canvassed, incentives could be provided to secondary rural students to get into medical school in the hope that they would then return to the country.

         From a long-term point of view, the answer is to change  prevalent cultural attitudes in Australia. Doctors and aspiring doctors should be educated to realise that there are attractions to life in rural Australia, and rural communities need to do all in their power to retain services. In my voluntary community worker career, I have observed with interest the power struggles and disagreements that can occur on hospital boards. This can be the last thing an overworked GP needs at the end of a long, hard day.

         As I mentioned, another key long-term strategy could be more appropriate selection criteria by universities and an understanding of and interest in rural issues by graduates. The government has signalled, by the volume of money it has thrown at these sorts of programs, that it is serious about tackling the problem, but the mere provision of money is not working. The government should take a close look at what it is doing, see why it is not working and set up programs in conjunction with professional organisations which hopefully will make some of these programs work. We must stop the drift of doctors to the cities from the country and we should look at initiatives designed to promote rural practice as an attractive and rewarding option for future general practitioners.

         This is a very important issue. It has been a very important issue for at least 30 years. It is 30 years this year since I left school and started nursing in a country town. In the country town I lived in there were six or seven GPs. There is still that same number today. Over that 30 years, surrounding country communities have had the problem of getting doctors to come to and stay in their towns. As has been said, many communities have instituted a number of very generous schemes and proposals to assist doctors to practise in their towns. There have been income guarantees. Accommodation has been provided next door to the local hospital. Every effort is made to provide all the assistance that is necessary to attract doctors.

         The training levels of doctors has been briefly mentioned. They may well spend one or two sessions away from the large teaching hospital with which as students and interns they were associated but they keep going back to those areas. When doctors finally finish their internship they know very clearly the drug regime for a cardiac transplant. But they are not quite so sure and confident when it comes to looking at a small child who is unwell with perhaps a case of otitis media and glue ear because those things do not come into the teaching hospitals and, if they do, they go to the children's hospitals.

         Whilst I am not being critical of the doctors for feeling that inadequacy, I would feel it myself if that was the situation with which I had to deal. It is something that has to be addressed. We also have to ensure that the universities look at how they provide these services. Also we must support and congratulate universities like Newcastle, which is not just looking at the HSC and TE score results but at the whole person, and Sydney University which is looking at people who might not have got such a wonderful TE score in the HSC, but who have actually gone on and got a graduate degree, to enter medicine. These are the sorts of people who will provide us with good medicine and want to be not just the professorial students and professorial residents and registrars but who will have a commitment to the average person out there, to the family out there who wants someone who will observe them and care for them as a whole family unit.

Doctors, of course, are quite competent in treating the sorts of things Senator West mentioned, like glue ear. Senator West does not seem to be aware that there are family medicine training programs without which one cannot become a GP. What does she think those focus on—cardiac transplants in the back room? For goodness sake, she should get up-to-date. She should really get her feet on the ground as well.

         I clearly understand what Senator West is saying—that there is no doctor in Adaminaby, which has a population of 300 or 400. There is also no social worker, counsellor, occupational therapist, speech therapist, physiotherapist and dietitian, and no railway and youth and community services department. This is a community of a few hundred people. Is Senator West seriously suggesting that such a community would have that? Of course not—that is in Cooma, which is 30 to 40 kilometres away, and that is the problem. One can have those things in Cooma but one cannot actually have those things on site when it comes to the day-to-day needs of a small community like that, which is one of the nicest communities in the world.

         There seems to be broad agreement about the problem. To my knowledge, the government—to use Senator Crowley's expression—has been addressing it since 1990. Although I liked her expression, `We now have rural doctors and the AMA et cetera to focus on this.' In all honesty, I have to point out that it was the rural doctors who got not only the government but also the opposition, to be equally fair about it, to focus upon a major problem. So it was something which the profession actually did raise and has been very active in raising ever since.

         What are the numbers? Of metropolitan GPs, around 15,000 care for 13 million people; that is one per 800 people. In the rural area there are 3,000 GPs caring for five million people; that is almost double, or perhaps slightly more than double—one GP for 1,650 people. Clearly, as Senator West said, there is a maldistribution problem rather than a shortage overall. There is no question that we would all agree with that. Nonetheless, I am not sure I would find a doctor on every corner but, still, Senator West was accurate in other regards.

So there is a major problem which may, as Senator West said, have been going on for 30 years but, certainly, is a problem now which is escalating out of control. Whichever area of expertise one asks in that regard, they will all agree that the problem is deteriorating.

         The question which nobody seems to have addressed yet is: does this matter? The answer, clearly, from a recent report published by the ANU entitled `Rural health outcomes' is yes. The only thing that really matters is whether people are sicker in given areas. Rural health outcomes are worse than metropolitan ones: there is a 90 per cent increase in female deaths from pneumonia and influenza; 50 per cent more diabetes; significantly more overweight and heavier smokers; a higher incidence of heart disease, cardiovascular accidents, genital-urinary diseases, respiratory diseases; and, indeed, they live shorter periods of life.

         Seventeen per cent of rural residents have significantly poorer outcomes in health terms. Sadly, there is a correlation with spending because less government money is spent in rural areas per capita. And this is without touching upon the details of one other major shame for Australia which is the terrible status of Aboriginal health, which we are only addressing peripherally here today. We have looked at some of the reasons. I think there is broad agreement about those reasons: the isolation for families and schooling for the children; the higher responsibility through being expected to be able to cope with the whole range of things that perhaps the metropolitan GPs are not expected to cope with; the lack of ongoing education; very importantly, the lack of locums; and again, as Senator West mentioned, the decline in available hospital support.

         Why are hospitals being closed? Senator West blithely blamed the states. However, she forgets that in fact the sizeable chunk of funding for public hospitals, large and small, is allocated by the federal government, and the federal government's share of that contribution has been reducing steadily since the entrance onto the scene of the Labor government. The decline in funds runs into billions of dollars, and that is why hospitals are having to be closed, and that is why the most inefficient ones, which are the ones in the country, are the ones which go first. If one is trying to run an efficient hospital system, sadly, those are the ones which have to go. If that funding is not restored by the Commonwealth government, those sorts of constraints will continue to occur.

         One of the issues raised earlier by Senator Sandy Macdonald was the question of litigation insurance, medical defence insurance by GPs. A document tabled earlier by Senator Crowley indicates that something like 687 GPs who used to deliver babies no longer deliver babies, and that is over a period of some three or four years. This relates to the rise in the cost of indemnity which next year, I believe, will be about $7,000 or $8,000 per GP. At that sort of level the GP has to deliver something like 30 babies, allowing for his overheads, before he even makes a cent on his Medicare rebate.

         What are the solutions? Clearly, we need more doctors in the area. How do we get them there? There are a number of key things, one of which is to get people from the bush to go to medical school. Senator Lees very sensibly touched upon one issue there: we need to make sure that in the current situation where drought is ravaging the bush families who want to send their children to medical school are not financially constrained from doing so. Adjustments to Austudy or the introduction of a similar allowance are very important issues for bush families

The New South Wales department under Ron Phillips has put in a few important initiatives. The rural doctors resource network as a way of supplying locums is a crucial incentive to have locums available to back-up these doctors. There are five rural health training units either established or being established around New South Wales. It is important to ensure that students do undergo electives and get a taste for some of the attractions and benefits of the system.

        Running in tandem with the Rural Incentive Package is General Practice restructuring which has led to the establishment of federally funded Divisions of General Practice throughout Australia based on regional considerations.

I think that deals with the issue as it relates to the areas of rural and remote country areas. It has been a major problem. Touching very briefly on Aboriginal health in rural and remote areas, I suggest that it may well be worth while looking at the number of doctors that actually have a rural background.

        To add insult to injury, between 1904 and 1906 many were deported under the white Australia policy. This policy was implemented as one of the first acts of the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia.

        Today's Australian South Sea Islanders are the descendants of this remnant community. We are not completely certain how many members make up the community but the report suggests there are 15,000 to 20,000 Australian South Sea Islanders. Many still live on the Queensland and northern New South Wales coast where their forebears sweated and strained to develop Australia's sugar industry.

The Report now provides the government with a census of the group and reports on the group's general socio-economic condition. It does not, however, establish which mainstream services the group accesses, which of those services are considered by the community to be culturally appropriate, and what information could be made available to assist Australian South Sea Islanders to access existing government services. Discussions with Australian South Sea Islander groups have also exposed a need for further consultation with the community.

         In order to assist agencies to develop mechanisms to serve Australian South Sea Islander community needs, basic information is required on how governments are currently providing services to these people, and where they are not, why not. A profile of cultural needs in service delivery must also be developed. The Government has decided to undertake a cross-portfolio research project to gather data on Australian South Sea Islanders in order to assist service delivery agencies in identifying their needs and in developing culturally appropriate mechanisms to begin meeting those needs. I am seeking to have an Australian non government organization undertake this research. My Department will jointly fund the research and a steering committee including members from the Department of Human Services and Health and the Department of Employment Education and Training, as well as the Office of Multicultural Affairs and my Department will oversee its progress. The Government will also consider how to best secure a better picture of the South Sea Islander community, including considering whether an ancestry question should be included in the 1996 census form.

The Manager, NSW Area West in the Department of Social Security has arranged for a comprehensive survey to be conducted to obtain data which accurately reflects the situation of Australian South Sea Islanders in that Area.

         POSITION/ACTION Supported. The government believes that completion of formal education is of great importance in overcoming the disadvantage suffered by individual Australian South Sea Islanders. Since Abstudy became available in the 1970's about one-third of Australian South Sea Islanders have received it while completing their education. Presently over 60% of 13-19 year old Australian South Sea Islanders report receiving it. Australian South Sea Islanders suffer very similar educational disadvantage to urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and Australian South Sea Islander people will be severely disadvantaged by the removal of the de facto access to Abstudy which they presently enjoy. I am proposing to defer consideration of the scholarship needs of Australian South Sea Islanders until the results of the new research project are known.

The Government should make a specific allocation in the 1993-94 Budget for the provision of culturally appropriate programs for Australian South Sea Islanders and organisations (such as programs to include housing, legal, child care and financial services). Community development workers could be employed through Grant-In-Aid type programs to liaise between South Sea Islanders and mainstream services, provide organisational assistance so that South Sea Islanders are better able to continue examination of their past and present situation, and present cogent arguments to governments for action as and where required.

         The first of these is the establishment of a Cultural Awareness Awards Scheme, to be funded under the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's International Cultural Relations Program, to assist Australians of South Sea Islanders descent to visit their countries of family origin in the South Pacific to research traditional customs and genealogy, and to use this knowledge for the benefit of their home communities in Australia. It is intended that the Scheme, which will commence in 1994/95, will help to meet the need, identified in the HREOC Report, for Australian South Sea Islander communities to re-establish family and cultural links with the South Pacific islands from which their families originated, as part of a process of developing and reinforcing their sense of cultural identity and in helping to keep alive South Sea Islander culture within Australia. It is proposed that the scheme will be run in consultation with the Australian South Sea Islander community.

         Secondly, funding support of a total of $75,000 over two years has been approved under AIDAB's Development Education Special Projects Scheme, for the development of a special curriculum package for Australian South Sea Islanders in Queensland, by the Queensland Department of Education. This initiative will provide historical and contemporary Australian South Sea Islander cultural education materials for early childhood, primary and secondary school students.

         The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is also funding the development of a photographic and ethnographic public exhibition depicting the history and development of Australian South Sea Islanders. The exhibition will open later this year and will tour selected centres in Australia during 1994 and 1995. After this, with further funding support from the Department's International Cultural Relations Program, the exhibition will also tour key centres in Pacific countries. It is proposed that the photographic component of the exhibition would afterwards be gifted to the Australian South Sea Islander community for permanent housing at an agreed venue.

         The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is also proposing to arrange, with funding support from OMA and in co-operation with the Queensland Government, the restoration of two old community buildings in Bundaberg with a historical association with the South Seas Evangelical Church. The Church originated in Bundaberg and is marking its centenary in 1994. It is proposed that, the restored buildings be used by the local Australian South Sea Islander community in Bundaberg for church and for general community purposes.

         —I rise to speak to the government response to the Wiltshire report, which was a major review of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. According to the original act which set up this board, there had to be a review after five years. The review is most welcome. There are over 80 recommendations from Professor Wiltshire on the reform of the NBEET structure. Over the years the opposition has been very critical of the way in which NBEET has operated. It found that it was excessively bureaucratic. At the last election we said we would abolish it. What we found in its operation was that it was a veneer committee with very big responsibilities but very few resources to do anything effective. If it is going to stay, what is needed is a properly resourced body that can do its task far more effectively.

         We went to the last election with the suggestion that we have a much more decentralised approach. One of the great legacies, unfortunately, of the Dawkins era is that so much of educational decision making is centralised and the whole approach is so interventionist. We suggest that the government should move to an approach that is far more deregulated and which provides institutions, particularly the excellent higher education institutions in this country, with far more autonomy.

         Professor Wiltshire, in preparing the report, went through a number of areas in which he felt NBEET should be reformed. In introducing the report, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, I believe, was engaging in self-delusion when he said that NBEET has fulfilled the high expectations set for it. It is a system which adds another layer of bureaucracy on an already bureaucratic system. Therefore, much of what it does needs to be considerably reformed.

         I refer to the Australian Research Council, which focuses on the allocation of grants for research in this country. A major inquiry set up by the Senate on research in Australia examined the ARC in great depth and found that the ARC did good work but, in line with what I said at the beginning of my speech about this body being under resourced, it found that the ARC was considerably under resourced while doing an excellent job. The recommendation by Professor Wiltshire to beef up resources to this body is most welcome.

         NBEET has continued to ignore the adult and community education sector which, again, the Senate has inquired into extensively. One of the recommendations that we made, that it should have its own council, was ignored. There was a committee set up and that procedure continues, but seeing that there are more students in the adult and community education sector than there are in all the universities in Australia, one would have thought that that sector should have greater recognition and greater input into policy advice.

         One of the recommendations that is most disturbing relates to the Committee for Quality Assurance in Higher Education. It has been proposed that this be brought into the ambit of NBEET and that it become a formal committee of NBEET. I would have thought that the quality assurance committee should be abolished. It has done enormous harm to higher education by the way in which it ranks universities. It damns forever quite a number of excellent universities in this country. It has harmed our reputation overseas. What the government has done in this area will cause a bad financial impact for many of these institutions. Because their reputation has been damaged, their chance of attracting overseas students has been reduced.

         One of the most welcome recommendations of the report by Professor Wiltshire is that NBEET come under the scrutiny of this parliament through the review of its reports and its operations by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. This will give us the opportunity of calling expert witnesses and scrutinise all aspects of its operations. If this committee structure is to continue, this particular finding of the report is most welcome.

        Unfortunately, we have seen a situation far too often, time and again in this parliament, where the government demonstrates its public brawling between factions over how to manipulate one minister or another or how to change things around. A perfect example, of course, has been that of the manoeuvring over the last few days of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, who is widely tipped by many people as a future Labor leader in Australia, a future Prime Minister. The manipulation, which has been going on with regard to a Victorian lower house seat, has preoccupied and distracted the government from its central focus.

        This particular motion pays regard to what the government should be concentrating on and what the agenda items set by the Labor Party should be. They are fiscal management and responsibility and, from my portfolio interest areas in particular, the interest rates that affect families and young people looking for housing throughout Australia. We need to ask why there is such an obsession with this constant game of musical chairs that seems to be being played within the Labor Party and within the government. Whether or not the Labor Party is, in fact, grooming Senator Evans for leadership ought not to be the major concern and preoccupation.

        If honourable senators watched the manoeuvring of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, with regard to this week's antics involving Senator Evans, they would really have to ask how long he contemplates staying in that top position of management. Here is a Prime Minister, who—prior to taking that position in the midnight horrors of several years ago from his predecessor, Mr Hawke—for a number of years before that had the controls of the finances of this nation as the Treasurer. He moved out as Treasurer for a short period because he could not live comfortably with someone else. He then did deals behind the back door and came in. It was interesting to watch the interplay this week between Mr Keating and Senator Evans. Honourable senators, therefore, have to ask questions about the motives of the Prime Minister himself. Is he getting ready, perhaps, to vacate the chair? These are areas in which questions should be asked.

        I go back to the relevance of this particular motion. The Reserve Bank's annual report was tabled in parliament yesterday. It warned the government that its deficit reduction target was not good enough, that its deficit was too high and that the government must curtail its spending. That report really does bear close scrutiny. The report and financial statements of 1994 for the Reserve Bank of Australia cover a whole range of issues and look very critically, both at the role of government and that of the community and looked at the issues that arise throughout this debate. I remind the Senate that that annual report called on the government to run a more sensible, responsible, fiscal policy and to lower the deficit in a meaningful way. What is the government doing? It is simply ignoring the warnings.

        The Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, claimed that the Reserve Bank was satisfied with the government's deficit reduction strategy. So it would now appear that the government is in great disarray. The Minister for Finance is obviously off side with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser. So, again, we have to come back and to look at what is preoccupying Mr Beazley. What are his distractions? We know that a month or so ago he was taking a public position with regard to the court actions of the former West Australian Premier, Mr Brian Burke, who had been disgraced. So we have the Minister for Finance with Labor Party internal distractions and areas of confusion.

        Another example of the confusions that are distracting many of these ministers from their core area of financial responsibility was the extensive debate we had in this chamber yesterday with regard to the three-mine uranium policy. The Australian Democrats came into this place with some sort of mystical solution of wanting to maintain a three-mine uranium policy that confused both the government and ourselves for debating purposes. We certainly could not understand their deviation from the principled position they had previously taken. I commend the Greens for sticking to their principles yesterday in that debate. The Democrats obviously caved in to this ALP distraction, this area of mood playing; they are just another faction of the Labor Party distracting the ministers of the crown. But that debate showed us the hypocrisy of the government in the way in which it then voted in this place.

        Let me take honourable senators back again to the motion and my focus, not only on finance but also on the housing area And what of the role of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, Mr Brian Howe? During the debates of the last month, which have been so crucial with regard to rising interest rates, where has there been one word of mention by Mr Howe, wearing either the hat of the Deputy Prime Minister or the minister for housing? Where has his contribution been on behalf of the constituency that he is the minister for—housing?

        Increases in mortgage rates will mean that all Australians who are buying or renting their homes will be hard hit. It is a very regressive move. It will adversely affect first home buyers and impact on the similarly important area of mortgage insurance costs. The changes will impact on low income households with limited finances and those who have difficulty in finding a deposit. Those households will become less attractive to the bank. I would have thought that Labor would have adopted this particular area of housing constituency as a natural constituency. But it is very obviously being ignored and overridden for crass reasons of personal power games between ministers.

        Labor's lack of action will now force low to middle income first home buyers to gain access to housing primarily through the operation of state housing authority home finance programs. What does that do? If we move people in middle income groups into the public housing arena and constituency, this then impacts on those in most need that the public housing authorities ought to be serving, by just blowing out the waiting lists. I asked a question at last year's estimates which showed that around Australia there were well over a quarter of a million Australians on public housing waiting lists. I will recheck that figure in a couple of months time; I will revisit it. I will be very keen to see what has consequently happened in these particular areas. This process that the government is going through will certainly affect building contractors, their subbies and the jobs of thousands of people employed in the construction industry.

        Just look for a moment at the key figures on housing. If we go to the seasonally adjusted May key figures, we see that the number of dwellings financed declined by 4.6 per cent; construction of dwellings declined by 8.6 per cent; the purchase of established dwellings declined by 3.9 per cent. Then a month later we have the June key figures of housing finance seasonally adjusted: the number of dwellings financed declined by 6.6 per cent; construction of dwellings declined by 4.2 per cent; the purchase of established dwellings declined by 6.9 per cent; the purchase of new dwellings declined by 10.7 per cent. These figures confirm that there was no urgency in the dampening of housing finance. The figures suggest that growth in home lending has plateaued and that a slowdown is emerging, and confirm that housing finance has already peaked. The home lending boom was only partly due to the upturn in the housing market.

        I would like to go to the declarations of interest of all the ministers of this Labor government. I would challenge a couple of journalists to do a bit of homework in this area and go through and read those declarations of interest with regard to the established homes of ministers and the established mortgages of particular interests to see how many of them will be hard hit by these particular interest rates. From my recollection, the last time I looked through those declarations of interest most of these ministers already had their homes substantially paid off, or did not have mortgages in that particular area, or had reached other financial accords. Therefore, it is an example again of the real hypocrisy of how this affects so many people.

        The growing incidence of refinancing old home loans in order to benefit from low interest rates has influenced figures since the rates started falling in 1991. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that up to 15 per cent of home lending represents refinancing of existing loans—but maybe it is higher. The market is not overheating. A lot of this funding is a consolidation of home loans to incorporate personal loans: cars, boats and, probably very specifically because of the economy in Australia at the moment, the dire plight of so many families that need additional finance.

His dealings last week at the COAG conference in Darwin certainly did not in any way go down the path of helping families throughout Australia. Similarly, all of his dealing in land with regard to native title and Mabo is very pious and obviously designed to make him look like some sort of a charismatic leader opening up new areas.

Mr Willis has obviously got stuck in the trench somewhere.

All we got from Senator Tambling—`rambling Tambling' perhaps would be the best description of him during that speech—was a list of the alleged misdirection of time and effort of people such as the current Prime Minister, Mr Keating, through to former prime minister Bob Hawke's book. We heard some sort of description of Senator Robert Ray, who has been misunderstood clearly, and his alleged counting of numbers in Victoria, and about Mr Barry Jones. We got a run-down for at least 10 minutes of the alleged problems in these areas. All this is supposed to represent a lucid development of economic policy to substantiate the motion that Senator Tambling has before the chamber today. It was a very poorly developed argument.

        I will make a couple of points about the four parts of this motion. The first part of the motion attempts to condemn the government for its fiscal irresponsibility and mismanagement. Nothing could be further from the truth. The current budget strategy of the government as set out by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) lays out a responsible approach to be taken over the next two to three years to the budget deficit, which approach is quite critical to addressing the issue of interest rates.

        The second part of the motion from Senator Tambling alleges that the government has disregarded evidence that Australia's home finance market has continued its slowdown over recent months. I think part (b) is a statement of fact: the housing market is slowing down. However, as the Treasurer made the point in an interview of Sunday morning last, even though the market is slowing down, it is currently running at rates well in excess of where it was at the height of the last housing boom four or five years ago. The third part of Senator Tambling's motion states:

       Again, I think Treasurer Willis pointed out on the

       program that there is a significantly increased risk for borrowers where the equity in their home loan is less than 20 per cent; that if interest rates should move up, borrowers will have a problem meeting those home loan repayments. It is a responsible approach by the government to ensure that people do not go in too far and do not go in over their necks in borrowing too much money. It is a responsible approach by a responsible government.

      <para first-indent="16">

        Following my rebuttal of parts (a), (b) and (c), it can clearly be seen that any alleged lack of concern by the government, as in part (d), is rebutted. In fact, the government's actions are motivated by a concern that home borrowers not borrow too much in the way of funds. The budget strategy has been developed to ensure that there is minimal fluctuation in interest rates. It is a responsible budget strategy, and the assertion in (b) that the home finance market has slowed down is correct. It has slowed down; but it simply has not slowed down enough.

        The majority of the time taken by Senator Tambling in his speech went on irrelevant comment about the alleged problems in other areas, problems which have absolutely nothing to do with the issue that Senator Tambling has brought before the Senate. It was a very disappointing speech. I will not attempt to go into the policy of opposition members because they do not have any. That is the problem. There is no need for me to spend any time on that because their policy development in this area could be put on a pin head. All they do is shadow box—box at personalities and distract themselves from the development of their policy.

        —It is true that Australia has a pretty poor record on monetary and fiscal policy. Interest rates have been raised when they should have been lowered, taxes have been cut when they should have been raised, and spending has been increased when it should have been cut. Economists such as Fred Gruen and Fred Argy blame the last recession—the recession we had to have—on inappropriate monetary policy and on interest rates being held too high for too long.

        Following that recession, it took the government and the Reserve Bank, in my view, too long to realise the depth of the recession and to loosen both monetary and fiscal policy accordingly. With the economy now growing again, the key question is how quickly and how far monetary and fiscal policy should be tightened. I do not have the answers to this, and neither does the government nor the opposition.

        But it is essential that in this recovery the government not rely solely on monetary policy and interest rates to control the economy. Interest rate rises have long lead times and unintended consequences. They hurt legitimate small business people, farmers and home owners just as much as and often more than they hurt the speculators who cause the asset price inflation which interest rate rises are supposed to stop.

        It is true that fiscal policy will need to be tightened. There is no question about that. The government has a plan to reduce the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1997. A recent report by the National Institute of Economics Research said that this target was far too low. NIER said that in 1997 Australia would be at the peak or past the peak of the recovery and the government would still be running a deficit. Such an approach, it said, risked much higher interest rates, unemployment and a higher current account deficit in 1997. So the evidence is mounting that the deficit reduction strategy might need to be reviewed.

        There is no doubt that in the tax cutting and spending Dutch auction leading up to the last election, the $3 billion worth of tax cuts granted last financial year and the $2 billion worth of new spending pledged this financial year will make the task of moving the government towards surplus harder because they add significantly to the structural deficit. Inevitably, this will put pressure on interest rates. These tax cuts and the new spending are not being funded by new taxes or offset by spending cuts; they are being funded largely by the cyclical increase in revenue from the economic recovery.

This is the tragedy of economic debate in this country. The `no new taxes' or `low taxes but big services' mantra that both the government and the opposition engage in means that the cost of funding our demand for current services keeps being passed on and on to our grandchildren.

My office has estimated that the promises on the run from Mr Downer and his shadow cabinet already add up to somewhere between $7 billion and $17 billion. But, guess what? There will be no new taxes or new revenue raising involved in this. Mr Downer has promised a sales tax rebate on exports worth $1 billion; tax breaks on savings worth between $500 million and $1 billion; and increased spending on Aboriginal health and housing.

        Unfortunately for this country, we do not talk enough about restoring the revenue base. We reinforce the culture of contentment. Governments who fear opposition attacks of such a discussion opt to slow the economy using the old sledgehammer of interest rates. To add insult to injury, they have placed the blame for it on the shoulders of home buyers by changes to the risk weighting rules, which Senator Tambling talks about in his motion. In doing so, I believe, they ignore the evidence that the housing market is slowing down. They ignore evidence that housing prices, auspiciously in outer metropolitan areas, are not galloping off in a spiral of asset-price inflation. They have walked roughshod over the aspirations of many young Australian families hoping to take advantage of the highest level of housing affordability seen in a generation.

        Where also is the government's policy response to the huge profits that banks are making on home mortgages? Yesterday's Reserve Bank annual report said that competition had `so far done little to whittle away these high returns'. The Reserve Bank also noted: `interestingly, most banks held similar rates on these loans'. `Interestingly' is an interesting word, is it not? I wonder how the Trade Practices Commission would interpret the Reserve Bank's use of the word `interestingly'. Do honourable senators think it would call it `collusively' or `non-competitively'? It is quite clearly a market failure in this area.

        In summary, the government's monetary and fiscal policies are, in the Democrats' view, in urgent need of revision, but I do not believe the opposition can take no credit for Australia's current predicament, for, on its own public statements, it has not just contributed to the government's policy dilemma but has also pledged that, if it were the government, it could be even worse.

        —I welcome the opportunity to speak to Senator Tambling's motion. I think it basically highlights the ineptitude of this government in managing the economy.

        The increase in interest rates of 0.75 per cent has paralysed the housing market already and has been condemned by the Real Estate Institute of Australia. That rise has knocked the guts out of the housing market. I think it has most probably also knocked the confidence out of people in relation to what is happening, what this government is doing and where it is going.

        I think the government has failed to recognise the impact this will have on the rural sector, which already has a debt of $17.2 billion or $17.3 billion, a lot of it imposed by this government. This latest 0.75 per cent increase in interest rates will add another $120 million in interest every year to the existing debt. I think most people are saying, `When is this going to stop and how is it going to stop?' If it does not stop, we will get back to the old cycle again. People will lose confidence and the drought stricken farmers especially will have their noses pushed right into the dust.

        Farmers trying to get new carry-on loans to get them through the drought are now wondering what the interest rate is going to be in six months time. They are asking whether we are on the spiral again and whether we will go like we did during the 1980s under this government when interest rates went up to 24 and 25 per cent—even as high as 26 per cent for some farmers. That did not just push their noses into the dirt; it pushed them right under the water, when there was water, and pushed them right into the dust bowl when there was not. I think this will be the final straw for many farmers who are on the edge of viability at the moment. Senator Tambling has put a very good motion before us because it talks about the fiscal irresponsibility and mismanagement of the government.

I think a lot of the financial problems we have now are due to the fact that the government has not planned properly over the years.

I express concern at the government's lack of understanding and compassion for the housing needs of Australian families. We have to have some compassion not only for those with housing needs, but also for those on the farms who are trying to fight a drought when they have a government that is so irresponsible in the handling of the economy of this country.

I consider this to be the most important part of this motion because it goes to the crux of the problem in the Australian economy. I know the housing industry is very important. I know the impact of interest rates on people in the housing industry is very important. But the impact of interest rates and lax fiscal policy is far more damaging on business, particularly small business, and it is particularly damaging on the rural sector, as is the fuel excise. It is all very well to say that we have a fuel excise and we apply it equally across the board, but if a person drives only five miles to work and home once a day it has very little impact.

        However, if one has to get all of one's goods and services carted hundreds, if not thousands, of miles, it has an enormous impact. I heard evidence last week in Darwin that 23 per cent of the cost of carting cattle in the Northern Territory is the result of fuel excise. My colleague Senator Panizza comes from Southern Cross in Western Australia: fuel excise adds $4 a tonne to the cost of carting grain from Southern Cross to Kwinana. The fuel excise has an horrendous impact on cartage costs. Those particular areas can get 14 inches of rain and the growers are looking at an increase in costs of between $20,000 and $40,000 a year, just on that one item alone. This tax was originally for road funding, yet it is being spent on railway lines. It just does not make sense. It is poor public policy. The government must start recognising this.

        A couple of days ago Senator Brownhill introduced a matter of public importance condemning the government for its handling of the drought. However, it is far more than the impact of the drought; it is the impact of being screwed into the ground. Rural debt is now above $17 billion. The increase of 0.75 per cent in interest rates will add another $120 million overnight to the cost of servicing that debt. Government members do not seem to understand the impact of that increase, which will further drive people into the ground, destroy them and emotionally cut them in half.

In my view, through overspending this government is putting so much pressure on the financial markets that Australia has real interest rates that are as high as anywhere else in the world. It is all very well to say that we have an official rate of 5.5 per cent or whatever it is—it is somewhere around that—but out in the marketplace people are paying more like 10 per cent to 14 per cent: those are the real interest rates.

The opposition is greatly concerned that the very people who face the horrendous problem of debt in trying to get out of the adverse seasonal conditions will be further damaged and screwed into the ground.

        That rise in interest rates was inevitable from the very moment that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) delivered his budget.

        I recall very well sitting in the lock-up on the day the budget was to be delivered and looking at the budget papers with dismay and despair and saying, `It is inevitable that interest rates will rise.' I wrote an article for the National Party's budget special which said, `Why this budget will make your home loan dearer.' It does not bring me any great satisfaction to say it, but I was right, because this government is spending well beyond its means with deficits of over $11 billion to $12 billion.

        Yet those opposite seem to be congratulating themselves. They stand with a hand on their hearts and say, `Aren't we wonderful people because we are cutting the deficit?' People in Australia seem to think that that means the government is cutting its debt; in fact, it is not. Every year that this government runs a deficit the amount of money the government has to borrow increases. Government debt goes up because this year's deficit will be added to last year's deficit and the deficit of the year before, and next year's deficit will be added on top of that. That is why government debt in recent years has trebled in the space of just a couple of years.

        It stands to reason that when the government borrows large amounts of money the price of money will go up, and the price of money is the interest rate. The government is out there greedily soaking up the savings that Australians have put away—very small amounts of savings, I hasten to add. The consequence of too much demand for money and not enough supply is that the price goes up.

That is why this government's last budget made it inevitable that interest rates would go up and that struggling Australian families with mortgages and struggling Australian farmers would pay the cost for this government's economic folly.

The government says to ordinary people trying to buy a house, `We think too many people are buying houses. That's why we are going to put up interest rates.'

        Is it not hypocrisy for a government to say, `We will spend without regard for our capacity to bring in income, yet you, in the Australian community, must curtail your spending because we think you're spending too much.'?

        Let us look at the consequence of this government's increase in interest rates. Let us take a hypothetical couple who have just bought a house. We will call them Greg and Di.

They can fund the loan at the moment and they fix the loan for the first 12 months.

        However, there is a common clause in fixed loans, when they are capped for the first 12 months, that they cannot be repaid at a faster rate. So they have just signed the papers on the house. They are spared the increase in interest rates for 12 months, but what is their first thought? Their first thought is, goodness gracious, interest rates are going up three-quarters of a per cent now, what will they be in six months time? Another half a per cent? So they start to save every penny they have so that as soon as the 12 months is over they can make a big payment to reduce the mortgage—$3,000 or $4,000—so that they do not have to pay a higher rate of interest on a big loan.

        The consequence of that inevitably will be that a lot of demand will be taken out of the economy, not just in the housing sector, but elsewhere. I think one of the real dangers of this increase in interest rates is that it is going to stop the spending on consumer durables. In other words, people will not buy a washing machine, a dishwasher or a drier. They might save that money to put into the mortgage, which will result in fewer jobs and fewer opportunities for people who are unemployed. That is the consequence of this government's policy and that is why its policy is so hopelessly flawed.

        Let us turn to the rural sector. What impact will this increase in interest rates have on the rural sector? The government congratulates itself on having made $15 million available to help farmers who are struggling with the drought to meet the interest payments on their farm loans because they have no capacity to pay at the moment. As Senator Crane has so ably said, many farmers have made losses year after year because of the drought and this government's failed economic policy. But what will this interest rate increase do to those people? It will wipe out the value of that $15 million that the government has offered in drought relief, because a three-quarters of a per cent increase in interest rates will add $120 million in interest to the amount which the farm sector has to pay this year. So the government is saying, `Aren't we wonderful, generous, compassionate people? We're going to give you $15 million to help you with the drought.' In the very same week we see interest rates go up by three-quarters of a per cent, which will add $120 million to the amount which struggling farmers will have to repay this year.

In fact, a friend of mine who moved there with his wife—he was working at Qantas; his wife was working at David Jones until she had a baby—was forced to move out of Cairns because he could not afford the rent. His wife was unable to work because she was looking after the baby and he just was not bringing in enough money to pay the bills. So finally, we have seen an increase in the amount of available housing and that increase will be wiped out by these high interest rates.

          —I will preface my comments by saying that the public hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration provide an invaluable opportunity to canvass a series of topical and technical questions on a variety of issues such as rulings, capital gains, sales tax, tax law improvement projects, the child support system and controversial tax rulings. The hearings are, I believe, a mutually useful exchange of views between the Australian Taxation Office and the community, through this parliament.

          I did note that, unlike in similar hearings in previous years, not as many big ticket issues were raised on this occasion. I think this reflects favourably on Mr Carmody and his staff at the Taxation Office, in addressing in a timely manner issues which are raised in these technical forums. I must also thank Mr Nolan, head of the tax law improvement project, for the length of his explanations about compliance costs to business and the simplification of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

          I now wish to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to address a number of unanswered and outstanding issues. Thresholds may remain unchanged for many years and, thus far, the Taxation Office has not had in place a mechanism to automatically review thresholds as time passes. The only way that thresholds can retain any true meaning is to index them automatically with movements in such indexes as the consumer price index and keeping vigilant about them as time passes.

          The second matter relates to the fast-tracking procedures implemented by the Taxation Office. Comments made by the office about objections against assessments or amended assessments being fast-tracked in the same manner as contemplated for objections against private rulings were beneficial in explaining the views held by the Taxation Office on this issue. However, I do have strong reservations about whether those involved in the fast-tracking process agree with the views expressed. I will be paying particular attention to Taxation officers' conduct with respect to this issue to determine whether my belief will be vilified.

          Next, I would put on the record that during the hearings I sought an explanation of the considerable delays in obtaining rulings about the Australian horticultural project, which newspapers have termed the `wildflower project' in Western Australia. Much to my disappointment, my concerns were unanswered, owing to section 16, the privacy provisions of the Income Tax Act, since they were essentially private rulings.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I am concerned about two aspects of the matter: firstly, the six-year delay in providing the ruling; and, secondly, the ruling was retrospective in seeking to deny deductions which were previously accepted in investor returns. The Taxation Office did indicate that it has some problems as there were requests for rulings by promoters of schemes for passing on to others when the Taxation Office does not know the circumstances and the purpose of each particular investor. I remind the Senate that private rulings can only be used by the particular person receiving the benefit of the tax ruling.

          I am really concerned that the problems now being faced by investors in that project will not be repeated in other schemes such as forestry investments, which are often advertised as tax minimisation, and other high yielding sorts of projects. Investors and project managers, I warn, need to be aware that many tax shelters may fail to deliver on their central promise of being the big tax deductions for expenses, such as prepayment of expenses for agricultural projects. I urge everyone entering into such projects to heed such advice and approach such investments with caution.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The time constraints of the hearing did not allow me to adequately pursue another important issue; namely, section 51AD. During the hearing I referred to a series of draft rulings, including TR94/D27. I raised that it had been suggested that `the rulings could cause some taxpayers to be technically insolvent, although they have not intentionally sought to benefit from a prescribed tax mischief'.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I remind the Senate that section 51AD was apparently introduced to overcome abuses by financiers obtaining leveraged property deductions where the real economic ownership of the property rested in a non-taxable entity. The difficulty is that the legislation applies to circumstances far wider than originally intended. For example, if an ordinary mum and dad acquire a residential investment in a special purpose entity—say, in a company or a trust—and use more than 50 per cent debt, then section 51AD will automatically apply.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Section 51AD is particularly onerous as it disallows deductions in all years. I call for the government to urgently review the operations, particularly the wider ambits, of section 51AD. Many thousands of ordinary taxpayers have serious section 51AD problems that they may not necessarily be aware of.

          Another matter which I raised during the hearing and which requires further comment relates to my questions about the inequity of taxing friendly societies at rates greater than those paid by their investors. I have been informed that the friendly society industry undertook a study in 1992-93 which revealed that over 40 per cent of investor members of friendly societies received a pension payment and that the percentage of friendly society members who are pensioners can be expected to increase. The study also revealed that the average income of friendly society investors who were pensioners was $9,903, whereas the average income for investor members of friendly societies was $18,357.

          The ATO also indicated that it would take into consideration the idea of certification of low income giving access to concessionally treated savings in relation to friendly societies. I call on the government to give this matter serious consideration.

          Another issue which is not resolved relates to the operation of the Taxation Relief Hardship Board. I raised my concerns about the large delays in processing applications. The number of applications per year is falling. The tax office's response was disturbing. It showed that the board has met on fewer occasions in recent years, justifying this on the basis that meetings were difficult to arrange owing to differing priorities and activities of the other departments from which representatives forming the board are drawn. This is not a satisfactory explanation for those taxpayers who have made an application and who must wait in limbo for quite a considerable period.

          I am pleased to say that, following a meeting this afternoon with the managing director and other officers of the research and development tax concession branch, many of the concerns which I sought to raise during that hearing about the Industry Research and Development Board, and in particular syndicated research, have been allayed. I will take a few minutes to draw the Senate's attention to the issues raised.

          The objective of the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development is to encourage increased investment in R&amp;D by Australian companies in order to make them more innovative and to increase their international competitiveness. I remind the Senate that the concession is a permanent and a positive provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The white paper has introduced a number of initiatives to the tax concessions for syndication, including lowering the R&amp;D expenditure threshold for participation in the R&amp;D syndication from $1 million to $500,000 and reducing administration costs by developing a generic syndicate structure to facilitate access to the scheme by SMEs.

          During the meeting I pointed out that there was a belief that the board and the ATO were rejecting finance schemes which involved tax loss companies—schemes which were readily approved in the past. The general manager of the branch advised that there were a number of reasons for the low approval rate: firstly, there was a higher than usual inflow of applications due to the 30 June timing of that particular meeting; secondly, that seven out of the 20 applicants were new structures and arrived after the cut-off date for receipt of the papers; and, thirdly, that a number of the schemes had interposed entities which had the effect of a tax benefit without making a prescribed benefit to R&amp;D. However, I was assured that the schemes were not knocked out because they were tax loss companies. In fact, the whole purpose of the arrangement is to encourage tax loss companies to participate.

          I also raised the issue that there seemed to be a change in attitude in relation to what is an acceptable period for the `commensurate period' and that an almost non-negotiable period of seven years was a board and ATO requirement. During this afternoon's meeting, I was advised that the board can appreciate problems, particularly in the areas of communications and information technologies, and that a shorter period may be appropriate. I was also advised that this is an issue that the board will raise with the Taxation Office and that there is really nothing that specifies the seven-year time period. I strongly urge the ATO to be more flexible in its attitude.

          I understand that the Bureau of Industry Economics has concluded a review of the 150 per cent tax concession and that the rigidity of what is known as the PUT option could, it acknowledges, disadvantage some researchers. During the meeting I also sought clarification of the government's policy in relation to participation of tax exempt bodies other than those on the register of commercial and general bodies. The officers informed me that the changes brought about by the 1992 budget had the desired effect of excluding tax exempt bodies in the public sector from participating where there was a guaranteed return.

         I also queried the Board about the perceived differences in interpretation of government policy by the Board and the ATO. The Board advise that it was not aware that the ATO has rejected syndicated projects that the Board has approved because most syndicate promoters have a joint approach to both the ATO and the Board. The role of the Board is to issue certificates—as to R &amp; D—yes or no.

         The Board also briefed me on its staffing arrangements. With increased staffing why were there backlogs and delays. The Board advised that sometimes it was difficult to get a quorum as there was a conflict of interest with absence of Board members creating problems in getting a quorum for meetings.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         I shall conclude this evening with probably the most controversial view expressed by the ATO during the hearing relating to the position where you have a public ruling and contrary case law. The Acting Chief Tax Counsel advised that a public ruling continues in operation despite contrary case law. The application of that view is inequitable to the ordinary taxpayer. A taxpayer is only in a position to self-amend in such a situation if they are aware of case law and matters being appealed. Taxpayers do not—and should not be required to—keep abreast of developments in taxation legislation and how the legislation is to be interpreted through tax rulings and determinations, meetings of the ATO liaison group meetings et cetera.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         By continuing to enforce a public ruling whilst a matter is proceeding through the Court, the Australian Taxation Office appears to be taking advantage of the "information gap" facing taxpayers and extracting taxation revenue, which may not have to be gathered. This position needs to be addressed immediately to restore fairness to the system.
        </para>

          This government has set up an approach where it segments research funding into a whole range of areas. It puts money in through the Australian Research Council; it puts money in through postgraduate awards. The government has cooperative research centres; it has a whole series of other research centres. It has mechanism A, mechanism B and mechanism C funding. What we discovered as we looked at these various mechanisms was that a good case could be made for increasing funding in most areas because they were very much starved of funds. I will give one illustrative example.

          The government set up some special funding to assist this. Again, it was too little and for too short a time. It established what it calls mechanism B, which was to create funds for five years to help these universities get up to speed. The failure of this policy was starkly revealed by the quality assurance mechanisms when the former CAEs ended up down the bottom of the list and the established, better endowed universities ended up at the top of the list. No-one was surprised by that, but it underlined that more funding should have been given to help these universities establish themselves as proper research institutions.

There has been great work done with the cooperative research centres, but what came out of the findings was some doubt that the money was always spent properly.

Rather than encouraging this country to become a clever and wise country, this government has shown no wisdom whatsoever when it comes to tertiary education. While we still have a residue of high quality people—I refer particularly to people in science at Australian universities—my great fear is that the quality of students going into science is such that within the next 10 to 15 years we will lose even that quality that we have and will really go down the gurgler in a major way. So while the quality of science is certainly poor at the moment by world standards—and I will give some figures on that in a moment—all the indications are that the situation will get worse very rapidly.

          The first point I would like to make is one that Senator Tierney has already referred to: that Australia is currently spending 1.35 per cent of GDP on research and development. That compares very poorly with most of the other OECD countries. It is less than half the money that countries such as Japan, Sweden and Germany spend on research and development.

          We simply will not get the quality work which is needed if we do not put in a lot more money. Given that in Australia, for very well understood reasons, we have failed substantially to match the private funds which are put in in those countries, it is absolutely essential—urgent—that the government comes to the party and puts a great deal more money into research.

          We certainly have done better in encouraging private industry to put money in. However, it is an established fact that we have many multinational companies in Australia that do much of their research overseas. If we want that quality research to be done here and the results to stay in this country and benefit this country, we need a higher proportion of government input into that research. That has not been forthcoming despite all the protestations of the government in relation to quality.

          The second piece of evidence that I would like to put before the Senate is the relative science citation study recently published by Professor Bourke and others at the Australian National University. It shows that, particularly since 1987-88, the quality of science published by Australian researchers has been falling quite precipitously, roughly by about eight per cent in terms of the science citation index. I admit that that is only one measure of the quality of science but it is generally recognised as a very appropriate measure. That would indicate that the quality of the research is going downhill. The amount of research is going downhill. When we put those two things together, it certainly presages a very poor outlook for science in Australia in the future.

          The third piece of evidence I would like to bring forward is the entry scores of students going into science. When one looks at those scores across all the universities in Australia, one finds that science is only marginally above nursing in the quality of the students which it attracts. I am not suggesting for a moment that nursing is a profession that we should ignore, but nursing is the profession which in terms of tertiary scores attracts the poorest quality of students. Science is only marginally above that. On a scale of one to five across 30 universities, medicine scores No. 1—in other words, it scores more of the better students—and areas such as business and law attract the rest of the good students.

          Looked at in another way, if we divide the students into quartiles, we find that, while medicine attracts something like 99.7 per cent of its students from the upper quartile, science attracts only about 25 per cent of its students from the upper quartile. While medicine attracts none from the lower quartile, science attracts about one-quarter of its entrants from that lower quartile.

Students—the intelligent students, anyway—simply do not want to go into science.

          As members of the Senate would know, at the moment the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is conducting an inquiry into CSIRO. I will give one example of what is happening there. Recently that committee went to Armidale, where there is a university with a CSIRO division. Private interests associated with the meat and livestock industry have involved themselves in two CRCs that have attracted $60 million worth of funds. The government has provided insufficient funding for CSIRO. CSIRO is intending to sell two of the field stations on which the CRCs depend. So $60 million that is already available for high quality research has been put in jeopardy. Again, that is an indication of where science is going in this country.

The quality is not being replaced. Science will continue the decline indicated by the relative science citation index, which as I indicated has been falling quite steeply since 1987-88.

          In drawing attention to that delayed response, I am not in any way critical of it. There are reasons that the response could not be made earlier, not the least of which is the very major decision announced in November of last year relating to refugee status claimants from the People's Republic of China. The 1 November decision, as it has become known, has resolved one large problem in that particular area. Obviously it would have been pre-emptive to make the response earlier. A number of other happenings in the area have led to a delay in the presentation of this response to the parliament which, incidentally, came in before we rose for the winter recess.

          I was very pleased to receive the response because the government has accepted the vast majority of the recommendations of the committee. There were some 30 recommendations in all and the government has accepted most of them. Indeed, it has not only accepted them but has actually also acted on them already. I have drawn attention to the 1 November decision announced by the minister.

          In relation to the 1 November decision, I was one of the committee members that did not agree with the majority recommendation. I am prepared now to accept that perhaps I was wrong. Had we gone down the track that I encouraged the minister and the department to take, the problem we had with quite a large number of people in this country awaiting determination of refugee status would still be with us. It is now some nine or 10 months since the announcement of the decision and a very large proportion of the applications of those people for permanent residency have actually been processed. Those people are able to get on with building their lives in this country—settling down, rearing their children, bringing their families together and so forth. It is a very good decision—I say that in hindsight—even though I disagreed with it earlier.

          I want to draw attention to one other particular matter; that is, the recommendation regarding the length of time it took to process the applications of people who applied for refugee status in this country. There certainly have been some criticisms in the past, and there are ongoing criticisms about delays in processing the applications of people who arrived in this country by boat post-November 1989. It took substantial amounts of time for many of them to even lodge their applications for refugee status. Indeed, in some instances there were inordinate delays in processing those people's applications. Consequently, many people spent quite a substantial amount of time in detention.

          I am very pleased that the minister is able to record that the average time for processing the applications of people who arrive in this country illegally by boat is now five weeks. It has been possible in some cases for it to be done in two weeks and on other occasions, because of complications with the application, it has taken up to 10 weeks. But processing is happening very speedily. It is not just a matter of processing and rejecting the applications. Many of the people who have arrived here by boat and made application for refugee status have been granted that refugee status in Australia—not all of them.

In their wisdom, their representatives withdrew the application for a review of their earlier rejection. This left the two young girls liable for deportation.

         —Yesterday, by leave of the Senate, I had the privilege of attending the Launceston memorial service of a former Tasmanian parliamentarian, Mr Max Bushby OBE. Max passed away earlier this week after an 18-month battle with cancer. Max Bushby was one of Launceston's leading citizens, and he leaves behind him an enormous store of goodwill amongst a wide range of people who worked with him or benefited from his efforts.

         Amongst his many attributes, Max was above all a gentle and devout man. He was an active and sincere Christian, and he lived his life accordingly. He spent much of his life working for those around him, especially those who were in need of special help. He was also widely respected for his stance on such issues as communism and on social and moral issues. His kindness and generosity began with his family—his wife and five children—and extended to all Tasmanians through his 25 years of service in the Tasmanian House of Assembly.

         Max Bushby was educated at East Launceston Primary School and later at Scotch College, where he provided leadership in the principal sporting teams and became captain of the school. On leaving secondary school, Max joined his family real estate business and maintained an interest in that firm at various levels throughout his life. He was a past president of the northern branch of the Real Estate Institute and, for many years, was a licensed valuer. He spent time in Korea as a journalist during the invasion from the north. This was where he became concerned about the threats of communism and the wider issues of the Cold War.

         Following an unsuccessful attempt to unseat the popular Lance Barnard from the federal seat of Bass in 1958, Max Bushby turned to state politics. He was elected to the Tasmanian parliament for the seat of Bass in 1961. He continued to represent the people of Launceston and north-east Tasmania until 1986. It is a tribute that a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Lance Barnard, no longer a young man, was at the service paying tribute with many colleagues from all political parties.

         Max was chairman of committees and deputy speaker of the Bethune government during the 1969-72 era. He was Speaker of the House during the first Gray Liberal government from 1982 to 1986. He also served periods as shadow minister in a number of portfolios, including health, housing and construction, when in opposition. During his long parliamentary career, he sat with more than 100 different members of the 35-seat chamber. Originally it was somewhat smaller than that.

         Max was also devoted to assisting his party colleagues at election times for both state and federal elections. The former member for Bass, Warwick Smith, remembers that Max made keen and wise contributions to all of his campaigns between 1984 and 1993.

         Max Bushby was awarded his OBE in the 1987 New Year's honours list for services to the parliament and to the community. His range of community service involvement was most notable. In particular, it included service through organisations such as the St Giles Society for crippled children, the Retarded Children's Welfare Association, Jaycees, his old Scotch College Association, the Northern Development League, the St Michael's Association and, more recently, Probus. He was also a member of the Royal Commonwealth Society. Max's main area of community work was with the Launceston City Mission. Earlier this year, he was honoured with life membership of the mission. This recognised his 36 years of service to the mission as a board member, most of which he served as chairman.

         Also outstanding was the contribution he made to the Bible Society. He served with great distinction over many decades and was the head of that organisation in Australia for a number of terms. Max Bushby's life was devoted to his church and religious beliefs. He was a lay preacher from 1950 and had a close involvement with the establishment and on-going support of the WEC Missionary Training College at St Leonards. At the time of his death, he was a member of its advisory council.

To them and to Max's other relatives—I mention especially his brother Russell and sister-in-law Betty, with whom he was very close—I extend my sincere and deep condolences. Tasmania has lost a wise and generous statesman. However, on the positive side, my fellow Tasmanians can certainly claim to be richer for Max's life and work. I thank the Senate.

His note to me outlining what happened continues as follows:

        Treacherous winds drove the fire first one way then another. Overrunning Kabatepe, though missing the museum there, it swept on to Kumkamp, about 8 km south. Like a rampaging monster the fire selected its victims at random. One row of summer houses there was completely razed to the ground, another, whose owner had been told that it had been lost, arrived during the day to find it still standing as if nothing had happened.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It seems as if nothing could stand in the path of devastation as the fire swept on south towards the villages of Behramli, which was evacuated, and Alcitepe, better known to the British as Krithia, where tens of thousands of lives were lost in 1915 in futile full frontal daylight attacks across the open countryside. Before reaching there however the flames of destruction somehow reached a state of exhaustion and the fire petered out amidst the open farmland.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The origin of the fire still remains unclear. Although the `eski muhtar' confessed and was arrested a few days ago the finger of blame has now been pointed at a 15 year old youth of that village. What is clear however is the fire started in the vicinity of either Yalova or Kumkoy village.

        Gallipoli is a place of deep significance to all Turks and the loss of this incomparably beautiful natural area has been deeply felt by the whole nation. The national newspaper Milliyet started a campaign to replant the millions of lost trees and the Governor of Canakkale province has pledged that this will be done, with the aid of the local military, within a year.

        Donations have been flooding in from around the country, small and large, with Koc Holdings, Turkey's second biggest conglomerate pledging 12 milyar lira (1 milyar equals 20,000 English pounds) and the owner of Dardanel-Onentas, a fish-canning factory that is Canakkale's largest employer, chipping in 100 million lira.

        Miraculously though, all the memorials and cemeteries that Australians normally visit on a trip to Gallipoli are almost completely untouched. In the main battle area only two of the 31 cemeteries and memorials appear to have succumbed to the flames. Damage inspection of these two is as yet impossible since the rarely-visited Fourth Battalion Parade Ground lies deep in the now-devastated Shrapnel Valley and `Plugge's Plateau', normally reached by a 20 minute stiff climb up a winding footpath, lies surrounded by burnt scrub on top of the first ridge that was captured by the Anzacs as they scrambled ashore under a hail of bullets in the semidarkness of dawn on 25 April 1915.

         Damage assessment also indicates that the Commission lost all the plant stock in their nurseries; scorching of the foliage at Ari Burnu where the Dawn Service takes place every ANZAC day; some grass burnt at Baby 700 where Joseph Lalor, the grandson of Eureka Stockade leader Peter Lalor, is buried and at Shell Green, where the famous cricket match was played in a ruse to convince the Turks that evacuation would not take place, half the cemetery was burnt though with no damage to permanent structures.

        In almost every case the cemeteries are now surrounded by a landscape of black and lifeless bushes and trees. The sensation of being in an area which was once a hell of exploding shells and bullets could not be more keenly felt.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Lone Pine tree, planted from a seed from the original, defied the flames and continues to stand serenely amongst the gravestones, though now scorched up one side. The imposing Australian Memorial still stands majestically at the lower end of the ridge that was the Anzac front line and though fire has consumed the grass surrounding up to the stone itself it will undoubtedly witness in 1995, as it has for so many years, the tributes and tears of Australians as they remember Gallipoli on the forthcoming 80th Anniversary.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The heroic efforts of the firefighters also managed to prevent more serious damage to the Turkish memorials and the only one to be blackened by the fire was that to Nazif Cakmak, a brother of Marshal Fevzi Cakmak, hero of the War of Salvation in the 1920's, on the summit of Chunuk Bair.

I refer to the practical application of aggregation as it has happened against what was supposed to happen in Tasmania. In setting the scene, I refer to a question asked by Senator Harradine of Senator Gareth Evans back in May 1989. He asked about the effect of aggregation on Tasmania in changing some areas from VHF to UHF. Senator Evans's supplementary answer provided on 23 May states:

        Just this evening I had a phone call from a constituent from the west coast of Tasmania who alerted me—as I had already been alerted by quite a few other complainants over the last month or so—to the fact that their television reception had deteriorated and was non-existent at times. Radio transmission from the ABC had ceased to exist for 10 days. Some people were receiving radio signals through their television sets; I do not know how that occurred, but it did. It all gets back to what is happening in Tasmania with aggregation.

         As I was receiving a lot of complaints, I conducted a survey in southern Tasmania, the results of which I have passed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee. I sent out something like 12,000 letters and received nearly 2,000 replies, which I believe is a very good response rate for a survey, particularly when it is conducted by a politician—an opposition politician at that. Apart from the written replies I received, I have had many dozens of phone calls from viewers and listeners and, in particular, I have had quite a fair amount of anecdotal evidence from people who work in the television industry and from people who are involved with the radio industry.

Comments were made to my office expressing the view that the Australian Broadcasting Authority in particular has been disorganised and downright negligent. It has been found that the ABA has allocated wrong frequencies to Tasmania and has failed to supply spectrum management. As recently as only a week or so ago when I made this matter public in Hobart, I had the support of David Hill himself, who was very critical of the fact that the National Transmitter Agency did not seem to have done any forward planning for the work it is doing on radio transmission, particularly around Hobart. I might add that we were promised a full coverage of the national radio in Tasmania and that still has not happened, although I am led to believe that it may happen in the reasonably near future.

         It gets back to the point that promises were made to Senator Harradine and others back in 1989—five years ago—that these problems would not arise. Yet here we are in 1994 not only with problems but with many thousands of people being disadvantaged in Tasmania. I know that Tasmania is a long way away from the bureaucrats in Canberra, but what about the people who have been complaining—those whom I have represented here and whose comments I have made known to the minister? I am not the only one who has done that. I know that Sylvia Smith from the north of Tasmania has done so, as has my colleague Senator Chris Miles, the honourable member for Braddon. I believe that Senator Newman is still waiting for responses from the minister to complaints she has made on behalf of many hundreds of viewers in northern Tasmania about the inadequacy of television reception.

         As Deputy Chairman of the Public Works Committee, I am well aware that a new transmitter is being constructed on Mount Wellington which will house most of the television transmission in southern Tasmania. Nevertheless, I am also aware that the UHF signal is not as far reaching as the VHF signal that is currently being used in Tasmania. It does not seem to have the power to reach out to those areas that have trouble—

         —The aggregation has meant that more UHF stations are coming into Tasmania. That is what has happened on the mainland with aggregation, and they tried to apply the same rules to Tasmania. They believed we needed all these extra channels, but our bands in Tasmania are not crammed as has been the case on the mainland. These matters were all raised with Senator Evans back in 1989 by Senator Harradine, and the exports pooh-poohed him. Nevertheless, the situation now is that many hundreds, if not thousands, of southern Tasmanians on the east and west coasts do not have the pleasure of viewing the Commonwealth Games. They will not have the pleasure of viewing the Grand Final of Australian Rules Football.

         The National Transmission Agency, which promised all Tasmanian politicians a briefing this week but cancelled it with no explanation, told us that down the track something like 20 translators will be provided in Tasmania. The agency has provided some material to people showing the areas it will cover. Taking even all that into account, the survey that I carried out and anecdotal evidence that I have received from other people, there will still be many areas of Tasmania, particularly southern Tasmania, the east coast and the Derwent Valley, that will have little or no television service. I believe in 1994 that is totally unacceptable, given the promises made and given that other people right across Australia receive very good television reception and telecommunications. Why is it that the people of Tasmania have suffered once again from decisions made in Canberra that work against them?

         —I support the remarks of Senator Calvert in relation to television services in Tasmania. I visited Tasmania with members of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, and we looked at that situation. While honourable senators feel for the children of Tasmania who cannot see the Commonwealth Games, I urge them to feel also for the people in west and east Pilbara, the Murchison, right out to the Gibson Desert, stretching from the Indian Ocean to the boarders of South Australia and Northern Territory—an area bigger than New South Wales—who cannot even listen to, let alone see, the games.

         This situation came about by the National Transmission Agency shutting down the VLW short-wave transmitter some months ago. We were told that it needs $2 million for a new transmitter in order for those people to listen to, let alone see, what is going on in the rest of the world. Compare this $2 million to the losses this week on ANL and see what that means. Once again, in backing up what Senator Calvert has said, I urge the National Transmission Agency to look at those regions in Western Australia where it has shut down VLW short-wave transmission.

         —I will not delay the Senate for very long but, in picking up the tail end of the comments of the previous speakers, I want to put some remarks on the record about the Commonwealth Games. I have just heard that Qantas Airways has offered the parents of Cathy Freeman free travel to Victoria, Canada, to watch their daughter participate in other events at the Commonwealth Games. I commend Qantas for doing that.

         I hope that while her parents are in Victoria, they too will be able to witness Cathy doing a victory lap of the stadium carrying behind her not only the Australian flag but also the Aboriginal flag. One cannot say that without mentioning Arthur Tunstall, the Chef de Mission, the neanderthal who criticised her for carrying the Aboriginal flag following her magnificent victory yesterday. It is strange that someone who uses a foreign title should make a stand on what could be seen to be a nationalistic issue. I suggest that double standards are being applied there.

         Of course, those double standards came to the fore right at the start of those games when that individual disgraced himself and this nation in the eyes of the world. The biggest disgrace of all is that Tunstall was allowed to remain. It is an indictment of whoever is responsible for the Commonwealth Games organisation in this country that they did not immediately step in, sack him and return him to this country. He is way past his use-by date. He is out of touch with modern Australia. I suggest that the sooner he relinquishes the position, either voluntarily or by being forced out, the better it will be for the standing of this country and the athletes of this country who come from varied backgrounds. Again I commend Qantas for its initiative.

        (1) Formal responsibility for approval of institutions to provide courses to full fee paying overseas students was transferred from the Commonwealth to the States and Territories on 1 January 1990. This transfer was consistent with the allocation of responsibility for education and consumer services under the Australian Constitution and the development by the States and Territories at that time of provisions for the licensing of institutions and development of criteria for institutions and courses for domestic students.

        (2) A National Code of Conduct and minimum standards for approval of institutions and courses for international students were endorsed by the former Australian Education Council (AEC) in 1988 and 1990 respectively. The minimum standards are intended to ensure that international students receive the courses and services they pay for and protect and underpin the quality of education services provided by Australian education institutions. The standards are reflected in the legislation, policy and administrative requirements of the State and Territory education  authorities for the accreditation of institutions and courses. Compliance by institutions with these standards is monitored by State and Territory education authorities.

        Since June 1991, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulations) Act 1991 (ESOS Act) has required the Commonwealth to maintain the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS). Only institutions and courses accredited by the relevant State and Territory authorities are placed on the CRICOS. International students are able to study only courses on the CRICOS. When a State/Territory authority advises the Department of Employment, Education and Training that an institution's course's accreditation is suspended or cancelled, the registration of that institution or course on the CRICOS is suspended or cancelled as the case may be.

The revised Code and Standards will take into account: the various industry codes in operation at present, the considerable experience gained by the Commonwealth, States and Territories since adoption of the Code and Standards, changes in the regulatory arrangements of the Commonwealth, States and Territories and changes in the focus of Government policy in international education and training.
