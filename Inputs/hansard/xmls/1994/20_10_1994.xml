        <para>
         This is the first report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. The report deals with our duties under section 206 of the Native Title Act, the first of which is to consult extensively with the community about the implementation of native title. The committee completed its first round of public consultations during August. This report is very much a record of those consultations and the evidence we received. I am pleased to say that the report is unanimous and it provides a snapshot of the developments and issues that have emerged concerning native title since the passage of the act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is important to note that we have not sought to fully assess the act because it is very much early days in the development of native title in this country. The committee took the opportunity to consult widely and travel around Australia to talk to people about native title, the act and related issues. Our intention was to consult rather than try to form definitive views on how the act was operating—and the report reflects that. For some people the report might be less controversial than they had hoped; but, as I say, it was a unanimous report of the committee and really just a reflection of those consultations.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There are a number of reasons why it is too early to make definitive judgments about the act. The first of those is that there have been surprisingly few claims lodged at this stage—certainly when the committee was taking evidence in August. Therefore, there has been very little progress in processing those claims. It is also worth noting that industry in general has shown a reluctance to make claims using the non-claimant application route provided in the legislation. So until they start to use that device more freely, developments in that area will be slow.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There are another couple of points worth mentioning in terms of why developments have not proceeded as quickly as some might have thought. There is a general wait and see approach to a number of test cases that are proceeding—particularly the Wik claim in Queensland, and a range of other cases. These cases will further develop the common law concept of native title.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One of the other issues is the long preparation time required for claims. A number of Aboriginal groups have expressed the view to the committee that they are working away at claims, but that the resources and time requirements of properly developing a claim are quite extensive. We expect to see more claims coming in over the next year or so.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another point I would like to mention is that, despite the fact that a number of states have passed state legislation which sets up a sort of complementary regime to the Native Title Act, most of those have not yet been proclaimed; so the regimes under state legislation, provided for in the legislation, are not in place. That has also acted to slow developments compared with what might otherwise have been expected.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The other major issue is the fact that the Western Australian government is challenging the legislation in the High Court. That challenge will no doubt resolve a range of outstanding issues. Clearly, there is an impact on the community generally that leads people to wait to assess that High Court decision. That is also impacting on state governments. All those things are important in assessing the development of the progress under the act.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In Western Australia, where there are two competing regimes—the regime under the native title legislation and the regime under the Western Australian Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act—people are quite confused and unable to proceed with confidence. Until those issues are resolved, we will need to wait for that determination before we see a greater number of claims and progress with those claims, in Western Australia in particular.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Because of this experience a number of the views expressed to the committee reflected the positions people had expressed and adopted prior to the legislation being enacted. As I say, they have not had a great deal of practical experience of the act being in operation, and very much a `wait and see' approach has been adopted by a range of key groups.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I want to mention briefly a couple of matters that arise from the report. The first is that the President of the National Native Title Tribunal, Justice French, has set up liaison committees of industry and Aboriginal groups in each state. That has been a very good initiative in that it has allowed him to work through with those groups a range of issues and problems that were raised with the committee. We have found that a number of those issues have been resolved, at least partly, since our consultations, as he has worked with those industry and Aboriginal groups to refine processes and resolve some of the teething problems.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The second issue that I want to mention briefly is the need for resources for education about native title. By this, I am not suggesting a major PR campaign or television advertising campaign about native title, but there is a need for key groups, including Aboriginal groups, to be provided with more information and knowledge about native title. This includes groups which have not been directly involved to any great extent, such as local government, the tourism industry and other groups. There is a need for them to be provided with solid information and assistance in coming to terms with native title issues. Aboriginal groups and industry groups may also require assistance both in coming to terms with native title and in dealing with the implications of the act.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One of the other points I want to stress is that it is important that we provide resources to either the tribunal or some other group to make sure that communities which are affected by native title claims quickly get easily understandable information on the impact of those claims and the legal issues surrounding them. It is important that we have people on the ground who are able to talk to people about how native title claims may impact on them. That would help alleviate a lot of the fear and misunderstanding that could be associated with claims being lodged. It would be a very good pro-active move if we were to get out early into the community and provide that educative role. It will not resolve all the difficulties, but it will at least promote better understanding of the issues involved.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I also want to mention the issue of land tenure history and maps for dealing with native title claims. It has been a fairly widespread experience for industry and Aboriginal groups that land tenure information and mapping has been inadequate and that the costs of that are prohibitive. The president of the tribunal has been playing a role in trying to resolve that issue, but clearly the native title issue is placing demands on state government land administration in relation to this issue. Those problems need to be resolved to facilitate the purposes of the act and the resolution of native title claims.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Finally, I wish to place on record my thanks to the staff of the committee, who have worked very hard in coming to terms with this new native title concept and the demands of the committee I also thank the members of the native title committee, who, despite their quite different views on native title issues and the Native Title Act, worked very cooperatively. It has been a good learning experience for all of us who were involved in this initial round of consultations. Hopefully, the knowledge we have gained will be useful when we come to have a closer look at the provisions of the act in the coming years.

          Firstly, I think that Mr Justice French is doing a very good job. The setting up of these liaison committees can iron out a lot of the wrinkles, so to speak. One of the criticisms has been the low threshold in accepting claims: that is, that a prima facie case does not necessarily have to be made out. It has been said that one could lodge anything with the Native Title Tribunal and it would be accepted. That is unfair. There is some uncertainty, however, and Mr Justice French has been on record as saying that an applicant is not required to establish a prima facie case in order to have an application accepted.

          Evidence was given by the New South Wales land council that there has been a good deal of uncertainty in relation to exactly what is the position. The making out of a claim for native title is a very complex issue, and it places a great demand on the staff of the Native Title Tribunal in accepting evidence and determining what is proper evidence. As Senator Evans said, a demand has been made on the various state land administration departments. That matter will have to be addressed.

          The matter of the non-claimant application has not provided the remedy that everyone thought it would. Certainly it has not been used by pastoralists or the mining sector, who have expressed concerns with the process. I recall that one witness highlighted the problem of having to go through the non-claimant process before anything else was done. That process held up any proposed activity or venture. The non-claimant process has some problems which need looking at. It has the potential to blow out and delay matters. It does not provide the quick result that some people said it would.

          With respect to cooperation from the states, it was a shame that we did not hear from Queensland or New South Wales. The submission made by the Western Australian government was most helpful and that sort of cooperation is essential if this committee is to fulfil its task as outlined in the terms of reference. The situation in the Northern Territory has to be closely looked at. Without burdening the committee with too much work, that situation could merit attention some time in the future. Also, the South Australian situation should not be forgotten.

The report contained 148 recommendations which were aimed at improving the administration of Australia's tax system. The committee's recommendations have been very favourably received by many individuals and organisations working in the tax profession. I am pleased to say that the government, too, has responded positively to the committee's recommendations.

          In summary, the vast majority of the committee's recommendations have been accepted and are being implemented. Some of the most significant policy recommendations agreed to by the committee are to establish the tax law improvement project, the aim of which is to rewrite and simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; to establish a small taxation claims tribunal to provide a cheap and streamlined review process for taxpayers with claims below $5,000; to sponsor the development of a charter of taxpayers' rights to better define the relationship between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office; to create a taxation ombudsman with the Office of the  Commonwealth Ombudsman to provide a discrete and readily identifiable avenue of administrative review for taxpayers; and to publish rulings issued by the tax commissioner in the Commonwealth

The measures contained in the finance minute in conjunction with those announced by the Assistant Treasurer will go a long way to ensuring that ordinary taxpayers are treated fairly, are clearly informed of their rights and have access to appropriate forms of administrative review.

          I believe it is vitally important that the momentum for change which has been generated by the committee's inquiry and by the positive nature of the government's response is not lost. Therefore, over the next few months the committee intends to meet with the taxation commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, to discuss the implementation of those recommendations which have been accepted and also to meet with the director of the tax law improvement project, Mr Brian Nolan, to discuss progress in the simplification of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

          The rewrite of the tax act is a very significant  undertaking, with potentially huge benefits for the Australian community. Although the early results from the improvement project are encouraging, I know that there are some in the tax profession who are concerned that the complexity of the tax laws will not be substantially reduced unless questions of tax policy are considered as they arise. The committee is inclined to agree that the best results will be achieved if the substantive provisions of the law are reviewed at the same time as the words are being redrafted. The work of the corporations law simplification program shows that such a task can be undertaken successfully.

         I am pleased to present to the Senate on behalf of the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the committee's annual report of activities for 1993-94. This report, which is the 334th tabled by the committee since 1951, presents an overview of the committee's activities for the last financial year. The committee began the practice of presenting annual reports in parliament in 1976. Prior to that date, the committee regularly prepared indexes of committee reports for the information of parliament and, less frequently, tabled statements of committee activities and procedures.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The committee's decision to prepare annual reports was explained in the 1979 annual report in the following terms—and I quote from that report:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In reporting this way to Parliament, the Committee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. This Committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the Parliament should report to the Parliament and has been in the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting.
        </para>
        <para>
         That statement is as valid today as it was in 1979. The period 1993-94 was a year in which the committee tabled five reports, published a discussion paper in relation to its inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments and gave its approval to a new set of annual report requirements for Commonwealth departments. The most significant of the reports tabled was undoubtedly report 326,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          An assessment of tax
         </emphasis>
         . The inquiry was a significant exercise which generated considerable attention within government circles and in the wider community. It is the committee's hope that its recommendations will lead to real improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of Australia's tax system.

          Other reports tabled by the committee in 1993-94 were: report 327, which contained the committee's comments on aspects of the finance minute in relation to the report of the Midford Paramount Inquiry; report 328, which was the committee's report of activities for 1992-93; report 329, which contained all the finance minutes presented in response to committee reports in the year 1993; and report 330, which presented the results of the committee's review of those reports of the Auditor-General which had been tabled in the period 1991-92.

          One notable development in the last financial year has been the committee's decision to give a renewed focus to its statutory responsibility to examine reports of the Auditor-General. The committee believes this responsibility to be one of its most important duties. The committee has developed new procedures to allow it to report regularly to parliament on its examination of audit reports. These procedures are described in chapter 4 of the annual report.

          Another highlight in the committee's year has been the approval of the new annual report requirements for departments.

I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat for their work in assisting the committee during the year. I commend the report to the Senate.

We are told that spare parts for goods re-manufactured outside Australia bear no sales tax and yet those re-manufactured in Australia attract a 21 per cent sales tax.

It may be that parties can agree that it is appropriate to bring this matter on today if those discussions that continue outside the chamber determine a particular course of action.

         What I am saying to Senator Faulkner is that if there are discussions taking place outside the chamber as to when this bill should be listed for consideration, and his intention is not to ambush the opposition, I suggest the best way to deal with it is to make the bill an item of business for the next day of sitting.

         The amendments are grouped according to subject matter and will be dealt with together when that particular subject matter is first reached in the bill, even if it is not necessarily the most substantive treatment of the particular item. The point at which the particular subject matter first arises logically seems the best place to have the debate. To the extent that complementary or associated amendments are involved, it is the intention that they be dealt with at the same time, even though they may not be formally endorsed until the actual clause is later dealt with.

        The Greens (WA) have proposed an amendment to the title because we feel that there are grave problems in presenting this bill without recognising the actual purpose for which at least the Prime Minister and the government say it is being set up. Instead of referring to it as the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994, which puts it in line with many other ATSIC amendment bills, we should have its clear and proper title at the front. Our substitute is:

       <para>
        We feel that is a much better way of describing this bill because, firstly, that is what the government claims the act is being established for. Secondly, we think that the omission of the word `dispossession' from the legislation as it has been drafted is one that should be redressed immediately in its title.

         If I may, I will speak to amendments Nos 1 and 2 because they are related as No 2 is a consequential amendment. The Greens support, in principle, the setting up of this land fund. We believe that it is an appropriate time in history to set up a land fund aimed at redressing the injustices of the last 200 years. We think it is a very important and historic principle to establish. If that fund were really offering Aboriginal people $1 billion with which they could acquire and manage land, then it would assume great importance, because the ATSIC budget itself is only $1 billion every year. If the fund made $1 billion available to Aboriginal people, equal to the current ATSIC budget, then we feel that the act should also be cited as the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Act and should refer to section 1 of the principal act by omitting the word `Commission' and substituting `Commission and Indigenous Land Corporation'—that is, measuring the significance of the act that we are currently debating by including it on an equal footing with the principal act into which it is being inserted.

        An Act to amend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 and certain other acts so as to establish a land fund and an indigenous land corporation to help redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders and for related purposes.

        That is the way it will read in its extended long title form. The government regards it as perfectly sensible for the long title of the act to be genuinely descriptive of the contents of the legislation, rather than just hinting at them in purely formal terms, the way it does at the moment.

         There is a further point to be made, which I am happy to make for the record. The language is to establish a land fund et cetera to help redress the dispossession of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. It is worth acknowledging that nothing we can do now by way of legislation or by way of payment of other forms of compensation could completely redress the dispossession. It is very difficult after 200  years of dispossession, marginalisation and maltreatment of Aboriginal people to talk in terms of complete redress ever being able to be satisfactorily achieved. At most, we can make some important steps in that direction.

         The Native Title Act itself is one such step; this is another major step in that direction. The further elements of the social justice package, when they come along, will go further again in that area. Over time, there may be still further ways in which we can address the subject of dispossession.

         We are claiming no more than that this bill is helpful in that respect. I hope that clarifies some of the concerns that Senator Chamarette was expressing to me yesterday with great vigour about the government's attitude to the general thrust and shape of this legislation. With the exception, unfortunately, of the opposition, we are in passionate agreement about the terms of the long title and we can perhaps now get on to more substantive issues.

         —The government does not think it would be appropriate to amend the principal act title in the way that Senator Chamarette has suggested. The proposal to include a reference to the Indigenous Land Corporation—but only the Indigenous Land Corporation—as an additional reference in the title of the principal act will be inadequate and misleading because the principal act, the ATSIC Act, establishes not only ATSIC itself and this new body, as will be the case after this legislation is hopefully passed, but a number of other corporations as well—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, the Torres Strait Regional Authority and a large number of regional councils. They are all established by the principal act.

         It is impracticable to mention in the short title to the principal act all the bodies that it establishes; and to single out one such additional body as a basis for amending the short title, whatever the significance of that body might be, we think lacks compelling logical foundation. For that reason, we would oppose the amendment.

Is the government stating by its unwillingness to support this that the Indigenous Land Corporation is just one of many other corporations? We are making the point that quite a large bureaucracy is being established. We have a new structure which has $3 million allocated to it each year. While we do not agree that the government should in any way be regarding it as a billion dollar fund—that is not the amount of money that actually goes to Aboriginal people for land acquisition and management—we still see that the government has established a billion dollar fund for itself that will be held by the Indigenous Land Corporation.

         This is not in any way to be taken as a downgrading of the significance of the Indigenous Land Council. We would be the last people in the country who would want to do that. It is just a matter of believing that it is inappropriate to expand the short title in that way. This is not a super significant issue, but I think our respective positions have been clearly placed on the record. We are not trying to put the council down.

        These amendments relate to the opposition's amendments Nos 9, 17 and 30 and deal with the principle of the separation of land granted by the land fund from native title land. The committee will note that the amendments state that the Indigenous Land Corporation, in the performance of its functions, must not hold or acquire, or enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to hold or acquire, an interest in land where the land is subject to native title or native title rights. This is a very important aspect because it separates the two pieces of legislation—the land fund legislation and the native title legislation.

         The committee will note that in the preamble it was said that the land fund was set up for those people who could not make a claim under the Native Title Act. The government recognised that there would be indigenous people who had a continuing association with the land and who could readily make out a claim. As I recall, the minister said something of the order of five per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be able to make that sort of claim. That left a vast majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who could not make a claim but who had still been dispossessed. That is, after all, what this land fund is all about.

         If we muddy the waters and marry the two, there will be confusion. What is more, we could well find competing claims within the Aboriginal community. Where land has been granted to a group of fringe dwellers—perhaps living on the outskirts of a country town—those people may find that they are subject to a native title claim by another group which has a continuing association with the surrounding land. We could find that we have a group of Aboriginal people claiming native title over land held by another group of Aboriginal people. That is a distinct possibility.

         Amendment No. 30 continues the theme I have mentioned and deals with section 47 of the Native Title Act. That says that section 47 of the Native Title Act does not apply to land acquired under subsection (1). It is saying that land cannot be granted under this legislation to a body of Aboriginal people or a corporation who can use the provisions of section 47 of the Native Title Act to fast-track a native title claim, that is, to convert it from land which was granted to them by the Indigenous Land Corporation to native title.

         One of the problems I have highlighted previously is that we might have a community that has been granted land and the elders of the community would like to establish native title. If a pastoral lease is granted to them, they can use these fast-track provisions of section 47 of the Native Title Act to convert to native title. Other members of the community might not want that, and that could well create some sort of division within the community. Senator Campbell and I have stressed this on a number of occasions in the hearing in relation to this legislation, and also in previous debates on native title.

         The question of converting land granted under this legislation to native title is a vexed one indeed.

Nonetheless, I believe it is sensible to keep the two schemes apart and not to risk confusion by overlapping.

         —I want to make clear that these amendments are not acceptable to the government. This is an old chestnut. It is an issue that has been debated very extensively in the context of the native title debate and also during the committee hearings on this legislation. The positions have been made reasonably clear.

         Let me say at the outset that, as a practical matter, there is no doubt that the corporation will give precedence and priority to purchase and acquisition of land that is not likely to be capable of sustaining a native title claim. The whole point of this legislation is to try as far as possible to redress the balance for those who have been dispossessed. Almost by definition, the primary focus of the legislation is aimed at those who are unable to re-establish their connection with land by means other than through this sort of acquisition program. That is clear. That said, it needs to be appreciated that to try to draw an absolute formal line of division between the operation of the Native Title Act and this legislation is fraught with difficulty, complexity and also some problems of principle.

         The first set of problems goes to the fact that there are some kinds of native title claims which simply do not amount to ownership in the same sense that will be possible for land acquired and granted under the scheme of this bill we are now considering. Some forms of native title claims extend only to rights of access—hunting rights and so on. To deny those people the capacity to have land granted to them, in effect, as owned land under the scheme of this legislation, simply because they have or possibly have a claim to native title rights in that very limited sense, would be seen as a travesty and a most unfair limitation on their capacity to acquire, in effect, full ownership.

         Equally, we may have over a significant or large tract of land a possibly successful native title claim applicable as to only a very small proportion of it. The piece of land is an integrated whole, but if we try to draw an absolute wedge between the two pieces of legislation we would have again the unfortunate consequence of the availability of that native title claim over a very small part of the land—in effect, denying the capacity for acquisition of the whole. Again, I do not think that would be seen as fair or just.

         A further consideration goes to the practicability of administering a division of the kind that is proposed by the opposition. It would create a nightmare situation for the corporation, constrained and restricted in this way, to have to satisfy itself, in effect, that there is no viable native title claim likely to be available before it proceeds with some other form of transaction.

         The opposition suggests in amendment No. 9 that the corporation could avail itself of the non-claimant application procedure of going to the tribunal and getting the matter heard, determined and the doubts resolved in that way. But that is an extraordinarily cumbrous process. Given the flexibility and the speed with which we would like the corporation to be able to act and discharge its statutory functions, we regard this as an unnecessary and unhelpful constraint.

         I come back to the practicalities of this, which is where I began. The pressures on the corporation to use its funds for acquiring land which would not otherwise come within the Native Title Act will be immense, because right around the country Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed, who have lost any connection with their land but who still have a hunger for it and want to re-establish that cultural, social and economic base for themselves, will be tremendously keen to be able to take advantage of this new legislation. The corporation will be tremendously keen to try to satisfy some of that hunger by those people. So as a practical matter all the pressures will be in the direction that the opposition and the government would want them to be—that is, a non-overlap. Nonetheless, it can be envisaged that overlap situations will arise. It is just an unnecessary restriction both in principle and in practice on the kind of flexibility and effectiveness we would like the corporation to have.

We just think that to try to formalise it in the way that the opposition has done creates many more problems than it will solve.

         —The Greens will not support these amendments, either, and for very similar reasons. We believe that at this point in history, where native title has only been recognised by white Australia for such a comparatively short time—the first action that was taken was the native title legislation last year which tried to secure and shore up all the other vested interests in land except those of the Aboriginal people but did allow a process to be put in place whereby native title claims could be dealt with—it is far too early to impose a restriction of this sort. We understand the rationale, which is simply to ensure that those people who will be given priority by this fund will be those who are dispossessed. But at this stage in Australia's history I think it can scarcely be stated that those who may possibly be able to exert a native title claim but have not yet been able to do so should be eliminated from the operations of this fund. Those are our reasons for not supporting the amendments.

         It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.

        Of course, that preamble was quite specific about why the land fund was established.

         The coalition feels very strongly that that principle should be adhered to and, of course, has designed a raft of amendments that seek to ensure that the ILC cannot go around hunting in native title country to buy land. I think we all understand that, so we have designed these amendments.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Some of the things that Senator Evans said require highlighting. Firstly, part of that raft of amendments does suggest that the ILC could use the non-claimant application route, which quickly became known in the Joint Committee on Native Title as the `Latham method'. It is a little hypocritical of the minister to now describe that non-claimant application as `extraordinarily cumbrous', because this is a procedure which the government is telling industry around Australia that it should avail itself of. Every time an industry spokesman says, `We have uncertainty about where native title occurs, so we are not prepared to explore or invest for mining', the government's response—and particularly Mark Latham's response in the other place—is, `You have this non-claimant procedure and it is quite easy: you just go and put a non-claimant application in and it is dealt with and all the uncertainty is cleared up.'

         The coalition is saying to the government that if it is good enough to clear up uncertainty in that way for the mining industry, it is clearly no less cumbersome for the ILC to do it. I do face the reality that the Greens, the Democrats and the government will not be supporting our amendments, so I will not delay the committee any longer on that particular point.

         What is interesting—and I am sure Senator Chamarette will be raising this later in the day—is that it has been good enough, however, for the government to draw a very clear distinction between native title land and land under the Northern Territory land rights act in subsection 191U(2) by making a very clear distinction about claims in the Northern Territory and ensuring that ILC land cannot be the subject of a claim there. So the principle that Senator Evans has held dear here has been emasculated in the government's treatment of the Northern Territory in that, certainly, the ILC cannot buy land that relates to a claim to land under that act.

         On the matter of principle, we do believe strongly that there is a need to assist those who cannot assert native title rights. We accept the government's view that probably only five per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians will be able to assert native title rights and that, clearly, there is a need to assist those others. With all the good intentions in the world, the ILC will be under enormous pressure to purchase land where there could be an overlap of native title. One of the practical reasons for that is that a lot of the Aboriginal organisations and individuals who have contact with land matters—land acquisition matters and land rights claims—are those people who are active and organised in those parts of Australia where the native title action is taking place at the moment.

We do not dispute that, I do not think. We are saying to the ILC that that is not the intention of this legislation.

         I would think—and I am probably speaking out of school here—that had this amendment been passed by this place, then it would have been the coalition's view on coming into government that we would review the action of this provision in the three-year review we proposed, particularly after a period of, say, three to five years when we had seen the native title situation shake itself out a bit, where the uncertainty relating to native title claims would, hopefully, disappear, where the Australian community would understand where native title is and what it is, and indeed the actions of the Indigenous Land Corporation would have become clear as well.

Of course we regard these as a very effective and practical way of testing the water in the standard situation where it is anticipated those provisions would apply. For example, if a mining company with an appropriate exploration interest in the land in question wants to know the status of that land before it embarks upon major potential investment activity.

         But when we are talking about a corporation with a large purchasing strategy extending over the entire country—multiple parcels of land in different parts of the country—we have a different kind of environment in which this provision would apply. Moreover, there is a legal inhibition—which I should have mentioned before—on the non-claimant application provision being applied when a person does not hold an interest in the land in question, unless that person is a Commonwealth or state minister. The only three categories of people who can lodge non-claimant applications are people with an interest in the land or those who are Commonwealth or state ministers.

But if the two systems run into each other, and someone decides to make a native title claim on that land then, whether it is successful or not, or whether it is waiting to be arbitrated upon, that would lessen the value of the property that person may wish to sell.

         I go back to my first point. This fund is for commercial purposes, as well as for other psychological economic reasons which the minister has mentioned. There could be a downgrading of the value of the place if the owners wanted to move on. It need not be a station; it might be a hobby farm close to the city. If the owners decide it is not what they want and they want to move on, the value of the property, in my view, would certainly drop if someone had come in and put in a land claim. So the owners would not be able to make a commercial decision to move somewhere else, unless an unending amount of money were available.

         —Mr Chairman, this amendment is an important one because it seeks to make clear the distinction between native title land and land purchased by the Indigenous Land Corporation. Those who oppose the amendment have a problem with the clarity of purpose of this legislation. If this legislation enables the Indigenous Land Corporation to purchase land which is already subject to a native title claim, it blurs the distinction between the fund, which is supposed to assist Aboriginals who are incapable of making native title claims, and the Native Title Act.

         One would assume that an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group which is capable of making a native title claim would have a lesser priority in calling on this fund than a group that is not. Those who oppose the amendment show that they have a grave problem with clarity of purpose.

         This amendment seeks to cut through that confusion so that there is a clear distinction between those who are able to access land by virtue of a native title claim and those who are not. There are very real consequences to blurring the distinction and Senator Panizza has already touched on one of them—that a native title claim could severely depress the market value of land subject to that claim. If we blur the distinction, the following situation is quite foreseeable: an Aboriginal group makes a native title claim, the effect of that claim depresses the value of the property and maybe even makes it commercially unsaleable; that group then seeks to access the fund to pick up the property, the market value of which has been substantially reduced by virtue of the claim.

         Of course, at some later stage it might be decided that the claim had no validity but this creates the potential—I am not suggesting that this will happen in a great number of cases—for dealings in land which we would regard as less than satisfactory.

         If this amendment is not accepted a big problem might arise for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups. Senator Campbell has already alluded to this but I wish to go into it in more detail. The problem is where different Aboriginal groups have competing claims to land. On Cape York Peninsula, an area with which I am very familiar, there are claims from different Aboriginal groups competing with the existing Wik claim. If one Aboriginal group in one part of the country makes a native title claim and another group seeks to access the fund to purchase some of that land subject to that claim, the result will be outright warfare between the two groups.

         That sounds like an extraordinary claim, but in places such as Aurukun and Kowanyama there is on-going internecine strife between people of one skin and people of another. All this will do is exacerbate tensions. It does not do anything to solve the lot of the Aboriginal community if these tensions are allowed to continue to simmer. If these tensions are exacerbated by virtue of the provisions of the legislation and by the operation of the fund, all that this will do is pit one Aboriginal group against another.

All we are saying is here is a way to ensure that that does not get worse, that we do not have one Aboriginal group pitted against another Aboriginal group.

         The government has said that this amendment has all sorts of thorns on it. Senator Gareth Evans said that one of those thorns is that it would take too long to access the non-claimant mechanism. Unfortunately, that is something the government put in place. The government put that non-claimant procedure in place. If it would take too long to access it, that is one of the government's defects in the native title legislation and that ought to be amended. But the government does not come before the chamber and say, `We want to amend it.' It recognises, from what Senator Evans said, that there are defects in that procedure.

         One of the other comments that Senator Evans made in relation to that, and I thought this was extraordinary, was that he believed the amendment would require the Indigenous Land Corporation to check that there was no potential claim over the land. That is not what amendment No. 3 says. This amendment says that the Indigenous Land Corporation must not hold or acquire land or enable persons to hold or acquire land where an interest in that land is subject to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 of the Native Title Act. This means there has to be either a declared right or a claimed right. But it would not require the Indigenous Land Corporation to go around and check whether any group believes it might bring a claim in the future.

         As to his last point about the corporation having to satisfy itself about potential claims, that is certainly my reading of the opposition amendment because a native title right is something which exists whether or not it has been recognised through proper process or whether or not it has been the subject of a formal claim. The right is there. The question is whether or not it is acknowledged, recognised and registered in law. Either it exists or it does not exist.

         Beyond that, I want to say that I think Senator O'Chee gives insufficient weight to the commonsense factor in all of this. We have an Indigenous Land Corporation which, let us face it, will have to resolve many potential conflicts between different claimants of Aboriginal groups and communities. It will have to prioritise claims somehow with a lot of clamour for simultaneous action occurring. In the case of particular communities living adjacent to each other, it will have to make some rather tough decisions, irrespective of the applicability of native title interests to the particular situation. We do have to rely on the good sense of the corporation that will be appointed and will be representative of indigenous people as a whole to get that right.

When we take into account the problems that can arise if we absolutely seek to exclude native title right holders from access to these funds, the issues that I spelt out at the beginning, then I think the balance comes down very much in favour of keeping the bill as it is.

         As to Senator Panizza's anxieties about land being devalued by a potential native title claim and spoiling its commercial utilisation, at least in terms of an on-selling transaction, I think it needs to be appreciated that this land has a lot of limitations on its alienability, anyway. People are only able to deal with the land with the consent of the corporation.

         The clear intention is that this, by and large, be land which is acquired on a more or less permanent basis. The possibility of a commercial rollover of a pastoral property or something is not excluded; the possibility for sale is not excluded.

If a question did arise about a competing native title based claim, then it would be possible for the corporation holding the land in question to itself take advantage of the non-claimant procedure in order to clarify the situation in exactly the same way as we have argued that other kinds of property owning interests should have that right.

It is not issuing exploration permits where there is any doubt about native title anywhere in New South Wales. I think Queensland is in the same situation.

From the equity point of view—and I can think of examples in the north-west of Western Australia, particularly in the Pilbara—there may well be Aboriginals who would have an interest in land, whose interest in the land from a native title right point of view has been extinguished because of past acts, and who may well be interested in purchasing pastoral leases or other property when they come up for sale.

         Let us take the situation where a group of Aboriginal people with some kind of incomplete native title claim to a tract of land want the Indigenous Land Corporation to buy that land for them so that they can fully and comprehensively enjoy it. Let us take the situation of a traditional group with hunting, or fishing or access rights to a piece of land—unquestionably native title rights constituting native title interests and recognised as such, let us assume, by the tribunal and a claim lodged.

         Let us take the situation that I mentioned before where a group of Aboriginal people have an unquestioned native title right to one small corner of a tract of land, but want to be able to acquire the tract of land as a whole and establish a pastoral business there, or something of that kind. If this particular clause were to be passed in its present form, the Indigenous Land Corporation would be totally inhibited from proceeding with the acquisition of that land and the capacity accordingly to grant it to the very people who would be wanting it. The clause proposed to be added states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In performing its land acquisition functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must take all reasonable steps, including, where appropriate, making a non-claimant application within the meaning of section 67 of the Native Title Act 1993—
       </para>
       <para>
        I interpolate there that the corporation would not have the capacity to make such an application technically if it did not itself, at that stage, have an interest in land. Leaving that aside, I will go on:

       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, if the corporation establishes that there is a credible native title right, either already recognised or in the process of being recognised, it would be absolutely inhibited, from the clear intention of the language of this section, from proceeding to the purchase because it would be utterly at odds with the substance of this section in that, having satisfied itself there was a native title right, it went ahead to purchase it anyway. It cannot do that.

         I understand what the intention probably was behind some of the speakers on this and what perhaps has made an initial impression on some people in this chamber. If it is a matter of untangling with some clarity in advance as to what land might clearly be the subject of a native title claim and what land might clearly not be the subject of any native title claim, it would be quite helpful, I suppose, as a practical matter, for the corporation to inform itself in that way.

         As a practical matter, as we said, I am sure that it would not be inclined to go willingly down the path of getting itself into a potential conflict situation between native titleholder claimants and other claimants of the kind that has been described. If it were just seen as an exercise in clearing the conceptual decks to avoid the possibility of that kind of conflict between two different groups, yes, one could see the point of it. But the clause, as it is written, has the unintended consequence—but the very real consequence—of inhibiting the kinds of transactions that I have described, for which the potential is very real in practice.

         One of the big problems is the twilight zone of people with some kind of connection with land, but maybe not enough to sustain a full-throated native title claim of a kind equivalent to ownership. So that is the problem we genuinely see with this clause. I really do think that, if this clause were to be passed, it would make an awful mess of the claims and aspirations of a possibly significant group of people.

         —I believe that the government is building a big, ugly, hairy-chested straw man in relation to its objections to this. The case that Senator Gareth Evans has just put is flawed. I will ask Senator Ellison to go to the core of that. But the fundamental principle here, particularly in light of the failure of the last amendments to be carried, is that there is now no specific requirement that the ILC cannot purchase native title land. So that has been cleared. We understand that the ILC in most of its duties will seek to give priority to the purchase of land for the benefit of those people who are not able to assert those rights. We do understand and share the view that there can be a lot of Aboriginal people who claim native title rights—it may only be a very small bundle of rights, including hunting and fishing, or just the right to traverse a piece of land—and that it is probably a matter of equity that they be assisted to buy a freehold or a pastoral lease and therefore enjoy full possessory rights. We understand that point.

         What we are seeking to do here—and it is as much a matter of equity for the Aboriginal traditional owners—is to require the ILC to take reasonable steps. If we look at the wording of the legislation, we see that it simply requires them to take all reasonable steps. It does not actually require them to even do a non-claimant application; it simply says that where it is considered reasonable, they do a non-claimant application. So with regard to a situation where they are looking at buying a particular property, Senator Evans would have us believe that if they were looking to buy something in a particular area, they would have to put up a non-claimant application and it would create some sort of massive bureaucratic problem by so doing. But this actually requires that when they are buying a property they take these reasonable steps.

         In many cases it may be entirely reasonable not to have to bother about even looking for native title because there may never be any native title likely in the area. But where there is likely to be native title in the area, where it is considered reasonable—that might be in the situation which I described earlier whereby there is a suggestion that there may be some traditional owners—they go down this route. Reasonable steps may well include having the normal sorts of discussions that a mining company will have anywhere around Australia. Sensible mining companies which are good corporate citizens, when they are about to do some activity in an area, most mining companies these days—I refer to companies such as Hamersley Iron, Western Minerals NL which now owns the Cadjebut mine and some of the other examples that we saw recently during the visit by the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title to north-west Australia—consult with the local communities. They get to know who the local traditional people are and they generally work very well with them.

         That is the sort of reasonable step that this amendment would envisage. It goes no further than that. It does not require the ILC to go any further than that. The ILC now can take the reasonable steps, find out what sort of rights exist and then proceed under all the other principles enunciated in the body of the bill. We think that it is only reasonable that the ILC be required to determine whether there are any other Aboriginals who can assert rights in the area. That is all that this requires the ILC to do.

         We consider it entirely unreasonable that the ILC would be able to go down this path without determining whether those rights do exist. As I said earlier, it is quite possible that there are traditional owners in the region or anywhere who may want to assert rights or who may need to be aware that they should assert rights. They will not have any notice provided to them unless the ILC has a specific requirement that it seeks to determine those rights. As I said, I would welcome a contribution from Senator Ellison as to the other fundamental flaw in the specific example given by Senator Evans.

         We felt it was quite reasonable that there be some acknowledgment that all reasonable steps should be taken to be satisfied as to what interests were present in the land in relation to native title. We did not realise that in our initial stages of agreement we had said that we did not support making a non-claimant application as part of the reasonable steps. Because we have not actually viewed these amendments in this form until today, I had not realised that they included that component.

         We are concerned that if the phrase `where appropriate making a non-claimant application' is retained, then it would automatically delay anything for two months. It may serve the opposite purpose for which it is intended—that is, it will not facilitate clarification of interests; it may block something being done that could be effectively done. So I am sorry that I indicated initially that we would be prepared to support that. Senator Ellison may be able to persuade me that I have again misunderstood what is happening. I do not feel comfortable about the way in which this amendment is phrased.

         —Firstly, in relation to the aspect of the pastoral lease that Senator Gareth Evans mentioned, of course, it is still open for the Indigenous Land Corporation to grant the pastoral lease to the dispossessed community or individual—in this case it has to be a corporation, but if our amendments are passed, it could be that—and that part of the land which is affected by native title could be excluded and reserved and set aside for particularly that native title claim.

         We are talking about native title where there is a claim to traverse the land or to hunt or fish. Those activities relate normally to specific areas. It is well known that in relation to these aspects in the past, Aboriginal people have used a tract of land—they have traditionally, historically, adopted a path they have gone backwards and forwards on, and have hunted in a certain area. That, therefore, does not take it beyond the realms of possibility of allowing the ILC to come to a pastoral lease and acquire the lease for the purposes of giving it to those people who cannot maintain native title but to excise that part of the lease where native title could be exercised.

         If the Indigenous Land Corporation granted the land to community A, and community A was dispossessed and did not have native title, and community B could maintain native title over that land, the two communities could be drawn into possible conflict because, naturally, the traditional users would want to exert a claim over that land. But other Aboriginal people, perhaps from the town, the city or wherever, nonetheless dispossessed, would be in possession of that land because the ILC had granted it to them—so there is a possible conflict.

         One could get around that quite easily by excising any portion of the land, saving that for the native title claimants and granting the rest of the land to those people who had been dispossessed—that is quite possible. In fact, in Western Australia pastoral leases have reservations on them. Some of those pastoral stations in the north-west allow traditional land users access to certain areas—wells and things of that nature.

         What I am saying is that the acquisition of that particular pastoral lease might not necessarily be impeded, as Senator Evans said. This legislation asks the Indigenous Land Corporation to take reasonable steps to ensure that it does not run into conflict with any native title claims. For instance, native title claims are pending in the north-west. Those have been made by various groups. It would be folly on the part of the Indigenous Land Corporation to go ahead and acquire land which is the subject of those claims for other Aboriginal groups because it would bring them into clear conflict. In the section which deals with the performance of functions, I think it is imperative that the Indigenous Land Corporation have some guidance as to how it should perform its functions—and this is a very important area—so it does not lead Aboriginal groups into unnecessary conflict.

         —The ILC satisfies itself after it has taken reasonable steps. The land corporation can look at a claim in an area. For example, on the outskirts of Kalgoorlie there might be an area where the ILC wants to grant land to an Aboriginal community. The ILC makes inquiries about the location and finds out that there is no possibility, or there is a very unlikely possibility, of a native title claim. It then goes ahead and acquires the land. The corporation has fulfilled its functions under this subsection because it has satisfied itself that it has taken reasonable steps. But if the ILC knew full well that this land was the subject of a claim, or that there was a claim pending by a group which had traditional ties with that land, and went ahead and still acquired it willy-nilly, it would be in contravention of this because it had not taken reasonable steps; it had ignored an existing situation.

         This legislation is for those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been dispossessed, those people who cannot maintain a claim for native title. In fact, the preamble to the Native Title Act, which refers to this very land fund, states:

        It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.

        They are, very clearly, people who cannot claim native title. So if we had a community which could lay native title claim to an area, it would not need the assistance of this land fund because it has the remedy of the Native Title Act. It may be that a group cannot maintain any strong claim at all and that it wants to claim that piece of land. The land corporation looks at it and says, `Well, we have looked at their claim. It really isn't going to get anywhere. We can acquire the piece of property concerned.' But, where a claim is up and running, it would be folly to acquire that land and then grant it to another Aboriginal group.

         This legislation says that the Indigenous Land Corporation has to take reasonable steps. It does not say,`You must not do this'. All it says is that the ILC must take reasonable steps to ensure that this land is not the subject of a native title claim. It is a judgment that it has to satisfy itself, not the world at large. So the ILC can say, `Well, look, there is a claim considered. But we are satisfied that this is not a claim which is going anywhere, and we can safely acquire the land and give it to this other community who are not native title aspirants.'

         If the inclusion of the reference to the non-claimant application is of concern to the Greens, the coalition could reconsider its stance on that. We are simply saying, `Take reasonable steps, including a non-claimant application.' That is not a compulsion; it is there by way of example. It really means, `Take reasonable steps, including that step, if necessary.' But if that is causing the Greens concern, I would be willing to defer the matter for clarification.

         —Mr Chairman, there has been some discussion around the chamber and it might be possible to reach some sensible agreement on this amendment. The difficulty is not so much with the Indigenous Land Corporation informing itself as to the existence of native title competing claims and building that into the judgments that it makes; the difficulty is with the corporation being hogtied by finding that there is some, perhaps only very small or marginal, native title right and, as a result, being inhibited from doing something that it and the people of a particular area want done.

         This is essentially a drafting problem and I think we can resolve it by changing the drafting so that, instead of the corporation having to satisfy itself, the basic idea would be that the corporation would have to inform itself whether these competing interests exist. In informing itself, it would be appropriate, if the corporation itself deemed it appropriate and if it were technically available, to go down the route of a non-claimant application. We could rewrite the clause as follows. The first line remains as is. It would read:

         Let me say at the outset that the question of the preamble to the Native Title Act has been mentioned many times. It is from that preamble that we have the very origin of this bill. I will not recite again that part of the preamble which relates to this land fund, but that is where it comes from. It is that part which says those people who cannot maintain this native title are to be the beneficiaries under this bill. It is fairly clear, but nonetheless very important, and it is an aspect which this bill does not address. It should be at the very forefront of the bill. It should be there as a guiding beacon to any reader of the bill as to where this bill is going and what it is intending to do. I notice that the Democrats have adopted words which are similar to the opposition proposal in incorporating this part of the preamble. To that extent, I think that is a good step forward.

        What he was saying there was that principles such as those contained in the preamble or the objects of an act are very important when deciding a case. He referred to the principles that are mentioned. Mr Fairlie, the president of that committee of the New South Wales Law Society, put this forward as a very important aspect to consider in how the courts will approach legislation. In his letter, he said:

        Of course, this can be contained in the objects. I think the opposition's amendment does that commendably. What we have in subparagraphs (a) through to (e) of the amendment are the very guidelines that Mr Justice Priestley had said are important when we decipher what legislation is for. He was not looking at this particular aspect but he was saying that we must have guidelines, in effect. What the opposition said here is that, in the performance of its powers, the following principles should be adhered to:

        That is, the money can only go so far and that if one is stretched, if one is a bit tight for funds, then one is guided by subparagraph (b) to look at those who are the most severely dispossessed. Subparagraph (c) of the amendment states:

        Those are very clear guidelines indeed as to how this Indigenous Land Corporation is to work. It is to make sure that it does not duplicate administration—that is, that it does not waste money on bureaucracy, on inefficiency or on duplicating functions, because if money is wasted, there will be less in the pot for the recipients.

         These principles make it easier for the Indigenous Land Corporation to function. I would say, with the greatest of respect, that it is to be preferred to the Democrats' proposal. The Democrats' proposal does not go that far in its detail. The summary in paragraph (3) states that the views of the bodies concerned, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and bodies, be taken on board. It does not talk about avoiding duplication of administration, it does not talk about giving preference to those more severely dispossessed if a conflict should arise, and it does not go into the detail, I would submit, that is necessary in offering guidelines to the Indigenous Land Corporation.

         The case that I mentioned at the outset was quoted by Mr Fairleigh in his letter. What he was driving at was that when the courts look at how a piece of legislation is to function, they look to what is in the legislation, what guidelines there are, what the objects are and what parameters are set. By including this in the legislation, we are making it very clear to anyone who comes after what this Indigenous Land Corporation should be doing and how it should be handling its functions.

         I think that the New South Wales Land Council, after a good deal of thought, has arrived at this as a very succinct way of outlining these guidelines that the Indigenous Land Corporation has to adhere to. As I say, the preamble is an essential part. It must be included in this bill, and it is not. That is a defect, which is recognised by the Democrats in their amendment. I can only say that the coalition agrees with the first aspect of the Democrats amendment which deals with the preamble, but not the remaining part of it, and I have already outlined the reasons for that. I would commend the amendment to the committee.

         —Senator Ellison says that he is indebted to the New South Wales Land Council for this amendment. I want to put on the record that we started off with a replica of that amendment from the New South Wales Land Council because we too were convinced by it and others that the bill as it stands gives no weight to the needs of those Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who have been dispossessed. The fact that the word `dispossession' did not appear was an important oversight.

         However, I point out to Senator Ellison that in acknowledging the New South Wales Land Council he did not see fit to take up its suggestion that all of the ILC directors should be Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. I would be interested in his explanation when we get to that part of the bill. I agree that we do need a coherent framework for the bill. We accept that with the ILC we are creating a very powerful body and it is important to specify what it must have regard to. But I think Senator Ellison is wrong in saying that my amendment does not deal with some of the specific exceptions he mentions.

         In part three of my amendment I am saying that the corporation must have regard to the existence and the views of community-based Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land bodies. In that way, I am drawing on their expertise; I am drawing on the opportunity to avoid duplication; and I am drawing on consultation. I think I am doing it more neatly; and I think I am doing it in such a way that the need to give clear guidance does not unnecessarily restrict the flexibility that the corporation will need. I do not object to Senator Ellison's mentioning issues such as keeping administrative costs to a minimum and avoiding duplication of administrative capability. They are important but I do not think the way he has spelt them out individually is the only way to do it.

         When it comes to a choice between the opposition version and the Democrats version, we very strongly prefer the Democrats version. It really all comes down to the presence or absence of one element in the two drafts. A lot of it is just drafting preference, amalgamating things together which are otherwise spelt out. But there is one thing in the opposition version that is missing in the Democrats version—subclause (b) of 191AB, which states:

        That is written not merely as a piece of guidance from which nothing follows other than the guidance itself; this will be justiciable. People will be able to use an alleged failure to adhere to this guideline as a basis for challenging decisions made by the corporation in the allocation of resources. With as much force as I can muster, I suggest that it is a recipe for a potentially absolutely divisive and disastrous series of conflicts—of appearing in the courts, and of generally inhibiting the capacity of the corporation to do its job properly.

         What the corporation is all about is allocating resources. What it will be constantly confronted with is the question of allocation as between states and then as between competing different groups within states. If the corporation has to satisfy some legal test of more severe dispossession in order to avoid legal challenge to the decision it makes, that has the potential for the corporation to get itself into very hot water indeed. If we are just stating it as something sitting around in the abstract which the corporation ought to somehow have regard to, we might be able to live with that. But in the very tightly drafted form in which it appears here and as one of the principles that have to be adhered to, it has a capacity to drive a coach and horses through the rational administration of this.

         Of course there will be resource allocation conflicts, and that is exactly why we are appointing a corporation to resolve them. It should be enabled to get on with the job, using all the wisdom, experience and commonsense its individual members may have accumulated over the years. We will certainly have regard to those qualities when appointing to the board. I know Senator Harradine has a certain disposition which says that commonsense is not something one finds in large measure in people charged with responsibilities of this kind. He may or may not be right, but I say to Senator Harradine that there ain't no commonsense in vesting this kind of weapon in those who might, for whatever reason, be minded to make life difficult for the administration of this particular new regime.

It has in it, for all practical purposes, all the other components of the opposition amendment. For that reason I suggest that as a responsible legislature we ought to support the Democrat alternative.

This is a land fund. It is a fact how much land people own or not. It was in discussion with an Aboriginal person yesterday that I realised that there are many creative and constructive ways of looking at this dilemma. One simply has to look at the communities in the region and see how much land they have. It is really quite easy to determine who has none and who has some. Similarly, there is a different level of availability.

It is a principle that says, `If a group is well organised and reasonably capable of setting its own standards, there should be some kind of partiality in the direction of those who have less organisation and less capacity to organise themselves in that regard.'

         There are two factors: one is the degree of land that is already in the possession of those people within that community. The other is the availability of land that comes up. So it is not automatic that any one criterion should prevail. There are two determinants: one is the kinds of lands that are available and whose interests are in those; and the other is the kinds of degrees of land that is already available. So there are ways of addressing this problem.

         It is important that there be principles that govern the distribution of this. It is a very simple and straightforward thing that should be supported. I am not convinced by the arguments that have been put up so far. The Greens will be supporting the opposition amendment, which, as the opposition has acknowledged, is that of the New South Wales Land Council, which has plenty of experience in determining differences of degree in relation to those who are advantaged or less advantaged within their own area.

         —Again we have the government making a decision to oppose a positive amendment which has the support of a wide range of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia. As Senator Ellison said, this is a beacon; it is a principle—just as is the preamble to the Native Title Act, which Senator Kernot in December described as a splendid preamble. She went so far as to say that the preamble should be incorporated in the Australian constitution. Much of what is said in that preamble, which goes on for over two pages, in the Native Title Act are matters that put some quite specific requirements and principles into place. Again, they are principles that need to be interpreted.

         The government has again built up a big, hairy-chested straw man and said that we will create a legal nightmare and the sky will cave in if we have this amendment as part of the preamble to this section of the act. It is simply not the truth, nor the case, that this creates any problem whatsoever. If it did, then the Democrats would not agree with the words `meaningful title', in relation to the title we are talking about, particularly in the first paragraph of this amendment, which we have both agreed on.

         If the government wants to talk about legal interpretation and creating a legal nightmare, if it is proposed that putting in the words `most dispossessed' does that, it could equally say that `meaningful title' does that. We all know the reason why the words `meaningful title' are in the objects—because the government could not live with the strictness of the preamble to the Native Title Act that this fund would be established to assist those who are unable to assert native title rights. As Mr Ridgeway from the New South Wales Land Council said, the main reason why this fund was taken out of that act and put into a separate act was so that the preamble could be avoided.

         The coalition's initial position was that that particular part of the preamble which has been quoted a number of times today should be exported out of the Native Title Act and put into this bill. As I said in my contribution to the second reading debate, the government has taken that part of the preamble to the Native Title Act and put a big red line through it. It is now a redundant part of the preamble. It is the most significant change to the Native Title Act which has taken place since December. The government has put a line through that paragraph.

         The word `meaningful' is certainly open to interpretation. Had the words `native title' been there, as they appear in the preamble to the Native Title Act, it would have been quite clear—it would have been quite restrictive and quite proscriptive. The word `meaningful' has been placed in there because it allows some discretion. It is quite sensible in some ways because it says, `We will assist people who are unable to assert meaningful title.' With regard to the calamity that the government and the Democrats have agreed can occur in relation to the words `most dispossessed', that term represents a very fine principle—to assist those who have been most dispossessed. It does not need to be finely interpreted. One does not need to go to the High Court and argue over who is the most dispossessed. It is a principle. As Senator Ellison said, it is a beacon.

         I do not know whether they are just being disingenuous or whether they do not really understand the way in which these clauses actually work but the truth of the matter is that there is a big difference between the general language of a preamble or, in this instance, the general language of 191A(a) which refers to the principles of dispossession. It creates a context within which the corporation should and will operate and creates a `bias' in favour of assisting those who have been dispossessed and, arguably, those who have been most dispossessed.

        There is a stark criterion to be employed and which is, by its very nature, testable in the courts. We all know enough about land council politics and competition within Aboriginal communities and the way in which these things have evolved so far to know that it will not be very long before this kind of provision is tested in the courts.

One of the most important principles—it is not just a principle—is that this is a land acquisition fund to address the dispossession of 200 years.

        In other words, if this small amendment is passed today, the government can make regulations that would exempt providers from part of the obligation and not simply from the whole of the obligation. The need to make this amendment has come about as a result of negotiations with which the Senate would be very familiar. Nevertheless, I will remind the Senate very briefly of the circumstances.

         In 1993 after the financial collapse of a large private college, the Commonwealth was forced to fund the loss at a cost of about $2.2 million. It was decided to strengthen the ESOS act to protect further students' prepaid fees. In December 1993, legislation was passed which required education providers to have trust accounts for prepaid student fees and also to be members of a tuition assurance scheme. The detail of these schemes was to be provided in regulations that had to be in place by 30 June 1994.

         The government finally tabled the regulations in parliament on 1 June, less than one month before they were due to come into effect. In response to massive industry concern, Senator Bell gave notice that he would be moving to disallow the regulations. On a motion moved by me, on behalf of the coalition, the regulations were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. In other words, we believed that disallowance alone did not resolve the problems and that, in fact, the Senate, through its committee structure, could contribute to what were the deficiencies in the government's proposed regulatory regime.

         As a result of evidence that was presented to the committee, particularly evidence from the industry which criticised the regulations as being unworkable, impractical and unfair, there followed further consultation between the government agencies and the industry groups. On 28 June, Mr Crean announced that the government had backed down. Agreement had been reached between industry and his department and changes would be made to the regulations and to the act.

         —I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1994, which amends the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991. In particular, I support the comments of my colleague Senator Hill, who outlined what has happened with this legislation and the subsequent regulations. It is a great victory for the Senate that finally we have arrived at this point. I would remind the Senate that this has taken some years—years that would not have been necessary if the government had been prepared to listen to the reasoned arguments of the Senate, in particular the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and also the main industry providers.

         We have finally—after two years—got to the point suggested by the industry and by this parliament. It was a rather painful and tortuous process. An enormous amount of work was undertaken by the industry and by this parliament to get to the position where we should have been in the first place. That is very surprising. It almost brought a sense of deja vu about what happened in this same area when I first came into parliament. Mr Dawkins as the minister at the time wanted to bring in draconian regulations to regulate this industry but he was blocked by the Senate; yet again, two years later, we have found the same thing happening.

         One of the most heartening outcomes of all this—as I suppose often happens—was that, despite what the government was doing, the industry still managed to boom. I think that was due partly to the fact that we managed to have a deregulatory framework early on in the piece.

         During the 3 1/2 years I have been in parliament, this industry has grown from a $800 million industry to one of $1,500 million. In other words, it has almost doubled in a four-year period. It was very necessary that this deregulatory framework which we started should stay. Despite that, and despite what happened in 1991-92, when we got to December 1993 the government proposed—yet again—to bring in more draconian controls, and in a way that was going to put up costs to the industry and force a lot of marginal providers out of business.

         The government legislated to establish trust accounts for prepaid student fees. We all agree that protecting student fees is an excellent idea but the way in which the government was going about it was by creating a tuition assurance scheme. It could not really define it in the earlier stages but it would have needed a reassurance proposal where the students' money would have had to have been protected in a system that would have added greatly to the costs of the business.

         One of the most disturbing things about the proposal at that time was that the government decided to create a regulatory framework and did not have the full details of how this tuition assurance scheme was going to be established, who was going to run it and the way in which contributions were to be collected. It said it was going to leave all this to regulation. This created a very dangerous precedent, not just in terms of educational legislation but in terms of legislation in this parliament. If we give away the right to give full scrutiny to legislation in this parliament, we are just handing the true role of the parliament over to the bureaucrats. As all members of the Senate know, if we do not put things in the act, if we put them in the regulations, they can be changed. We have a regulations and ordinances committee but its members cannot offer the scrutiny that this parliament offers. So parliament did move and, over time, has changed the whole approach to put it back into the act. That is precisely what the industry wanted.

         There is enormous concern by the different groups in the education export industry. I speak particularly of ACPET, which is in the area of business education; ELICOS, which is in the business of language education; the TAFE colleges and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. When this proposed change was put up originally in late 1993, there was not a great deal of consultation with these groups. When consultation did occur, it seemed that DEET was not listening. It had its own hidden agenda; it was still working on its command economy model out of the Dawkins era. It knew best. It was a top-down scheme; it was one that was not sensitive to the needs of the industry and was going to raise the costs of the industry.

         The net result of all this was that we had great uncertainty and interference for the period of 18 months and that is most regrettable. The government action was widely criticised by the industry and by overseas students. They wanted a workable framework for quality assurance and safeguards of student prepaid fees but they did not want the heavy-handed bureaucratic approach that was proposed by the government. The government's proposal was going to put up their costs and take away the independence of educational providers. It was going to hamper their international competitiveness. The concern of the Senate standing committee meant that we had a referral to scrutinise this whole process. We had a series of hearings where evidence that was highly critical was presented by the industry.

         An interesting innovation in Senate practice is that quite often we hold a series of half-day or one-day hearings where we bring industry representatives in and we have the government departments sitting there through it. They have to respond to what the industry is saying and then we have a round table conference to try to resolve the matter. That was not making much headway until DEET was finally mugged by the reality of what the parliament can do in terms of stopping inappropriate legislation. The combination of Senator Bell's disallowance motion and Senator Hill's referral to the committee was where the government really had a gun to its head and had no option but to cave in, back down and accept the recommendations of this parliament and the recommendations of the industry.

         The effects of this bill are that the government's anticipated regulations will now allow for a payment of 80 per cent—not 100 per cent as required by section 6A of the 1991 act—of prepaid tuition fees into trust accounts. This is what the industry wanted. It will provide for further draw-downs from the trust accounts of 25 per cent on commencement of courses and then weekly in arrears. Again, that is what the industry wanted. It takes into account the common practice of 20 per cent of the money being retained offshore before forwarding the balance to Australia. Under the system proposed by DEET the locals would have to cover that. It also allows for a non-refundable enrolment fee of $250 for administrative costs incurred by the local industry. This very satisfactory outcome is only possible because of the measures I mentioned above, and it is a real win for Senate scrutiny.

         The growth of Australia's international education industry depends upon the confidence that students overseas have in the quality of the courses they undertake, and the protection of moneys they invest in receiving an Australian education. The ESOS act was first introduced in 1991 following the damage caused to Australia's reputation by the financial collapse of several private education providers and consequent publicity overseas about the problems of students who lost money as a result.

         During the debate on the ESOS bill in 1991, the Senate watered down the protection offered by the act to international students. The limitations of the 1991 ESOS act were subsequently exposed by the collapse of further institutions, causing over 430 international students to lose their prepaid fees. The government had to refund $1.3 million to affected students in order to protect Australia's reputation. I notice that Senator Hill and Senator Tierney did not claim any credit for being involved in watering down the 1991 act, so that we again had weaknesses which cost  Australian taxpayers another $1.3 million, which is typical of the profligate attitude which the opposition has about public expenditure.

         Following college failures during 1993, the ESOS act was amended in December 1993 to strengthen the protection that the act offers to international students' prepaid funds. These amendments included the requirement for providers to deposit all prepaid course money received directly or indirectly from international students into notified trust accounts and to withdraw those funds in accordance with the regulations. Regulations prescribing the draw-down requirements of funds from the trust accounts and the requirements for providers to be members of a tuition assurance scheme—TAS—were subject to notices of motion of disallowance and later referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The notices of motion disallowance of the regulations were withdrawn on 23 August 1994 following acceptance by the Senate of Mr Crean's proposed package of amendments.

Providers will also be exempt from depositing an enrolment fee of no more than $250.

This bill further enhances those opportunities. The development of this industry is one of the great achievements of the present government.

The bill amends the Law Officers Act 1964 to allow the Governor-General to appoint a person to act as Solicitor-General during a vacancy in the office of Solicitor-General or in circumstances where the Solicitor-General is unable to perform the functions of the office. The bill also amends the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 to provide that, apart from an initiating process or subpoena, service may be effected in certain circumstances at the address for service of the company or registered body in the proceedings.

         As I have said before, the most contentious aspects of the bill are probably those aspects which concern the desirability of conferring powers of entry on authorised officers of the Trade Practices Commission. In this regard the bill amends division 1A of part V of the Trade Practices Act, which deals with product safety and product information. Section 65Q of this part confers upon the minister or authorised officers the power to obtain information and documents from a supplier relating to goods which will or may cause injury.

         This bill was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Some concerns were raised which did not relate directly to these amendments but to the provisions in the principal act. The committee thought that at some future stage it would be useful for the Attorney-General and for parliament to revisit the reasons for the original provision of powers for officers of the Trade Practices Commission to have the right to enter premises in the way in which the act now allows.

         I personally feel that there is an argument of justification in this area because we are dealing with public safety. We are dealing possibly with a situation where a product which is dangerous to the health of people—perhaps a toy which is dangerous to the health of children—could be released unless the manufacturer or trader concerned could be stopped at very short notice from doing so. We need to balance the civil liberties arguments that are being brought on behalf of the manufacturer with the argument of safeguarding public health. It is not an argument, in my view, that these provisions have not been used since they were introduced a number of years ago, because an emergency could arise at any moment. I believe that this chamber and this parliament would not wish to soften provisions which might prevent a tragedy in those circumstances.

         I comment briefly on one amendment which has become necessary due to a drafting error in the bill. That is in group 6, paragraph 65Q(3)(b), which was intended to add, `and in order to prevent the goods in question from being concealed, lost or destroyed, or from being removed from the premises.' This is a very good explanation as to why these powers need to be exercised and why they need to be there. Unfortunately, such powers are not given by the principal act and this paragraph, if passed, would have caused a conflict and made the provisions virtually inoperable. That was the advice of officers from the Attorney-General's Department and I understand that the government is moving to remove that. While it is obviously technically necessary to remove these words, I believe that they are a good expression and a good description of why these provisions are necessary. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill.

         —I will just summarise, in relation to provisions, that this Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 covers the areas of legislation of the Law Officers Act 1964, which Senator Spindler has outlined, and the Service and Execution of Process Act as well. They really are quite straightforward amendments and are very sensible indeed.

         The problem, of course, arises in the Trade Practices Act, and Senator Spindler has touched on the areas of concern. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recently held a hearing in relation to this. It came to light that there was some concern in relation to the powers of entry that some of these officers had—powers which really were akin to police powers. I am referring to section 65Q of the legislation. In my dissenting report to that report by the legal and constitutional affairs committee, I indicated that a complaint has been levelled by the Australian Federal Police Association that, under the present act, officers concerned had these powers without having the relevant training. Mr Law, who appeared for that association, was of the view that governments should be very cautious in giving any public officers powers of police entry or powers of police seizure where they do not have the necessary training.

         Members of the Australian Federal Police have that training and, indeed, are qualified to carry out those powers. Really, the section itself needs revisiting. As I understand the amendment, it limits the powers of the officers in some way rather than extending them as had initially been thought. Quite frankly, the section itself, which was brought in in 1986, ought to be looked at and we should query whether the officers concerned should have those powers.

         Evidence before the Committee indicated that there was a serious deficiency in the proposed amendment . . . Ms Johnson of the Attorney-General's Department gave evidence that the additional requirement could never be met. The amendment adds the additional condition that the entry must be required in order to prevent the goods in question from being concealed, lost or destroyed.

       <para>
        In evidence, Ms Johnson stated:

        It actually makes it impossible ever to exercise the power, in our view, because the additional requirement can never be met.

        That is an additional requirement before the power can be exercised and there is no power in the act to do any of those things. They cannot seize all the goods. They cannot prohibit the person who owns or has charge of the goods from doing anything with them until a few days later when the minister makes his prohibition.

        So we have a situation where the section in the first instance has some deficiency in that it affords too much power to a public officer. Then we have the proposed amendment, of which we have here evidence that it is unworkable. The government should really look at this closely. It is an aspect which needs attention.

         The other aspect of increasing penalties initially caused me some concern. However, I do not think that this really is sufficient to make a stand on. It is related to the penalty points that, as I understand it, the Commonwealth is now using. That is appropriate. The main concern I have in relation to this matter is the police type powers of entry that some of these officers have. That aspect needs review.

It is a document that has been fairly widely circulated, so I do ask the minister to bring this matter to the minister's attention. Obviously, the minister is not aware of it either or he would not be acting in the cavalier way that he is, but it is a 10 per cent reduction in fire safety personnel.

         I will cite the facts. Immigration data shows that in the 10-year period to 1992-93 Australia had a net influx of 28,000 engineers, scientists and academics in the science and engineering area and every year saw a net gain in these categories. The extent of this inflow can be measured by a comparison with the output of degree completions from Australian universities. The net influx is equivalent to about 18 per cent of all science and engineering degree completions in Australia for all of that period, that is, the equivalent of the annual graduate output of scientists and engineers from about eight average sized Australian universities.

         Mr President, some people might defend the ludicrous position of a brain drain by saying, `But we are losing quality people.' That is not true either.

As I said in this place on Monday, Australia obviously condemns terrorism in whatever form it occurs. This recent outrage is no exception.

Despite the shadow which the bombing of the bus and other recent acts of violence have cast over the peace accords which Israel has reached with the Palestinians and, more recently, with Jordan, we do believe that such setbacks will not succeed in reversing the process towards peace.

Continuing developments in technology and knowledge mean that our ability to manage and monitor our continental and global environment can only improve.

Is the minister aware of today's press reports that the Minister for Consumer Affairs will dump the government's origin labelling legislation rather than accept amendments from the coalition and the Democrats—despite comments from the ACTU President, Martin Ferguson, that the ACTU `is concerned about the inadequacy of the government's legislation and its major thrust'; despite public statements from great Australian food processors like SPC `that government legislation was a misguided approach' and Golden Circle's `concern at the use of the "made in Australia" label'; and despite the NFF's concern that `"made in Australia" should only be used to describe goods manufactured in Australia from Australian ingredients'? Will the minister give an assurance that she will not withdraw the legislation and act against the wishes of the ACTU, Australian workers, farmers, processors and consumers?

         However, I can understand the frustration that Mrs McHugh, the Minister for Consumer Affairs, may be experiencing at the moment. Not only is she introducing legislation which encompasses the internationally accepted definition of `made in', but she has also had problems trying to work out where the opposition is coming from. It was only a few months ago that what Senator Boswell is now proposing—the interchange between `made in' and `manufactured in'—was rejected by those opposite. The minority report of Senator Vanstone called the proposal that Senator Boswell is advancing both `confusing' and `senseless'. Given that backdrop, given the complexity of the issues, and given the fact that the opposition has not worked it out—maybe Senator Boswell is the lone cavalier on this—I can understand why Mrs McHugh is experiencing frustration.

It has that advantage as well. So, despite the array of people that Senator Boswell has mentioned, I put it to him that maybe his side has to work out its position as well.

As I informed the Senate on 19 September, it is unfortunate that FINA, the international swimming federation, has not yet been as willing as other international sporting bodies to work with ASDA and its international colleagues. I am pleased to say that since that time, and following pressure from agencies such as ASDA, FINA has requested information from ASDA about its out-of-competition testing services.

         The majority of the 15,000 competitors will come to Australia at least once between 1996 and 2000, both for training and for acclimatisation. In addition, there will be a host of world championships and other international competitions held in Australia in the lead-up to the Olympics. These athletes will be exposed to ASDA's out-of-competition testing program and to its range of educational materials.

I would love to have been in cabinet at that stage but, unfortunately, I was not—nor was I the Minister for Administrative Services. There has been no property scandal or cover up. All that emotive language makes him feel good, but out in the electorate and in this place he gets no credibility for running those sorts of lines without any substantiation. In respect of any documents that may or may not have been tabled, I have no brief on that. I will take that on board, and I am sure that when Senator McMullan comes back on the next sitting day he will be able to give the senator a full answer to that.

With the new policies of the Indian government, there are considerable opportunities, we believe, in road, bridge and railway construction where that government is carrying out major infrastructure initiatives. We are already the third or fourth largest investor in Vietnam. In Vietnam, as an example of our efforts and recognition of BHP, there will be an official opening of the Dai Hung oil exploration and drilling program. This is a program which, within 18 months of winning the contract and setting a number of construction records, has now got the field into oil production. That is a major advantage and example of the initiative and skill of the Australian construction industry, and one of Australia's major companies.

In the current drought situation, it is manifestly very important that the banks provide flexible arrangements to meet farmers' needs.

         Industry levies in this coming year will exceed $100 million, more than triple the $30 million contributed by primary producers just 10 years ago. The 15 agricultural RDCs will invest nearly $211 million of government and industry funds during 1994-95. A survey recently undertaken by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has indicated that around 3,000 researchers are either fully or partly dependent on funding from these corporations.

         This figure includes 430 postgraduate students, many of whom receive direct support through scholarships. These funds are allocated across the full spectrum of research activity, with universities receiving 22 per cent of total funds; the CSIRO, 23 per cent; state government research institutes, 38 per cent; and other research providers, around 16 per cent. Importantly, the traditional agricultural research focus on improving production is making room for research into other steps along the path to market. Only 56 per cent of funds are allocated to production research, whereas processing research now takes up 18 per cent; product handling research, five per cent; and storage distribution and market research, six per cent.

They are: enhancing the competitiveness and resilience of industries; developing a significant processing capacity to build on our comparative advantages; the development of industries oriented towards the demands of the marketplace, particularly those in the Asia-Pacific region; management of the natural resource base in an ecologically sustainable manner; and an integrated response to regional development and adjustment.

         —On Tuesday Senator Lees asked me, as the representative in the Senate of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, a question relating to the recommendations of the Joint Health Planning Committee. I inform her that 233 bids for funding were received by the Joint Health Planning Committee prior to the committee's meeting on Tuesday, 18 October. These bids totalled $78,578,790 for the current financial year and $217,530,534 for the five years from 1994-95 to 1998-99. I table a summary of all of these bids. All these bids, whether for capital or recurrent expenditure, are directed to improving primary health and the operational effectiveness of Aboriginal primary health services.

         The Joint Health Planning Committee consists of elected representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, community controlled Aboriginal health services, the Department of Human Services and Health and a National Health and Medical Research Council nominee.

         The issue is not one of verifying the accuracy of the jobstart card but confirming the eligibility of the job seeker and the vacancy. Jobstart self-canvassing cards are an aid which job seekers can use to assist themselves in securing employment. They do not contain commitments to pay particular levels of jobstart subsidy. The cards clearly state that to be eligible to receive a jobstart subsidy the employer must always contact the local CES to confirm eligibility and to complete an agreement with the CES.

        As Minister responsible, I make the decision on appointments before taking my recommendations to Cabinet, and then to the Governor General for a final decision.

        This system, as it relates to the review of migration decisions, was recently reviewed by the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Immigration Decisions (CROSROMD), chaired by the former Coalition Immigration Minister, Ian Macphee. The Committee consisted of Mr Macphee; Professor Julian Disney, Centre for International Public Law, Australian National University; Mr Stephen Skehill, Deputy Secretary, Department of the Attorney General; Ms Pamela O'Neil, Principal Member of the IRT; and Mr Wayne Gibbons, Deputy Secretary, Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It reported on December 11, 1992.

        The committee also endorsed the principle that the Tribunal should reflect a diversity of skills. This principle was stated by former Immigration Minister, Robert Ray, when he established the IRT in 1989. Again, it was restated by the Macphee Committee in Recommendation 7.9.1:

        The Committee notes that immigration issues commonly involve difficult assessments of an applicant's personality, capabilities and motivations and consideration of cultural and other social factors.

        As I informed the Senate, in the most recent round of appointments announced on 17 August 1994, I set up a panel and asked it to assist with appointments in Victoria. I also asked it to assist with the other "high volume" States—New South Wales and Queensland. I asked it to provide me with further information as to the applicants in those States. In the smaller States, where a limited number of appointments were required, I decided I did not need the panel's assistance.

        The panel provided me with information on a list of people that it had considered in the three major States. The list included one person who was not interviewed—Ms Radford (NSW), a person with a distinguished career as a Federal public servant and who was working overseas. A positive assessment was made by the panel on Ms Radford's papers. Mr Karas, the incumbent Senior Member in Queensland, was also reappointed without an interview.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am informed that all appointees made applications through the normal process. In States where I asked the panel to conduct interviews, only one part-time appointment was made without the panel's positive assessment. In NSW, only one person was assessed positively and not appointed. In Victoria, only two were assessed positively and not appointed, because of the limited number of positions. Michael Clothier was not one of these two.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to achieve a panel which could best advise me on the exercise of my discretion, I drew on the three most relevant areas. The panel consisted of the Principal Member of the IRT, a senior departmental officer, and one of my staff.

        Ms Pamela O'Neil has been the Principal Member of the IRT since its establishment in 1989. She was congratulated on her appointment at that time by the Federal Opposition, particularly by Senator Chris Puplick.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given that the appointments are totally within my discretion, the inclusion of a member of my staff on the panel was both desirable and appropriate.

        As noted above, I did not ask the panel to interview in South Australia, Western Australia and the ACT, due to the smaller number of positions available, and the more limited response from applicants. I made recommendations for appointments and reappointments in these States on the material before me, as is quite common with such appointments.

        As is evident, the discretion in all tribunal appointments is mine and I fail to see how it is possible for me to politically interfere with my own decisions!

        At least now I do have something to talk about. It was pretty obvious from question time generally that none of the ministers was able to answer any questions except those that were dorothy dixers prepared by themselves and distributed to their own backbench. It really shows the absolute contempt with which the current government treats this parliament and treats question time. It is supposed to be a time when the opposition can obtain information, but the ministers simply do not care or are not sufficiently briefed, or do not wish to be put under scrutiny at question time. One minister after the other was simply unable to answer questions put by the Liberal and National parties that were very much matters of great public importance.

         Senator Collins has given a sort of answer—after question time, regrettably. He indicates that this is an internal working document. It does not seem to be too internal; there seem to be plenty of copies floating around. But it is a proposal dated September 1994, and it is one that I would have thought Senator Collins would have been aware of.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Senator Collins used to be the transport minister and he has represented the transport minister at estimates committees on this side of the parliamentary building since he lost the transport portfolio. His answer to me today was similar to his attitude during estimates committees, that is, that he did everything possible to protect the CAA, to keep it from parliamentary scrutiny and to stonewall every question that tried to raise the issues that have become so current in recent days.

In Cairns, at an airport in North Queensland which I use quite often, the proposal is to cut the staff allocation from 69 to 63, again a cut of around nine

Similarly in Hobart there is a reduction from 29 to 23 and of concern to me as well, as a Queensland senator, is the proposal to reduce the Rockhampton service and the Mackay service from 15 to 10, representing cuts of 33 per cent in the firefighting service at those airports. With these sorts of services, there is a limit below which one cannot go and still have an effective rescue firefighting service at these airports.

         The fact that some of these airports are not as busy as others does not mean to say that the effort needed in the event of an emergency is not the same, whether it be a big or small airport. The way the CAA is proposing to slash the numbers of safety personnel in these regional airports particularly, but also at Sydney, shows that it has not learnt the lesson and is more intent on saving money than on saving lives. I hope that by raising that matter in the parliament, we can stop dead this proposal by the CAA to lower yet further the safety aspects of flying in Australia.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Knowles this day, relating to the Commonwealth Employment Service jobstart program.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        The question I asked during question time was why the onus was on employers to verify the accuracy of the jobstart canvassing card which is provided by the CES. The minister subsequently said that the onus has to be on the employees and that the jobstart card is not worth anything in terms of going and getting a job and obtaining a subsidy. Then why on earth have it? Many jobstart cards issued after the release of the government's Working Nation white paper are not worth the paper they are written on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I was advised by the very same minister that all CES officers were notified immediately after the release of the white paper on 4 May about the reduction in the jobstart subsidy rate and were told that the changes would come into effect on 4 July. A constituent of mine was issued with a card on 3 June, one month later; and that card stated that it was valid for three months from 3 June 1994 to 3 September 1994. The details on the card stipulated that she may be eligible for a subsidy of $200 per week for 16 weeks. That simply was not right—and the CES had provided that card one month after the Working Nation statement was brought down.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The staff of the CES continued up to the changeover date to complete cards for their clients which advised potential employers that the cardholder may be eligible for the old higher rate of $200 per week for 16 weeks; and the card was valid for three months from the date of issue. There was no directive to notify employers or jobstart clients prior to the changes taking effect. Surely some responsibility should be put on the CES rather than that all the responsibility should be put onto the employers or the unemployed. After all, it is the unemployed who are desperately trying to seek work—and many companies are equally desperate to try to provide work.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The CES—or, more importantly, the government—is abrogating its responsibility. This has given a number of employers a very false impression and jeopardised the possible employment of a number of long-term unemployed people. The minister simply washes his hands of the responsibility for these people by saying that the advice given on the jobstart card does not commit the Commonwealth to a particular level of subsidy. The simple question is, `Why give the card in the first place?' I believe it is quite unfair, especially when the CES was aware that changes were imminent. There should have been an amendment to cards issued after the details of the changes were released to CES staff to notify the client and the potential employer that the old subsidy would end on 4 July and that a lower subsidy of $100 per week, half the subsidy for three weeks less—$100 a week for 13 weeks—would take its place.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Likewise, cardholders who received cards prior to 4 May should have received written advice of the change. It should not be the responsibility of potential employers to verify every jobstart client's cards if the client is considered to be a prospective employee. Rather, it is the responsibility of the CES to provide up-to-date and accurate information about its programs in advance of the forthcoming changes to those programs. The difference in the subsidy, quite frankly, can be the difference between an employer being able to afford someone and not. And here we are giving the unemployed a card that quite clearly is stating the wrong information!

         What needs to be also looked at is the emotional aspect of this. It has been heartbreaking for this particular constituent and for many others who obviously have experienced the same problem. It is heartbreaking for those jobstart clients to come within an absolute whisker of getting a job only to find that the information they have been provided with by the CES and have subsequently given to a prospective employer is wrong. It is unsatisfactory that the government takes such an indifferent and careless attitude to the long-term unemployed.

         The government got terribly confused as to what people understood `Made in Australia' to mean. In a recent hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs this matter caused a great deal of concern. The ACTU/Food Policy Alliance said that it was `the unanimous considered position of all ACTU trade unions, all of the country's consumer organisations, most if not all of the farmer organisations and a very large cross-section of the Australian public' that `Made in Australia' should refer to something which is 100 per cent Australian.

         The Australian Democrats also had misgivings about this bill. What does this government do in the face of opposition? It runs the other way! The government will not even put the legislation forward. That is why the headline on the article says `Govt will dump rather than amend labelling legislation'. That is just typical of the government's attitude because it is dead scared of being found to have made a mess of things. I think the minister, Jeannette McHugh, needs to seriously consider her situation because all of her counterpart ministers in the state governments throughout Australia have opposed her proposals in relation to this matter. If she does not wake up to that, I think she ought to give the game away.

        I refer to Senator Collins's non-answer to my question, which I believe is a disgrace, considering the number of air crashes we have had in recent weeks. On 1 August this year a Melbourne doctor wrote to the regional manager of the Civil Aviation Authority—with a copy to the minister responsible for Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Brereton—in which he outlined a whole lot of problems that he had encountered in flying out of Broome.

         I will give a few examples. He pointed out that when the petrol switch was on, it was actually off; there was extreme vibration on take off which the pilot said was called `shimming'; the fuel gauge suddenly flicked to zero on one of the petrol tanks and the pilot had to furtively chase around and switch tanks; the pilot then informed the doctor that the reason the plane was flying so slowly was that she could not get the wheels up; she then said that they had to return to Broome, or to some other suitable airport, because she was concerned for the safety of the passengers.

         The doctor had a lot of praise for the pilot. He said there was nothing wrong with her. When the plane landed it was met by fire engines at the airstrip and they had to look out the window to see if the wheels were locked down. The doctor went on to say:

        On receipt of a copy of that letter, I wrote to General Gration, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. The doctor received a response to his letter from Captain Rick Davies. The doctor points out that it seemed to be a very reasonable response. Captain Davies wrote:

That is clear; it is in black and white. That is not the only reference to it in the report. If we look at paragraph 7.4 on page 9 we see reference to the fact that incentives were not paid.

        If the business units had been free agents in the market at August 1992, they would have been able to attract the average market incentives available as indicated by the effective rents outlined at Table 5, page 10. By this time the availability of incentives was commonly known to informed market participants. This action would have resulted in the units paying comparable market rents and removed the need for category A payments under the property adjustment program.

       The reason why this thing continues is that Senator Bolkus comes into the chamber and is poorly briefed—and I understand that.

I think one other paragraph he read to us was paragraph 9.78.

       That gives a little bit of a different spin to the comments Senator Bolkus made. Nonetheless, we can clear this issue up quite simply. Were incentives offered? Were they paid? Did they have the effect of distorting the financial arrangements of these business units?

        The government can solve this problem by tabling the letters. It is no good coming in and asserting, and then selectively quoting, that incentives were not offered when paragraph 9.78 shows that the business units themselves describe them as incentives. I put it to Senator Bolkus that it is vitally important that these particular letters be tabled to determine the veracity of what he told the chamber. I understand the Australian Democrats will support the motion of my colleague Senator Campbell. Hopefully when these documents are tabled this rather grubby matter, which has dragged on for far too long, can be brought to an end.

       I am sad to the say that the audit report does not bear that out. As I understand it, apparently the three tenant agencies in question were not entirely happy with the arrangements of higher rent with compensation through PAP. It seems that there is a glitch with PAP in that the subsidy rates are based on market rents which are several months old. At a time of falling rent, this meant the tenants felt that they could do a bit better out in the open market.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        In turn, AEM kept them quiet by offering them a package worth $3.9 million, consisting of rent-free periods and free fit out. Such arrangements are referred to in the market as incentives. They were referred to as incentives in correspondence between APG and AEM. They were referred to as having the effect of incentives in correspondence between APG and ACS. They certainly are an inducement to the tenants to stay in the building at rents otherwise in excess of market rental, even with the shonky PAP subsidy. Yet on page 27 the report quotes the arguments from the AEM people and from DAS as follows:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . the amounts were not incentives in the context of inducing the units to undertake something that would not have otherwise been undertaken but rather represented a package of financial benefits to the units for which they did not pay.
      </para>
      <para>
       On page 15 the report states:

       No incentives were provided to the business units even though the rental rates were based on the use of market incentives.
      </para>
      <para>
       Clearly that is doublespeak. I think we need to get to the bottom of this. The Democrats support this particular motion, but I foreshadow that I will seek leave to move a motion which will widen the inquiry to other properties which are controlled by AEM. There are at least ten of these properties which, I am told, may well be leased under similar arrangements. I think this is only the tip of the iceberg, and we need to get to the bottom of the issue.

        —in reply—I thank Senator Spindler for his contribution. I suspected many months ago that PAP and the dealings in Casselden Place were shonky. The Senate passed a resolution seeking these documents which would prove that the arrangements at Casselden Place were effectively creating a financial house of mirrors to cover up one of the biggest property disasters that have ever occurred in Australia, particularly in the Commonwealth of Australia.

        The ministers who are responsible for what is indeed a cover-up—even though Senator Bolkus said there was no cover-up and scandal—are Mr Walker, in the other place, and Senator McMullan, who has the leave of this place today. There was a cover-up, because the Senate passed on two occasions—specifically on 5 May and again on 10 May—a return to order motion requiring that these documents be tabled. Those orders were entirely defied by these ministers. They told us, if I may paraphrase them, that everything was okay and they were all normal commercial arrangements. Mr Walker said in writing, and Senator McMullan said in the

        The Auditor-General's report now shows that on those two occasions both of those ministers grossly misled the parliament. They said that there were no incentives, and tens of millions of dollars worth of incentives have been paid. The Auditor-General reached a conclusion on the construction of this house of mirrors and all of the financial arrangements. I do not even think high-flying merchant bankers of the 1980s such as Mr Connell, or even entrepreneurs such as Mr Bond, could have come up with such an interesting scheme.

        The minimum net result is that the Australian taxpayer has poured in excess of $103 million into this house of mirrors called Casselden Place. I am reminded of the debate we are having at the moment in the committee stage of the Aboriginal land fund bill. I thought Senator Chamarette might think of that. This government is pumping $21 million a year into its fantastic new justice package so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can buy land, and here it is pouring $103 million into its white man's land in Melbourne.

        I say it is a minimum of $103 million because, quite frankly, if the government had sought to minimise its losses one, two or three years ago—or even up to a few months ago—instead of deciding to cover up this property scandal, it could still have saved the taxpayer probably tens of millions of dollars. If it had availed itself of literally hundreds of acres of empty modern office accommodation available to lease in Melbourne, it could have saved millions.

          I simply argue that this motion is necessary due to the arrogance with which the bureaucrats and the ministers concerned in the Casselden Place situation have refused to give information which has been indicated to be important. It will be shown by the Auditor-General's report that this information is critical and that the management of the properties under the control of AEM has not been handled properly. It is therefore urgent that the Senate address whether this inquiry should be widened to other properties under the control of AEM.

          Let me also say to Senator Spindler that I find this a very curious motion. What we have here is the Australian Democrats—the party of `feel good, soft and cuddly and more to life than just financial management'—asking the Auditor-General to make an assessment of all these leases on the basis of one criterion alone, that is, financial effectiveness. What about social considerations? What about, for instance, in leases consideration of the fact that one may have to apply access and equity principles, social justice, child-care centres and occupational health and safety aspects? All of those things are ignored in this motion. What Senator Spindler wants to find out is where the bottom dollar goes and forget about the people.

He would not know. But I can say to Senator Spindler that this could keep the Auditor-General going for a good century or so. This motion reflects the lack of consideration that Senator Spindler has applied to this motion. He has jumped. He thought, `Wonderful! I can get on the bandwagon as well.

Education is essential to the social development of countries and the dignity and wellbeing of their populations.

         The concerns of indigenous peoples are important in the context of a program of action which deals with development and population. At Cairo we argued for explicit recognition of the needs of indigenous peoples in the program of action, not just because they comprise marginalised and disadvantaged groups in many societies, including our own, but because as they are custodians of values which reflect a uniquely durable relationship with the environment. Indigenous peoples often have a cultural and spiritual attachment to the environment which goes beyond economics, and which could be threatened by unsustainable development and some forms of population growth.

         Some difficult migration issues had to be addressed at the Cairo conference and it was important to achieve a balance between the need for national sovereignty, and recognition of the needs of refugees and migrants and the contribution that they can make. One issue that emerged with unexpected force in Cairo was the question of the right of family reunion. Few countries have recognised the benefits and desirability of family migration more than Australia. However, Australia and many other countries including the other traditional countries of migration, were not prepared to concede a right, particularly when its application to family groups was uncertain.

         Australia was happy to be able to play a key role in brokering a solution calling on countries to recognise the value of family reunion and to reflect it in their legislation, as we have done in Australia, and which refers to Article 10 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Member nations are committed to regularly assessing their progress towards implementation of the program of action and reporting on a periodic basis. Many of the goals set out within the program are ones to which Australia has already given high priority and the targets are more than met. In other areas, Australia meets standards at a national level but needs to continue to address the needs of particular groups, such as indigenous peoples, people in rural and remote areas and people from non-English speaking backgrounds.

         —I welcome the minister's statement on the Cairo population conference which was held during early September. It was the third such United Nations conference, the others being held in 1974 and 1984. The conference addressed the issue of the burgeoning world population. It now stands at something like 5.7 billion people, which is up from just 2.5 billion people in 1950, and it is expected to grow to 7.3 billion by the year 2015, even if growth rates can be limited. The United Nations currently projects a world population of 10 billion by the year 2050; however, with policies implemented by governments to limit population growth, it hopes for a stabilising figure of close to eight billion or a little less. Senator Harradine will correct me if I am wrong.

         —The conference was basically premised on an acceptance that high world population growth as it is is harmful to world development, and that one of the ways to improve human wellbeing is to limit or restrict the rate of world population growth. It is worth noting, and I make this as an observation, that whilst Senator Bolkus and the Australian government agreed with this premise in a global sense, as I understand it, they specifically rejected it in a national Australian sense. That is, they rejected limiting Australia's population growth and the concept that such growth inhibits rising living standards in countries such as Australia.

         The relationship between population growth and development appears to present a conundrum that many participants at the conference had difficulty coming to terms with. There is still a wide range of views and research findings on the possible linkages between the rate of population growth and the rate of development and depletion of resources.

         While not wishing to go over all the arguments here, there is evidence to support the view that in the developed world there has been a positive rather than an inverse relationship between population growth and economic growth. Whether that relationship continues today, and to what extent it applies to the developing world or parts of it—if at all—is obviously a debatable and highly contentious issue. That was one of the important subjects of the conference.

         On the one side there was the Vatican lined up with the Islamic groups, and on the other side there were the liberal Western and most developing countries. The former grouping was opposed to artificial limits on births. The latter was supportive, to varying degrees, of national and international action to limit births and hence the population growth rate. There were shifting sands, obviously, as the conference went on. Senator Bolkus weighed into this debate by criticising the Catholic church over its pro-life stance by saying that its insistence:

        In the end, no country at Cairo voted against the final draft position, although, as the minister pointed out in his statement today, the Holy See and a small number of other states entered reservations in respect of the chapters on sexual and reproductive health. The final position was one which emphasises individual human rights. It seeks, as the minister said, to empower women by better education, access to health care, and greater equality under the law in all societies—aspects with which the coalition would agree. The stress on education was also a very important point.

         While broadly accepting the conclusions of the conference as practical and constructive, I am concerned about the relative lack of attention that was paid to the development side of the conference. For instance, what weight was brought to bear on those undemocratic regimes around the world which suppress their people, and which were importantly represented at the conference? What direction was spelt out for opening up undeveloped and developing nations to investment and economic advancement? Those equally, if not more, important areas for improving the wellbeing of our fellow world inhabitants are left to forums like GATT and others when troubles arise.

I hope that the next world conference on population and development will pay attention to these matters because they go to the very heart of the liberty and wellbeing of people. After all, population is all about people. It cannot reasonably be claimed, in my view, that these issues are irrelevant in such a conference. The wellbeing of people in the broadest sense should be at the centre of our international attention.

Some of the programs aim at reducing maternal and infant mortality, reproductive health issues and nutrition.

I would stress however, that the Coalition remains strongly committed to family reunion and to humanitarian assistance. At the same time, we recognise the rights and the responsibilities of Governments to make decisions about their borders and the flow of people across them.

On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I am pleased to express our full support for the contents of the program of action which was tabled today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). I was fortunate to have attended, as a member of the Australian delegation, the United Nations Conference on Population and Development which took place in September this year in Cairo. I was particularly fortunate because those of us who went were afforded a rare opportunity to meet and discuss with a wide range of groups and individuals from around the world the increasingly important and interrelated issues of population, development, the environment, human needs and social responsibilities.

         With a world population presently around 5.7 billion and increasing at a rate of over one billion per decade, the international community had an almost overwhelming task of putting in place a program of action which would genuinely address these issues. One of the more startling statistics quoted by United States Vice-President Gore was that it took 10,000 generations to reach a population of two billion; and two more generations to double that figure. Across the whole spectrum of participants from national governments in the developed and developing world alike, to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and to smaller non-government organisations, there was a general acceptance that without global efforts to slow population growth, science and technology would not be able to redeem the future from poverty and hunger.

         The success of the conference owes much to the efforts of one woman in particular, Dr Nafis Sadik, General Secretary of the United Nations Population Fund. Dr Sadik is an extraordinary woman whose vision and personal energy are inspiring. It was largely because of her exceptional efforts that so much was achieved in Cairo. On the whole, the program of action is a realistic plan which, if acted upon, should effectively address the population and development challenges the world now faces. It is especially reassuring to find that the issue of what form of development we pursue is given serious attention in the program of action. This is one of the most vital issues the world faces in the next decade.

         The real threat of course is the overconsumption patterns of the industrialised world—and that includes Australia. One of the more startling statistics given great emphasis in Cairo is that even though the industrialised world makes up only 22 per cent of the world's population, it consumes two-thirds of all resources and generates 75 per cent of all pollutants and wastes. So the issues for us in Cairo were much more complicated than a mere desire to bring world population numbers into a suitable balance in accordance with nature's capacity to cope.

         There is also the need to address the runaway consumption of resources in the industrialised world and the development patterns that nations pursue. Population by itself is not the problem; rather it is the balance between population and resources. It is the unequal and the uncontrolled use of energy resources that makes life unsustainable. The program of action correctly recognises that the way we use resources in the environment has significant implications in terms of population policies.

         Serious attention was also given in Cairo to the importance of integrating women into all future development activities, in order to meet population and development challenges. Women as heads of households, as educators and, particularly in the developing world, as the majority of the world's farmers—a fact often overlooked—have enormous potential to reverse the process of environmental damage and to limit population growth.

         It is crucial that governments adopt the recommendations contained in the program of action which are based on the principle that successful population programs target the role of women in both the decision-making and implementation programs. Poverty and the low status of women are among the primary causes of rapid population growth and environmental degradation. Women are particularly dependent on children for economic security and thus they often feel forced not to limit their families, even though they might otherwise wish to do so. Rural women, in particular, are often forced to adopt environmentally destructive practices in their daily struggle just to survive—for example in such things as firewood collection. The world's poorest people have the least ability to engage in alternative economic activity.

         In response to these interconnecting issues of poverty, overpopulation and environmental degradation, this Cairo program of action has successfully focused on the need to empower women and to provide women with the necessary resources through technology, training and education. Australia has an enormous responsibility to now ensure that our aid projects give increasing emphasis to women's issues and in particular to empowering women. I trust that the government will move to recognise this in next year's overseas aid budget. In particular, this will require substantial increases in the funding provided to family planning, health and education activities for women.

         The Australian Democrats welcome the government's commitment to promoting non-coercive population polices as part of Australia's various overseas aid projects. One aspect of the program of action relating to family planning that deserves special mention is the recognition that it is just as important to include men in such projects as it is to include women. As the program of action makes clear, increasing men's responsibility for family planning increases the chances for success of all such programs. The twin objectives of empowering women and enlightening men to act on their responsibilities will lead to tangible results in the long term.

This is especially so because there was wide acceptance of the view in Cairo that indigenous peoples are generally among the most disadvantaged in the world today—and they deserve very special attention.

         As Senator Short said, the media tended to focus on the negative aspects of the debate in Cairo. However, the majority of us who were there, notwithstanding moments of extreme frustration at times in terms of the debate, would have come away very optimistic. Debates on any subject at United Nations conferences can appear to be rather protracted. One can see that there is a lot of rhetoric. One can ask where all this is leading. The conference, in my opinion, was very positive. It certainly has put firmly on the agenda the question of empowerment of women and the issue of women's reproductive rights. I am optimistic that Cairo will be seen in future years as the turning point in regard to issues relating to the population and development debate.

         —I thank the Senate. In relation to the need for a focus on resource mobilisation, I think it is true that a number of us felt that more might have been achieved in getting absolute commitment from many nations in regard to resource allocation. What influenced this was the fact that the United Nations Social Development Summit is to be held in Copenhagen next March, and it was opportune for some countries to argue that this question of resource allocation in relation to the development issues should be included in that debate rather than finalised at Cairo.

         I would like to conclude by focusing specifically on the resource mobilisation issues. We were all impressed with the delegate from Ghana, who said that we must curb the appetite of the developed world, which has become bloated from overconsumption. When we talk of population and development, we must remind ourselves of the inequities not only between north and south and between nations but within nations. The quality and success of population and development programs depend to a considerable extent on how strategically a country allocates its resources among various sectors. This, in turn, depends on the social, political, economic and cultural realities of the country and its population policy and program priorities. Parliamentarians attending a forum prior to the population and development conference which I had the opportunity to attend said:

        We accept the responsibility as elected representatives of the people to translate public support for population and development activities into the most beneficial distribution of budgetary, human and administrative resources. We take note of the strong international consensus on the need to mobilize significant domestic and external financial resources and endorse the estimated resource requirements set forth in the draft Programme of Action. Additional resources to population and development programmes should be made available by shifting resources, especially from defense expenditures.

         We therefore pledge to work to enact legislation to increase domestic funding for population and development programmes, as appropriate, and call upon the international community to provide the resources required to implement activities . . . At the same time, efficient use of existing resources is also important and should be pursued through such measures as decentralization, peoples' participation, a focus on target groups and an increase of national capacities.

        I found that one of the very interesting features of the parliamentarians forum was the call to action. In relation to United Nations agendas, I think it is important to recognise that there is not only a government role but also a parliamentary role. The Australian government has recognised this on a couple of occasions by including parliamentarians in delegations. I think this is a practice that should be more widely adopted by many countries.

         If the Program of Action is to be implemented to match the rhetoric that we all heard during the debate at Cairo, it will take parliamentarians across the political spectrum to closely monitor the activities of all governments to ensure that they always practice what they preach. It is very easy for countries to send along key government spokespeople to say what they believe should be the case in terms of a program, but it is what happens when we return to our respective countries that is important. Therefore, I would like to read a part of a document entitled

        I commend one of the first actions that has been taken as a result, and that is an initiative of Minister Carmen Lawrence, who has initiated a family planning review in Australia headed by Murray Coleman.

I endorse particularly the comments of Senator Bourne in relation to the priorities of increasing the recognition of women in our overseas aid program.

         I went to the conference as a delegate in the hope that, by so doing, the draft declaration could be improved. I had studied the draft declaration prior to going there and had identified five or six particular areas which I felt required improvement. That improvement could well have been adopted. In the ultimate, I attempted day after day to raise those particular issues within the delegation, and some sort of excuse was always given that these matters could not be discussed at the particular time I raised them. The issues I wanted to raise related to human rights abuses in population programs.

         Where there are target driven programs they are inherently coercive. My concern with the views that were being expressed was that the document should contain something more than just a simple statement about coercion. I believe that the declarations in the document about non-coercion required enforcement, and that such enforcement requires sanctions of those contravening human rights. Very often we will hear a country say, `We are not coercive. This is the work of some of the family planning workers and cadres that are over-enthusiastic'. We see gross violations of human rights—particularly women's rights. If we ask, `Can we visit these people in jail? How much are their fines?', we are told, `No, definitely not'. These people are allowed to do what they like. We need sanctions.

        I tried to raise these matters in the delegation day after day after day. I also tried to raise the question of finance. A draft program—which was finally endorsed; pretty quickly, I might add—required US$17 billion by the year 2000, US$18.5 billion by the year 2005 and US$20.5 billion by the year 2010. As far as Australia is concerned, in addition to the threefold increase in that area now, it would translate to a further threefold increase by the year 2000 and over fourfold by the year 2015.

         Time is running short, but I want to say two more things. Tensions did occur amongst the Third World delegates. Only  seven pages out of 114 pages were devoted to development. Development was nearly ignored. Tensions did emerge. The minister may not have heard them, but if he had been there on Saturday afternoon and evening he would have heard them. The tension exploded over the issue of family reunion migration. That was an issue where the delegates let off steam because they were concerned. One could hear them talking about the fact that development was ignored in this international conference on population and development.

         The World Bank, in a recent report, concluded in a survey of six east Asian economies that Thailand had not made major inroads into the reduction of poverty during the 1980s. It noted that Thailand's incidence of poverty was as high as Indonesia's, although the average gross national product per capita was 250 per cent higher. This is because development is uneven.

         The Khor Jor Kor relocation program involved the army moving villagers at gunpoint from forests to rehabilitate them. Rehabilitation consisted of clear-felling the forests and planting eucalypts for the Japanese pulp industry. Strong rural activism, widespread protests at these actions, at the murder of resisting villagers and at the arrest of monks who were protesting against these moves, and international pressure have all resulted in a review of the program, particularly after the overthrow of the Suchinda regime in late 1992. The program has been replaced by a royal project, however, which many Thais feel is equally bad. Another royal project involves the clear-felling of the last stand of native pine forest and the relocation of hill tribes in north Thailand.

         In spite of such efforts to undermine the logging ban, logging—especially the logging of teak—has slowed markedly in Thailand. Thais, unable to exploit their own forests, have turned to the massive extraction of forests in neighbouring nations, particularly Myanmar and Cambodia. The stripping of Burmese forests has had a devastating impact on the Karen people and is a source of many of the problems within Myanmar. Huge volumes of teak are taken every year, with no consideration of sustainability.

         The removal of Cambodian forests has involved the active assistance of the Khmer Rouge. In the face of the sanctions put on Cambodia in 1992, timber traders volunteered to assist in peacemaking. They cited their longstanding trading relations with the Khmer Rouge as giving them a good understanding with that group. At the time, the government showed its position by massively upgrading roads and border checkpoints to allow an additional 50,000 cubic metres of timber to pass to Thailand before the sanctions were put in place.

        This committee was set up under the National Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992, which came into effect on 24 December 1992. The committee makes recommendations to the government on matters concerning natural resources management and investigates and reports to the Commonwealth on matters referred to it concerning natural resources management. It acknowledges that landcare is a broad-based community concern that affects each and every one of us. Through its composition, it acknowledges that landcare is very much made up of a community based organisation, a community based movement, for both farmers and non-farmers, and that the wider community needs to be involved in the development of landcare policies and programs.

         We are over halfway through the decade of landcare and much has been done. Over 1,000 landcare groups operate across the nation and their work is to be applauded. The committee is of importance in providing the community's view on landcare to the government. It should be encouraged in this task.

         —I also rise to speak on the report of the National Landcare Advisory Committee. This report is worthy of notice. The NLAC has a wide role in advising government on the important issue of landcare. Landcare, within the scope of NLAC's brief, also includes water care, and is not restricted to agriculture but includes rangeland, forestry and urban environments. It can advise, as various groups can make submissions, but the government need not take that advice or even pass it on.

         We do not doubt the good intentions of the government on landcare. The government has been very supportive of the need for it and takes the issue seriously. We regret that the advice usually stays within departments and that the ultimate fate of initiatives is decided by cabinet and a small group of people concerned with fiscal management. The consideration of reports such as these is one of the few times the parliament actually hears from the NLAC.

         We note with some satisfaction that the NLAC is recommending several measures we have supported for some time. Section 2.2.5 suggests that more positive incentives are needed to encourage the adoption of landcare. I mentioned a number of such initiatives in my speech the other day supporting Senator Coulter's amendment to tax bill No. 3, suggesting that donations of natural heritage should be given the same treatment as donations of built heritage.

         Section 2.2.7 suggests a strong coordination and integration of all measures at all tiers of government. Section 2.2.2 specifically notes the need for work with local government. Section 2.2.9 echoes my suggestion that banks should be required to consider the management practices of farms or stations when giving loans, especially in regard to landcare. Section 2.2.11 notes that there are many options to mix an economic return with conservation by shifting to high value, low volume products and through properly managed tourism. Sections 2.2.8 and 2.2.10 highlight the ongoing problems of land and water degradation. Under section 2.3, the NLAC makes more explicit the need for urban landcare and suggests a separate body to counter the perception that landcare is only about agricultural farms.

         It is clear from reading this that landcare is more than this. It concerns rangelands—for instance, pastoral leases. The issue highlighted in section 2.2.3, the involvement of Aboriginal people, relates in many cases to pastoral leases and to the fact that in some states there is reticence to declare a pastoral lease held by Aboriginal people as no longer viable, converting it to some other title, and therefore eliminating the requirement for it to be run on a pastoral lease—something that can damage the environment while increasing the management costs.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The whole area of pastoral leases is of concern. Some of those concerns have been voiced regarding the desertification convention. The concern for water care is also important, and really taking that up a notch in terms of programs regarding water conservation, protection of waterways, rural sewerage programs, fringing vegetation and so on, could have major benefits to Australia, particularly if some consideration for water conservation in relation to drought was incorporated into the program.

         Something that has not been tackled by the NLAC but has been recommended by this chamber is that the NLAC should consider examining landcare in the context of climate change. What defensive strategies are possible and available? Are there ways to minimise risks to both land users and the land? Are there any areas or practices that can be identified as particularly important for either affirmative or preventative action? In conclusion, we hope that the general support for landcare will translate into an even stronger political will than the government has yet shown.

        The Australian Wool Realisation Commission is the body that was given the unenviable task of selling down the wool stockpile to meet the repayment schedule required by the government after the collapse of the reserve price scheme in 1991. The AWRC took over the Australian Wool Corporation's $2.7 billion debt and the 4.6 million bale stockpile, warehouses and related property.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The AWRC's main task was to discharge the debt in accordance with the specified seven-year repayment program by disposing of the stockpile. Its task was made extremely difficult for a number of reasons: firstly, the overhang of the immense amount of wool in the stockpile—over one year's production was there; secondly, the set repayment schedule; thirdly, the necessary transparency of the AWRC's operation, which made its business decisions extremely difficult; fourthly, the 1993 global recession; and, fifthly, all of these, combined with a high level of wool production, made the method of stockpile reduction and debt repayment a non-viable combination. It became essential for a change in stockpile disposal policy as a result of this. The government's Garnaut committee recommended that the AWRC be replaced by Wool International, a new body which has the responsibility of disposing of a fixed quantity of wool until privatisation, targeted for 1997.

         Within its charter, the AWRC operated as best it might, and can take some credit for reinstilling confidence in buyers and processors of wool that the stockpile will be managed commercially and responsibly. I commend Mr Bob Richardson, the Managing Director of the AWRC, for the way in which he carried out his role. His commitment to the job and his knowledge of the wool industry were recognised by his appointment to head the new body, Wool International.

         The wool industry is suffering from the drought, with the added burden of four years of prices that have made it impossible to have any fat to meet the present crisis. However, the conservative stockpile reduction schedule now set by Professor Garnaut, coupled with the world lifting out of recession and, more importantly, a confident wool trade, indicates that at last there is hope for this very great Australian industry.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At present the stockpile has been reduced to 3.5 million bales and forward selling has reinforced the optimistic approach to wool's future. The worry faced by the industry now is the very capacity of the Australian industry to survive this drought and to meet customer needs and expected increases in demand. The worry is that wool production will fall dramatically in 1994-95, although the clip forecasting people suggest that at this stage only a small fall is expected. I do not believe this. I would be surprised if there was not another substantial rise in the market indicator price in the next 12 months. That will make it very difficult to give the confidence that the trade requires and a permanency in supply.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Certainly, a substantial increase in price is something the industry can do without.

         One thing is clear: the stockpile reduction method must not be changed, and I do not believe it will be. Wool growers can be confident that Wool International is performing well. They can look forward to a valuable equity in 1997 when Wool International is returned to them in the form of shares. It will be a very happy day.

         —The annual report of the Anti-Dumping Authority is a short but interesting report. Dumping refers to the practice of selling goods at a price which is less than the normal value of such goods in the country of export. About 70 per cent of trade is dumped.

         The authority also deals with trade in goods which has been subsidised. Measures taken to counteract subsidies are called countervailing measures. Dumping and subsidies are seen as unfair trading designed to open markets to other nations through unfair competition. A duty is applied to such goods to counteract this attempt to distort the market. This is what the Anti-Dumping Authority does.

         An issue then arising is whether anti-dumping laws are mis-used by nations as a trade barrier. Australia has been noted as a nation with a very active anti-dumping regime, and this has been the target of criticism in the trading community. This is partially because few other nations have anti-dumping laws, frequently because tariff and other duties are more dominant. We have followed the practice of unilaterally stripping away virtually all tariff barriers, which makes us more susceptible than other nations to dumping and subsidy.

         The issue of anti-dumping gains greater prominence with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation or WTO. From now on, it is not nations but the WTO that will decide on anti-dumping and countervailing measures. As noted in pamphlets from the ministry for customs, this will result in technical but significant changes to our anti-dumping regime. There is also the issue that the Uruguay Round agreement imposed limits on the use of countervailing duties to defend against subsidised food and agricultural exports.

         The authority notes that anti-dumping cases diminished mainly because ICI was not bringing cases of dumping of chemicals before it. Indeed, inquiries have declined since 1991-92, although reviews of customs decisions are up. The report on page 2 notes the scope of complaints in the past, with enormous actions being brought against some 20 different countries. It notes that fewer claims occur but does not indicate whether this is the result of less dumping globally, the presence of a regulatory regime resulting in fewer attempts to dump in Australia, a stronger position of our industry leading to less concern with the level of dumping and subsidy, or whether there is some other reason that companies feel it is not worthwhile to pursue dumping and subsidy issues.

         This is because the Anti-Dumping Authority is essentially reactive. It does not monitor trade or attempt to identify dumping, relying instead on the private sector to make claims. The authority therefore has little understanding of why a reduction of claims is occurring, or whether they might increase. Opinion in the authority is that dumping has not decreased at all, and that the decline is a result of the attitude of both major parties against regulation of trade, and the more outward looking approach of business with global economic recovery.

         Clearly the behaviour of nations in deciding to subsidise, or companies deciding to dump, is going to involve factors other than statistical trend. They relate to international, national and corporate economics and the trade regulatory regime. This latter is a particular issue in light of the new WTO procedures for dispute resolution. In the past, the GATT required a unanimous vote of contracting parties. Under the new WTO it will be significantly easier to deem an anti-dumping or countervailing duty as impermissible. Along with lack of detail about the cause of reported changes, there is no real projection of the consequences of change in the international regulatory regime.

         I would like to bring up a final issue in the context of this report. One of the primary proposals for environmental regulation is that the lack of environmental controls leading to environmental devastation in order to hold prices down is a sort of subsidy. It is therefore suggested that countervailing duties could be used, with the money collected hypothecated to environmental rehabilitation. The Greens would support such a move, which would need some support from international trade organisations. Currently, or in the next few weeks, the WTO, the United Nations ESCAP, the OECD and UNCTAD are all having meetings of committees set up to examine the relationship between the environment and trade or development, and to consider means of regulating trade and development to slow global environmental degradation. We will be watching closely for new regulations that affect anti-dumping and countervailing legislation; we will also be watching the Anti-Dumping Authority itself. I suggest that other senators do likewise.

         —Yesterday I spoke of my concern about the evidence that was given at the Perth hearing of the inquiry into funding in CSIRO for agricultural research. I spoke about the fact that I saw two major reasons for less funding being available for general research, including agricultural research. One of those concerned what I believe to be the `commoditisation' of knowledge and information. This seems to be having the impact on individual scientists working within CSIRO—and this can be extrapolated to many of the universities throughout Australia and throughout the world—who are each working on trying to reinvent the same wheel.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Scientists might be working in the same department but cannot speak to each other because each is working on a privately funded project. Because of the nature of the patenting system, intellectual property concerns and so on, they cannot speak to each other about the work they are doing. They may be working in opposite directions but it may be that they are inventing the same wheel. It is also the case, it would seem, that a great deal of the time now spent by scientists involves chasing around after patents. Quite a considerable amount of time was talked about—perhaps up to 25 per cent. So we are having scientists dealing with areas with which they are not familiar.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We also have the problem that scientists who are not as familiar and as skilled in dealing with such issues as intellectual property may be putting public money into particular areas, and being done over by the process and the fact that other people are picking up their ideas and then patenting them, meaning that other people have the exclusive right. How does one patent an idea? How does one know that it is some person's idea and not another person's idea? How does one then restrict the use of those ideas in other places? This is having a real impact on general research here and in other countries.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other major point that I felt came out in that hearing was that in the attempt to require CSIRO to find a higher proportion of private funding, we perhaps have lost a lot of the impact of what CSIRO was established to do. What in fact happens, according to those people who gave evidence, is that a great deal of scientists' time is used chasing private financing, putting in submissions and so on. That means that actual research time is reduced. It also means that the people who commission research by CSIRO, and who then get fairly substantial tax deductions for doing so—so in reality it is mainly the taxpayer who has paid it; and I have said this in the past—have a very high proportion of control over what research is done.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It was estimated at this hearing that 30 per cent of private funding can result in 70 per cent control over the research that is being done. This means that more specific research, applied research, is being carried out for particular bodies, not necessarily for agricultural bodies or organisations that have the public good at heart. So it means that more and more resources are being pulled away from general research in a whole raft of areas, including the environment. This is a great worry, because we begin to wonder whether CSIRO, being pushed to get a greater and greater proportion of private funding, is actually wasting research money. A great deal of this is involved in management.

         Therefore, we have to really rethink whether or not we do need pure research. There is clear evidence throughout the world that it is pure research that leads to the most important discoveries in our society, not specifically targeted industrial research. We have to think about whether we want to be the clever country, or whether we want, for the sake of privatisation, to ruin this opportunity.

        When I looked at the annual report, I noted that at item 2.13 and 2.14 the Electoral Commission talked about compliance investigations and also investigations and prosecutions of actions relating to elections in previous years. I have been looking at these reports for some years, and I was hoping to have my memory refreshed in relation to an action which I recall being mentioned in the parliament about commissioners investigating some irregularities alleged to have occurred in relation to the Australian Democrats—I think it was in the New South Wales division.

         I was hoping that this report may have indicated the results of that investigation and whether any proceedings had been instituted against the Australian Democrats or any other persons in relation to those investigations. It may well be that the investigations are not yet complete. It may be that they are complete and action has been taken or they are complete and the commission has decided to take no action. One way or another—because it was a fairly important matter, and I understand there were some fairly serious allegations—I hoped that the commission would have reported upon it in this particular report.

         I move on to another matter which relates to the redistribution of electoral boundaries in Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. I am pleased to say that because of the continuing growth in my state of Queensland we have been allocated yet another federal seat, and the redistribution has concluded in my state. One of the roles of the Electoral Commission is, of course, for the preparation and production of redistribution maps and reports. I note at page 30 of the report that the commission is also charged with the responsibility of making the community aware of:

        In the Queensland redistribution, there was a reasonably minor alteration to the boundaries in the electorate of Herbert, which are based on Townsville in an area where I have my office and adjacent to an area where I live. I found it very difficult to get information of exactly where that boundary went. Certainly, maps were published in the newspaper but they can be, of necessity, only very broad maps. From the broad maps published, it did not look like there was much change in the electorate. It was only a couple of days before the objections closed that someone suggested to me that there was to be quite a dramatic change in the electorate, one which may or may not have had quite significant electoral consequences.

       <para first-indent="16">

         At almost the eleventh hour, I then tried to get copies of where the boundaries went—which streets they covered, which suburbs they cut in and which suburbs they cut out. I regret to say that it was rather difficult for me to find out where exactly the boundary went. I did eventually get on to an officer in Canberra, whose name I wish I could remember because he was very helpful. He went out of his way to find out the information and he sought authority from various people, which seemed a bit strange to me, but in any case I eventually did get the results.

         When I saw them, I realised that there was quite a dramatic change. I was concerned that the public of Townsville had not been told that part of their city was being cut off. A couple of suburbs in the southern part of the Townsville City Council were cut off, taken out of the Townsville based electorate and included in the Dawson electorate, which is based upon Mackay, some 400 kilometres to the south.

As it turned out, the Electoral Commission did hear objections. It did not take any notice of mine,

         As a result, unfortunately, the city of Townsville is now cut in two, with a couple of the southern suburbs taken out of the Townsville based electorate and put in with Mackay, 400 kilometres to the south. I noticed that the honourable member for Herbert, Mr Ted Lindsay, supported the application, because he thought the two suburbs being cut out were conservative voting electorates, and he did not want them in his electorate.

        This report is an interesting document. It is a bit of an arcane document, because not a lot of people take a great deal of interest in the operation of the Bankruptcy Act. The Bankruptcy Act is very important because it is one of the instruments of public policy which is used to enforce some sort of decent behaviour in business dealings. It is important, therefore, that the act operates properly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The report is also interesting because it gives very good statistical breakdowns of bankruptcies by state, age, industry classification, cause of bankruptcy and so on. One of the disturbing things that I noted was the large increase in bankruptcies in Tasmania, which grew by more than 11 per cent. More disturbing than that was the age distribution of people who became bankrupt in Tasmania in the previous financial year. Of the 656 people who became bankrupts, 285 were under 34 years of age. Ninety of them were aged under 25. That means that 43 per cent of bankrupts in Tasmania were young people. That is substantially above the national average.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It would appear, from looking at other statistical information, that the principal reason for the non-business bankruptcies would tend to be unemployment. That shows that it is the young people who are suffering. It is interesting that not just unemployment is being visited upon them, but also bankruptcy. That is a terrible stigma to have when one is a young person, because it basically means three years taken out of a person's life—three years in which they cannot start to buy a house or proceed to accumulate assets, all the normal things that people do at that age.

         We must pay attention to how we run the economy to ensure that that level of failure is not visited upon young people. There are other ways out, but one of the problems is that young people generally do not avail themselves of the provisions of part X of the Bankruptcy Act and become debtors under administration. The flow of information to them is not sufficient, and generally they do not have a lot of assets to put up for a deed of arrangement, a composition or something like that. So there is an unfairness which we are perceiving at the moment. I hope that it is something which will change over time.

         The other aspect I want to comment on—and I commented on this last year—is funding under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act. Funding under section 305 is intended to provide money for trustees to run legal actions in the estates of bankrupts where there are no assets. As honourable senators would appreciate, the best way for crooked bankrupts to ensure that they do not get pursued is to not leave any money in their estate. The trustees get appointed to a state with no assets; therefore, nothing can be done to realise funds to pursue the bankrupts for whatever unsatisfactory behaviour they indulged in.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Section 305 was intended to provide funding for that but it is interesting to note that the number of applications approved under section 305 has steadily declined from a peak of 237 in 1986-87 to 41 in the last financial year. The estimated cost of those 41 applications was a mere $302,000.

         If we compare that with the receipts of the registered trustees, which were some $54.6 million last year, and the receipts of the official trustees, which were some $28 million, it is very clear that the official receiver has received several million dollars in charges on the realisations that trustees are forced to lodge with the official receiver. Yet nothing substantial has come out of section 305 funding. It was always intended that the charge on realisations that the trustees must lodge was substantially to fund section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act. Yet a mere $302,000 was the estimated cost and the rest has been snaffled.

         I note from the report that the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy states that the operations of the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia are substantially funded by the taxpayer. I believe that they are also very heavily subsidised by those realisations and they are funded by creditors. But even to the extent that they are funded by the taxpayers, ITSA's operations are very important. As I said, part of the process of implementing public policy is ensuring that people who indulge in unsatisfactory business conduct do not get away with it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        I am interested in the Department of Defence report for 1993-94 for several reasons. One is the fact that consultants were employed by the department during the year at a cost of $53.3 million. One particular consultant is a company called Malindoqueen, a consultancy that cost the department $174,000. That company was the subject of a question that I put on notice to the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, from whom I received a reply this week. As the

        I further understand that the department was using Malindoqueen to ascertain the Indonesian navy's interest in purchasing high-powered submarines from Australia.

He says that, under the its contract, Malindoqueen is required to `introduce the department to higher Indonesian defence circles and obtain information about priorities in Indonesian defence expenditure'. Surely if that were public information it would be readily available. Is this an attempt to get information through the back door or some other way?

        I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the Australian Tourist Commission and to congratulate it on the work that it does. The job of the commission is to market Australia overseas as a tourist destination. Tourism is probably the most competitive market in the world. In Australia we have benefited enormously from the work of individual entrepreneurs, theme parks and resorts, all working hand in glove with the Australian Tourist Commission. They are a good combination.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Tourism has really developed right throughout Australia—in my own state of Queensland, from Cairns down to the Gold Coast and into the northern parts of New South Wales. However, it should borne in mind that while even with all that effort we get only one per cent of the world tourist trade, from our largest single market, Japan, we pick up five per cent. Yet there is an impression in the community that we get all the Japanese tourists, which is of course far from true.

         The Australian Tourist Commission does a first-class job. The people who work for it are dedicated. Over the last couple of months I have had the pleasure and the honour of meeting some of them. I met up with wholesalers and airlines representatives in places such as Taiwan and Japan and they all spoke very highly of the work done by the Australian Tourist Commission.

         There are, however, a couple of hiccups on the horizon, and I think they should be mentioned. The first is that there is growing interference by the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) in the work of the commission. Tourism is these people's job and they are measured by the results they produce. Increasingly, they are getting notes, allegedly from the minister, demanding reports be made. This is taking up an inordinate amount of time on work that should be done competing against other countries to get foreign tourists to Australia.

         The other concern I have, and I looked for this in the report, is that in my travels overseas I found that key people from the Australian Tourist Commission were leaving and going into the private sector. The reason is that the government has not seen fit to give flexibility to the Australian Tourist Commission to retain these people. They have been a very valuable asset to this country and it is important that their expertise not be lost simply because of the inflexibility of this government.

         The other thing that I want to mention—this was raised in recent days at the Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee by a range of people, including the chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission—is that tourism here may be in jeopardy because of a lack of accommodation. It was pointed out by Mr Iwasaki that Australia must address its dramatic accommodation shortage. He also said that it may be dangerous for Australia to become too conceited over having such rich resources in tourism. The well-known Japan Travel Bureau urged better planning of accommodation.

         Everyone has known that this problem has been looming for the past couple of years. The demand is apparent, and the question is often asked: if the demand is there, why are these resorts not being built? There are a number of reasons and all of them can be sheeted back to the government.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the reasons is the difficulties encountered by people who want to build resorts. This is because we have governments prepared to listen to vocal minorities whose threats throw the development of projects into jeopardy at the expense of the communities and regions concerned, and at the expense of employment in those regions. We have seen these sorts of blockages. Recently there was one at Byron Bay, and now there is the one at Port Hinchinbrook.

         In addition, there is the plethora of taxes imposed by various governments on an industry which is labour intensive. If our industry is going to pick up in a market which, as I mentioned earlier, is the most competitive market in the world, and employ these people, particularly the young people, these barriers must be turned around.

         All these factors send out terrible signals to financial institutions, which have been a bit nervous anyway in recent times, and prospective investors. Many businesses and organisations, such as the ATC, have spent a lot of time and money promoting Australia as a destination for overseas tourists. Unless these impediments are addressed, we as a nation will suffer and the real jobs which this industry has the potential to create will not eventuate.

         Senator Parer was correct when he said that governments—federal, state and local—have to look very seriously at the impediments they place in the way of these increased tourist activities. At particular fault is the federal government for the way it taxes the tourist industry and small business and for not being game, because of its close connections with the ACTU, to make industrial relations as flexible as they should be. Is it simply not able to do what it knows needs to be done in that regard?

         I also want to make the comment that the Australian Tourist Commission could almost be called the New South Wales Tourist Commission because the seven of its 10 board directors come from New South Wales, the majority from Sydney. Of the other three, one comes from Queensland, one from Victoria and the head of the department is in Canberra.

         That seems incredible to me. It is a bit like the grants for elite artists; the good artists seem to live only in Sydney. Apparently the people who know anything about the tourist industry seem to live only in Sydney as well.

         Whilst I concede that the board and the commission do a good job in promoting Australia, I do not understand why the board members could not come from other parts of Australia and lend the expertise and regional knowledge they would have to that board. I am not suggesting that the current incumbents are not competent and good at their job, but I am sure that there are persons equally qualified and who could make an equal contribution to tourism promotion who live in other states and other cities besides Sydney.

         I also wonder why, if this government is at all interested in regional development and decentralisation, the headquarters of this commission have to be in Sydney. Why can they not be in Ballarat, Bendigo, Port Lincoln or Perth? Why not in Mackay, Ballina, Coolangatta or Tweed Heads? Why not in Nowra, Alice Springs, Cairns or Townsville?

         These days these sorts of offices could be established anywhere. The support mechanisms are available in most Australian cities and, of course, with communications the way they are, there does not seem to be any real reason that this type of organisation, particularly one dealing with tourism, could not be established in another city around Australia. If that were to happen it would be a tremendous boost for regional development, it would be a tremendous boost for decentralisation and it would create a lot of activity in some other town.

         I ask the government: why Sydney? Why does everything have to be concentrated in Sydney? Is it because the minister, who is known to be one of the movers and shakers in the New South Wales Right, comes from Sydney? It is quite interesting that this minister is also the minister in charge of the arts, and he seems to have a fixation with Sydney and cannot see beyond the harbour shores when picking the best artists for grants and the best people to put on the board.

         I note that the board travelled about a bit last year and moved out of Sydney to Brisbane and Melbourne. But again I wonder why it cannot move a bit further afield? Why not have some meetings in Cairns, Nowra, Ballarat, Perth or perhaps Darwin? It would seem that that would be an appropriate way for this Sydney-based organisation to show that it is taking into account the interests of other tourist areas in Australia.

          —The third report of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operations of the Australian Loan Council was completed and tabled in December of last year. As the final report notes, the Senate inquiry proceeded on the twin assumptions that the Loan Council process itself was in some disarray, and that it was in the public interest that the facts surrounding the so-called Victorian loans affair be revealed.

          The committee's report made a total of six recommendations, and it is heartening to note that the government, in its response, has acknowledged the worth of each of those recommendations. During my time on the Senate committee, I took considerable interest in the question of accrual accounting, and the implications of that concept for accountability in government and transparency in public sector transactions. For those reasons, I particularly supported the committee's recommendation relating to the adoption of accrual accounting as a matter of priority by all state and federal governments and including Loan Council disclosures.

          In an important submission to the committee, Professor Bob Officer and Mr Saul Eslake from the Victorian Commission of Audit pointed to the deficiencies of current government accounting where accrual accounting was not used. They pointed out, for example, that accrual accounting would help in reducing the opportunities for window-dressing budget results by shifting cash transactions around balance dates.

          Accrual accounting is considered a superior method of accounting as it results in accounting measurements based on the substance of transactions and events rather than merely on cash received and disbursed. Accrual accounting results in better financial information, better performance measurement, better asset management, better debt management and a clearer picture of a government's overall financial situation.

          In its response to the committee's report, the government makes the point that the Loan Council itself could only move to an accrual system when all its members had done so on a consistent basis. I understand that considerable progress has been made on the move towards full accrual accounting by commonwealth departments and agencies, with the latter being able to report on an accruals basis fully by the end of this financial year. In addition, each state and territory has moved along this road to varying extents. My plea today is for all states and territories to give urgent attention to this matter and to fall in behind the commonwealth in this very significant reform of public accounting methods.

          Further recommendations related to uniform reporting requirements, auditing of reports and the making of such reporting requirements legally binding on the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments through an amendment to the financial agreement.

          I welcome many of the recent reforms to the operations and guidelines of the Loan Council. The important principles of greater disclosure and improved accountability, which I have already spoken on earlier, are of great significance. The Australian public requires and deserves greater accountability in all aspects of government sector operations. After all, it is not the government's money that is at risk, it is the money belonging to the Australian taxpayer. Public sector activities, whether they be current spending, capital spending or the sale of government assets, should all be totally transparent and subject to the most comprehensive guidelines possible.

          —This report is very welcome indeed. It is very thorough and detailed, and it pays a great deal of attention to the shortcomings of the citizenship act as it now is and the amendments that need to be considered by government. I believe that a very important first step has been taken. I wish to comment on two particular aspects of the report. One of them is the area of education and information for citizenship, and the other is the dual citizenship concept which the report recommends should be available to Australians.

          I find that the recommendations dealing with the educational information program are extremely well targeted and worth while—for instance, calling for an increase among all Australians of the awareness and understanding about the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Further, it seeks to introduce in the Australian schools curriculum a course on Australian institutions and history, the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship and the principles and values of Australian society.

          In some ways this is an extremely important emphasis. We all agree that people coming to this country need this information and, to a greater or lesser extent, efforts are made to provide them with that information. But during the last decade or so, I believe that citizenship education has been sadly lacking in our school system.

          I speak at schools quite a lot in Victoria. I have spoken to about 200 different schools in the last two or three years on the workings of the Australian Parliament. I believe that this is extremely important because I think the old adage that we get the government and the leaders we deserve is very true. If we ask people to vote in the political system without knowing the system and how it works, and the consequences of making certain decisions, I believe the concept of citizenship becomes somewhat of a mockery. I have found during those visits to schools, particularly during the last year or two, that class sizes have diminished. Politics or civics or whatever we want to call it—and there are different names being used for these various courses—have been made elective subjects. They are not part of the core curriculum, and fewer students apparently opt for these courses.

           Education for active citizenship 1989

          , which makes very strong recommendations that the Commonwealth initiate a national program in education for active citizenship. I regret to say that this recommendation, in my view, does not appear to have been taken up. There is really no evidence that our education system has responded to that challenge. I think that committee made a very good contribution to that debate. I note that Senator Paul McLean from the Democrats was a member of that committee, and it was chaired by Senator Terry Aulich. I believe it is a great pity that that recommendation was not taken up.

          . Once again we have a recommendation. The committee recommended that school systems identify, publicise and support existing citizenship education initiatives and encourage their extension to other schools. Once again, I believe that suggestion was not taken up. It was a suggestion very strongly supported by the Australian Democrats, and I note that Senator Robert Bell and Senator Cheryl Kernot were at various times members of that committee.

          I recall that some years ago, when I first became aware of the appalling ignorance amongst young people of how they can participate in the political process as citizens, I wrote to the then Minister for Education in Victoria, Joan Kirner. I received a reply saying that she agreed with me that it should be made part of the core curriculum—that all children should have the benefit of history, should know the duties, responsibilities and rights of citizenship and should have the opportunity of finding out how they can take part in the political process. She said, `But I have Buckley's of getting it implemented. I am sorry to say that I would not get it through.' I hope that this, the third report, will be treated better and that this recommendation will now be implemented.

          The other matter I wanted to raise in relation to this report concerns dual citizenship. I believe that generally speaking in the global community we are moving to a stage where nation states are diminishing in importance and where we more and more see ourselves as global citizens. In a sense, this is reflected in what is happening in Europe. We might soon, instead of having individual countries, have a united Europe. That is fine and welcome and probably would be a very constructive influence for achieving lasting peace and for economic matters, trade and so on.

          However, there is one situation where dual citizenship could produce a problem: when, much to all our regret, a country gets involved in a conflict. If a person has dual citizenship, and it is a dual citizenship that implies or constitutes some allegiance to a country with which Australia may be in conflict, how is that resolved and would it be that, automatically, these people would be interned?

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This leads me to the thought that, while we should allow people to enjoy the benefits of dual citizenship and the privileges this might offer in other countries, we should also, very importantly, make it quite clear that an Australian citizen, first and foremost, owes allegiance to Australia, that this must be the overriding commitment, and this is so because that was the last declaration of allegiance that was made by that person. I believe this concept will be discussed and debated in future. It is a sound development. Above all, we must be certain that we are building a national identity which depends on the commitment of all citizens to this country of ours—Australia.

        —by leave—I thank the Senate for its indulgence. This is the report, of course, that reveals the scandal relating to the Casselden Place Building in Melbourne, where the federal Labor government has lost $103 million of taxpayers' money. This has been the subject of a return to order by the Senate earlier this day when Senator Bolkus, the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, was required to table by 5.00 p.m. this day three specific documents referred to in section 9.78 of the Auditor-General's report.

        As all honourable senators would be aware, it is now 10 minutes past six and these documents have not been tabled. So the Senate can quite rightly ask: why is the government continuing to seek to cover up this scandal in Melbourne? That is the question that all honourable senators should be asking this government.

        Not only does this report reveal that the Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. Frank Walker QC, misled this parliament by saying in a letter addressed to Senator McMullan and dated 4 May that no incentives were provided to the occupants of Casselden Place when the Auditor-General's report shows that incentives were offered, but it also proves that Senator McMullan misled the Senate and therefore the parliament when he reiterated the statement made by Mr Walker. Those two ministers are condemned for misleading this parliament.

        They are further condemned for continuing the cover-up of a property scandal of the proportions of WA Inc. conducted under the auspices of a federal Labor government. It is probably appropriate that this scandal took place in the city of Melbourne at a time when Premier Cain and then Premier Kirner were in charge and were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year of Victorian taxpayers' money.

        The cover-up has now been further compounded by Senator Bolkus who, in responding to the motion that he be required to table these three letters—letters that have been cited and referred to by the Auditor-General in confirming that the department called these  financial inducements incentives—said that we can pass the motion if we like but we should not count on getting the documents.

        That is the contempt that Senator McMullan has for this chamber. It has been compounded by Senator Bolkus. It was also compounded by Mr Walker when he said that the Senate is not entitled to this information. It is a contempt of this parliament but, more importantly, it is a contempt of the people of Australia who expect that a federal government will not only run its operations on sound business principles but be accountable for the expenditure of taxpayers' money to the people through the parliament. This government has shown absolute contempt for the people of Australia in, firstly, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars in this case and, secondly, refusing to allow the Senate and the parliament of Australia to properly scrutinise the government's financial dealings.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        In rising to speak about this report tonight I specifically want to say that Senator Bolkus stands condemned for not complying with the order of the Senate to table these three letters. This is a continuation of a cover-up of a multimillion dollar Australian Labor Party financial mismanagement scandal. These ministers have continued to defy orders of the Senate and have misled the parliament now on two or three occasions about, firstly, the size of the loss; secondly, whether incentives were involved—the Auditor-General said they were; and, thirdly, the dealings within the building. Senator McMullan said that those dealings were all commercial and were all at arm's length and there was nothing to worry about. This Senate has uncovered a multimillion dollar scandal involving the federal Labor government.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I believe we should take quite seriously the actions of a minister who misleads this parliament. It is now quite clear that both Mr Walker and Senator McMullan have misled the Senate on at least one occasion—quite possibly two. The Senate should regard the behaviour of these ministers as most serious breaches of their ministerial responsibility. Senator McMullan is away at the moment, so he cannot defend himself. But, when the Senate resumes in a fortnight's time, he should certainly be required to make an explanation as to, firstly, why he keeps continuing to cover up the scandal and, secondly, why he misled parliament.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Failing a proper explanation of these matters, I can see absolutely no reason why Senator McMullan and Mr Walker should not resign their positions as ministers. This should be regarded as a most serious breach of their responsibilities. Either they misled the Senate knowingly and, therefore, created what should be a hanging offence for a minister; or, if they did so unknowingly, they breached their ministerial responsibility because they certainly should have been responsible for the actions of their department—particularly bearing in mind that the Senate has raised these matters over a period of many months and all we have got as a response from the government is a covering up, just a continual refusal to table the documents.

        —by leave—I thank the minister for his courtesy in sending me a copy of the document so that I could have a look at what he was going to table. I appreciate that. However, a lot of the documents which the Senate requested are not being tabled. The government is claiming commercial-in-confidence for a lot of the documents. I find this absolutely extraordinary. This is about a company—ANL—that the minister said on 22 August could not be given away. The Senate was seeking documents relating to the relationship between the minister and the company prior to 22 August. At that time the government's judgment was that the company could not be given away; that it was worthless. I fail to see why documents relating to a relationship between the minister and that company should not be tabled.

        A couple of weeks ago we had correspondence between the minister and the company tabled. Those documents quite clearly show that there was a not very healthy relationship between the minister and the company. The minister's handling of this whole operation since early this year has been poor. That is why the Senate wanted to see the documents—to find out what had been going on. For the government to complain that these are commercial-in-confidence documents that will affect the operation of ANL, when it said on 22 August that the company was worth nothing and we wanted documents prior to then, does not make sense.

        The Senate should note that in February this year the government changed the articles of association of this company, whereupon the government insisted that any decisions that affected the potential sale value of the company had to go through the minister. That meant that from February the minister was, in fact, in charge of the company and was directly responsible for what happened. The documents previously tabled clearly show that the minister was not responding to management, so there was a lot of responsibility lying on the minister's plate. He obviously was responsible for the poor shape of the company when he made the claim on 22 August that the company could not be given away. I express the strongest displeasure to the government for not tabling these documents in the Senate.

         —I want to speak to amendment No. 1 that has been moved by Senator Ellison to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. Prior to the luncheon adjournment I said that it was noteworthy that the government had failed to include in the bill not only the objects of the legislation but also the principles of the legislation. I think it was Senator Campbell who pointed out that, in a judgment handed down in New South Wales, it became evident that the objects of the Native Title Act were quite important. That point needs to be noted: the government did not include in the bill the objects of the legislation, much less the principles of the legislation.

         The question then arises as to whether the objects and the principles as proposed by Senator Ellison are to be supported, or whether the objects as outlined by Senator Kernot should be supported. At least the opposition, the Democrats, the Greens and I all believe that the objects of the legislation should be in the bill. I also happen to believe that the legislation should outline principles which should be adhered to. The government has indicated, through Senator Evans, that the major concern that it has is with new paragraph 191AB(b), which reads:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        (b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources, preference is to be given to those Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands;
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are going to have the objects as outlined in the opposition's amendment, it therefore follows logically that we should have some principles to be adhered to. The principle outlined in 191AB(b) seems to me to follow logically from the objects. I refer the Senate to the fact that the background of Senator Ellison's amendment states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is important to recognise that many Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert meaningful title to those lands and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.
       </para>
       <para>
        Correct me if I am wrong, but I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated something similar. I do not know whether it was in those precise terms, but he certainly stated something similar. He certainly used the words `dispossessed from their lands'. The next paragraph goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Therefore, the object of this Part is to assist those dispossessed Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations through the acquisition and management of land.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those words also echo in my ears as not being original, but are understood and accepted by most of the community. The next paragraph indicates:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To give effect to that object, this Part establishes a fund, known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, and a corporation, known as the Indigenous Land Corporation, to facilitate the acquisition and management of land for those Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we recognise the fact that, because Aboriginal persons have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, certain things flow in order to assist those dispossessed Aboriginal persons meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations through acquisition and management of land, there should be no opposition, in principle, to meeting the economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations of those who have been most severely dispossessed.

         If we are talking about the results of dispossession or if we are talking about assistance, as distinct from justice, then we really have to ask: who are those most in need? We hear this from the government all the time. It talks about those who are most in need. If we accept the objects proposed by Senator Ellison and Senator Kernot and if we accept that, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, we need to meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations, there seems to be no logical reason to oppose, in principle, the proposition contained in 191AB(b).

         We then get to the practical situation. It has been put by the minister, and others, that this provision will cause untold delays and will eat into the already limited amounts that have been earmarked for the fund. It has been put to me by people, for whose views I have the utmost respect, that acceptance of the amendment would undoubtedly lead to irreconcilable conflict and division amongst Aboriginal communities and scarce resources having to be channelled into challenging and defending board decisions which would, in practice, also have the effect of paralysing the ILC.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I have to accept that that is a possibility but, in my view, that sort of possibility has to be put into the scales. The other scale contains the principle of social justice and the principle of natural justice. In my view, it comes down to those principles. If there are Aboriginal persons who are aggrieved by decisions of the ILC, surely they should have the assurance that the allocation of resources has some sort of priority; that those who have been most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands will get some sort of priority.

         If, in the final analysis, after the bill has been passed and after the ILC has been in operation for some time, a situation of the nature that has been suggested arises, the parliament can revisit this matter. But the mere suggestion that these sorts of things may occur does not counterbalance the important principles of social justice—that is, giving priority to those most in need—and natural justice, which enables those persons in the ultimate to have some say about the prioritisation of resources. Under those circumstances, it is my view that the amendment moved by Senator Ellison and supported by the opposition and the Greens deserves the support of the Senate. I will be supporting that amendment.

         First of all, on the question of the basic principles and the logic, as it were, of having the clause expressed in these terms, might I just suggest that, when we look at the basic theme of the background provision in the objects clauses that we agree on, the reference is to assisting those who have been dispossessed as distinct from those who have not been dispossessed. That is the theme, the flavour, the language and the content of those clauses.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If you are translating the substance and effect of those clauses into the principles listed over the page, the logical transition is a principle expressed in the following terms: if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources, preference is to be given to those who have been dispossessed rather than those who have not been dispossessed. That is as far as the logic of the language of the preamble goes. There is a logic in translating the language of the preamble into the language of principles, but the logic of the preamble only goes so far as to say `preference to the dispossessed'. As such, it is, in a sense, a reflection of the earlier debate that we had. If there is a choice between buying land for someone who might be able to establish a native title claim to it, who has maintained continuity of association and physical possession of it, if it is a choice between using land fund money for that purpose and using it for those who have been totally dispossessed and do not have any of that kind of relationship, there should not be a choice at all. There is no harm in the statute reflecting that. I suggest to Senator Harradine that that is as far as the logic takes him, in terms of his own chain of reasoning, if he wants to move from the language of the preambular objective to the language of principle.

         We then come to the question of practicality and how this can be made to work in practice. Senator Harradine used the language `by comparison with those most in need', making the point that we are used to talking about those most in need. We are used to quantifying need; we are used to calibrating need; and, from a social justice perspective, so we should. Senator Harradine is saying that this is an analogue of that—that those who are most dispossessed should be given preference in exactly the same way as, in other social policy situations, we give preference to those who are most in need.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The difficulty that I would like to put to Senator Harradine and ask him to seriously consider is that the notion of dispossession is not quantitatively ascertainable in the same way as the concept of need is ascertainable. We all know how need can be calculated—by reference to income, by reference to assets and criteria of that objectively ascertainable kind. But how do we determine who is more dispossessed than someone else? How on earth do we begin to calculate that particular kind of equation? The basic distinction, logically and in practice, is really only between those who, on the one hand, have been dispossessed and those who, on the other hand, have not been dispossessed, who have maintained their association and relationship with a particular piece of land.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I suppose there are some criteria that one could begin to contemplate as applicable here. There could be the criterion of duration. A person could be more dispossessed if it is a longer period in time since his or her father, grandfather or other ancestors had that kind of possessory relationship with the land in question. I suppose that could be applied, but how does that translate into a social justice need? How do you say that someone who has been off the land for less than a generation is somehow less deserving than someone who has been off the land for three or four generations? I am not sure that there is a translation of the one concept to the other.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I suppose there could be a locational criterion. One could say that people out in the bush, in Moree or somewhere, are perhaps less dispossessed than people living in Redfern who have become totally absorbed in a city culture rather than in a rural culture which at least has some affinity or relationship with land, even if it is not the possessory relationship that was associated with original occupancy of the country. But it is a pretty tough criterion to apply to the fringe dwellers of Moree as compared with the urban dwellers of Redfern to say that the Moree people—I am just taking them as an example at random—have to miss out because in a conflict situation they are less dispossessed than people in Redfern.

         This, I fear, is the kind of calculation that you are forced into if you put a principle in these terms in the legislation and make it justiciable in the way that this is. When you create the potential for the courts to wrestle with these sorts of problems, obviously you create all the problems that Senator Harradine adverted to that have been put to him about litigation, divisiveness, claims upon resources and so on.

         If this were a clear-cut criterion, like the criterion of need, which was quantitatively ascertainable, applicable and calculable, then I would have a lot of difficulty in arguing with the way it has been put. The truth of the matter is that it ain't quantifiable in that way. It is a matter of impression. It is a matter of judgment. It is a matter of waiting around to determine what the courts are going to identify as the relevant criteria of dispossession. While we are waiting for the courts to tell us, one heck of a divisive environment will build up as people see the potential to argue their way through by using this particular clause.

From the outset, this legislation is going to get off on the wrong foot if we have this particular provision here.

         I do not mind the other principles that are laid out there being set out in the way they are rather than in the way that Senator Kernot outlined. At the end of the day there is not an awful lot of significance to be attached to that, but there is a great deal of significance to be attached to this. I ask Senator Harradine, using exactly his own frame of reference and exactly his own chain of reasoning, perhaps to  rethink his position on this.

I started at exactly the same point Senator Harradine is at now. I had proposed to take forward that form of amendment myself. But having spoken with some Aboriginal people—and I acknowledge it is not an inclusive list but neither is anybody else's who is contributing to this debate—I have come to the view that we are making a mistake to attempt to categorise dispossession.

         In the hours since we adjourned this debate, I have had phone calls and a couple of faxes from Aboriginal people whom I do not know who seem to have found out we are doing on this matter and who are saying, `Please don't do this to us.' One of them said, `We cannot define dispossession in varying degrees, as dispossession is still 100 per cent dispossession'. I fear more though the divisiveness that exists. We can look at the case of ATSIC with its limited funding and we can see the divisions that are caused in communities when decisions have to be made. They are made on need and they are made genuinely, but we can already see the incredible amount of divisiveness that has come from this sort of process.

Goodness knows, it is hard enough at the moment with the limited amount of money that is supposed to address all their needs. I feel so strongly about this that I am going to register my view that we are making a mistake by calling a division. I give notice of that.

         —That is a very good question. Senator Ellison, I think, made some comments about that. Somebody has to make the decision. If this is passed, the ILC will have to make the decision. I will tell Senator Evans what it might mean. If we look at this part of the legislation, it says that the object is to assist those dispossessed Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations through the acquisition and management of land. That presupposes that somehow the economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations of those persons have been affected by dispossession. If those aspirations have been affected by dispossession, they have been affected more seriously by more serious dispossession.

Should we, as members of parliament, just agree that the ILC should make arbitrary decisions without regard to certain principles? Obviously, there are things that the ILC has to have regard to and they were mentioned by Senator Evans in his address to the chamber prior to lunch. They relate to various terms and conditions, financial questions, and so on. All of those things, by virtue of the particular provisions of the act, will need to be observed by the ILC.

         For my part, I am voting for this particular measure on the grounds of social justice and natural justice. People who consider that they have more of a claim, if you like, on the fund—and bear in mind that this fund is established for people who are dispossessed under the native title legislation, and there may be two or three groups that have a claim to a particular piece of land—will have that claim decided on certain grounds. This ought to be decided on certain grounds, and I believe the proposal that has been put forward by the opposition and the Democrats at least requires this principle to be observed by the ILC.

It seems to me that there is a clear-cut distinction between those who are dispossessed and those who have not been dispossessed, which we can all readily understand. But once we start getting into the business of drawing distinctions between those who are more and less dispossessed, then we are inevitably back in the realm of a centrally arbitrary choice because there are no obvious criteria that one can point to.

         Senator Harradine pointed to the language of the preamble in terms of economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations and suggested that might be an appropriate touchstone and that we measure the degree of dispossession by the measure of economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations which have somehow accumulated as a result of the severance of a person's connection with the land. But how on earth does that work in practice? How does it serve the end of social justice, to define it in those terms?

         Most Aboriginal people, as we all know, in Australia live in urban areas. They are unequivocally dispossessed in the sense that their forefathers of long ago lost their links with their traditional land. I do not know how we can measure their economic, spiritual and cultural aspirations. There are ways of measuring their level of attainment. By and large, people living in urban areas have far greater economic opportunities and socioeconomic status than their fellow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote parts of Australia. The urban people might be more dispossessed, but in many ways they have many more opportunities for social advancement such as higher status, recognition and self-esteem.

        This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 1. It provides that in section 191 there is implementation `in accordance with the object of this Part'. It is fairly self-evident that this is a necessary drafting provision which flows from the passing of amendment No. 1. I do not think I need to waste the time of the Senate, unless there are any further queries.

         —Mr Acting Deputy Chairman, is it possible for the Greens to go first with the next series of amendments, with Senator Ellison's approval? We regard the opposition's amendments and ours as virtually interchangeable, with the exception of opposition amendment No. 50, which the Greens are not supporting, and our proposed amendment F9. I believe the government will be supporting our definition of a trust in amendment F9. With the opposition's permission, I request that we go first.

         —I thank Senator Ellison. Amendments F1 to F9 relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. Under the bill, the ILC can carry out its land acquisition functions only for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. The Greens (WA) believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be able to own land as they see fit and that the bill is far too restrictive on this issue. Acquired interests in land may be granted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders or trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts in the amendments that we are putting forward and I understand this is almost identical to the amendments of the opposition. We believe that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders should be treated like other citizens and be allowed to hold their land as they see fit. We believe it is an act of paternalism to do otherwise. I move:

There are an awful lot of individuals whose needs one wants to attend to and assist and, of course, all the welfare programs—health, education, housing and so on—are very much geared to individuals as well as to groups and communities. In the particular context of what this legislation is all about, the primary focus, thrust and direction is towards trying to recreate, or help recreate, a sense of community and respond to community needs rather than individual needs.

         —Tonight I would like to speak about Prime Minister Keating's `phoney feminism' and its alleged benefits to the political process. The recent motion to create a quota of 35 per cent of candidates to be preselected in `winnable' Labour Party seats has been celebrated by many community groups but, most notably, by ALP women.

         Any proposal to get more women into parliament at both state and federal levels should be applauded and, more importantly, acted upon. We desperately need to break down the barriers which prevent 51 per cent of the voting population from gaining appropriate parliamentary representation, from helping to shape our society, from improving legislation and from acting as representative voices for the communities they represent.

         The real sadness in all of this, of course, is that Paul Keating, our Prime Minister, has failed to see—or chosen to ignore the reality—where these barriers to entering parliament are. He has made loud, self-congratulatory noises—the media and other interest groups have swallowed them—about removing barriers within the preselection process, a place where there are few, if any, real barriers to be removed. Perhaps he has done so to suit his own purposes, but certainly within the Liberal Party there are really no barriers to women within that preselection process itself. If a woman stands and has merit, she is, in 1994, just as likely, if not more likely, to gain successful preselection from a group of candidates.

         Liberal preselectors are urged to preselect a woman, and have been doing so for some years now. Much of this has been due to a number of Liberal women who have worked tirelessly towards achieving equality of opportunities for women. In particular, I mention Chris McDiven, who is an example, both of herself and in her achievements, of what the ALP should be trying to emulate.

         It is a sad reflection of ALP preselectors that they are lagging behind the other parties in affirmative action for preselection of candidates; and sadder still that they need a compulsory quota and not just an active reminder to achieve this. Paul Keating is removing the wrong barriers. I say to Mr Keating: preselection is not where those real barriers to women are. The real barriers are those factors which keep women from even entering the preselection process in the first place. The barriers are often socioeconomic and relate strongly to women usually being the prime child carer within a family unit.

         The barriers which exist for potential women candidates without children are similar to those preventing many men entering politics: there is no job security, the hours are often long, overtime is often relentless and unpaid, the job satisfaction is low and, for many, the travel, particularly to Canberra, can be prohibitive. But where a woman is the main child carer, the barriers to entering politics, particularly at a federal level, are overwhelming.

         Federal politicians often have very limited time with their children, reducing their involvement with child rearing, since even evenings and weekends are often occupied with community and party functions, even when parliament is not sitting. I commend the federal parliament and the New South Wales state parliament for the changes to the sitting hours, such that politicians of either gender can have something approaching a more normal family life.

         All this applies to a man who is the primary child carer, and this group in our community should not be overlooked. In addition, of course, it should be acknowledged that even where a parent is not the prime carer, that person does miss out on family life by entering politics.

         So, you see, Paul Keating is removing the wrong barriers and, worse, he imagines that those barriers are there only for women. The quota system he is introducing is an artifice. He does nothing to improve the journey of women who enter politics. Quotas themselves mean that preselection may not be on merit, and that in itself is demeaning and insulting to women. Real equality is a long way off but we are going towards it. Do not let us go for the short-term goal of phoney equality because the community would always wonder whether a woman had been preselected simply by virtue of her gender. That would further erode the very slim confidence people have in their parliamentary representatives.

         There is another significant problem to be addressed—a problem largely of the Prime Minister's own making—which deters women, and also a large number of men, with all the qualities for public life from seeking a parliamentary career. That is the contempt—that is not too strong a word—in which many politicians are held, largely as a result of the gratuitous personal denigration, gutter language and general poor behaviour exhibited by our joke of a Prime Minister. As I understand it, our personal responsibility ratings are now sinking to the same level as that of the reptiles of the press.

         This could be achieved through income splitting or any one of several other options. The option itself is not crucial but it is vital that something real be done to overcome what are real barriers preventing many people—men and women—from moving into public life. The ALP's puny and insulting stunt—an artificial quota for women—is not the answer. Without that quota—but by actively seeking quality candidates for preselection—the non-Labor parties will soon have 50 per cent female representation. That will be achieved on merit and without recourse to the phoney and patronising form of alleged feminism. That will be the ultimate triumph—a system where real equality does exist and where merit alone is the basis for entry into public life.

         It is an issue which, I believe, continues unresolved within my own state of Queensland. I note that yesterday Senator Jocelyn Newman tabled a letter from the Queensland Premier which answered some of the concerns of the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing. I would like to quote from the Premier's letter because I believe it raises a very important issue. In his letter the Premier says:

        In respect of allegations raised by Mr Lindeberg concerning the lawfulness of redundancy payments made to Mr Coyne by the Department of Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, and the lawfulness of the destruction of documents relating to the Heiner Inquiry, the CJC concluded that there was no official misconduct involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing was correct when it pointed out to the Queensland government that there were apparently unresolved whistleblower cases in Queensland. I believe that one of the problems has been that much of the documentation available both to the Queensland government and to the CJC has not been considered.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The Senate select committee did have some of that documentation before it. In fact, when the Premier says that there was no official misconduct involved, I believe that some of the documentation has not been considered, and that is the best construction I can put upon that particular paragraph within his letter. I will be seeking to table a number of documents which I believe the Senate needs to have before it and to have on the public record.

         These documents include a transcript of a radio interview between Mr Lindeberg and Haydn Sargent on ABC radio in Brisbane which contains, I believe, an update of the issue that was the subject of concern of the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing, and that is why that document needs to be on the public record. There is also a letter from Mr Lindeberg to the police commissioner which includes an attachment which is the agenda of a meeting held on 12 October. This letter raises matters with the police commissioner, who is in the process of conducting a further inquiry into possible criminal offences, and simply transfers to the police commissioner further information. I do not believe it prejudices the inquiry in any way but simply gives to the Senate information which assists its inquiry. There is also a letter from the Attorney-General to Mr Lindeberg about an FOI request which he has, and his reply to the Attorney-General. I seek leave of the Senate to table those documents.

         —The other day in this place Senator Spindler raised a matter in relation to a part-time Comcar driver, Mr Dennis Reid. I thought it appropriate to make sure that the facts in this matter were very clear. Mr Reid did in fact write a letter to the paper in Queanbeyan, which letter was critical of me. That is nothing new, because I get a lot of that correspondence myself. Occasionally I see it put in the paper, and that is part of the democratic process.

         Unfortunately, Senator Spindler misses the point. The point about Mr Reid is not a point of free speech; it is a matter of trust. Comcar drivers perform a particular role which requires a high degree of trust. All of us in this place and in the other place would understand that, or at least I would hope they would understand that. Comcar drivers, by virtue of their occupation, are privy to all sorts of conversations, both on the telephone and between members of parliament or members of parliament and their staff.

         I did not raise this matter with Comcar to attack Mr Reid. I have a very real concern that this man does not understand the particular position of trust in which he is placed. By his actions he has shown that he is willing to be partisan in a public forum. I do not believe that I can sit in a car which Mr Reid is driving and have a conversation with one of my colleagues secure in the knowledge that that conversation will not be repeated outside the car.

         Lest Senator Spindler or anybody else is under some misapprehension that this is some sort of party political attack on Mr Reid, let me make it very clear: I know many Comcar drivers in Canberra and Brisbane very well. Many of them, I know, are members of the Labor Party. Some of them, with whom I get on very well, are branch officials of the Labor Party, but that is not an impediment. They adhere to a very strict rule that whatever they hear in the car is absolutely confidential, and they do not make a habit of going public about their view on this, that or the other.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In Mr Reid's case, that has not been adhered to. I know that many Comcar drivers, particularly the permanent Comcar drivers, are absolutely disgusted with Mr Reid's behaviour. The indications of support I have had about this from permanent Comcar drivers would, quite simply, astound Senator Spindler if I were to be so indiscreet as to outline them. I do not intend to do that because I intend to observe the same sort of trust and privacy which I expect Comcar drivers to observe.

         Let me make it very clear that Mr Reid's behaviour is thoroughly unacceptable. What is more, it makes it very difficult for any National Party member or senator to sit in a car which Mr Reid is driving and have any confidence that what is heard or said in that car will remain confidential. That is the grave difficulty which I have and which some of my colleagues have with Mr Reid performing the functions of a Comcar driver. It is more than Senator Spindler merely running off and saying that it is a matter of free speech. It is not a matter of free speech; it is a matter of being trustworthy and being seen to be trustworthy.

         Not only were Mr Reid's comments in the paper erroneous and frivolous; they showed that he could not display that he was a trustworthy individual. That was what disappointed me. I think the standards of conduct that we expect of Comcar drivers are no higher than the standards of conduct that we expect and receive from many of the parliamentary servants who work in this building, be they chamber attendants, attendants in the corridors, clerks or staff in the Black Rod's Office or other people who serve us very loyally.

         That is the standard that must apply. Mr Reid has shown that he cannot abide by that standard of conduct. That is why I made the complaint, that is why I believe that the complaint is correct and that is why I would have grave reservations about Mr Reid continuing in his employment as a Comcar driver. Certainly I would not hop into a car if he were behind the wheel.

         The property owned by Prime Minister Keating in Elizabeth Bay is worth at least half of what he has signed up to pay for the new residence.

         That is the $2.2 million residence. In other words, Oakes says it is worth at least $1.1 million and Senator Evans says $1 1/2 million.

          That is curious because the property two doors away recently sold for $750,000 and certainly its exterior condition is better than that of Mr Keating's property. In October 1993, the property next door sold for $660,000. I do not know how Senator Gareth Evans thinks that the recent sale of a property identical to Mr Keating's for $750,000 will magically double the price of Mr Keating's property because of what he has done to it. The $1 1/2 million Mr Keating is hoping to get for his property sounds like some sort of mates price again.

          Quite frankly, I think the real estate industry would be very interested to know how one could acquire such kindly benevolent purchasers who are so far out of line with the price of properties that are very similar or near identical. In a speech he made on 17 October, Senator Gareth Evans assured us that:

         Mr Keating knows enough about the property market in Sydney to be able to make his own judgments about these things and about the affordability of this particular transaction.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is fine. If Senator Gareth Evans is relying on Mr Keating's information about the property market, maybe he has the expectation that, because of the government's policies over the next few years, inflation is going to be so enormous that that kind of upward rush in housing prices may well take place. Maybe the Reserve Bank is correct in pressing for an increase in interest rates if the Prime Minister's own actions indicate that he is of the view that there will be a huge surge in housing prices.

          I might remind those who have been saying that if the Prime Minister spends more on his house on Elizabeth Bay Road it may well sell for more than $1.1 million, that that would involve the actual expenditure of money and, presumably, the Prime Minister would have to get that money from somewhere. So in effect it does not make any net difference to the ultimate cost to him of his $2.2 million mansion. If people really want to try to defend the Prime Minister on this matter, it would be a good idea if they stopped relying on hyperbole and wishful thinking and just looked at what sorts of prices this kind of property has actually been sold for.

         of Saturday 15 October, which reported that the chair of the inquiry, Ms Claire Petre, was a member of the Hon. Frank Walker's staff when he was Attorney-General in New South Wales. The article states:

        (1) In 1993-94 the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) made payments through the National Landcare Program totalling approximately $7.12 million to community organisations and groups for 583 community landcare orientated projects. Payments for the community landcare projects were made to the groups indirectly through State or Territory agencies, whereas City Landcare and national component payments were made directly to the group concerned. The payments were made for a range of projects to improve natural resource management including community education and awareness, resource surveying and mapping, planning, investigations and trials, training, monitoring and demonstration activities.

        (1) I am informed by Telecom that occurrences such as the May storms in Perth have the potential to generate extraordinary volumes of calls to organisations such as the State Electricity Corporation of Western Australia (SECWA). Such volumes can exceed the levels allowed for in the design of that organisation's call answering facilities.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        In an emergency situation, when Telecom recognises that such levels are likely to be exceeded, standard network management procedures are invoked in consultation with the organisation being affected. To prevent all the busy tones emanating from the organisation's local exchange, these procedures allow Telecom to provide a busy tone at the caller's local exchange for a proportion of the calls to that organisation's number. This procedure reduces the possibility of network congestion occurring, whilst still permitting callers to contact emergency services such as Fire, Police or Ambulance. These steps were taken by Telecom in consultation with the SECWA management on the occasion of the Perth storms on 23 May this year.
