         â€”Last night when the time allowed for this debate ran out I was speaking in response to the motion by Senator Ferguson to disallow the determination for the salary packageâ€”as I suppose it can be put, in common termsâ€”for Mr Kelly to be an adviser to the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. I want to put on the record the general description of the job that Mr Kelly would perform as an adviser.

         At the end of my remarks last night I was explaining that a major part of the Conroy report dealt with the way Customs had introduced new technology. The report said that Customs has been a world leader of any Customs department in doing that, and has been recognised at an international level around the world for chairing committeesâ€”in particular, one of the initial committees established by APEC to look at the harmonisation of customs law and rules within our region.

         So, despite the criticism in the Conroy review about internal management et cetera, there was strong commendation in that part of the report about Customs for things that it had done at an international level and at a technological level. The government believes that Mr Kelly must take some of the credit for that, because he was a senior officer in Customs as comptroller-general and as deputy of the department before that, and that cannot be ignored. We believe that Mr Kelly is very suitable as special adviser to DITARD on APEC matters.

         It should be noted that the APEC ministers in Seattle in November 1993 confirmed to the government the importance to Australia of involvement with the regional groupings through such initiatives as harmonisation of customs procedures, harmonisation of standards and conference procedures, promoting technology transfer between APEC economies and improving market access for Australian manufacturing and service industries within the APEC region. Because of the direct beneficial impact on trade and investment these initiatives will have for Australia, the industry, technology and regional development portfolioâ€”my portfolioâ€”will be substantially increasing its involvement in these areas over the next two to three years.

         The role performed by Mr Kelly in maximising the potential gain for Australia in this area has been carefully considered by the department with an interest in APEC matters. His position will involve encouraging interaction of complementary APEC activities within the portfolio and with other departments and agencies; ensuring a commercial orientation of the portfolio's APEC activities that is relevant to business priorities in the region; and representing the portfolio at appropriate APEC meetings. Mr Kelly is well qualified to perform the task of special adviser by virtue of his international experience in customs, particularly in the APEC context where he was involved from the earlier stages in developing a customs theme to encourage trade facilitation through harmonisation.

         I believe that the Public Service Commissioner was willing to make the determination that the salary package for Mr Kelly as an adviser for these responsibilities was quite appropriate in view of his experience and, as I said before, the Conroy review not criticising Customs. It commended Customs for what it has done in the area of introducing new technology into its international obligation. In the criticisms being made, I acknowledge the management problems internally and domestically, but I hope that honourable senators, particularly those opposite, will keep some balance in the debate that is taking place.

Although I do not agree with the thrust of his remarks, at least they show he has put a lot of effort into this issue compared with some of the hot air windbagging and grandstanding of some other honourable senators opposite.

         Senator Ferguson raised the question of how we remove a statutory office holder if there is, as he claimed, incompetence and so on. There are three ways to remove a statutory office holder. One of the ways is by resignation, which is what happened. As I have said before, I had discussions with Mr Kelly and, in consideration of the Conroy review, he agreed to resign from the position of comptroller-general, which is a statutory position. Another way to remove an office holder is by a joint resolution of the houses.

         â€”Senator Ferguson raised the ways, if Mr Kelly deserved to go, other than through resignation. Achieving it through the resolution of both houses, I would have thought, in the end might not have brought great credit to the Senate or to the House of Representatives. The debate would have been about a personality. There would have been questions of natural justice and how he could defend himself. He would not have been able to participate in the debate. Those issues would have been raised. We may have ended up with a process going on for months before we resolved the issue one way or the other.

         From the government's view, we wanted to get on with the job of the reform of Customs, not make ourself a hostage to the process of a joint resolution of the parliament. In fact, it might have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which could have held hearings to at least give Mr Kelly a chance to put his case. Maybe that is what honourable senators opposite would have wanted. Again, we would have had hours of hearings where Mr Kelly would have been attacked and abused on issues that may not have been particularly germane to what we were debating. I think that process, though it is available to the parliament, is deficient in the context of what we were trying to do in getting on with the job of changing Customs.

We all know how long the business list in the Senate is. Again, it may well have been referred to a committee.

         In the circumstances, with the Conroy review and its criticism available, I think the resignation of Mr Kelly from the position of comptroller-general was the best outcome.

So, after discussions with him, the department and the Public Service Commissioner, we have offered him a role in which he maintainsâ€”for about the equivalent of the remaining period of his statutory office-holder's position, about two yearsâ€”salary and conditions equivalent to those he would have earned as comptroller-general.

         â€”Senator Ferguson has interjected about Mr Kelly's responsibility for Customs. The fact that he has resigned may be an indication that he has paid some penalty. That may be an interpretation the public wants to put on his resignation. The way he has been attacked in this place in particular over the past four or five weeks has been so consistent and vigorous and damning that his reputation clearly has been affected. That is a penalty he has paid. For a long time to come the way this matter has been raised and debated in this place will stand against his name. There can be no argument that his reputation has suffered from the way he has been individually attacked in this place. No case has been made to single out Mr Kelly in the way that this motion does and in the way that those opposite have done.

         Senator Ferguson and Senator Watson spoke about this issue because of their involvement in the appropriate committees. The way some other senators opposite jumped on the bandwagon yesterday to speak in the debate indicated the permanent oppositionist mentality of some of those opposite. They realise that in the foreseeable future they will not be in government and they do not have to address issues of government. If they thought they may be in government in the next six months or at the next election, some wiser heads opposite would have said, `Do we want to set a precedent like this which a future opposition against us may have the numbers in the Senate to use to knock over a determination which we think is reasonable and which even the Public Service Commissioner has agreed to?'

         This is a warning sign for those opposite. They ought to think at times about what they would do and how they would act in government, not just how to be a permanent opposition. Nobody in the oppositionâ€”National Party or Liberal Partyâ€”has had any ministerial experience in government. That has  certainly been the case since the introduction of PR in the Senate. It is the first time in the history of the Senate that none of those opposite have had ministerial experience and it is showing somewhat in this debate. I am not referring to the speeches made by Senator Ferguson or Senator Watson. But some of the other speeches indicated to me the opposition's mentality. This approach will lead the opposition into a dead end and make it even more likely that the opposition will be rejected by the people in the future.

         My final comment about the process relates to where we are at with the Conroy review. I am very pleasedâ€”and Senator Ferguson would probably be pleasedâ€”to hear that over the last four or five weeks since the review was tabled I have had extensive consultations with Customs staff. My staff and Customs estimate that I have been to a number of meetings in all of the states. I have spoken to a total of around 2,000 members of Customs staff at meetings that have lasted for between an hour and an hour and a half. At those meetings Customs staff had every opportunity to raise individual issues and present individual recommendations to me and to express their view about the report. I have spoken to the union delegates committees in most states and that has been a very useful process.

         This process is extremely important, not only because I hear their views but also because it encourages them to see that the process of change in Customs has to be, as much as anything, driven from the bottom up. I am encouraged by the response I have got from the average staff members. Many of them have accepted much of the criticism in the report. Some of them think they have been individually wrongly accused of things they have not done and they will argue that case in their submission. Many of the ordinary staff say that they never had anything to do with the Midford case and that they  should not be blamed for it. At the meetings there was clear criticism by the average staff member of middle and upper management of the organisation. But from those meetings and from over 400 individual and group responsesâ€”the consultation processâ€”they are overwhelmingly in favour of the general thrust of reform, and that is a very encouraging start.

I look forward with confidence to that in the future.

         Whatever the government decided to do in respect of one public servant should not have been done in the way that it has been done. It used the Public Service determination, which then brought the matter into the parliament. As we all know, the parliament does have the right to disallow those determinations which, under normal circumstances, are there for particular classes of public servants. They are like an industrial award, if you like. As has been pointed out previously in the debate, it would be a most unusual situation for Public Service determinations to deal with a specific question such as this.

Included in those remedies is resignation, a motion by both houses of parliament, and the amending of the legislation to abolish the position.

         â€”No, I am the last one to suggest gross improprietyâ€”and I am not doing so. But obviously the government wanted something done. It seems to me that Mr Kelly was influenced to take the first optionâ€”that is, the resignation from the position of comptroller-general. Presumably the government promised Mr Kelly that his talents would be able to be utilised in another area, and that that would not involve substantial loss of remuneration or entitlement. Therefore, we have before us a disallowable instrument. I do not propose to vote for the disallowance of that instrument because I am not sure that it is the parliament's prerogative to deal with the fate of an individual public servant in this particular way.

         I believe that these Public Service determinations and the parliament's ability to disallow those Public Service determinations will be diminished if we allow ourselves to be pushed into pursuing individual cases such as thisâ€”and allow ourselves to follow what the government is on about. I will not do that. If my view prevailedâ€”which it will notâ€”any action would play into the hands of the government in this case. So be it.

I am sure there are many in this chamber who are not aware of the history of Customs over the last four years, other than with regard to the Midford Paramount case. I speak as a senator who spent three years overseeing the Customs Service when it appeared before Estimates Committee A. There were many manifest defects in the Customs Service.

         â€”Yes. There have been many problems with Customs, and there have been many problems recently. The most noticeable, as far as I am concerned, are the manifest problems we had with the Coastwatch contract and the inability of Mr Kelly, when he was given good warning of my intention to question him on the Coastwatch contract, to answer even basic questions such as, `What was the financial situation of the contractor? Did the contractor have sufficient staff to meet its contractual obligations? Did Customs ever, in fact, ensure that the contractor had the sufficient staff?'. We could go into that in great detail.

         We had a report which was very critical of Customs. Mr Kelly appears to have been persuadedâ€”Senator Harradine quite rightly asked, `How was he persuaded?'â€”to hand in his resignation and he was then appointed as a special adviser on customs matters with the salary level and entitlements of a departmental secretary. That brings this matter to this chamber, because there was a special determination by the Public Service Commissioner to advance Mr Kelly to the level of a departmental secretary when he had previously been at the level of a deputy secretary.

         In Mr Kelly's defence, Senator Schacht said that there is absolutely no reason why those of us on this side or anybody in this chamber should overturn that Public Service Commissioner's determination because Mr Kelly has paid a sufficient price. In that statement alone Senator Schacht recognises that some responsibility attaches to Mr Kelly; otherwise he would not say that Mr Kelly has paid a sufficient price. But what a marvellous price it is when one is asked to bear some of the responsibility for the failures of the Customs Service and one then receives a pay rise. If only I could pay a price like that.

         Senator Schacht made many comments. After listening to Senator Schacht last night, I thought the comments of Ralph Waldo Emerson, that men are always conservative after dinner and that radicals rarely have full stomachs, were highly relevant. Before he assumed his position as a minister on the treasury bench, Senator Schacht was the arch radical. He spent three years with me on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, during which time he espoused every possible radical cause, and I do not begrudge him that right. We had many interesting debates.

         Now the arch radical has become the arch conservative. Senator Schacht was advancing a very interesting case last night. He said that it would be a dangerous precedent for this determination to be overturned. He saidâ€”and I do not think I am unfairly paraphrasing himâ€”`It has never been done before and we shouldn't do it again'. The arch radical has turned into the arch conservative. But Senator Schacht knows full well that the process by which this determination is made is pursuant to a statute, and certain important observations need to be made with respect to that.

         The first and foremost is that in previous times in other parliaments the appointment of people to high office was done by an act of parliament. The effect of the legislation, which sets up the office of the Public Service Commissioner, was to ensure that many of those matters were dealt with by a disallowable instrument, such as a determination. But it is surely not the intention of the statute that this parliament should abrogate its responsibility to oversee those matters; in fact, it is quite the contrary.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fact that this parliament requires the Public Service Commissioner to make a determination, which is a disallowable instrument, is not an abrogation of the power of this parliament; it is a reservation of the power of this parliament. It means that the parliament will give that responsibility to the Public Service Commissioner, but that this parliament reserves the right to say whether it does or does not agree with this or that determination.

       <para first-indent="16">

         It is an extraordinary argument for Senator Schacht to say, `Look, the Public Service Commissioner has made a determination; parliament should butt out'. If the intention of the act was that parliament should have no oversight and no say in these matters, then why would parliament require such determinations to be disallowable instruments? Parliament made that decision because it wished to reserve the right to oversee that process. So the arch radical turned arch conservative falls at the first hurdle because he does not understand the processes which he purports to be defending.

         Senator Schacht then made another argument. In an attempt to persuade Senator Harradine to follow his side of the argument, Senator Schacht said that the parliament overturning a determination of the Public Service Commissioner would be like the parliament overturning a decision of a court or the Industrial Relations Tribunal in relation to an award. That is also a very flawed argument. I am sure Senator Harradine will appreciate the fact that the Public Service Commissioner is not a judicial officer, a court or a judge.

         That argument is highly flawed. It is like saying that the parliament should not be allowed to oversee any actions of this individual. It is like saying that the actions of the Public Service Commissioner should be sacrosanct. In my role as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I can assure this Senate that we have been highly active in scrutinising the determinations of the Public Service Commissioner. We have disallowed many determinations of the Public Service Commissioner for a whole range of reasons, yet Senator Schacht, through his argument, seems to be denying us any power at all. His argument is clearly flawed. In upholding the suggestions put forward by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, this Senate recognises the fact that there is a role to oversee the determinations of the Public Service Commissioner. The Public Service Commissioner is not sacrosanct. He is not above review and nor are his decisions.

         Senator Schacht then tried to take the argument one step further. He said, `Look, this is a disallowable instrument. The only ground that you have to disallow the determination is if it is improperly made'. He suggested that the Senate had the power to disallow the determination only if there were some defect in the process. That is not true. There is certainly a role for the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to disallow regulations that have a technical defect or where they breach one of the terms of reference to that committee. There is a general power for this Senate at any time, for whatever reason, to disallow a disallowable instrument; and that is a step we are taking. For Senator Schacht to say that there is no power or that the power is limited only to determinations which are improperly made or not made in the course of proper process is an absolute nonsense. So the arguments that Senator Schacht advances in this matter are extremely weak.

         In the case made by my colleague Senator Ferguson the question is: is it appropriate in these circumstances, in view of the manifest values of Customs over the past few years in which Mr Kelly has been comptroller-general, for him to be appointed to this position at this particular level of remuneration? The opposition, and other senators in this chamber, have formed the view that it is not. Not one argument has been advanced by the minister to say that what we are doing is improper. In fact, it is highly proper, because it seeks to ensure that parliament properly oversights the actions of executive government.

The attacks that have been made and the questions that have been asked have been in response to decisions that the minister or the government have taken.

         For the life of me, I really cannot see how the minister can talk about Mr Kelly being denied justice when compared with what happened to the people involved in Midford Paramount. Yesterday, my colleague Senator Watson, who was heavily involved in the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts hearings on this matter, said that the actions of Customs in that case brought premature death, ill health, loss of income, loss of business, loss of capital and loss of reputation to many people in Australia who were relentlessly pursued by Customs. It is beyond me how the minister can say that there is a denial of justice in this case for Mr Kelly but not for any other individual. The minister also said yesterday that disallowing this determination will set `a dangerous precedent'. The minister is wrong, wrong, wrong!

         I believe that the minister has been badly advised on this particular issue, and it does him no credit at all to suggest that a dangerous precedent will be set. All section 82D determinations relate to terms and conditions of employment. They have been disallowed in the past and they will be disallowed in the future. Apart from that, why would the parliament be given the power to disallow section 82D determinations if it was not intended that that power ever be used?

         It was obviously envisaged that there would be times that section 82D determinations would have to be disallowed, and that is why Labor government senators did it in 1987, 1988 and 1992. The only dangerous precedent that has been set is that the minister has chosen to reward Mr Kelly by paying him a salary package higher than he is legally entitled to. The minister also said that at the end of those discussions `Mr Kelly agreed that he should resign' from the position of comptroller-general. Yesterday the minister stated that the Conroy report did not find Mr Kelly personally responsible for the failings of the Australian Customs Service and did not find him guilty of any wrongdoing. If that is the case, why did Mr Kelly agree that he should resign? Surely, an agreement that he should resign is an admission of failure on his part to properly administer the service and to perform to the level expected of the comptroller-general.

         If we compare this performance with the performance of other secretaries of departments and of people in the private sector getting salary packages of this size, then this shows all the earmarks of a special dealâ€”a special deal that the Senate should not tolerate.

He has probably booked himself a seat in the spotlight at next week's additional estimates hearing. I intend to try to get to the bottom of this matter.

        This Bill proposes an amendment to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. Details of the amendment are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill has been made necessary by the issue of Letters Patent to the Honourable Gordon Samuels AC QC and also to Mr Michael Codd AC to conduct an inquiry into the operation and management of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. That Inquiry has been asked by the Government to report if possible by 30 September 1994 and in any case by 31 December 1994. As the terms of reference include the effectiveness and suitability of existing arrangements for control and accountability of ASIS and the resolution of grievances and complaints relating to ASIS, it is likely that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have information and documents which would be of considerable relevance to the Inquiry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that provisions in the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act which were intended to give the maximum possible protection to information held by the Inspector-General may preclude the Inspector-General from providing information or documents to the Inquiry and therefore substantially impede the ability of the Inspector-General to co-operate with the Inquiry. Subsection 34(1) of the Act precludes the Inspector-General and his or her staff from disclosing or communicating to any person any information obtained by the reason of the person having held one of those positions except in the performance of duties and the exercise of powers under the Act. The Inspector-General's powers and functions are listed comprehensively in the Act and do not include the giving of evidence to Royal Commissions and similar inquiries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The effect of this is that the Inspector-General may not lawfully disclose information or give documents to the Inquiry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the Bill is intended to remove this difficulty. It will permit the current and former Inspector-General and the current and former staff of the Inspector-General to give information and evidence to the Commissions of Inquiry conducted by the Honourable Gordon Samuels and Mr Michael Codd without risking prosecution. In that way, it will ensure that the Commissions have access to a class of information which would be among the most relevant available.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The point should be emphasised that the amendment made by the Bill will not permit the disclosure of information or the giving of documents by the Inspector-General or staff other than to the specified Commissions of Inquiry just referred to. In that way, the present position, which emphasises the need to maintain the greatest possible protection for the privacy of individuals and for information about matters related to security, will be preserved as far as possible.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The introduction of the Bill is a measure of the importance which the Government attaches to enabling the Commissions of Inquiry to conduct the fullest examination of the matters within their Terms of Reference.

         The need for this motion is self-evident. This is the sixth time that this matter has been debated in this place. The issue has been before the Senate since the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made a statement on 22 September 1983. This matter has already occupied over eight hours of the Senate's time since the system was adopted by the House of Representatives. It was first proposed in 1987. Of that, 6 1/2 hours of debate has occurred during the life of this parliament. We debated it once in the autumn session last year, and we debated it twice in the budget session last year.

          As honourable senators would be aware, the government became extraordinarily frustrated with the progress that had been made on this particular issue. As a result, combined with a range of other senators representing minor parties and independents, the government voluntarily tabled pecuniary interest information in this chamber. I would suggest that the time proposed in this motion for this debate is a more than generous allocation, notwithstanding the fact that we have an extraordinary amount of time already involved in debate on this matter. Unfortunately, given the opposition's appalling record on this particular issue, it would be very irresponsible for the government not to take some precautions against further filibustering and time wasting on this issue.

We have agreed, appropriately, to bring this matter on for debate today.

          It is not my intention to prolong the debate on this particular motion, given that any time in excess of 30 minutes obviously will reduce the time for debate on the substantive motion. I believe that the time this motion proposes for debate on the substantive motion is a very generous amount of time indeed. I do not intend to prolong the debate at this stage. I do, obviously, wish at a later stage, assuming the carriage of this motion, to make a longer contribution on the substantive motion. I do commend this procedural motion to the Senate, and look forward to an early conclusion of this matter so debate on the substantive motion can commence yet againâ€”but on this occasion conclude.

          I certainly cannot recall any instance where the government has included a provision such as that included in paragraph 3 of this motion; that is, any time in excess of 30 minutes on this procedural debate will then be taken off the time for the substantive issue. If we follow through that logically it would mean that, if this debate went for some hours, the government would then expect the substantive motion to be passed without debate and we would not have the benefit of the long speech that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has already forecast he would be giving on the substantive debate, which I think indicates just how shallow this attempt is.

          It is particularly appalling in the circumstances of the history of this matter. The minister said that it is self-evident that we should have such a restriction on debate because this issue has been around for some time. All that demonstrates is the failure in programming and planning by this government. The minister knows, and I can see the acknowledgment in the smile on his face, that for 11 years the government has from time to time introduced this motion into this placeâ€”I am talking about the substantive motion, not the procedural motionâ€”and on no occasion did it pursue it to finality. On no occasion did it not proceed as a result of any filibuster on this side of the chamber.

          In 1983 the government brought down a statement in the first instance, but basically did not pursue it.

The government said that it was going to pursue it, but it kept postponing it. It was postponed for five days and then there was another motion to postpone it. There were something like five or six subsequent motions to postpone it before it was abandonedâ€”in that instance for another year.

In 1992, the government passed the matter over to Senator Cook. He started on it but he obviously was not interested and did not pursue it. It went back to Senator Button later in 1992.

He said that it would never occur again, yet every year when the government has gone to the Australian Democrats and said, `We want to constrain debate; we want to limit debate; we want to push something through', the Australian Democrats have said `okay'.

In 1992, a further 57 bills went through under a guillotine imposed by the government with the support of the Australian Democrats. Yet the Australian Democrats come into this place and say, `We are here because we take on a responsibility to keep this government honest'. I say to Senator Bourne that the Democrats will not keep this government honest if they are prepared to constantly agree with the government to limit debate in the only real chamber of debate in the Australian parliament.

          I register the protest of the coalition to what the government is seeking to do here: to impose this guillotine at the beginning of this debate in an unprecedented way. I express concern as to what it will mean in the future. Is it a demonstration of how this government intends to use its numbers, together with its friends in the Australian Democrats and the Greens, to further restrict debate on other matters? If this motion were carried, I think it would be a highly undesirable precedent for this chamber. I trust that when the minority parties join the debate on this motion they will recognise that and throw out the motion and say that in this chamber we will require full debate, not artificially restrained debate. The coalition will oppose this motion.

The only reason for that is the Australian Democrats have got the government to agree to that amendment. I would hope that opposition senators would agree to that amendment, and I would expect them to agree with that amendment, because I heard Senator Hill on the radio this morning saying that he was concerned about that.

For the minister responsible for small business not to understand the difference between a proprietary company and a public company is absolutely amazing.

Its members put in returns that do not show anything and, as I say, in the case of at least one senator, they do not even bother to put them in at all. That shows the absolute and complete futility of it. The Labor Party has always had it in its power to bring this matter up for debate if it wanted to. Senator Hill has pointed out the history of this matter. Since 1983 this matter keeps coming up. It is the Labor Party which will not proceed with the matter.

I think that the opposition has a valid point when it says that all the issues should be canvassed and raised in a meaningful debate.

          I want to make some specific points about time limits in relation to this debate. It was quite interesting that when Senator Gareth Evans came into this place on 3 March to basically cobble together a package of so-called accountability measures to gain the support of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine in stopping an inquiry into the distribution of the community cultural, recreational and sporting grants it was to ensure that the Senate did not fulfil its proper duty in going through the grants right back to 1989 and 1990 when Senator Richardson was responsible and where the Auditor-General had found basically a smoking gun.

          The Auditor-General found the potential for massive political corruption in this programâ€”a program in which we have seen evidence of political bias and which required the Senate, because the House of Representatives refused to do a proper job, to go through the process of reconstructing an audit trail that had been demolished by the wiping of a whiteboard. The Auditor-General could not find a proper audit trail or proper documentation. That required the Senate to go back through the trail to find out whether or not political corruption occurred.

          As I said, we had a smoking gun; we had enormous evidence of political bias and political corruption. It required the Senate to go and find whether that corruption took place. On 3 March the Senate chose to turn a blind eye to potential political corruption. The Democrats, with Senator Harradine's support, voted with the government to ignore and turn a blind eye to potential political corruption, for two reasons: firstly, Mrs Kelly had resigned and, secondly, we came up with this hastily cobbled together package of accountability measures, which are welcome. However, the time limit issue becomes crucial.

          The measures included a commitment by Senator Evans that there would be timely responses to the Auditor-General's reports. That is not a measure. That is something that should take place as a matter of course. There should be timely responses to the Auditor-General's reports. That should not be a part of some new package; it should just be taken for granted. Another measure in the package was to ensure that the Auditor-General had proper resources. Again, that should not be part of a new package. That should be part of sensible parliamentary democracy with an independent Auditor-General. Where he senses that there needs to be an inquiry into malpractice, maladministration or bad financial management, he should have the independence and the resources to conduct an inquiry. It should certainly not be something, as Senator Evans said in his statement to the chamber on 3 March, that will be reviewed in the forward estimates and in allocating funding for the audit office for 1994-95 following the outcome of the inquiry into the Centenary House affair.

          There is no commitment on one of the most crucial parts of the accountability packageâ€”the resourcing and the independence of the Auditor-General. It is going to be reviewed in the estimates process later this year. What becomes urgent? Out of all of the commitments in the so-called accountability package that the Democrats and Senator Harradine so readily supported as a way of stopping a proper inquiry into potential political corruption, which are urgent? The urgent measure is to ensure that senators disclose and register their interestsâ€”very powerful stuff. Out of all of the accountability measures, who has to take the rap for potential political corruption in the sports rorts affair?

           These measures are not upgrading the Auditor-General immediately; they are not ensuring he is independent, that he has the resources or that report No. 296 of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts is implemented. This is just the bringing on of an urgent debate on the register of senators' interests. As Senator Hill has already said, that debate has occurred on a number of occasions. The government has been so non-committed to this issue. It has just used it as a political football; it has wheeled it out when it suits to turn up the heat on the opposition. That is not a very good way of conducting debate on government accountability.

Senator Evans promised on 3 March that `if possible' within one month he will introduce redrafted legislation on the review of the Audit Act and will ensure that it is debated in both houses early in the spring session of 1994â€”not the budget session. A bill which was put up by Senator Watson is already on the

His resourcing would be a matter for us, not for the Department of Finance and Australian Labor Party ministers who despise the Auditor-Generalâ€”or who have done for many months, until 3 March when they suddenly decided that the Auditor-General needed more money.

          The register of senators' interestsâ€”this crucial part of the government's accountability packageâ€”is so urgent it has to be guillotined today.

The amendments to the Audit Act will be put off until Christmas and they may still be awaiting debate in 1995; in fact, we may never see them again because they do not seem to be important to the government and the Democrats.

          We are having an inquiry, finallyâ€”with no help from the Australian Democrats, I might sayâ€”into the Centenary House affair. When this inquiry was originally raised by the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, it was going to be a private inquiry that did not even report to the parliament. A firm commitment still has not been given in this place about the inquiry into the Centenary House affair, which I remind honourable senators involves a deal that the Australian Labor Party receive an over-market rent on a 15-year lease with a nine per cent increase every year.

          One of the few pieces of paper coming out of the Auditor-General's office that the government reads on a monthly basis is the monthly rent cheque from the Auditor-General's office. The government does not like reading the Auditor-General's reports. It does not like reading the reports into the sports rorts affair. It does not like reading the reports into the abuse of the Australian government credit card.

          The government loves receiving it because every year it is a better storyâ€”it gets bigger by nine per cent. It is a lovely bit of paper. But unless it is reformedâ€”and reformed urgently, because in September that rent is going up again by nine per cent; we will see that work through the budget processâ€”every time that rent goes up by nine per cent, the resources of the Auditor-General go down by eight per cent. As we talk here today, there is only a one per cent increase in the Auditor-General's property operating expenses. What the Australian Labor Party likes reading from the Australian National Audit Office is the rent cheques; it does not like the reports.

          a letter from the Auditor-General saying that he wants to do an inquiry into the allegations I have raised about uncommercial practices by Dasfleet. Dasfleet is engaged in tax evasion. It has cost the Australian taxpayer in the vicinity of $234,240 in the past 15 months in unpaid sales tax due to an administrative failure within Dasfleet and through a deal which supplies executive cars, like Ford Fairmonts, to the Transport Workers Union and government fuel cards which provide fuel at 59c a litre. These cars are supplied at a discount to the trade union movement of between $250,000 and $500,000 every year. The Auditor-General wants to look into it. In the letter that I incorporated into

          It is urgent that the Auditor-General's resources be improved and that his independence be assured. But here we are, at the behest of the Australian Democrats, debating as a matter of extreme urgency the registry of senators' interests. This matter should involve a thorough debate on all of the issues. It goes to the heart of accountability in the democratic process and does deserve a debate. We have had a debate before, but, as Senator Harradine quite properly points out, there are new senators and new issues, including those resulting from the piggery affair and the sports rorts affair. Thankfully, the whole accountability issue is at the top of the political agenda again.

          This is what the Australian Democrats consider urgent. I wonder whether they consider it urgent for there to be a full inquiry into the potential political corruption of the operations and uncommercial dealings of Dasfleet. As it stands at the moment, the Auditor-General may not have the resources to undertake what is a sensible inquiry, something that the people need to understand. People do not like the Australian Labor Party government delivering benefits to its trade union matesâ€”delivering them Ford Fairmonts and cheap petrol at 59c a litre. They do not like it.

          On 3 March the Senate refused to investigate potential political corruption. With the support of the Democrats and Senator Harradine, the Senateâ€”shamefully, I suggestâ€”turned its eyes away from the potential political corruption, the smoking gun in the sports rorts affair. That was a very sad day for the Senate and a very sad day for accountability, because the Auditor-General said that he did not have the resources to go back and try to uncover the audit trail which had been erased from the whiteboard. The Senate had the power and the capacity to go through the grants, talk to the people, investigate the local needs and find out whether there was political corruption. But the Senate said no. Mrs Kelly, as a ministerâ€”I think it was John Stone, the former head of Treasury, who described ministers as just part-players who flit across the political stageâ€”just flitted across the political stage.

So her resignation was nothing. It was something to ensure that the Labor government did not have to endure any more political flak than it had already endured, and it was decided to cut her out. She was not the issue. The issue of political bias and political corruption within government programs is the issue that lives with us. There are the accountability packages, including the package that Senator Gareth Evans put down on 3 March. The deal that was effectively cobbled out over a couple of meetings between Mr Beazley and Senator Kernot is part of the solution. But the timeliness of implementing that solution is crucial, and we are debating the time limits in this debate.

          The point I am making in a roundabout and detailed way is that this accountability package, part of which is the register of senators' interests, includes some important measures. They are measures that should take place anyway, regardless of whether or not there is a Senate inquiry into the sports rorts affair. There should be a Senate inquiry into the sports rorts affair. It is a crucial issue of public accountability. All of the other measures that Senator Evans mentioned on 3 March, including the one we are debating today, are important, but they are ones which should take place anyway. They are not things which should be new initiatives of the government. The Auditor-General should be independent, and of course he should be properly resourced, regardless of the inquiry into the Centenary House affair, which is yet another inquiry into government mismanagement and political corruption. They are things that should be investigated.

          There are matters of importance that need to be considered whenever a guillotine is considered, and Senator Harradine of course has referred to those. Whenever senators' times and opportunities to speak are limited, we then impede the whole process of accountability of government. So I will not be supporting the guillotine, and I certainly will not be supporting paragraph (3) of the motion which involves a retrospective guillotine. It says that, for every minute I speak, I limit the time of some senator who in the future may want to contribute to the debate. So, with the nodding approval of my deputy whip, I will sit down and register my abhorrence of this new device called `a retrospective guillotine'.

        I turn now to the declaration of spouse interests. That should be coupled with dependent children. Earlier when I spoke, I said that children can leave dependence and return to dependence. That was the laughable situation with the other sideâ€”has no-one on the other side had a son or daughter who has left dependence after leaving university and then, having worked a couple of years, has gone back to university to do a higher degree? Who keeps that son or daughter? The government cannot keep that son or daughter all the time. So, the parents then take up responsibilities, as I have done.

I thought that in the ensuing timeâ€”quite a few monthsâ€”he might have spruced up his act a little. But it was sad to see that, even today, Senator Panizza's speech was even more convoluted and confused than it was on that occasion.

        I do not think there is any need for me to repeat what the government put on record about this matter when it was debated in 1987, 1992 and again last year, as I mentioned in the earlier debate, in both the autumn and budget sittings. The key issue before the Senate again today is whether or not a declaration of pecuniary interests is a right and proper thing for Australian parliamentarians to do. That is the key issue. We on this side of the chamber believe it is the right thing; we always have. We have always been committed to that fundamental principle.

Any system that is adopted by any parliament has to attempt to reconcile the right to privacy of all citizens, whether they be members of parliament or not, with the basic right of electorates to information about their elected representatives. This proposed system attempts to strike, and I believe succeeds in striking, that balance.

        The opposition has spoken at great length and made much of its support for the general principle of declaration of interests but cannot vote for or support the system that this government has proposed. It has trotted out a litany of alleged shortcomings in the proposed forms that are to be filled in and a litany of alleged inadequacies, suggesting that the definitions are imprecise or people may not be filling out the forms accurately. It is suggesting, of course, that the forms have these sorts of shortcomingsâ€”that they are ambiguous, unclear and so forth. This needs to be recognised as nothing more than an excuse by the opposition for doing nothing at allâ€”which is its fundamental position of lack of principle on this issue.

It involved a mistake by the New South Wales Police Service from 1978 to 1989 through which it overtaxed the long service leave component of those members of the force who left as a result of either voluntary retirement at age 60 or 65 or discharge on medical grounds. For those 11 years, the New South Wales Police Service overtaxed these members' long service payment on their retirement.

According to the police service, my husband has probably been overtaxed by something like $1,000. The Retired Police Association knows of in excess of 200 other members who have been overtaxed.

         It also appears from questions that have been asked in the state parliament that the New South Wales Police Service was not the only New South Wales government agency which did this. I am not sure which other New South Wales government agencies in fact did overtax their separating members, but certainly others have been involved. One of my colleagues in the other place spoke on this matter in the adjournment debate on 23 February. I commend that speech to honourable senators.

         I became aware of the situation in 1990-91. The problem was very easy to fix for those people who had separated after 1 July 1986 because the three-year period of the statute of limitations for taxation was in force and they were able to seek recalculations and reassessments. The ones having problems are those who separated from the police forceâ€”and, obviously, from elsewhere in the New South Wales Public Service and associated organisationsâ€”at some time between 1978 and 1986. Those people have to attempt either to get an ex gratia payment from the state governmentâ€”because it made the mistakeâ€”or to come back to the federal Department of Finance and ask it to make repayments for the overtaxing.

         This issue has dragged on since early 1991. There are now a number of estates held up because of the recalculations that have to be made and this overtaxing that needs to paid back. I personally do not know of any, but there must be estates that this has affected for something like three or four years. It must be extremely disappointing and traumatic for the families of those members to have this hanging over their heads. To lose one's spouse or a close family member is difficult enough, but to have this situation as a constant reminder of what has happened is intolerable.

         â€”in answer to a question on notice, the police minister admitted that from August 1978 to July 1989 the New South Wales Police Service incorrectly calculated the tax payable on accumulated long service leave payments to employees on termination of services and that a number of other government departments and instrumentalities were also incorrectly calculating this particular tax.

         He further went on to say that the New South Wales service was only one of a number of New South Wales government agencies at the time which misconstrued the taxation affecting termination lump sums. He was sympathetic to the claims by the affected employees of the police service. General issues of compensation for these individuals, and for the affected former members of any other government agency, is something that can be resolved only at government level through state Treasury.

        Of chief concern is whether it is possible to obtain compensation from the Commonwealth on behalf of the retired police. The delay is mainly caused by the length of time which has elapsed since the police service incorrectly interpreted and processed taxation on lump sum entitlements of retiring police. The mistake was made so long ago that it is difficult and time consuming to reconstruct events and recalculate the amounts which would be payable. These calculations must be made before a formal approach is made to the Commonwealth. The ministry of police and emergency services is actively investigating the matter and is retrieving records in order to establish who should be compensated and the amounts involved.

         The next question to the New South Wales government is: how is it going to advise these people of their rights, of the fact that they have been overtaxed, and how they should go about endeavouring to retrieve this overtaxed amount of money? To someone who is living on a pension, and be it living on a police pension, $1,000 is a huge amount of money. I will say more about the amounts of the police pension shortly.

I would only urge them to speed up their work and to be cognisant that there are at least 220 that I personally know of who are affected, and there are a number of estates that are affected. Some of these estates could be of people who have died three or four years agoâ€”or maybe even longer. I would think that if the widows, particularly of those police officers, are entitled to $1,000, they should be receiving $1,000, because the widow's component of the police pension is not particularly great.

But I would bring to your notice today also the issue in relation to pensions to the spouses of deceased police officers, and that is, what I consider, the gross anomaly. Whilst it does not affect me financiallyâ€”I obviously have an occupation where I am, I think, well remuneratedâ€”there would be a number of people out there, usually women, who, upon the death of their spouses, would want to know what finances are available to them, and would want those to be fixed up very quickly.

         It came to my attention that, to be eligible to obtain the widow's pension from the superannuation fund, one had to be married to the superannuant at the time of his separation from the New South Wales police force. In my case, my husband left the police force on 12 November 1982. We were married on 28 March 1987, so we were married for nearly seven years. I am informed that because we were not living together in a de facto relationship in 1982, or marriedâ€”in fact, I publicly say we did not know one another thenâ€”I am ineligible for the widow's part of the pension.

         I do not know whether there are a great number of widows or widowers affected by this, but certainly a number of police officers are discharged for medical reasons from the police force at a reasonably early age. When they are medicalled out, the police force gets its pound of flesh off them first. They do not get medicalled out for trivial reasons; they are medicalled out for very good reasons. A lot of these people, if medicalled out when young, could well have re-married or married for the first time. They might well have been married for up to 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, but because they were not married or in a de facto relationship at the time of separation from the job, they would be ineligible for that part of the police pension that the widows are entitled to.

         I found out about this through a phone call I had from the State Superannuation Board. I was told quite abruptly, after I had been led to believe I was entitled to the pension by the police welfareâ€”but police welfare may not have known the key dates so I am not critical of that bodyâ€”that I was not eligible. I also had to inquire as to what date the superannuation entitlement payments ceased. They ceased from the date of death, so, given that most people would take at least a week for the wheels to turn to advise the superannuation board that an overpayment made has been made, most of the estates would be up for an overpayment. I casually asked this because I was not sure; I had assumed that it might have been like the Department of Social Security where there are a number of payments made at the old rate before they cut out to the single rate.

         When I got this letter, I was, to say the least, not impressed. When I asked about it during the phone conversation, the comment was just briskly and brusquely made that I would have to talk to social security if I needed some money. I said that I did not need to talk to social security. It was a particularly horrible attitude. As I say, they had written to me to tell me that an overpayment had been made, and during the telephone conversation I asked for a written determination as to why I was ineligible for the widow's part of the superannuation and they sent me back this letter which did not address that at all. I then wrote to them again and requested a written determination on thatâ€”advising them, as they had requested, who the solicitor handling the estate was. I also requested a copy of the trust deeds for the superannuation fund of which my husband was a member.

         I received a written determination which was fairly scanty telling me it was in the terms of the `Police Regulations Superannuation Act 1906'. However, I have not received from them either a copy of that act or the trust deeds. This is an issue which I intend to discuss with the ISC because I am not quite sure where it is going to fit within the superannuation scheme of things. I would think that, as I had written as the widow of a superannuant member of the superannuation fund, I would be entitled to a copy of the trust deeds. If there are no trust deedsâ€”and I do not know how that would come aboutâ€”at least I should be entitled to a copy of the act and regulations which determine how these decisions and determinations are made.

As to the treatment that Mrs Martin got in a number of departments, whilst some have been absolutely wonderful, there have been others which have certainly been lacking in a lot of respect and understanding of the difficult times that families have to face.

         The interaction between doctor and patient, a key element of any health system, has been changing over the last 20 to 30 years. The autonomy of patients has increased as their desire to become much more directly involved in their own care has developed. And acceptance by the patient of the doctor's opinion is less the norm now than it was, and our desire to do the best we can for our patients, acting simply in a benign form of paternalism, is clearly no longer sufficient or appropriate. But preserving the doctor's beneficence at a time when patients want to be involved to a much greater extent in decisions about their care, to choose their treatment, or even exercise their right to refuse treatment, is an adjustment we have to make. But, as we adjust, it is essential that we preserve the trust which contributes so much to the quality of care.

        Having given that notice of motion, it was suggested that we should declare it formal and then bring it on later for further debate. However, when this matter was put to the ALP, it said that it would be happy to do that, provided that item (f) was dropped off the motion.

I wanted that commendation to stand on the Senate record, and so I repeat it today.

         The fire touched so many lives, just as it nearly touched my life many years ago. One of my earliest memories as a boy is standing in the backyard of my home with a wet hessian bag waiting for pieces of fire to drop. As they dropped, we would charge over and put them out with the hessian bag. That was in the town of Eden in 1951 when the bushfires were raging up from Victoria. We were very fortunate in being in a town that was on the coast. Another of my earliest memories as a boy is being out on the beach with all the people from the town and all their furnitureâ€”beds, cupboards and the lotâ€”as the fire raced for the town. The town had an old petrol dump in the middle of it. In those days petrol was in 44-gallon drums. There were hundreds and hundreds of these in a yard in the centre of the town. We were just waiting for the town to go up. Fortunately, the wind changed and that did not happen.

         I have always had a very healthy respect for bushfires, but I did not really appreciate their awesome power until the January fires in New South Wales, which were the worst fires ever. I had the opportunity as a senator to fly over them while I was doing other tasks. Looking down on these massive fire systems, I appreciated how incredibly difficult it was to do anything about them. The Royal National Park south of Sydneyâ€”the second oldest national park in the worldâ€”looked like a moonscape. There was not one vestige of green left. Ku-ring-gai Chase was a wall of flame on the evening we flew over it. The flames stretched from the Pacific Ocean right across to the Brooklyn bridge. In one direction it was headed for the Hawkesbury and, in the other direction, it was headed for the northern suburbs of Sydney.

         At that time people talked about the Ku-ring-gai Chase fire, the Gosford fire and the Peats Ridge fire but, when looking down on the area from the air, there was one huge fire system through the Hawkesbury valley, which was almost impossible to stop. We need to come to terms with what we are dealing with in this country and the real nature of the environment.

They protestedâ€”they will claim that they did not, but all the local organisations tell me that they didâ€”whenever anyone wanted to burn off to get rid of these fuel levels.

         People were prepared to take risks during that fire. I was truly proud at the time because I believe they defined the essence of what it means to be Australian. Our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has tried to redefine this in various ways. He has tried to change the flag and the constitution, but I think he misses the point. The essence of what it means to be an Australian stood in stark relief before him last January, silhouetted against the flames of the bushfire. Thousands of men and women dropped everything in early Januaryâ€”they left their jobs and their loved ones and risked their lives for others. It was in the same spirit of the pioneers who first came to this country, it was in the same spirit at the time of war, and it was in the same spirit at the times of hardship that have faced this country.

I raised these matters in the adjournment debate on the last day of the last sitting fortnight. I rose on that occasion because two nights previously Senator Schacht had challenged my speech and that of my friend and colleague Wilson Tuckey in the other place as being one of the worst sledgings or smearings that he had seen in 25 years. Senator Schacht must not have been listening in or may not have been around when his old backbench buddy former Senator Walsh was smearing the now Senator Noel Crichton-Browne before Senator Crichton-Browne had entered this place in 1980.

         It is very important for Australian citizens to knowâ€”even more so now that Dr Lawrence has convincingly won the by-election and will be in the Keating cabinet within a few daysâ€”that Dr Lawrence's standing in the community, having been a former premier and having been a so-called defender of parliamentary standards and standards in personal behaviour, will be scrutinised as to her own behaviour. She entered the Western Australian parliament and put herself up as someone who would try to take the nasty heat out of politics in the Legislative Assembly and would not engage in crass, nasty, dirty politics. She has very successfully ensured that that is her image. If she behaves in her own affairs in the way that she says she behaves, that is to be commended and I will be the first one to commend her.

I suggested to Senator Evansâ€”and this is revealing a private conversation which I am sure Senator Evans would not mindâ€”that as a matter of courtesy, sense and fair play he refer these documents to Senator McKiernan because Senator McKiernan has an interest in and knowledge of this.

         Yesterday Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia decided to keep this matter on the boil and, I guess, to rub our noses in the loss in Fremantle by coming in here and referring to the comments of our federal secretary, Andrew Robb, that the campaign in the House of Representatives and the Senate was not an orchestrated one.

On every occasion that I have raised these sorts of contentious issuesâ€”and I am sure there have been some from time to time over the last 3 1/2 years that I have been in this placeâ€”I have always gone to my counterpart, whoever had the interest in the same debate and was to be my sparring partner, and said that I intended to do something of that type. I did that, as Senator McKiernan will attest, on the last sitting Thursday. I told Senator Evans, again, early this morning that I intended today to respond to his remarks last night. But yesterday Senator Chris Evans chose not to so inform me.

Then at least I would have been here to respond, I would not have been surprised by seeing Senator Evans's contribution on the monitor and would not have had to rush into the chamber unprepared. But Senator Chris Evans chose to do as he did. Having got to know Senator Chris Evans from sitting on aeroplanes with him from week to week, I respect him as an honourable and decent human being, and I will give him the benefit of the doubt.

I did not discuss with Andrew Robb anything I had done or said in the Senate. In fact, I know very well, from discussions about the Fremantle by-election, that it was very much Andrew Robb's opinion that personal attacks on Dr Lawrence would not assist our campaign. To that extent, I probably contravened our federal secretary's specific political instructions earlier in the campaign.

         In my response to the letter that Mrs Campbell sent me, I made a point which I think is a very important one; in Western Australia there is now a Liberal government administration. I suggested that, if there were political games being played at the time of Penny Easton's death and if those political games had any impact or any causal connection with the death, there might be a better chance of getting such a judicial or parliamentary inquiry established in Western Australia now that there is a Liberal Party administration in that state. I think that is where it should be pursued.

         If people want to continue to pursue this matter, I think the quite proper place to do that is in the respective legislature in Western Australia. I do not think that the Senate of the parliament of Australia can rule on this. In regard to this matter, I would also make the point that during the debate on the Thursday night, to which Senator Campbell referredâ€”I cannot recall the dateâ€”

         One of the points of order that I raised was that the matter of the petition of last resort had already been investigated by the privileges committee of the Legislative Council of Western Australia. That privileges committee brought down its report and exonerated Mr Halden, the person who tabled the petition. The report of the privileges committee said that Mr Halden had no option but to present the petition as a constituent had given it to him. He had no choice in the matter. He had to present it. So it was presented.

         I make the point that that privileges committee was chaired by a man who is now a respected minister of the Western Australian government, the Hon. Peter Foss. So people cannot make accusations of it being a stacked parliamentary committee which investigated the matter and which exonerated Mr Halden, because it was one of the Liberal Party's own people who was chairing it. That report has been brought down.

         â€”I wish to speak on the non-controversial matter of tobacco. Although it is non-controversial, it is certainly providing a lot of problems for growers in North Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The tobacco industry is a vital source of employment and income to parts of northern Australia and is the mainstay of the area around Mareeba and Dimbulah.

         The tobacco industry was one of the industries that opened up North Queensland. The government started the tobacco industry as an import replacement industry. People were encouraged to come to the area and take up selections to grow tobacco in the 1930s and 1940s. The Tinaroo dam and canal systems were built to sustain the industry. Out of all this government encouragement, a vital industry developed. The area prospered, the north was developed, and the industry became the mainstay for a diverse, cosmopolitan region as many European migrants were attracted to the areaâ€”Albanians, Greeks and many others.

         Sadly, for the last 10 years the industry has been in decline. It has rationalised itself, with over half the growers in North Queensland leaving the industry. The tobacco industry in recent years has also suffered the vagaries of decreasing production through health campaigns and massive government taxes. Both state and federal governments have used tobacco as a giant revenue source. Just last year, the Commonwealth collected excise of $4 billion, and Queensland had an extra $18 million windfall. Taxes are significant in that not only do they reduce consumption, which is falling at six per cent a year, but also governments directly gain extra revenue to fund worthwhile community programs such as increased education and health facilities. A breakdown of the tax from an average pack of cigarettes gives $1.22 to the federal government, $1.70 to the state government, $1.01 to the manufacturer, 80c to the retailer, and 0.06 of a cent to the grower.

         I want to address the issue of the tobacco industry today not from the health issueâ€”an important but entirely different issueâ€”but from the angle of the tobacco industry as a primary industry that has become established and sustained rural communities for the last 70 years. The tobacco industry presently operates under the tobacco industry stabilisation scheme which is due to end in September 1995. Under the scheme, growers' quotas are set. These quotas have declined way below the industry's capacity to produce 16 million tonnes. Just over the last two years, growers' quotas have been reduced by 42 per cent to 8.1 million kilograms and are expected to continue to decline next season. The industry presently operates under a mixing regulation supported by the three cigarette manufacturers as well as the growers whereby local tobacco forms 57 per cent of the tobacco used by manufacturers.

         However, the industry has just been dealt a further blow with the high quota levels submitted by the government under our schedule to the GATT Uruguay Round resolution. The government has submitted a tariff quota level for tobacco entering Australia at a concessional rate of 11.184 million kilograms or 70 to 80 per cent of local consumption. Both the manufacturers and the growers have said that this figure is too high and have said so to the government.

         The GATT process was meant to convert the local content provision which stands at 50 per cent to a tariff rate. But the effect of it being based on the 1986 to 1988 levels and not the more recent years, which more accurately reflects declining consumption, means that Australian growers will have 70 per cent or more of their market open to imports. This is a most unfair consequence of the GATT solution.

         It is predicted that by the year 1996, when the full effect of the tariff quota is being felt, Australian producers will be reduced to contributing three million kilograms, a small quantity even when compared to the much reduced 8.1 million kilograms this season. That will be a reduction of around 70 to 80 per cent of the previous quota and will result in a reduction of their income of the same proportion.

The national accounts for the December quarter were released at 11.30 a.m. today. They show that the economy grew by 1.7 per cent in real terms, seasonally adjusted, for the December quarter. That is the highest quarterly result in five years in this economy. They also show that activity increased by 4 per cent in the course of last year. This growth is controlled and appears to be occurring without any inflationary pressures. It is unambiguously good news for Australia and the economy. It shows that the economy is on track with low inflation and low interest rates and that the growth is being taken up by the private sector. These figures demonstrate private sector growth.

         As is the normal practice, the release of the national accounts will provide a trigger for the review of the government's economic forecast for the current year and for the 1994-95 year as part of the preparation for this coming budget. It is safe to say that today's figures are likely to lead to a further upwards notch in the expected growth figure for 1993-94 from the revised figure of 3 1/2 per cent announced by the Treasurer in early February. Indeed, the December quarter result confirms that underlying growth is now running at around four per cent, as indicated by the Treasurer at that time. However, it provides no credence for those who, for whatever purpose, have recently been stirring up concerns about the economy overheating.

         The composition of the growth revealed by these figures is further confirmation of the shift in activity to the private sector. Private sector consumption and stock building were by far the largest two contributors to growth in the December quarterâ€”contributions of 1.1 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points respectively to the expenditure measure of GDP. Net exports contributed a further 0.4 percentage pointsâ€”evidence of the significant structural improvement which has been achieved in Australia's external accounts. In contrast, public sector consumption was merely 0.2 percentage points.

         Business investment was neutral in terms of growth in the December quarter. Nevertheless, the strong build-up in private non-farm stocks is evidence of the continuing improvement in business confidence and a further reflection of the strong fundamentals, which point to an increase in investment for the future. Those fundamentals are historically low inflation, historically high company profits, strengthening consumer confidence and the evidence of increasing capacity utilisation in the economy. These growth figures are impressive. They surpass our major trading partners as a group. If I were to characterise them, I would do so by saying that the wind is in our sails, we are on a calm sea, we are on a broad reach, we are reaching well and we are on course.

She asked a question the other day, to which I gave an answer. It is absolutely extraordinary to suggest that $9 million is being spent on the ACTU-caucus working party. If he had read the answer, which he obviously has not done, he could not possibly say that. It includes things like saying that $2 million is for casemix developments which would have occurred in any event. So the idea that we are spending $9 million on a caucus-ACTU working party is a farce and a joke. It was not in the question. He must be getting awfully desperate to suggest it.

         I understand why Senator Herron would be getting desperate. On Saturday I spoke to 200 surgeons in Western Australiaâ€”200 of his colleagues. It was a fascinating afternoon. I think one thing that the discussion paper I put out last year has achieved is that, even if he has not been prepared to reconsider anything that his profession has done, his profession will reconsider it anyway. I listened to them telling me how they will now agree to bundling bills so that each patient got one bill from them. They do not want to go down my path, but they want to do that. They were very worried about how many of their colleagues were charging as much as they were. They are very concerned about the gaps and how much damage it is doing to them. They are glad it is on the agenda, and they want me to legislate, and support legislation in the states, to make it compulsory for patients to be told how much surgeons will charge.

         â€”There are many different kinds of Senate committee hearings and inquiries and in some of them it has to be expected that partisan political considerations will prevail and the committee will not meet judicial or even quasi-judicial standards. When a Senate committee is looking at the question of propriety or impropriety, when it is passing judgment on the conduct of individuals, when it is passing judgment on business decisions that affect the credibility and the viability of particular companies, then it is absolutely crucial that the highest standards of propriety be adhered to by the committee and by all those associated with it. That is why the revelations about the actions of Senator Alston are so serious and why the government believes he should step down as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in relation to the Print Media.

         We have here a situation in which the inquiry, of which Senator Alston is chairman, is determining three central questions: whether there were conditions attached to the approval of an increase in foreign ownership to the effect that Fairfax coverage had to be balanced; if so, did Fairfax act on the basis of any such arrangement; and, if so again, what was the propriety of such conduct or arrangement. Against that background, we now have revelations of Senator Alston ringing a Fairfax editor on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition complaining of bias and demanding balanced coverage, and doing so at a time when he was exercising real power in determining the outcome of an inquiry that was crucial to Fairfax's commercial reputation.

         I stress that what matters here is what Senator Alston can be seen to have done. We do not know what his actual intention was. It may be, as the Fairfax editor Alan Kohler was saying, he was just plain dumb. But in all the appearances here, Senator Alston stands accused of hypocrisy and double standards as a result of his doing the very thing that he is complaining about in others. Unless he stands down, he can rightly and justly be accused of bringing the Senate committee system into disrepute. In the government's view, he should stand down immediately.

We have had an ongoing commitment to ensure that all Australians exercise and enjoy their human rights, and that the interests of individuals and minorities are not sacrificed at the will of the majority. If one looks at our record, since coming to office some 10 years or so ago the government has established national human rights machinery to assist in the domestic protection of human rights. We have outlawed race discrimination, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and disability discrimination. We have established the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. We have ensured the right to privacy and we have created the office of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner.

         No site-specific environmental issues arose out of the assessment process. The new site is not expected to give rise to new environmental issues or different impacts. Impacts of the facility and associated dredging on seagrass beds and prawn fisheries were examined as part of the EIS process, and the Northern Territory government made recommendations for further studies in regard to these impacts. I am advised that these studies are addressed in the draft dredging environmental management plan. The EMP provides for the monitoring and management of impacts. For example, impacts on seagrass beds will be managed as part of that monitoring process. I understand that the changes to the design of the facility were in response to a recommendation by the Northern Territory government that the length of the causeway originally proposed be minimised. This causeway has now been eliminated to reduce impacts on longshore drift.

        The sorts of matters that Senator Vanstone is concerned about were investigated by Coroner Cahill in the Winchester inquiry without the result that she alleges. Not only are the allegations outlandish, but also the government has been keen to pursue allegations relating to Italian organised crimeâ€”a matter which Senator Vanstone should also know. We have given a reference on Italian organised crime to the National Crime Authority. It is matter No. 14, and was referred in June 1992. As a member of the NCA parliamentary joint committee, Senator Vanstone would know this. She would also know in respect of that reference that there has been no political interferenceâ€”no interference by the governmentâ€”with the NCA or the AFP in terms of its investigations.

         Referring that matter to the NCA is reflective of the government's ongoing commitment to pursue organised crime as far as it is within our capacity on a state or federal level. Senator Vanstone would also know that the NCA, in adopting that inquiry, has done so through a mechanism which involves both state and federal operations. Investigations are flowing from that reference. They have been undertaken in most jurisdictions in Australia and have been coordinated by the NCA. That reference in respect of Italian organised crime is supported by all governments in Australia and is getting results.

         The government is determined to fight organised crime in this country and internationally. If Senator Vanstone is patient, she will appreciate that the inquiry I referred to is important in that respect and she will very soon see the Minister for Justice announcing the government's response to the recently completed review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements. As all senators should appreciate, we are aware of the need to pursue organised crime. Our determination is to fight it in all its manifestations.

         â€”Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister seems to confuse today, as he did yesterday, the allegation that a 1990 AFP report has come to this conclusion with some sort of remarks that may have been made by Mr Verducci in the Winchester inquiry. The Winchester inquiry was not charged with the responsibility of ascertaining the veracity of the allegation that government and non-government agencies have been infiltrated by Italian organised crime, nor with ascertaining the veracity of the allegation that a major Australian political party has been so infiltrated. So the minister's answer, to that extent, is deficient, because that was not the task of the Winchester inquiry. I come back to the original question: does the government accept the allegation made in the AFP report? If it does not accept the allegation made in the AFP report, is the minister saying that the AFP was simply wrong and incompetent in drawing the conclusions that it did?

         â€”One way or another, what is clear is that it is an election promise made and an election promise kept. It is going to assist unemployed people very significantly. It is at an estimated cost of $40 million in a full year. It means that there is an increased incentive and reward for unemployed people to look for and take up part-time or casual work without the same threat against their pension, particularly if they have this credit amassed. It is also going to be particularly useful for people who at the moment find that it is very hard to get full-time work but who are able to benefit from part-time and, particularly, casual or seasonal work.

         The earnings credit will also be available to people receiving sickness allowance who, while not yet fit to return to full-time work, may be able to make a gradual or graded return to work through part-time or casual work. Once people leave the unemployed payment system, their accumulated credit will be preserved for up to 13 weeks, so the earnings credit will also be of benefit to those people who come on and off unemployment benefits looking for and enjoying sometimes the benefits of casual or seasonal work. The earnings credit very much assists people on unemployment benefits. It recognises that they are much better assisted towards returning to full-time work if they are able to have access to part-time or casual work. It is an excellent addition to people on unemployment benefits.

         national index on small business activity, which has now been going for nearly a year on a quarterly basis, has already established itself, I think, as the pre-eminent indicator in the private sector of small business activity. Every quarter it surveys over 1,000 firms across Australia. These are statistically and regionally balanced, and are small businesses with a maximum of 19 employees.

         The survey found that confidence in small business had surged during the December quarter. Of the small businesses, 31 per cent reported higher sales and 21 per cent reported higher profits. Nearly three-quarters of proprietors expressed confidence in their prospects. The highest confidence reported was in manufacturing and business services which I find, as a minister in the industry portfolio, very pleasing indeed to hear. Also, 60 per cent of small businesses surveyed see economic recovery as being well under way. I know that figure will disappoint all senators opposite with the possible exception of Senator Boswell who I think, from my 12 months in the job, is the only senator opposite who genuinely raises issues of small business with me, both publicly and privatelyâ€”and I acknowledge that.

Employment in small businesses surveyed rose by one per cent in the quarter to February. Fifteen per cent of proprietors of small businesses expect to increase employment in the next three months.

         â€”Some of these issues were raised in the discussions with Secretary Christopher when he was in Australia a few days ago. The situation overall is this: the Uruguay Round disciplines on export subsidies will require a reduction of 36 per cent in budgetary terms and 21 per cent in terms of the volume of subsidised exports that will be permitted during the implementation period from 1995 to 2000. In the case of the US, for example, that will mean a reduction in value of subsidies on wheat and flour exports from $US846 million to $US364 million and a very significant reduction in volume from 21.4 million tonnes to 14.5 million tonnes.

         We are aware that farm organisations in the US are pressing their government to convert export subsidy programs such as the EEP into some sort of tool for general market promotion. That would not enable the US to avoid its reduction commitments on export subsidies but would be a worrying development. It would certainly show to be empty the persistent claims that have been made by the US to the effect that it is a reluctant subsidiser and that it is in the export subsidy business only to protect its interests against unfair trading practices of other countries, particularly those in Europe.

The period between now and then is really quite crucial. He also gave a commitment that the European Community would not initiate any escalation in export subsidies. The government is seeking parallel assurances on those matters from the United States. That is very much a part of the discussions that have occurred and will be followed up.

         There is no reason to suppose that the Americans, when confronted with the international spotlight that these practices will be now under as a result of the conclusion of the Round negotiations, will not meet their obligations. They sometimes twist and wriggle a little in terms of getting to the barrier on these matters but once the obligation is set in concrete, is clearly determined, and the rules that are applicable are clear as they are nowâ€”or certainly will be with the establishment of the WTOâ€”then I do not think there is any reason whatsoever to doubt the bona fides and credibility of our friends in the United States.

Senator Neal asks a question which relates to one of the world's most pressing problems, that is, the unprecedented illegal movement of people. It is an enormous issue, a world-wide one. The United Nations Population Fund has estimated that with the 100 million people on the move throughout the world todayâ€”the scale of today's migration being beyond that of previous experienceâ€”this problem is one that poses a whole raft of challenges. It poses challenges to governments all over the world. They are faced with the challenge of an increasing number of people seeking to move by illegal channels. It poses risks to the persons involved and also to the countries that carry them either by way of transit or as final destinations, including security and health risks.

         This is a new phenomenon. We are seeing the growth of a particularly undesirable aspect of this phenomenonâ€”the clandestine trade in illegal migrants known as people smuggling. This practice amounts to little more than slavery. It is slavery for those who pay large sums of money to smuggling gangs, many of whom have links with organised crime.

          Australia has had a long-term interest in this area. We share the concerns of nations which are trying to deal with the many problems associated with the large scale of illegal movements of people, the large scale of people smuggling. As a consequence, I am pleased to be able to announce that the Australian government will host a regional consultation on illegal migration in Canberra on 11 and 12 April 1994. The consultation will bring together some 18 participants from the Asia-Pacific region, as well as international organisations with major involvement in this area. Our objective in hosting this meeting is to begin a process which will enable the exchange of information and views between countries in the region, improve the flow of information, enable participants to define what they see as illegal migration, and demonstrate how illegal migratory movements manifest themselves. But, more importantly, we will discuss options for future action.

We anticipate that by kicking off this process, Australia will once again be at the lead in confronting a problem which is confronted by nations world-wide.

         However, the discussion paper also proposes that, when certain conditions are satisfied, taxpayers will be able to use a simpler accruals method known as daily straight line accruals.

A standard debenture which pays interest regularly at a fixed rate and which is not issued at a significant discount or premium would be susceptible to the simpler daily straight line accruals method.

Taxpayers in this situation could choose to perform 1,826 separate calculations, if they were so inclined, but it would be far simpler for them to compute the daily internal rate of return using a standard financial calculator or spreadsheet program.

The information I have is, I think, that there were only three outstanding questions, including one from transport which Senator Campbell has not asked about but which I will provide some information on anyway.

          The Department of Transport answer to question No. 1027â€”it is the same questionâ€”was lodged with the Table Office on 14 March 1994. The answer to the ATSIC question, which is No. 1031, has been completed in draft form and is only awaiting approval from the minister; it is in his office now. So that, I am assured, will be very soon in coming. The answer to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy question, which is question No. 1023, is now only awaiting input from the Department of Administrative Services. So that answer will also not be long in coming. To the best of my knowledge and advice, they are the only questions that are currently unanswered.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr this day, relating to the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in relation to the Print Media.

        The history of this inquiry is essentially a farrago of appalling misjudgments. The very fact that the Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in the Print Media was established under the terms of reference that it was, suggested to me that there was a distinct possibility the committee would turn into a farce. When we look at a Senate committee which essentially is examining the propriety or impropriety of, and passing judgments on, the conduct of individuals or business decisions that affect the credibility and viability of particular companies, it is absolutely crucial that the operations of that committee are seen to be aboveboard. However, that has not been the case.

         From the beginning of the operations of this committee on 9 March 1994 we were told there would be no witch-hunt. Assurances were given, both by the opposition and the Australian Democrats, that there would not be a witch-hunt and that issues of great substance would be considered. However, the establishment of this committee has demonstrated that to have been an act of misjudgment. The second act, I suppose, was the proposition that the chair be given to Senator Alston, a member of the opposition, which clearly has a political agenda to pursue, as evidenced by the way in which the matters have been under investigation.

         The committee has demonstrated to us that it has been operating double standards. We have complained on many occasions about the way in which this committee has operated. We have indicated that we are not entirely happy with the breach of the conventions in the way in which these sorts of committees should operate. We have seen the threatening of public servants and, I believe, attempts to intimidate public servants and acts of misjudgment. We have also been given in recent times an indication by Senator Alston that he has the capacity to ring the editor of a newspaper, the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Age

         In politics, one should not necessarily suggest that stupidity in itself is a reason for resignation. We know that if that were the case quite a few people in public life would have some difficulty. However, we do have a real problem with the intentions of Senator Alston. Whatever he claims were his intentions, his actions have given the committee the appearance of having been fundamentally compromised. We have a situation where the chairman of the committee at this time has more power at his disposal than he is ever likely to have.

         A report to be brought down will comment upon the operations of John Fairfax Ltd and the actions of individuals with respect to their propriety. That raises some pretty basic questions about the way in which the committee should operate. When it is said that there should be some discussion and that questions of judgment should be exercised with respect to the transfer of ownership of Fairfax, it is important and absolutely fundamental that there is no hypocrisy from the chairman. There should also be no question of double standards. In this case, the chairman of this committee has indicated on the public record that he believes that these matters are clear and that a deal was done. He has prejudged the operations of the committee. We have seen the final act of misjudgment.

         The question I put to Senator Evans today was based on my concern for the integrity of our committee. It really does raise the issue of how long this committee can continue. Quite clearly, it is in the interests of the operations of this committeeâ€”if it wants any integrity at all in the reportâ€”that Senator Alston stand down from the chair. I believe that there are very fundamental issues here that go to the question of propriety and the issue of hypocrisy. Acting on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the chairman of this committee, at a time when he has more power than he is ever likely to have, is able to raise matters with editors about the question of balance, the very subject we are purporting to inquire into. It is quite clear, as far as I am concerned, that Senator Alston should stand down. Under the terms of reference that have been put through this Senate, another coalition member can take the chair. If there is to be any propriety or integrity in the way in which this committee operates, Senator Alston should stand down.

         â€”I also wish to take particular note of the answer given by Senator Gareth Evans. I thought it was highly significant in a number of respects; in fact, it was quite measured. In some ways, I do not think he had his heart in it. For example, he did not seek to comment on the suggestion of a deal which, in the last day or so, has been elevated in yet another desperate attempt to suggest that somehow the Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in the Print Media is not behaving in the way that it should. On 18 November last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when in Seattle, in talking about Conrad Black, said:

         If we are talking about the way in which the committee has operated, it is worth remembering a couple of important things. This is very significant. There are a number of crucial matters of public importance. The whole role of the Foreign Investment Review Board and its effectiveness are crucial issues to public policy considerations in this country. Yet what we have had to date is, to say the least, a marked reluctance for any cooperation on the part of government. The Prime Minister treats the Senate committees with contempt. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) puts every obstacle in the way of the committee and declines any invitation to attend. Those who are on the committee, particularly Senator Loosley and Senator Carr, have no compunction about doing all that they can to derail the committee.

         â€”I think that the government senators on this committee ought to get their facts straight. I refer firstly to comments made by Alan Kohler yesterday on the

         of the leadership questions in the Liberal Party. He said that Senator Alston made it very clear that he was calling as shadow minister for communications and on behalf of John Hewson. Mr Kohler said:

        He is corroborating what Senator Alston said in relation to the joke that he made. It was a jokeâ€”and, in fact, Senator Alston was contacting Mr Kohler about something completely different. Mr Kohler revealed that during the previous week he had had three, four or five contacts from various politicians. He said, `It kind of goes on all the time'. In fact, Paul Kelly, who was interviewed on the same station, said:

        Well, I don't know exactly what Senator Alston said, but I see absolutely nothing improper in that at all. I mean, it's going to be a sad and sorry day if we get to the stage where journalists or editors believe it's improper for politicians to ring them up.

        I remind the government senators on the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in the Print Media to remember that the terms of reference do relate to specific matters. They relate to the origin and basis of decisions in 1991 and 1993 to increase the permissible percentage of foreign ownership of newspapers, and that would go up to about March 1993. They do not involve anything which has happened since then. For the government senators on this committee to suggest that members of the committee, including the chairman, are not at liberty to phone up an editor or a journalist in this country and say that they are not being properly treated or they are not being given accurate coverage is absolutely outrageous.

         I would hate it if government senators ever served on a jury because I am damn sure they would not look at the facts of the matter before them. In this case the facts are before them and they should look at what Mr Kohler said. Mr Kohler said that in no way did he feel that any influence was being brought to bear.

         Mr Kohler said that Senator Alston made it abundantly clear that he was approaching him on a matter completely separate to that which is under inquiry by this committee. Even Paul Kelly, when he was interviewed, thought that this was farcical. He said, `I would never complain about politicians, whatever committee they are heading, calling up and making their views known'. Undoubtedly, at one stage or another honourable senators in this chamber have called a journalist or an editor to make their views known. It is completely proper, in the process of democracy in this country, that honourable members exercise their roles as senators by contacting journalists and editors when they feel they have been hard done by. Every one of us has felt that an article has been unfair either to our party or ourselves. We are at liberty to call the journalist who wrote the article or the newspaper and put our view forward. That is all that Senator Alston was doing: he was talking about something completely different.

         Reading the terms of reference, government senators will see that those terms of reference have nothing to do with the subject about which Senator Alston telephoned Mr Kohler. Mr Kohler admits that; he fully corroborates Senator Alston. There is no case for Senator Alston to answer and, if government senators read the advice from the Clerk of the Senate, they too will realise that.

Really, Senate select committees ought not to be abused in this way; they ought not to become vehicles by which people can be abused. There is no doubt that this inquiry was conceived in political malice. I do not make that reference to the Australian Democrats because I understand Senator Kernot's principal concern rested with the workings of the Foreign Investment Review Board and foreign investment policy generally. It would have been far better had there never been the political malice demonstrated in respect of the Fairfax takeover and had the foreign investment questions been dealt with separately by a Senate standing committee with all the processes of due deliberation and care. It would have been an infinitely better circumstance.

         The situation we now have is that the Select Committee on Print Media, Foreign Ownership Decisions has become a continuing embarrassment to the opposition rather than to the government because of the behaviour of the chair. I will not make personal references. What has been going on is just plain silly: the manner in which the government was excluded from the loop of information, the way in which people waltzed into the Senate and moved motions without consulting the committee and now political intervention.

Matters may or may not be coming to a head this evening in terms of the standards that should apply to the chair of a Senate select committee. A single standard ought to be maintained for everybody on both sides of the chamber. It is not good enough for people to insist on the highest standards of office for the government while the coalition simultaneously maintains the standards of high farce. It is simply not good enough. There ought to be a single standard.

         When Senator Alston was quoted twice in the last 24 hoursâ€”he may have said it on other occasions, but I have only seen two quotesâ€”I really thought that a deal had been done, an arrangement had been concluded and that he had predetermined matters. My view is that part of the terms of reference cited by Senator Ellison earlier required the committee to look at the circumstances of the Fairfax takeover in 1991 and related matters to see whether there had been any quid pro quo and any arrangement. I say without fear of contradiction that no evidence before the committee to date suggests that in any way, shape or form. I have no doubt that when we come to deliver the final report no evidence in those terms will have been presented to the committee.

There is a political conflict of interest when the chairman of a committee looking at the Fairfax organisation rings the editor of a major metropolitan daily and says, `I do not like the political line being pursued by Mark Baker. Is it his line or is it the line of the paper?'. That is what Senator Alston told the committee. They are not my words; they are the words of the chairman of the committee. He did not like the political line being pursued by Mr Baker. He asked Mr Kohler whether it was also the line of the

Two issues are involved. The first one is the propriety of Senator Alston's call to Mr Kohler, which we have canvassed in detail in the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in relation to the Print Media. While I have said that I thought the timing was unwise because it was capable of being misconstrued, I cannot see any impropriety in Senator Alston's actions in connection with the terms of reference of the committee's inquiry.

We also know that some 40 per cent of all photosynthetic activity on earth is now being consumed either directly or indirectly by humans. When I raised this question with Senator Schacht several weeks ago, he did not even understand the question. It means that some 30 million other species with which we share this planet have only about 60 per cent of that photosynthetic activity available for all their activities of life.

It is quite true, as we may hear from either the government or the opposition, that we do not know what the consequences of this change will be. There are certainly predictions. The intergovernmental panel on climate change has made estimates in relation to changes in global climate, changes in temperature, changes in rainfall and so forth. One must comment that the changes which have been observed are consistent with those models. We are indeed on track for the sorts of changes that those 200 scientists from over 20 countries on two separate occasions have predicted.

In other words, we should slow down our rates of burning of fossil fuel; we should slow down those other activities which are affecting the composition of the atmosphere.

         The whole reason for raising this debate this afternoon is simply that, on all the indications, the government has accepted, temporarily, a very weak set of recommendations. It has not done anything to implement those recommendations and we fear it is now going to move away even from those very weak recommendations for stabilisation by the year 2000 and a 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005 based on the 1988 figures.

         It may be assertedâ€”and has been asserted by the opposition in particular but no less on occasions by the governmentâ€”that there is some conflict between the economy and the environment. We could easily achieve these targets of stabilisation and a 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005 while benefiting the economy. I stress most strongly that Australia, because of its procrastination, is being left behind. Other countries are instituting energy efficiency; other countries are developing more efficient ways of production. They are reducing their costs by doing that and are stealing a march on Australia. So there is in this instance no conflict between the achievement of these targets and the economic wellbeing of this country either in terms of profitability or in terms of employmentâ€”indeed, the two things are consonant. We can achieve those greenhouse targets. We can do better, and we can improve the economy and employment at the same time.

         I turn now to transport. With great difficulty I convinced the government that it should go down the road of supporting ethanol as an alternative fuel. Fortunately, we have now embarked on that road, and Australia is well on the way to developing some very exciting technology which will make ethanol as cheap as petrol. We will indeed be able to use a renewable fuel, provided that the government is serious about supporting the remaining research in the development of ethanol from cellulose.

         We already have the world's best technology in solar hot water; a technology which is present in only 6 per cent of Australia's homes. With the application of solar hot water alone we could very substantially reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from electricity generating stations. But we do not find this federal government consistently and seriously addressing the problem of the recalcitrantsâ€”and I use that word deliberatelyâ€”of the electricity utilities around Australia, which have simply sought to increase their production of electricity rather than use least-cost planning to produce a system which has energy service use at the point of use as its principal objective.

         I would suggest very strongly that the federal government use its corporations powers, as it did in the case of Tasmania, to say to the electricity utilities around Australia, `You shall import no more heavy generating equipment into Australia for the next 25 years', to force the utilities to adopt least-cost planning and to provide, through various incentives, ways in which domestic hot water services might be just as competitive as the provision of electric hot water. People do not basically need electricity; they need hot water; they need the services which electricity and other energy forms make available. We can do that with fewer greenhouse gas emissions, with more employment and at lower cost by going down the road of alternative energy and energy efficiency.

         The intergovernmental panel on climate change has twice said that we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent as rapidly as possible. Translated into Australia's terms, that means a 92 per cent reduction on a per capita basis. The government has accepted a very weak figure when it suggests stabilisation by 2000, and a 20 per cent reduction by 2005. I am very concerned that the government is going to move away from those adopted standards. I urge the government to stay with those standards or, if possible, to improve on them. Next Monday, 21 March, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will come into force. For the first time Australia, like the other parties to the convention, will be legally required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, yet the Australian governmentâ€”against the weight of international, scientific and political opinionâ€”has pulled back from the commitments. I urge the government to stay with those, or even better, standards.

         â€”In October 1990 the Commonwealth government, along with state, territory and local governments, adopted the national interim planning target and agreed to develop a nationally coordinated response. The interim planning target is sometimes, however, mischaracterised, and unfortunately that has happened today. Senator Coulter has not included it at all, because it should be noted that after the words `the year 2005' in his motion the rest of the sentence continues:

        They are significant words, and I do not think we can ever in this debate avoid confronting them. The target adopted by Australia has a high degree of synergy with the commitments and principles in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It recognises that there is a range of important greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, and it does not limit action to a single gas. It also recognises the importance of a global response in order to effectively counter the challenge posed by increasing greenhouse gas emissions. It also recognises that concerted action must take place within the framework of a sustainable Australian economy and a sustainable Australian trade competitiveness as well as protecting the environment.

         At the same time as Australia adopted the interim planning target, the international communityâ€”recognising that the prospect of global climate change resulting from enhanced greenhouse effects presents some of the most far-reaching problems ever facedâ€”agreed to develop a framework convention on climate change under the auspices of the United Nations. The Rio Earth Summit developed a convention that was open for signature at that landmark conference. Australia, along with 150 other nations, signed the convention and announced that we would work towards its early entry into force. We took the pledge seriously, becoming the ninth nation to lodge an instrument of ratification with the United Nations as far back as December 1992.

         At the same time, we were developing Australia's national response, becoming one of the first countries in the world to develop an action planâ€”the national greenhouse response strategy, which I will refer to later. As Senator Cook said, next Monday is a landmark day because it is the day that the convention comes into force. The necessary 50 ratifications needed to bring the convention into force were achieved in December of last year. I suppose that, in itself, is not of great moment but it is worth noting that among the 50 nations were the US, the European Union, Japan, China and India. They are the nations that are the major greenhouse gas emitters. That event will trigger a series of activities that will culminate in the first conference of the parties, which will occur in Berlin in March 1995.

         The issues can be divided into two streams of activity: operational and institutional arrangements that must be put in place to assure the rapid implementation of the convention; and work in preparation for the first review of the adequacy of the emissions commitments in the convention. The review of the adequacy of the convention's commitments was formally discussed for the first time at the February 1994 meeting of the negotiating body. Resulting from those discussions, there is now a widespread acceptance that the convention's existing commitments are inadequate and need to be strengthened. As a result of this widespread agreement, there is now a strong expectation that the first conference of the parties will launch a negotiating process for a protocol that will establish further and more detailed commitments to move the global community towards meeting the objective of the convention.

         I would like to state quite clearly that, contrary to what some have been saying, Australian support has not diminished or evaporated on the question of the adoption of targets and timetables that acknowledge the principles embedded in the convention, such as the comprehensive approach and equitable burden sharing. At the last negotiating meeting, the Australian delegation also made this point during the discussions on the review of the adequacy of the convention's commitments. However, we also have to recognise that, without credible action by Australia domestically, we will not have any standing internationally to influence events. We are going to have to make sure that our act is in order.

         Consistent with this, the Commonwealth government has been pursuing as a priority the adoption and further development of the national greenhouse response strategy. The Council of Australian Governments endorsed that strategy at its meeting in December 1992. Australia's national greenhouse response strategy contains a comprehensive framework for taking action. The three-pronged goal of that framework is as follows: to contribute towards effective global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions and enhance greenhouse gas sinks; to improve knowledge and understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect; and to prepare for potential impacts of climate change in Australia. The framework also contains a set of objectives and strategies for key economic sectors and areas of public sector activity and some initial actions to abate greenhouse gas emissions.

         I want to point out some of the general principles which underlie all of the response measures. These are specified in the strategy. It is important to understand what they are because they guide and explain Australia's approach to responding to the threat of climate change. Response measures should be effective in furthering the strategy goal and be economically efficient. Perhaps more importantly, from Senator Coulter's point of view, one of the principles is that response measures should be directed towards the interim planning target.

         The strategy is a phased plan of action towards limiting greenhouse gas emissions, conserving and enhancing greenhouse gas sinks and preparing for the potential impacts of climate change.

Certainly, in accordance with some undertakings that I have given to Senator Coulter privately, over the next few days I will be taking up with the department some of the matters that he raised here today.

         Finally, the strategy contains mechanisms for continued monitoring of the programs identified and for assessing performance in the actions, as well as arrangements for the periodic review and continuing development of the strategy. That includes the scope to reassess objectives as we go along and to reassess programs in the light of new scientific information in this area, because we are getting new scientific information all the time. Therefore, we will monitor international developments, we will monitor the effectiveness of the response actions and we will make sure as we go along that if we need to change then change we shall.

The important thing to note is that more can be done, more is being done and more will be done. Measures adopted in the first phase include actions focused particularly on the energy and transport sectors and things like energy efficient standards for a range of equipment and goods, provision of the information of energy users and looking at environmentally favourable electricity generation technologies, et cetera.

In addition, the development of measures considered to date for the national greenhouse response strategy has largely been limited to Commonwealth and state-territory government actions. The Commonwealth will canvass with the states some proposal which would draw together a picture of Australia's progress by mid-1994. We will then present that to the public.

         â€”The sentiments and general thrust of this motion by Senator Coulter are supported by the coalition. The actual wording of the motion requires some closer scrutiny. Most Australians accept that the level of greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide, is increasing and that there is a need to reduce these gases, but there is a debate about whether global warming will occur, and that debate continues. Certainly the balance seems to suggest that it will, but I note an interesting article by Roger Pocklington, Kenneth Drinkwater and Richard Morgan entitled `Scientists sceptical of greenhouse alarms', which does in fact make interesting reading.

         The evidence for the likelihood of global warming is such that we cannot ignore it. I agree with Senator Coulter that we have to slow down the increasing emission of greenhouse gases. It is interesting to note that the analysis of air from previous centuries captured in the Arctic ice and atmospheric measurements taken since the 1950s confirms the rapid increase of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.

         Because carbon dioxide captures heat in the atmosphere, it follows that we could expect some increase in global temperatures as carbon dioxide levels increase. Fortunately, the equation is not that simple. If it were, we would be experiencing a much greater rise in temperature than the 0.6 degree centigrade rise that has been measured over the last century.

         Scientists have tried to model the effects, but the models have been crude compared with the complexity of the system. Early models predicted temperature rises of four to five degrees and accompanying sea rises, due to thermal expansion, of one to two metres. More recent models, however, have predicted a smaller temperature rise of one to two degrees and a tidal rise of 20 centimetres by the year 2030. Many important questions remain to be answered.

         There is a very real fear that, as temperatures are not increasing in concert with the increase in greenhouse gases, a critical point may be reached at which the ability of the world to absorb more carbon dioxide is exceeded and a large and sudden rise in temperature occurs as a consequence. It would be foolish for governments to ignore the possibility of global warming. It is the responsibility of governments to keep an open mind, to monitor scientific evidence and to continually adjust policy on the basis of that evidence. It is also essential that governments continue to monitor costs to business and employment as a result of any action they take on global warming.

         It is said that more than half of the carbon dioxide emissions in Australia come from the burning of coal. That is why the electricity industry, with its coal burning power stations, is often in the firing line. By cutting down on the use of electricity and by using it more efficiently, Australia will cut down its emission of carbon dioxide. Australia contributes only two per cent of the global greenhouse gases and, consequently, any reduction in our emissions would have only a minimal effect on the overall problem.

         In an attempt to address the problem of greenhouse and its effects on climate change, the United Nations developed its convention on climate change. The convention was put to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, known as the Rio conference, held in Brazil in June 1992. The developing countries which signed the convention agreed to a number of commitments, including the recognition that a return to earlier levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000 was desirableâ€”I emphasise `was desirable'â€”and their eventual aim of returning to the 1990 levels of emission in due course. The convention was not precise about the level of stabilisation by the year 2000 or about when signatory countries should return to 1990 levels of emission.

While the cost of production is running from $16 to $22 per litre of oil or gas equivalent, it is selling at $14 a litre.

         The national greenhouse response strategy that Australia has recently published is disappointing and compares poorly with actions taken by other developed countries such as Denmark, Germany and the USA. This information is provided by a recent report produced by an international network of environmental non-government organisations. The concerns of the environment movement about the weaknesses of Australia's strategy are confirmed by inspection of Australia's official report on its implementation of the national greenhouse response strategy just released. Western Australiaâ€”again I mention my stateâ€”one of our main resource development states and highest greenhouse gas producers per capita, did not even contribute to our national report. All other states and territories and the Commonwealth did. For this reason, the Greens (WA) express their support for the motion that is being considered and urge the government to improve its attempts in this regard.

Senator Coulter has to understand, in pushing for this motion to be acceptedâ€”if it were read by those in Australian households, they would not understand itâ€”that there are more concerns than just alternative energy policies. There are jobs and livelihoods on the line. I was very disappointed that, in the 10 minutes available to Senator Coulter, he did not show a great deal more sophistication in his approach to this matter because, as I said, he is the so-called expert in this area; he has spent a lifetime studying it.

         On the face of it, although this motion is accepted by the coalition as having some merit, if Senator Coulter and his policies are set loose, they are, in fact, quite dangerous and a threat to the economic well-being of Australia. The motion before the Senate basically deals with a new age concept of the greenhouse effect. Senator Coulter is calling for the enforcement of the 1990 Rio conference agreement, to which Australia was a signatory with 48 other countries. From the Rio conference, the federal government has adopted an interim planning target of stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, based on the 1988 levels, by the year 2000, and reducing these emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005â€”an ambitious program.

         It is believed that this target would stabilise the greenhouse gas emissions and stem the alleged and, indeed, phoney prophecies of severe climate change and overheating of the earth.

          While carbon dioxide levels are going up, it can be said that there is no direct link with current climatic changes. It is not a scientific fact.

All are marginal climatic changes, other than the normal and expected evolutionary changes in climate. This is borne out by the fact that the doomsday predictions of the 1980s have fallen flat in the 1990s. I will refer to two of those predictions of the 1980s.

He saw fit, in his opening remarks, to say that much more research was needed because scientists did not yet know enough to accurately predict the impact of the greenhouse effect.

         That is all very well in this placeâ€”at last we have seen some effortsâ€”but where are the low wattage computers? I understand that these days there is software available, as well as hardware, which could be very quickly installedâ€”software which acts a little bit like a screen saver by shutting or slowing down the computer after a period of inactivity. Why are we in this place not at the forefront in the use of such products? Why is our government not showing initiative by using its purchasing power to encourage the use of such obvious energy savers?

Senator Coulter mentioned the available option of increasing Australia's usage of solar water heating.

         We know the value of insulation in reducing our energy consumption. Senator Panizza would be well aware of the value to Australia's pastoral industries if there were an increase in the use of wool as an insulating material. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy could well be a leader in this regard. It would create jobs for Australians and improve Australia's economy by reducing our greenhouse emissions and our need to import either fuels or energy sources from overseas. But what do we do? We stand accusedâ€”the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in particularâ€”of ignoring these opportunities to create jobs and to increase economic activity by trying to reduce our greenhouse emissions.

         Senator McGauran claimed that the predictions of dire consequences if we do not reduce our greenhouse emissions have been debunkedâ€”to use his wordsâ€”yet he did not offer us any quotes from research or any information which backed up that claim. In contrast, I offer these examples. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is composed of more than 300 of the world's leading climate experts, who are in agreement that current climatic patterns are threatened by the growth in greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC has stated categorically:

         â€”Senator McGauran has left us with a wealth of fertile arguments. It is very disturbing to see how amazingly and frighteningly misrepresented many of these ideas on the greenhouse gas problem are. Senator McGauran said that there are jobs on the line, that there are livelihoods on the line. Certainly there are. They are on the line because people are not thinking on a medium-term or long-term basis. In Western Australia the jobs that are going in this area most notably are at Collie. They are going because the industry is shedding jobs. The Collie power station, if it goes ahead, will be based on a net loss of jobs. Yet the least cost planning approach to energy planningâ€”which has been used successfully in a number of countries, including Japan and many OECD countriesâ€”has benefits. It brings more jobs, less waste, healthier economies and a better environment.

         We in Australia are basing our policy decisions on the greenhouse problem on a fraudulently lacking report produced by the Industry Commission at the end of the ecologically sustainable development process. The problem with the report is that it looked largely at the effects on one industryâ€”the coal industry. In looking at potential, the Industry Commission did not look at the potential for a no regrets policy, which was mentioned by Senator Chamarette. A no regrets policy does not harm the economy and it is of benefit in terms of reducing greenhouse gas production.

         The Industry Commission did not look at any of the options for a no regrets policy. It did not look at information which was available from Japan. It did not look at the information that was clearly available from the OECD that industry was made to improve its act on greenhouse gas productions. It fought, kicked and stamped the whole way saying, `This will be the end of life as we know it. We will be dreadfully disadvantaged because of this; it is a dreadful thing to do to industry'. In fact the outcome was beneficial to industry because it was forced to find a more economical way to produce goods and services, and industry found that it saved money.

         The turnaround for many energy reduction processes is, on average, about three years, which is a much better turnaround than any other such investments in industry. So least cost planning is both economically and environmentally sound. Yet there is a very skewed idea of economic rationalism that if we affect any particular industry, like the coal industry, it is bad for the economy as a whole. That is a fraudulent argument.

          Not only is Western Australia not doing anything about the greenhouse problem, but the problem in Western Australia, as with many other parts of Australia, is actually getting worse. The reason is the NIML principleâ€”the not in my lifetime principle; not the not in my backyard principle. People are suggesting that a small amount of change can be transferred to the next generation, and that the cost of that change can be transferred to the next generation. That is the worst kind of inequity that I can think ofâ€”that in the future people will have to severely change their lifestyles because we have not had the forethought to consider how lifestyles can be changed in the interim so that we do not have to have such drastic solutions in the future.

         We are supposed to be moving towards an ice age. The recognition that there is climate change and that we are moving towards global warming is an indication that something is going drastically wrong. Yes, there does need to be much more research but there is a point at which we realise that, whatever research we do, at some stage we have got to take action, and we have got to realise that the time is now. We cannot continue to pretend that it does not exist, that it is happening on another planet, or that we in Australia are somehow isolated from what is happening on the rest of the globe because we have so much more space, more air to put greenhouse gases in and that therefore it does not matter.

          The 42nd Report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Possible Adverse Treatment of a Witness before the Corporations and Securities Committee, was tabled in the Senate on 27 May 1993. Included in its findings and recommendations was the following:

          That the Senate resolve as follows:

          That the Senate is of the opinion that all heads of departments and other agencies, statutory office holders and Senior Executive Service officers should be required, as part of their duties, to undertake study of the principles governing the operation of Parliament, and the accountability of their departments, agencies and authorities to the Houses of Parliament and their committees, with particular reference to the rights and responsibilities of, and protection afforded to, witnesses before parliamentary committees. (paragraph 3.8)
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Senate adopted the recommendation on 21 October 1993 and this response gives details of action taken to implement the recommendation.

         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
          Following passage of the Senate resolution, my predecessor, the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, wrote to all Ministers advising them of its passage. Similarly, the Clerk of the Senate wrote to the heads of all departments, and to the Public Service Commission, drawing attention to the terms of the resolution. I understand that the Chairperson of the Committee of Privileges advised all Ministers of the content of the report and also of the 36th Report of that Committee, which raised similar concerns.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
          The content of the reports was drawn to the attention of all Senior Executive Officers in an article written by the Secretary to the Committee and published in SES News of December 1993, in response to an invitation by the Public Service Commission. The Clerk of the Senate has since spoken at one of the SES management seminars which are conducted by the Public Service Commission. It may be hoped that his participation will be a regular feature of subsequent programs.

          The earliest response to the recommendations of the report came from the Australian Securities Commission, which, soon after the tabling of the report, arranged for Senators and senior Senate staff to conduct seminars for the Commission's senior officers. So far, these full-day seminars have been conducted in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, and the senior officers who attended included a Commissioner of the ASC, and Regional Commissioners from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. A further seminar is scheduled for Perth at the end of April.

         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
          Brisbane was also the venue for a seminar conducted for regional heads of Commonwealth departments and authorities, organised on the initiative of the Queensland Regional Commissioner of the Australian Securities Commission, who is also the convenor of that group.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
          Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds, Chairperson of the Committee of Privileges, participated in both Brisbane seminars. Senator John Coates, another member of the Committee and Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, addressed another regional seminar, in Bowral, New South Wales, for regional heads of departments and agencies and for heads of agencies based in Sydney. Senator Bruce Childs, the longest standing member of the Privileges Committee, spoke at the first ASC seminar, held in Sydney, while Senator Rod Kemp addressed ASC officers in Melbourne.

         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
          The Procedure Office has received several approaches from departments in Canberra, and has conducted two seminars for all SES officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. A further seminar is to be conducted in April, covering SES representatives of several departments. It would be helpful if central agencies such as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Commission were to become more actively involved in implementing the Senate resolution. The Department of the Senate would, of course, be happy to cooperate and in the meantime intends to continue its programs to meet individual departmental demands.

         Mr President, I wish to underline the importance of your response and the very good work that has flowed since the adoption, here in the Senate, of the report of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. Mr President, I know that your two-page response has been incorporated in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         record and will be read by a wide number of interested persons, not the least of whom will be senior officers of the Public Service in all departments not only here in Canberra but in the states, in all the regions where Commonwealth officers serve. It would pay not only Commonwealth public servants but, indeed, state public servantsâ€”all decision makers who have any dealings with the Commonwealth parliamentâ€”to study the recommendations of the Standing Committee of Privileges, particularly the 42nd and, indeed, the 36th reports of the committee. There is a report currently before the chamber on the Australian Customs Service which I believe also will repay similar study.

          What is the upshot of this whole matter? It is this: citizens of Australia have rights, including the right to make a submission to the parliament without any personal detriment to themselves as a result of making such a submission. They can appear before a Senate committee in a public hearing and they can write a letter to the parliament. We must safeguard the right of every Australian citizen
         </tab>

         to so act. We must ensure that, if there is any infringement upon citizens because they have taken up such a right, there is redress for that and there is no detriment, no punishment and no loss or suffering as a result.

          I use the 42nd report of the committee as an example. This has been addressed by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. Mr Acting Deputy President Childs, you are the longest serving member of the committee and are very aware of the principles about which I will now speak. Senator Reynolds, who is the current chairman of that committee, is in the chamber. I happen to be the deputy chairman. We also have in the chamber, sitting in the Clerk's chair, the Deputy Clerk, who is the secretary of the committee.

          My colleague Senator Ellison, who will speak following my remarks, is a new and rising star, if I might put it that way, on the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. Every single member of the committee goes about his or her work in a bona fide way and I am proud of each of them. The last time I was able to say that was on the occasion of the retirement of the then chairman, Senator Patricia Giles, and Senator Durack. Both of those former senators are from Western Australia.

          I do not wish to divert from the issue. I wish to highlight that we had a serious matter of law reform before the Australian parliament. The Australian Securities Commission made a very deliberate submission and its representatives appeared before the committee asked by the parliament to inquire into that law reform.

          One of the middle rankingâ€”some would say juniorâ€”lawyers serving in the Australian Securities Commission quite conscientiously, as a citizen, had a contrary view. That lawyer put forward a view which was quite contrary to that of his employer. As a result of that, in partâ€”there were other complicating factors, and these were all addressed in our reportâ€”this person was dismissed from his employment. One of the reasons for the dismissal cited by the head of the ASC's Victorian office was that the lawyer had made a submission to the parliamentary inquiry which was directly contrary to the view of his employer.

          As soon as it was drawn to the attention of that person, and indeed to the attention of the Australian Securities Commission, the commission immediately saw the seriousness of its mistake; that it had actedâ€”some would say it had acted inadvertently or out of ignorance, but certainly without taking responsible actionâ€”to punish that person for exercising his ordinary civil rights as an Australian citizen. That whole matter has now been settled. A finding of contempt for that action was found by the committee and by the Senate, and that matter has been very seriously understood within the Australian Securities Commission.

          What is so cheering to me as a senator in the way the President has responded with these two pages of summary of the action that has flowed since October when the Senate adopted that report is a wide-ranging set of activities alerting virtually the Commonwealth Public Service to the law of the land and to the rights of Australian citizens and, in particular, public servants, as individuals, to make submissions to parliament; and for them to be able to exercise that right without any detriment or punishment. This has been highlighted by the President of the Senate in the way he has summarised the circulation of the Senate's resolution on this matter by his predecessor, the Hon.

We have also very happily seen such seminars inviting appropriate and well-informed senators to address conferences and seminars of public servants. Senator Reynolds has done so; Senator Coates, another long serving member of the committee has done so; and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have done so. Senator Kemp responded to an invitation to speak directly to the Australian Securities Commission officers in Melbourne, which is where the original problem arose.

He has said that there has been a positive response to make sure that the law of the land is understood throughout the Commonwealth Public Service.

          Let us look back to the formation of the federation. Australia borrowed several constitutional systems to form its government arrangements, the centrepiece of which was a bicameral legislature for our parliamentary system. The principles shaping it are representative democracy and responsible government. Essential to it is the parliamentary committee system. If we are to be representative of the people of Australia, and if we are to be responsible government, then contained in our actions must be open government and accountability. In any democracy the people must be informed and must make an informed choice when, periodically, they choose who will govern them. Through our parliamentary committees the people of Australia have such representation and power exercised on their behalf.

          Recently, we have seen the power of the Senate and its committees questioned, and this has been canvassed at great length in the press. In most parliamentary committees the witnesses are public servants orâ€”at the leastâ€”ministers, who in turn are advised by public servants. Without going into detail, I note that in the case of the 42nd report of the privileges committee the Senate endorsed a finding of contempt by that committee relating to two senior public servants who had charged a junior officer of the same organisation with misconduct because he had given evidence to a parliamentary committee. That is at the very root of the matter.

          The government has recognised the possible problem in relation to this matter and has issued guidelines for official witnesses appearing before parliamentary committees and related matters. Unfortunately, that does not seem to have filtered through the Public Service. I believe that the measures mentioned in the President's report are therefore essential in briefing members of the Public Service in relation to their role when appearing before Senate committees.

          The Deputy Clerk of the Senate, Anne Lynch, touched on this problem in her article entitled `Straw men and bogeymen: Public Service accountability to parliamentary committees'. I was interested to note that the Department of the Senate has been conducting a number of seminars for middle level public servants. Page 1 of the article states:

         At virtually every seminar at which the role of parliamentary committees is discussed terrified participants ask the question: "What if I answer a question in the way my senior officers or my ministers do not like?" The next question is invariably: "What happens if I am browbeaten by Senators seeking information?" Obviously, their perception is that they are between the devil and the deep blue sea, with no protection either from a predatory committee or from a vengeful minister or senior officer.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         In fact, the obligation of public servants is two-fold: to provide information and advice to ministers, with accountability for the implementation of policy; and to perform precisely the same function in respect of the parliament. The only constraints on this function are those imposed by the parliament itself, whether through legislation, for example, secrecy provisions specifically binding the parliament, or through self-denying ordinances such as the Senate privilege resolutions, which bind committees in what they may require of public servants, and the government guidelines for official witnesses before parliamentary committees.

          When one looks at the article and recent events, one can see that there has been a great deal of vindication of the action that has been taken as outlined in the President's report. The 46th report of the Committee of Privileges deals with false or misleading information given to Estimates Committee E, popularly known as the diesel fuel rebate reference. At page 12 of that report the committee stated:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The responsibilities of public servants directly answering questions by members of Senate committees are clear: officers are required to answer fully and honestly all questions which are asked of them, to ensure that Senators are not misled by the provision of incomplete information . . . This duty is limited by the constraints imposed on committees by Senate Privilege Resolution 1(16), which provides that:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         An officer of a department of the Commonwealth or of a State shall not be asked to give opinions on matters of policy, and shall be given reasonable opportunity to refer questions asked of the officer to superior officers or to a Minister.
        </para>
        <para>
         Quite clearly, one can draw a parallel between that situation and the one which is outlined in the 42nd report of the Committee of Privileges. At page 13 of its report the Committee of Privileges said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee endorses the Minister's action in rebuking the officers and places on record its own serious concern at their conduct, in placing both the Minister and the Estimates Committee in the position of giving and receiving information which would shortly be known to be false.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That is a most serious situation, because parliamentary committees should not act upon information which is either incomplete or false. To that extent, I submit to the Senate that members of the Public Service have a most important duty and a most important role when either appearing before such committees or assisting their ministers who appear before such committees.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We have only to look at the process of the estimates committees to see just how important that information is, because it is, after all, what the Senate committees and the public rely on. When Senate committee members convene to hear evidence, they hear it on behalf of the people of Australia, who elected them. They are unable to make informed decisions or draw valid inferences if they are labouring under evidence which is incorrect or incomplete. Therefore, the system of government that I mentioned will quickly fracture and decay if the role of parliamentary committees is not upheld and, in particular, if the duties of public officials before them are not outlined.

         I think this is the first report of the Auditor-General since the government announced that it was going to at least consider the Auditor-General being made directly responsible to the parliament in response to an arrangement made with the Australian Democrats. We would be much happier if that arrangement to have the Auditor-General responsible to the parliament rather than to the government was not simply under consideration. We would have hoped there was total commitment to that because, unfortunately, the Auditor-General has been subjected to non-stop attack by this government, not least as a result of the ALP's role as its landlord. The Auditor-General is, quite frankly, being ripped-off in an incredible way by the landlord that it did not know it hadâ€”a sort of Clayton's landlord; the landlord you have when you do not know you have oneâ€”because there was a front put in so that Auditor-General's was not aware of who its landlord really was. I hope that matter will be resolved fairly soon.

          There has been a policy of consistent attack on the Auditor-General, a freezing of his funds, and as a consequence the Auditor-General believes he is unable to do the job which he believes should be done by the Australian National Audit Office. We have seen examples of that kind of campaign spreading a little wider. I noticed a press article just a few weeks ago suggesting that the private sector auditors ought to come in and do the audits of governmental instrumentalities. The point being madeâ€”curiously enough, I might sayâ€”is that the Auditor-General cannot claim the credit for latching onto the sports rorts because all he did was see what I had been doing in Senate estimates committees and as a result he looked into them. It is exactly the opposite.

          The fact that the Auditor-General is there gives an added dimension and depth to the benefits that emerge from Senate estimates committees. The government might trample all over us and take no notice of anything we point out, but the Auditor-General is there to ensure that the important matters brought up by opposition senators in Senate estimates committees are properly examined if they merit that kind of examination. I am very grateful for the Auditor-General's devotion to duty in the face of consistent attacks from this government for the fearless way he has done what is no more than his duty.

          It would seem to me an extraordinary situation for anyone to suggest that private sector auditors should be brought in to do the Auditor-General's job with government instrumentalities if we recognise one of the problems that emerges in private sector auditingâ€”and I am not being critical of any individual auditors. That problem is that while auditors in the private sector are directly responsible to the shareholders, it is the directors who recommend their appointment. I am not aware of any situation in which members of a company at an annual general meeting have overridden that recommendation.

          But if one had this situation in the government the problem would be that an auditor doing a major audit, like a government instrumentality, may be under a great deal of pressure to in fact maintain that job. In other words, if there are pressures brought on him by a government instrumentality that might involve the auditor being pressured to see things in the way of the instrumentality rather than in the way the auditor would rather see them, then obviously the threat of the loss of that audit job would be a major problem for the auditor.

          This kind of conflict does not emerge in the private sector because it would be disastrous for a major company if a major auditor was `sacked' because he would not bend to the will of the directors, and no doubt the marketplace would deal with that company appropriately. There is no marketplace for this penalty, or punishment if you likeâ€”this oversightâ€”to be available in the public sector, apart from the parliament itself. It would be quite improper for an auditing group that had a vested interest in maintaining that audit to be put in the terrible position by government of being pressured to do what the government wants. We have seen the way the Auditor-General has resisted that sort of pressure from this government.

          â€”Yes, I was, in fact, making those comments by way of a preliminary discussion, because, as I pointed out at the beginning of my remarks, this is the first report since the government gave the undertaking that it would at least examine the serious need to have the Auditor-General directly responsible to the parliament rather than to the government itself. There is no doubt, as Senator O'Chee says, however, that this is only a preliminary study of the role and administration of this program because the Auditor-General did not proceed to a full efficiency audit. One of the reasons for his not proceeding with that, of course, is that the mandate of the audit office does not enable it to audit the operations of state government bodies, except in very restrictive circumstances. Nonetheless, the restraints put upon the audit office by lack of funding are a key factor in limiting the many activities the Auditor-General would like to pursue, as the Auditor-General himself has said many times.

          The National Industry Extension Service, which is the subject of this audit reportâ€”a project auditâ€”is a joint Commonwealth-state and territories program which aims to assist firms to become more internationally competitive. The major responsibilities of the Commonwealth are to coordinate and monitor the systemâ€”and, I might say, to put in a fair amount of money as well. These functions are carried out by the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Commonwealth expenditure on the program in 1992-93 was $16 million. While the Commonwealth puts up a lot of the money, the states have primary responsibility for the delivery of the program to clients. The report of the audit office states:

         It is very pleasant to see the Auditor-General being able to report that a body has conducted itself in an essentially sound manner. Despite what may be the impression from a lot of publicity, the great bulk of governmental bodies are conducted in an essentially sound manner. But the Auditor-General, ever alert, has found many instances where there have been major problemsâ€”such as the sports rorts affairâ€”that have to be brought to the attention of the parliament and given the backing of the objectivity of the Auditor-General.

          Nonetheless, even though the program basically gets a clean bill of health, the audit office considers in this case that the extent to which the program is effective in achieving its primary objective of making firms internationally competitive needs to be more clearly established. There is no doubt that there is a bipartisan approach within this parliament about the need for Australia to be more internationally competitive and for firms to be assisted, where appropriate, in achieving that kind of objective. The Auditor-General states:

        </para>

         In particular, it is considered that a greater priority should be given to tracking the progress of firms that have participated in the program.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is just like the sports rorts affairs. We discovered in a Senate estimates committee the other day that there had been no really effective study of the effectiveness of that program. Once again, we see that there is a need to track the progress of firms that have participated in the program. We were told at the Senate estimates committee which dealt with sport rorts that successful applicants had not been tracked to see what had happened; in fact, it had not even been established whether the applications that were successful were better than the applications that were not successful.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I think the Auditor-General is quite right adopting the same sort of approach here. The report says:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The appropriateness of using subsidised consultancies as the means of assisting the majority of clients should also be reviewed.
        </para>
        <para>
         I will deal with that in a minute. The report continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It was found that the NIES Branch of DITARD had not gained assurance that all of the States applied procedures in administering subsidies that minimise the risk of fraud and protect the integrity of their respective subsidy approval and payment systems. A review of their procedures has been recommended.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a proper recommendation. One of the problems is that taxpayers' money from the federal stream is disbursed by the states. So, obviously, there has to be proper supervision to ensure that the risk of fraud does not become too great. Going into a little detail, the Auditor-General's report says:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The States have primary responsibility for the delivery of NIES services to firms. However, the Commonwealth provides some funding to each State and  . . . some direction on how the funds are used. The practice of using the major proportion of NIES funds to subsidise consultancies as a means of delivering extension services appears to have evolved, rather than to have been specifically and formally decided at the national level. It is acknowledged that NIES provides some services such as networking and quality assurance which assist firms other than through individual subsidised consultancies, but these remain in the minority.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Rigorous consideration of the effectiveness or otherwise of the program should entail review of the appropriateness of current delivery methods and the feasibility of any alternatives that may have wide application. It would be appropriate for the department to encourage a regular review. In particular, it should promote examination of whether subsidised consultancies for the majority of clients is cost effective and the most appropriate means of meeting the objectives of the program.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It may also be appropriate to examine the relative merits and cost effectiveness of the various subsidy structures used by the states in the light of how effective existing practices are found to have been. Issues such as whether the level of subsidy should reduce as the firm engages in more NIES services could also be given further consideration.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General notes that the issue of what constitutes adequate evidence that firms have paid a consultant's fee in full before claiming payment of a subsidy should also be included for review. That seems to be a vital requirement and it is a matter of some concern that the Auditor-General is apparently not satisfied on that level. The audit office understands that there is no present indication that manipulation of payments is occurring but considers that investigating the practicality of a procedure which could provide better control would be prudent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Finallyâ€”this is a matter that is certainly close to my heartâ€”the Auditor-General looks into the matter of assistance to small firms. This program is not simply aimed at people with big export potential but aimed at small firms where I believe there is an incredible future for large export earnings to develop if given the right and enthusiastic support by government and others in this area. In the course of the preliminary study, the view was put to the audit office that subsidised consultancies may not be the best way that the program can assist small firms.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The concern was that some small firms may be encouraged to undertake relatively expensive consultancies which may produce a weighty report that addresses longer term issues beyond the firm's most pressing needs for survival in the short to medium term. It was felt that the executives of such firms might find a report and its recommendations overwhelming, put it aside and direct their attention back to shorter term needs. In other words, the whole point of the program could well be missed.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Auditor-General says it was suggested that some such firms would derive greater benefit if a form of mentoring was provided with expertise being made available on a periodic basis, such as monthly, to give practical assistance in overcoming problems and impediments to international competitiveness. The audit office understands that NIES does provide assistance through methods other than individual subsidised consultancies and that small firms are encouraged to participate in activities such as networking and group quality assurance programs. The department advised, however, that it was sensitive to the needs of smaller firms, pointing out that several NIES products had been modified for

        </para>
        <para>
         easier, less costly use by smaller clients and that a number of self-help manuals for small enterprises had been developed. Commonwealth NIES also advised that, following the recent restructure of the department, it was now part of the broader business improvement programs branch, which seeks to address development of firms of all sizes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I say in conclusion that I hope small businesses that are keen on developing export markets will in fact be looking into this program. There is a fair amount of Commonwealth money in it. Maybe it is not enough in some people's view, but there was something like $16 million in 1992-93. I commend the Auditor-General for his report on this matter.

        (2) No level for atrazine has been formally set.

These are draft guidelines, which still require endorsement from the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand before further consideration by the NHMRC.
