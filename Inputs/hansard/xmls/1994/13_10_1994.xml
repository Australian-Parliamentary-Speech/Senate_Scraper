        Certain clauses, particularly subclause 5.1, appear to be subdelegations of legislative power and, as such, invalid unless expressly authorised by the parent Act.

Also, subclause 5.1 does not provide for the way in which the Minister is to exercise the power to increase the Deployment Allowance. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on the possible legislative nature of the powers.

        I refer to your letter of 30 May 1994 concerning the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1994 No 126, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 2 June 1994.

        The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Regulations were made to facilitate implementation by Australia of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When that Convention enters into force for Australia (not likely to be prior to 1 November 1994), oil companies operating in Australia will be required to complete, on an annual basis, a return that includes details of oil received by ship. The information provided must be certified by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) on behalf of the Australian Government in order to fulfil the obligations under Article 15 of the Convention to provide relevant data to the Fund established under the Convention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The information provided by the oil companies and certified by AMSA will determine the contribution due from each company to The Fund. Regulation 24 is designed to enable AMSA to confirm that the information provided by an oil company is correct.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In practice, it is expected that the provision would need to be enforced rarely as the Australian industry has indicated full support of the Convention and the procedures necessary to ensure compliance.

        In his response, the Minister for Transport, the Honourable Laurie Brereton MP, undertook to have his Department seek the advice of the Attorney-General's Department and to respond to the Committee when that advice had been received.

        You will note that the Attorney-General's Department is of the view that regulation 24 of the Regulations does not involve self-incrimination but merely requires a return for administrative purposes, no different to that required under many other legislative schemes. The imposition of the penalty for not complying with a request to provide a return is not connected to the liability to contribute to the Fund. It relates solely to the failure to provide information required for proper administration.

The Senate will be aware that the Australian Soccer Federation has appointed Mr Justice Stewart to do an inquiry into that matter. Initially, the Senate was informed that the inquiry would conclude by this week.

         However, we have now been informed that Mr Justice Stewart has this week brought down an interim report and has delayed his formal report until a reporting date of 1 December. I am satisfied that the Australian Soccer Federation is acting in very good faith in relation to this inquiry. The Senate does not want to create an inquiry that will cut across Mr Justice Stewart's inquiry. On that basis, we will be holding off any potential Senate inquiry until the full findings of Mr Justice Stewart's inquiry are made public and we see how the Soccer Federation goes about implementing any recommendations. So that is the reason for the delay until 5 December.

          —The inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the implications of Australian defence exports commenced on 9 September 1993. At that time the then Minister for Trade, Senator Peter Cook, referred the matter to the committee and outlined certain terms of reference for the committee's deliberations, including the definition as to what goods and services might constitute defence exports—traditionally, this has been something of a grey area; the guidelines, constraints and conditions governing Australian defence exports; the actual role of existing programs in facilitating defence exports; and to also look in a comprehensive way at the strategic, political, economic, international and human rights implications of defence exports and Australia's role in the construction of an effective international regime of monitoring and reporting on defence exports.

          This was a series of issues, therefore, that had very serious moral, political, economic, industrial and strategic dimensions and considerations grouped around the terms of reference. There is no question that it was a legitimate area of inquiry, and legitimate concerns were expressed to the committee as to the appropriate Australian industrial posture and profile, as to our role internationally and as to the guidelines which might govern the defence export industry.

          The report that has been drafted by the trade subcommittee—it was submitted to the House of Representatives a day or so ago and is before the Senate this morning—is, in my view, a balanced, thoughtful and deliberate report in terms of its review. It deals with very sensitive areas. I think every member of the committee is aware of the significance of human rights concerns. Certainly, the potential for linkage of defence exports with human rights issues and the potential for human rights abuses is clear and was one of the issues that was weighed up by the trade subcommittee in its evaluation. The legitimate demands of self-defence, of the right to protect sovereignty and of rights to guarantee security and independence were also weighed up by the trade subcommittee and by the joint committee as a whole.

It was an outstanding effort over time.

          There is no question that the end of the Cold War brought with it a great range of opportunities for humanity. Not all of those opportunities have so far assumed a definite form. Some remain only potential. The strategic environment has unquestionably changed in some respects, as in relations in Europe there is now greater predictability and greater certainty. But in other parts of the world there is greater volatility, less certainty and, as the report makes clear, greater fluidity.

          As well as that, the collapse of the Soviet empire, for example, and related matters mean there is a vastly increased potential for cheap and easy supplies of arms that are now surplus to the Cold War period and the Cold War doctrines. We confront—in Africa especially, but not confined to that continent—circumstances where states simply implode, where the rule of order, as distinct from the rule of law, simply evaporates. We have seen the tragic consequences of those implosions in situations of recent times, such as Somalia and Rwanda. In both of those circumstances Australia has sought to play a very purposeful role.

          We have also seen in different parts of the globe much more brutal conflicts than we have witnessed for a long time. Not since Vietnam have we seen conflicts of the savagery of Bosnia, or the impact of unrestricted arms trafficking upon circumstances whereby civilian populations suffer very greatly. Also, as everyone is aware, there is a greater potential, an increased potential, as a consequence of the end of the Cold War, in certain circumstances, for massive destruction to loom. I refer to the potentially disastrous adversarial situations that have loomed in recent times in the gulf and on the Korean peninsula. In these situations, with more arms being available and greater volatility, the committee looked very carefully at an appropriate Australian role. The deliberations of the committee very much reflected Australian opinion in the broad. A diversity of opinion was present not only on the committee but also in terms of the submissions received and the arguments advanced and considered.

          International relations now are characterised in our region to an extent and globally by a degree of turbulence and disorder. That requires greater sensitivity in terms of what we do by way of defence exports—there is no question about that—in terms of the changing security environment and the changing demands upon us for a greater degree of accountability and a greater degree of control. Just to put matters into brief perspective, Australia, of course, is a relatively small defence exporter. The total value of Australian exports of defence and related goods, for example, in 1992-93 approached $37 million. Even allowing for some distortion or some lack of clarity because of the deficiencies in defence export data, it represents a minor part of total Australian exports, as the Senate would be aware. As a matter of fact, defence exports represent something less than one per cent of Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactures which, in turn, represents about 14 per cent of Australia's exports of goods as a whole.

          By contrast, the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, actually imported about $1.5 billion of defence equipment in 1992-93. I think those figures are interesting in terms of putting matters in balance. There is no question, though, that even given the relatively small size of defence exports, these issues need to be placed under close scrutiny, given the potential impact. The committee in its report endeavoured to outline issues such as the operations of the guidelines for export, including industry concerns regarding the processing time for export approvals, the role of customs in verification procedures, the defence export program, the implications of defence exports and, of course, Australia's international role.

          In terms of the definitions, the committee was of the view that there needs to be greater clarity regarding what we mean by defence exports by the defence industry. In terms of that approach, there is no doubt that the committee's recommendations are entirely appropriate and will lead to a better regime overall. The committee was of the belief that there was a pressing need to develop a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports. The deficiencies in the current definition are most clearly seen when it is endeavoured to apply the definition to estimate the value of defence exports. This is where conflict arises; this is where differing figures emerge.

          As well as that, there are clear deficiencies in the collection of data. More needs to be done in this regard.

          If we look at the application of the report overall, in an area where there had been little work done by the parliament it has proved to be a valuable document by way of stimulating public discussion and comment and will prove to be valuable in view of the recommendations being adopted. The committee was concerned at the number of difficulties that had been experienced. It was made clear that in a limited number of cases there had been some embarrassing failures. But the committee noted also that significant improvements had been made to the guidelines for approval of defence exports so that such issues as global and regional stability and potential economic, industrial, employment and technological benefits would be taken into consideration; Australia's strategic international relations would be weighed in terms of the decisions made; and the country's commercial credibility would be taken into account when matters were being considered.

          Many submissions to the inquiry suggested that the decision making process needs to formally take account of foreign policy objectives, including human rights, as I have mentioned earlier. There is a clear recommendation in the report for a greater degree of cooperation, better communication and closer consultation between the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on these matters. I think that is one of the key findings of the report: that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to have a more formal role in the process, and there is a specific technical recommendation to facilitate that.

          Overall, the committee's report outlines that a defence exports effort within very clear and very firm guidelines is justified and that it can be achieved effectively without compromising foreign policy objectives and without compromising regional security. In fact, quite the contrary; it may be a very useful element in strengthening regional security and stability. However, some improvement to the approvals system is required to achieve this.

          In conclusion, could I again commend the trade subcommittee of the joint committee for its work in the area. It has broken some new ground and it has definitely stimulated a greater degree of awareness in the broad, and a better focus and a greater degree of certainty in terms of the discussion and debate. The series of recommendations made, 1 through 20, are realistic and appropriate, in my view, and are capable of ready implementation; will serve to improve the regime; and will bring greater clarity to the area and a greater degree of public confidence as to what Australia is able to achieve in what is a highly sensitive area of policy making.

          The committee received 36 high quality submissions, representing a broad range of interests, and we took evidence from 44 witnesses at hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. Among the recommendations made in the report, the committee highlights the need for matters of national and regional security to be of primary consideration when decisions regarding defence exports are taken. The minority report criticised the current policy of defence exports, saying that selling defence equipment in Asia fuels regional insecurity and promotes infringements on human rights.

          I disagree with that point of view. Australia has always taken, and with this report will continue to take, a well-informed and balanced approach to exporting defence related goods and services. This is an issue which requires balance, and I think the guidelines that are in place for determining whether an export licence is granted reflect that need for balance. The points that have to be taken into account before granting an export licence include the implications for global and regional stability; the potential economic, industrial, employment and technological benefits that the specific export may have for Australia; and the impact on our regional and strategic relations and for our commercial credibility if we deny a country access to our defence goods.

          A good example of this approach is the recent interest shown by Taiwan in buying up to six submarines from Australia—a deal which was worth about $3 billion. Despite the obvious economic benefits to Australia, it is unlikely the sale will go ahead as it would breach our current policies with China which ban all official ties with Taipei, including the sale of lethal weapons.

          This report reinforces the constant need to balance our export control with export facilitation.

          Looking realistically at the impact of Australia's exports on regional stability, it is clear that we are a very  small player, especially when one looks at the hardware that is now becoming available within the superpowers following the end of the Cold War and the scaling down of armaments. Therefore, it can be said that the impact of Australia's involvement on a global scale is minimal. On the other hand, the benefits to Australia on a domestic level are great. The development of a specialised technology has far-reaching advantages for Australia's elaborately transformed manufactures, an industry which must be maintained and developed if we are to keep up with the technological advances of the rest of the world.

          Apart from the obvious financial and development benefits, this report has also emphasised other advantages for encouraging the continuation and expansion of the export of defence related goods. These include the enhancement of Australia's strategic interests through regional engagement and trade negotiations. Through market development and trade in defence exports with our close neighbours, we can build a trust—which is very important—and an understanding within the South-East Asian region. Furthermore, the continued development of our industries in this area promotes our own self-reliance—a goal which Australia would dearly like to achieve.

          This brings me to highlighting what I believe is one of the most important recommendations in the report, and that is the development of a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports. It is important to realise that computer hardware, clothing and mechanical components can all be used in a military capacity and are therefore seen as defence goods. But the use of these types of items can be seen to be of great value to our trading partners outside the defence area. Because our neighbours lack the technological and manufacturing advantage that Australia has developed, they must turn to us and that can only be a good thing for Australia.

          Exporting weapons and defence products will always require balance. If this balance is constantly maintained, Australia will continue to reap the economic and regional benefits of exporting our superior technology and goods. With the total value—I think Senator Loosley made mention of this earlier—of Australian exports of defence and related goods in 1992-93 at some $36.8 million, the benefits are very clear for us to see.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 covers a wide range of amendments to taxation legislation. It covers areas such as the reportable payments system; foreign investment funds and controlled foreign companies; regional headquarters income tax concessions; and social security payments. These, of course, will be dealt with in detail at the committee stage.

         I want to focus on the aspect of the legislation to which I alluded last night—the aspect which affects most workers. As a result of this legislation, the wages of many workers will, in fact, be cut by $28.40 a week. That will come as a great surprise to many workers who did not realise before the last election that the government's promise to provide $30 a week in home child-care allowance was conditional upon the money being taken away from the spouse; that is to say, the dependent spouse rebate would be abolished. That was not understood prior to the last election and, I believe, is still not readily understood by a lot of workers. So it will come as a surprise to them that their wages will, in effect, be cut by $28.40 a week.

         The government argues that a number of carers do not receive the benefit of the dependent spouse rebate, that it goes into the hip pocket of the worker who, in most instances, is the male, while the mother cares for the children. The government also advanced the argument that a number of people were not receiving the dependent spouse rebate because they did not receive sufficient taxable income. That was also an important question.

         However, I am concerned that this transfer from the hip pocket into the purse may well result in the same problems that arose from a similar transfer that occurred in 1976 in respect of the family allowance payments. At that time the taxation system handled tax rebates for dependent children. That was abolished and those rebates were cashed up into the family allowance system—in other words, it was a straight transfer from the hip pocket to the purse.

         Since that time, successive governments have purloined from the purses of mothers something like $12 billion, and this is what worries me about the exercise that is now before us. As I said last night, if the government were concerned about the need to have the money actually go into the hands of the carer, then it could have done so by simply requiring the spouse, whether it be male or female, who was actually working to provide a certificate which showed that the money would be transferred to the bank account of the carer. That would have been a simple way of doing that. The other area in respect of those who are not receiving a sufficient income to benefit from the dependent spouse rebate could have been covered by the social security system.

         As a result of what is being done, people will be quite disillusioned. I will give honourable senators an example. Applicants must fill in all sorts of forms—and there are pages of them—before they are eligible to get the home child-care allowance. It will be a bureaucratic headache for a large number of people, and it will be of great concern to ordinary people. Just compare this with the child-care cash rebate for people who may be in the work force. All they have to do is fill out a very simple form, go along to the Medicare office and get the cash—virtually no questions asked. It is a very simple matter. On the other hand, look at what the mother in the home has to go through. She has to fill out all these forms—and for what? For a mere $2.60 a week. Yet the child-care cash rebate is substantially more than $2.60 a week. In fact, it recognises that a carer is looking after at least two children.

         I think mothers in the home deserve a great deal better than what this government is dealing out to them. I raised a whole range of matters, both in parliament and outside, when the home child-care legislation was discussed in December and February, and I pointed out various inequities and anomalies. For example, if the child-care cash rebate is non-income tested as a cost of earning income, why is not the same true where one spouse is working and the other is looking after children so the first spouse can engage in paid employment? That question has to be answered by the government at some stage.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another anomaly is switching from the tax concept of annual separate net income to the social security concept. This means that many spouses who would have been eligible for the spouse rebate will get reduced home child-care allowance because expenses allowed in the tax system are not allowed under social security, and the social security concept of income embraces windfalls and gifts not regarded as income under the tax law. So that is another anomaly that has resulted.

         Also, there are a number of people who will miss out as a result of this action by the government. Families leaving Australia temporarily—such as diplomats, service families and missionaries—will be disadvantaged because they will have to pay full Australian tax. They will lose the spouse rebate, but they will not get the home child-care allowance because they are out of Australia for more than three months. I know the government has considered this question, but it is a matter it has overlooked. It has overlooked quite a number of matters. Families with dependent children over 16 will lose the spouse rebate at the with-child rate, but will not get the home child-care allowance. Again, that is a matter that the government has given some consideration to. When I raised those matters previously, the government thought that its scheme was perfect, but it is not perfect. In fact, since I raised those matters, others have re-emphasised the problems in shifting from the tax concept of a spouse rebate to a social security payment.

A number of people were interested in this bill and raised a range of issues. But before I do that, it is important for me to emphasise that, as is usually the case with broad taxation laws amendment bills, the overwhelming majority of provisions in this bill appear to have and, as I understand it, do have the unanimous support of the Senate. Overall, the changes are positive ones for taxpayers and for the taxation system as a whole and that is something to be welcomed as part of the continuing progress of reform of the tax system.

         Essentially, four issues were raised in the discussion. Three related to amendments to the home child-care allowance, the provisional tax uplift, and the sales tax changes, particularly one aspect of them. The fourth issue relates to the points raised by a couple of speakers concerning the legislative framework for the reportable payments system, for which there are no amendments but about which people raised issues in the course of the debate on the second reading.

         Debate on provisional tax uplift and the special matter of the amendment relating to the sales tax changes should be left until the committee stage.

As for sales tax, it is also a matter of the detail of the provision rather than a matter of broad principle.

         The reportable payments system—or, if honourable senators will excuse the shortening of it, the RPS—is not a tax collection system and it is not a new tax. It is a monitoring mechanism for compliance with the existing tax system. It is an income reporting arrangement to allow the tax office to compare taxpayers' income as they report it with information contained in the income tax return of the income recipient.

         There is no discretion in respect of senators, most of the people in the gallery and those who are listening to the debate or who will read the transcript. We make regular PAYE deductions—fortnightly, or monthly, as the case may be. But for many other people, whose payments are made in other ways, the capacity to establish whether what is being declared as income is an accurate description of the income is not as straightforward.

         RPS is another part of the mechanism for ensuring that the tax burden is being fairly distributed.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is based on the tax file number arrangements that already apply in the employment and investment areas. Under RPS—the reportable payments system—people receiving a reportable payment need only provide their tax file number to the person making the payment in order to prevent deduction of tax at source. In other words, as with other sources of income, if people provide their tax file number, no tax will be deducted other than in PAYE circumstances. But in these circumstances, that will not be the case.

         However, if one chooses not to provide one's tax file number, tax will be deducted. This is logical: otherwise, firstly, there is no way in which compliance could be established; and, secondly, there is no way in which those people who are evading tax could be caught by this system. This is essentially a matter about enhancing tax compliance to ensure that the amount of income tax which is properly payable is paid.

That is the rationale. It is not a new tax.

We have made sure that the industries involved have been informed of the privacy requirements; all the relevant brochures and pamphlets produced will emphasise or contain information about privacy issues; and every endeavour will be made to inform those affected by the system of the obligations imposed on payers who have access to tax file numbers.

         The core of the matter is that this is, and is seen by Australians to be, an improvement in the method of, and an increase in, the amount of government payments to families. It is a proper recognition by the government of its obligation to provide assistance to Australian families and to do so in a fair way. In this instance that includes directing the payment to the carer rather than to the income earner, as is necessarily done through the tax system, and increasing by some $230 million per annum the amount of the payment.

         It is an important reform, one that is being welcomed by Australians. It is an important addition to the range of assistance provided to families. It has the major advantage of being paid directly to the parent with the caring responsibility. It is, in the broad scheme of things, inevitable in the debate in the Senate that people focus only on the losers. Let me give some comments about the winners from the introduction of this measure. When a measure increases the cost by $230 million, it means there is $230 million extra being paid to Australian families as a result of this payment. The families which benefited from the with-child rate of DSR will be better off, because it is paid at a higher rate. That is the first thing. It is not a big increase but it is a welcome increase.

         There are some well targeted and important other things. I will mention just one. About 55,000 families with low taxable incomes who are unable to obtain the full value of the dependent spouse rebate will be, on average, $20 a week better off. That is not a bad start, over and above the increased payment and the improved targeting of the payment in general. There are around 120,000 families which will benefit from the greater responsiveness of the payment.

Also, the annual amount a dependent child can earn—and the family can still qualify—is more generous. In summary, there are benefits from these changes which are substantial and which greatly outweigh the relatively small impact that the change will have on a small number of families.

So we have this complaint that we misled people but my clear advice is that the Prime Minister never said there would be no loser. What he did say in the election speech, which I listened to—I suspect those opposite did not—is that this allowance is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replace. He never made any secret about the fact that it would replace the rebate. That is the extent of the claim. It is $230 million more than the dependent spouse rebate. All the advertising says—

         I understand that the claim which has been made that there will be up to 200,000 losers has been based on an estimate of the total number of people receiving the part-rate with-child DSR. It is nonsense to say that all those people will be losers. The majority of them will be winners also. Most part-raters will benefit from the increase in the maximum rate, which will flow up the line to them. Some of them will gain much more because their taxable income was too low to get the maximum DSR. Some will gain because they receive a part-rate DSR due to having a part-time job for a few weeks of the year. A number of other groups will be in the same or a slightly better position. Those getting part-rate because of bank interest and those with shares will have, as I understand it, no change.

         Latest available estimates from the Australian Taxation Office show that in 1992-93 about 680,000 families received the with-child rate of dependent spouse rebate. The home child-care allowance data available to date shows that as many families who in 1992-93 got the maximum rate with-child DSR are already receiving the maximum rate of home child-care allowance after only 10 days of operation. A much higher proportion of these grants are being made at the maximum rate than was the case with the dependent spouse rebate in the year 1992-93. Those are important facts to put on the table.

         The national Fishing Industry Council has argued that the provisions of the bill implementing the reportable payments system will increase compliance costs for the industry by imposing further unnecessary and unproductive paperwork and administration, particularly for those who are already complying with the tax laws. In addition, the Fishing Industry Council argues that the bill's RPS provisions do not address the real issues facing the industry, in particular fish poaching and tax evasion through direct selling.

I do not know whether the minister has had a chance to look at that matter. I am sure the council and certainly the opposition would welcome any comments he might have on that. It does seem to be a serious point as far as the fishing industry is concerned. I do not know whether it has any wider application but the fishing industry is an important industry in its own right.

Broadly, it is something we will have to monitor. Conceptually, I think the system is right. It seems on the face of it to be the logical place to start, because there are a small number of payers paying to a large number of people in an area where there is not a PAYE system operating.

         The problem which arises here is that when fishermen sell fish to a wholesaler, they have to then give the tax file number.

         Let me qualify it now so that when it comes back there is not some sense that, in giving that assurance, I have given something we could not deliver on. Firstly, as I am advised, the industry specification of sources of taxation revenue is probably less than perfect; so the base may not be ideal. Secondly, there are consequential changes. Once this system is introduced, it is possible that some of the people involved will move into the PAYE system and out of this system of payments, because the benefit of not being in the PAYE system will be reduced. The figures will not be unambiguous, and I make that clear right from the start.

         It is reasonable to request that we make some attempt to monitor industry by industry the consequences of this. I cannot give honourable senators a guarantee about how comprehensively we will be able to do that, because of the problems in the statistical base from which we are working. Some of the parallel changes that will go on that will not be identified as consequences of this change will show up in other parts of the statistics. I make those qualifications beforehand so that, when the report, such as it is, is developed subsequently, people do not accuse me of not having fully advised the Senate. I accept the broad thrust of the point the honourable senators have made and will seek to do that.

         —So the minister did not say that; I misheard it. Clearly, there is extra paperwork. I wish to refer to page 4 and the definition of reportable payment. Reportable payment means a payment that `is declared by the regulations to be a reportable payment for the purposes of this Division'. Does that not enable the government to extend to the whole of the economy by regulation a massive expansion of paperwork and bureaucracy which will be a disguised tax on employment and business?

         The second point, interestingly enough, is that reportable payment means a payment that is assessable income. It might well be that an employer does not know what is assessable income for the  purposes of the payee. The payer may not know in respect of moneys provided to the payee what may be assessable income. For example, if one sells one's car, does the payer know whether it is a personal or a business car? These are the sorts of things that may or may not have been considered by the officials. Certainly, it will cause a lot of confusion.

         Finally, the penalty is set out in proposed new section 22OAF(2) on page 6 of the bill. If these things are not done by the payer, the payer must deduct 48.4 per cent of the payment. The minister, although not seeking to belittle the position, seemed to say, `If the tax file number is not given and certain other requirements are not observed'—for example, the one that I am talking about now—`then the payer must deduct 48.4 per cent of the payment.'

         Certainly, this proposal is consistent with the way in which the prescribed payments system—which is the closest analogy—operates. It is not as though there is an incentive for the government to declare lots of these payments because, in areas where we are already getting revenue, it is expenditure for the government for nothing. Even if some senators are very suspicious of the assurances that I give, I can say that there is no incentive or benefit for the government to do that. I can assure honourable senators that we would proceed with that very cautiously. The development of these regulations is being done with very close consultation with the industries concerned. I put that on the record.

If a tax file number is supplied, 15 per cent or 20 per cent is withheld, and that is more comparable with the PAYE system. We are not proposing to do that here.

         Under the PPS, the normal PAYE system, bank interest or whatever source of income is involved, if a tax file number is not supplied, 48.4 per cent is deducted. There is a simple reason for that: if that were not the case, people in the highest tax bracket—who pay 48.4 per cent—would benefit from not providing a tax file number, compared with people on lower rates of tax who would not benefit. The system could not operate fairly at other than the top rate.

         In his contribution, Senator McMullan raised the matter of prescribed payments. That is exactly the problem that the fishing industry is trying to avoid. People in the fishing industry know the problems that prescribed payments present to those in the cottage building industry. Even builders with only two or three carpenters and who use subcontractors—painters, tilers, bricklayers and electricians—are spending up to two days a month filling in their forms.

         Not so long ago I held a meeting at my house attended by builders in the district. They pointed out to me that no new builders are starting up in the cottage building industry because, for every 30 days that they could work, there are probably two days of non-productive time taken up with paperwork. They pointed out that the average age of builders around the district was 58 or 59 and that no new people were coming through. Meanwhile, the ones staying on are getting rid of as many people as they can and using subcontractors.

The only way in which a household activity such as that would be caught up—it would not be under this clause, but under the prescribed payments system—is if the value of the work being done were above the minimum threshold, which is $15,000. Provided the work being done was less than $15,000, which all the sorts of examples Senator Harradine is talking about would be, there would be no requirement for a TFN relationship between the tradesperson or worker and the householder.

         It is a commendable first step in the recognition of the role of parents, mostly mothers, caring for children at home. But it began as a deception, a pea and thimble trick on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the election speech, and it has deteriorated into what can only be described as a bungle and a debacle. When the home child-care allowance was first before the parliament, I raised a concern at the number of people who are unlikely to benefit from this new allowance or who would receive a substantially lower benefit from it than they presently receive from the dependent spouse rebate. That was the first time that was ever brought to public attention.

         This government was not going to tell people, `Look, I am awfully sorry, it is more generous for some, but there are a lot of you who are going to miss out or who are going to get less money than you got under the dependent spouse rebate.' The government did not bother to tell them that. It is the different treatment of income under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social Security Act which causes thousands of Australian families to be worse off. According to evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, up to 800,000 people could be affected by the different definitions of `income'. Mr Peter McDonald, the National Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, in his evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 19 September put it this way:

        That, for me, is not the same as, `It is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate.' He went on to say:

        From what I have been able to glean out of the Australian Taxation Office statistical annual reports, there are in the order of at least 200,000 families who may be worse off.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to these families, as I outlined earlier in the debate, the bill as originally drafted would mean that a number of other families would have been worse off because of differences in the qualifying criteria. Families overseas for longer than 13 weeks will be adversely affected. That would include aid workers, missionaries, academics, exchange students—people who go away for a period longer than 13 weeks and who are paying tax here in Australia; people who are on Australian salaries when they are engaged overseas in those activities. They would not be eligible for the home child-care allowance and would no longer be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate at the rate payable for those who have children. They would be $372 a year worse off.

         Another group, families with children who are dependent full-time students, aged 18 to 25, whose income is less than $1,785 a year, will be worse off. I was told by a government senator—I cannot remember who it was—that, `There are not many students who earn less than $1,785. They all go out to work.' Let me tell that senator that there are a lot of country students who cannot earn $1,785 from part-time jobs. There might be young people in the cities who can get jobs at McDonald's, but out in the bush students are not able to get part-time work and earn that amount of money.

         There are families which will be adversely affected by the inequitable treatment of unrealised capital gains under the Department of Social Security definition of income. Contrary to the government's claims that the home child-care allowance would benefit all those on low incomes, couples where both partners are unemployed would be excluded from receiving HCCA because it is means tested on only the child carer's income. Because of the introduction of the partner allowance, which effectively splits the unemployment benefit between both members of an unemployed couple, the child carer's income will be too high to receive the home child-care allowance.

         Some people who receive very irregular incomes preferred the dependent spouse rebate because it made it much easier for them to reconcile their financial affairs at the end of the year. Mr McDonald, the National Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, described the administration with regard to these people and the HCCA as absolutely abominable. He said that many people in part-time employment, with wild fluctuations in income, could find themselves having to lodge up to 26 applications on an ongoing basis each year. That seems unbelievable.

They would be eligible only for an amount that is paid at a considerably lower rate. They will be $372 a year worse off.

         The government originally sought to obtain political capital by introducing changes that were designed to demonstrate its commitment to recognising the role of home child carers and to helping families with a parent—more likely than not, a mother—at home. The home child-care allowance was Mr Keating's key election policy commitment to women. As I said before, he pledged in that campaign launch that this allowance would be more generous than the dependent spouse rebate that it would replace.

Mr Keating hoodwinked the Australian public and, in particular, he hoodwinked Australian mothers who are at home caring for their children. They were the people who were tricked and hoodwinked in that election campaign. Thousands of families will be considerably worse off as a result of the move from the dependent spouse rebate to the home child-care allowance, even with this amendment.

         Having given the implied promise that no family would be worse off, that the home child-care allowance would be more generous than the dependent spouse rebate, the government should have made sure that people who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance were eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate at the higher level at which they presently receive it.

That is the purpose of my amendment. These families were not identified by the government, and they still will not be dealt with adequately unless the government is prepared to adopt the amendment that I will move.

         Without going through the full detail, let me say that the Democrats support the principle of HCCA. We support the principle of ensuring that the parent who is at home and largely responsible for looking after children is the one who should have that money in pocket and should know how much the amount is. As we have seen from the statistics, many women are not even aware that there is that rebate intended for them through the male spouse's income tax.

         It is wrong for the government to seek to paint into a corner those of us who have problems with the way HCCA is organised and running, suggesting that somehow we are not in favour of the system or the principle.

         The government now acknowledges with this amendment that many people are losing part of that payment. But the amendment goes only part way to the solution.

But these families will be about $241 a year worse off, which is basically a week's pay for low income earners. If the government has acknowledged in the first place that the principle is right, I cannot see why there is a problem.

         I refer again to the advertising. I do not have the original advertisement before me, but I have already gone through it in my contribution to the second reading debate. Nothing in that ad even talks about replacing the dependent spouse rebate, hence the number of complaints and calls to my office once people began applying and began to understand how the system really works. We have heard on talkback radio over the past few weeks the confusion about it, with people asking, `What has happened to the $60? We have lost $50-odd through the tax system.'

         I say to the government that, if the advertising had been more carefully thought out, some of the flak that we now have simply would not be occurring. If the advertising had gone that extra step and been honest enough to say, `We are replacing the dependent spouse rebate. You may be entitled to the home child-care allowance,' we would not have some of the problems with the lack of community understanding that we have today. So we will not support the government's amendment but we will support the opposition's amendment and we will move an amendment of our own.

         —I want to refer to what I said on 23 February 1994. I do that to indicate that I, too, will be opposing the government's amendment and supporting the opposition's amendment. I indicated then that if a family has a student child on Austudy, it receives the spouse rebate, under the current circumstances, of $1,425. As a result of the legislation that we are discussing today and the operation of the HCCA legislation, that family would stand to lose $237; that is the cut that it would experience. Does a child cost $237 less once he or she becomes a student? Do the parents of that child pay less in indirect taxes in respect of food and services purchased?

         At the moment, couples with student children up to the age of 25 get a spouse rebate of $1,425. With the combined legislation, they are denied the home child-care allowance once the last child is over 16 and leaves school, or turns 18. The government suggests that, if that is the case, they will get the without-child grant. Why? That is what we have to ask ourselves. It is miserly. It is a sort of anti-child mentality that is creeping in. I do not think the government is doing this deliberately. I think there are members of the government who understand that this really is a taxation question.

         When the minister, Senator McMullan, was summing up, I took a note of what he said. He said something like this: `This area must essentially not be able to be achieved through the taxation system.' That is, to try to get the money to the actual carer requires measures which cannot be achieved through the taxation system. That is a lot of nonsense. Of course it can be achieved through the taxation system except in respect of families whose income is not sufficient for that purpose, and that can be dealt with in the social security area.

         I have to cover a couple of issues, even though they have been touched on previously in this debate, from the government's perspective. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, did not mislead the people about the promise. He never said there would be no losers. I will quote from his election speech. I viewed the election speech; I am not sure whether the opposition did. When he announced HCCA the Prime Minister said, `This allowance is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replace.' We have delivered on this promise. Overall, HCCA is estimated to cost some $230 million more than the dependent spouse rebate, and that is not an insignificant amount of money in the context of a government program.

        As I stated during the second reading debate, and again when I spoke to the government's amendment No. 4 to clause 57, thousands of Australian families will be worse off as a result of this legislation. Families that qualify for the dependent spouse rebate will not be eligible for the home child-care allowance because of the stricter Department of Social Security criteria. In addition, there will be thousands of families who will qualify for HCCA but who, because of different income definitions, will not receive the full amount of HCCA.

         When the parliamentary secretary was speaking to the last amendment, he said there would be $230 million more and people would be better off. The promise that the Prime Minister made was that the home child-care allowance would be more generous than the dependent spouse rebate. He should have then qualified that and said it would be more generous for those who qualify for the home child-care allowance. When he said, `We are going to have $230 million to distribute to carers of children at home', the honest thing to do would have been to qualify it by saying `for those who are eligible for this $30 a week'—although it will not be $30 a week for all of them anyway. He should have said, `Some of you will be worse off, you won't be getting $30 a week, and some of you won't get anything at all.'

         Those families with dependent children who currently qualify for the with-child rate of the dependent spouse rebate and who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance would still have been worse off under the proposed government amendment which we have just voted against because they would have been able to claim the dependent spouse rebate only at the without-child rate. The intention of the amendment I have moved is to ensure that those families who currently receive the with-child dependent spouse rebate and are not eligible for the HCCA because of stricter eligibility tests will continue to receive the with-child dependent spouse rebate. In addition, the amendment removes from the calculation of separate net income both the child-care cash rebate and the home child-care allowance.

        We will be supporting the opposition's amendment. My amendment does two things. Firstly, it makes it clear that, if the spouse of a taxpayer qualifies for the maximum rate of home child-care allowance, the taxpayer is not entitled to claim all or part of a rebate in respect of that spouse under this section. In other words, people have to go into the HCCA system. Secondly, if there is a problem with the amount being claimed—in other words, if they are worse off—then that can be made up only at the end of the year.

         —The coalition supports the amendment moved by the Democrats. We will support it because it will further address the shoddy manner in which the government has approached this legislation from the outset and also ensure that what positive aspects there are are preserved. The insertion of proposed subsection (5F) would prevent taxpayers claiming partial spouse rebates where the spouse qualifies for the full rate of home child-care allowance. This amendment recognises that it is only where the full rate of HCCA is payable that reliance upon the dependent spouse rebate should be forgone. Of course, the number of people who will qualify for the full rate of HCCA will be far smaller than the number of those who do not. We can thank the government for that. This amendment would ensure that, unless the full rate of HCCA is payable, access to the dependent spouse rebate is preserved.

         The insertion of subclause (5G) to clause 57 would mean that partial spouse rebates would be payable at the end of a given year of income. Both amendments reflect the fact that retention of the dependent spouse rebate despite the introduction of the HCCA is justified as a safety net measure only. The dependent spouse rebate is not retained to allow taxpayers to withhold the benefits of a rebate from their spouses. Rather, it is necessary for the protection of families this government has forgotten in what has been a cheap and a deplorable bid for votes.

         The coalition and the Democrats say they do not want to run a dual system—a with-child DSR and the HCCA. They want to give people the option to fall back onto the DSR only if they do not qualify for any HCCA payment during the previous year. There is no practical way to design such a system. This is because the DSR is based on a financial year eligibility and the HCCA is based on eligibility in a fortnight. To pay DSR only after HCCA qualification for the year is tested would require clients to test their HCCA qualification 26 times a year, each fortnight. This would be nonsensical and surely cannot be supported by the coalition, the Democrats or the Greens. As well, it would be virtually impractical to determine HCCA qualification retrospectively, which is what the Democrats' amendments propose.

In allowing people to get either the without-child DSR or HCCA throughout the year, we ensure no-one receives nothing. At the end of the financial year they can apply for the without-child DSR and if they received less HCCA they could get the difference between the two. There are also a number of technical problems with the way the amendments are being drafted which we believe cause problems.

         —I cannot let that go unchallenged. Firstly, yes, I stand by what we said then, that it is a matter of balance. But the government, in moving these additional changes in legislation and now amendments again to those changes, has also acknowledged that the number of losers is substantially more than we believed in the first place. I acknowledge that some of the losers at that stage were going to be students, and they remain part of the losers under this. We cannot move amendments to tackle only one particular lot of losers. Surely it is fair enough, now that we have all acknowledged that there are large numbers of losers, that we move amendments—and these amendments, by the way, are those amendments which were issued on 11 October.

         We realised with our very first draft that there was a problem. We are assured by those who have drawn up these amendments for us that they achieve what we want to achieve. But I think that all of us in this chamber—the government included—have acknowledged that there are far more losers than we first thought. I stand by what I said earlier this year and said again today: we welcome a policy change that would ensure that the spouse who remains at home, primarily looking after children, gets that money in hand, rather than have it come through the pay packet of the spouse who earns the majority of the income.

         After the committee hearing only a few weeks ago, the government, the coalition, Senator Harradine and the Democrats had the opportunity to hear from a number of people that the government should have heard from and whose opinions it should have sought in the first place—people who have given us specific details and some numbers. From what they have said, there will be a wider range of people who will be losers than any of us in this place envisaged in the first instance.

When we agreed that a balance had to be struck, we believed that far fewer people would be disadvantaged than proved to be the case when the committee hearings concluded.

        The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor for 1994-95 and subsequent years from eight per cent to five per cent. Yesterday I canvassed the arguments, and I will do so again very briefly, for our settling on five per cent. The main reason we think eight per cent is unfair is that it is an uplift factor which is nearly four times the inflation rate. The effect of that will be that small businesses, farmers and independent retirees will have their taxable income from last year automatically increased by eight per cent. It does not take cognisance of the so-called other factors, the other things which are happening in the economy and in their industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The government will collect something like $250 million from this. We know that most of it will be refunded in the next tax year, but I think the important thing to note is that in the meantime it will affect the cashflows of small businesses. It would be much better for the $250 million to be given back to small businesses so that they can get on with the job they do well—job generation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Why five per cent? We think that is a more appropriate median figure for expected provisional tax income growth than eight per cent. The government has forecast growth in average weekly earnings this year to be about 3.5 per cent; in real GDP, 4.5 per cent; and, in inflation, 2.25 per cent. So five per cent is reasonably consistent with growth. The all ordinaries index grew by five per cent and there was a 5.72 per cent rise in retail trade in the year to June. Setting the uplift factor at five per cent would allow for the expected rise in interest income as interest rates rise, and there could be some recovery in property incomes.

         The point of setting it at that figure is that it would provide a well-timed boost to small business. I have heard the government's argument. Of more interest to me, I guess, is the position on this matter of members of the opposition because they say that they are the champions of small businesses. The government probably acknowledges that they pay a lot of attention to the big end of town and not quite as much to the smaller end.

         I heard Senator Kemp, Senator Short, Senator Panizza and Senator Boswell speak yesterday about how bad the principles of the tax system are for small business. That is obviously the reason we said that this is an opportunity to do something about it. Groups such as COSBOA, with which the opposition would be familiar, the Small Business Forum, ACCI and the Retailers Council have asked the opposition for assistance by supporting this amendment.

         The opposition has chosen to use a number of arguments which I canvassed yesterday—essentially, that it is plundering the revenue, which it is not, and that small business is already engaged in working it out for this year so they do not want the money back yet, but they might get it back next year because the opposition will put everybody on notice that it will not do it this year but it will think about doing it next year. The other reason is that it does not want to block supply. People in small business believed that for a short time until it was possible to point out to them the difference between money bills, tax bills, supply, appropriation and all the different terminologies that can often be used deliberately to confuse people. I think it is the politics of this issue that are more important to the opposition than the immediate opportunity to support small business, and I think that is regrettable.

         —As Senator Watson said during the second reading debate on this bill, there are a number of measures in this bill that leave a bitter aftertaste in the mouth of members of the coalition. Not least of those is the government's decision to maintain the provisional uplift factor at eight per cent. It does seem too high. I will be asking Senator McMullan to give us much more detail. The government has been pretty coy to date as to how the eight per cent figure was derived, because it certainly does seem much too high when we take into account the government's own forecasts for inflation and real income growth during 1994-95. I hope Senator McMullan will address that.

         We agree with the Democrats that the eight per cent figure is too high. As Senator Kernot said, we have put the government on notice that next year we will be looking very closely at whatever figure it brings up. But there are some important points of principle in this matter. So far as the government is concerned, of course, it is yet another very clear example of the disdain in which the government holds the small business sector, self-employed persons, retirees and the like. There is no doubt that it is very damaging to simply maintain the eight per cent figure this year. It does hit the small business sector and we recognise that.

         I point out, though, with respect to Senator Kernot, that it is a short-term hit in the sense that it does not increase the total tax paid over time by provisional taxpayers. What it means is that they will pay less provisional tax next time than they will this year. So if we take it over time, of course, it does not affect the total level of the tax bill. Certainly, the $250 million or thereabouts that Senator Kernot referred to is not an unimportant figure, particularly for many struggling small businesses today.

         On the other side of the coin there are some important principles. We in the coalition have for long maintained the principle that government budget measures are entitled to carriage unless—a very important consideration—the measure represents a broken promise on the part of the government and unless the measure is retrospective. They are the two particular reasons why the coalition would feel obliged to oppose government budget revenue measures.

         This year, in this instance, neither of those two conditions applies. The coalition has been arguing strongly that the government should be taking much stronger measures to get its fiscal house in order. Small business is in trouble today because of the inept, incompetent economic management of this government. Because the government has let huge budget deficits run, it has put more pressure on interest rates, and high interest rates are the killers of small business. Through the ineptitude of its fiscal management this government has been the prime architect of the problems that the small business sector faces today.

         Given that there are not the two preconditions that we have always had as a matter of principle in relation to opposing budget measures, it is difficult for the coalition—as a principle to coalition—to say to the government on the one hand, `Get your fiscal act together. Get your budget deficit down', and on the other hand to say, `You have determined your budget for this year, but it is far too high a deficit, anyway. We want you to take a measure which will increase that deficit by another $250 million or so.' That would put still further upward pressure on interest rates and compound the problems that the government has already imposed on the small business sector.

         It is for those reasons that the coalition, while understanding the point that Senator Kernot has made, will not be supporting the Australian Democrat's amendment. I hope Senator Kernot realises the irony and the hypocrisy of what she proposes. She talks about playing politics, but she is the ultimate political opportunist. If the Democrats were fair dinkum and were really serious about wanting to do things for small business, they would stop taking the continual measures which are now in their economic policy platform and which would vastly increase government expenditure to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. I think the Democrats expenditure proposals at the moment are something like $20 billion plus over the present level.

In the end, the taxpayer has to pay for the totally extravagant, damaging, job destroying policies of the Democrats—particularly in the rural areas of Australia that are suffering so grievously today. If the Democrats were really serious about having any concern for small business in this country, and about having any concern for those people in the bush who are having such a desperately difficult time today, they would be pursuing policies which were aimed at decreasing the burden of taxation on small business; to decrease the level of interest rates to give small business a chance to grow and thrive as we all want it to do.

         Yet, the whole thrust of the Democrats' policies ever since I have been in this place, but increasingly over the last five years, has been bigger government spending, higher government taxation, higher interest rates, less savings for investment, less job creation, less small business, and less growth in the economy. With great respect to Senator Kernot, I have to say that the hypocrisy of the Democrats in moving this amendment is monumental.

         I am delighted to say that that irony, that hypocrisy, and that basic inconsistency in the economic policy proposals of the Democrats are very well recognised in the small business community. The coalition is sorry that the uplift factor being maintained at eight per cent is as high as it is. I have asked Senator McMullan to explain to us precisely how the government arrives at eight per cent.

If a party is going to be a disciplined and principled political party, unlike the Australian Democrats, then there are certain principles that it has to adhere to. This is one in this particular budget measure. For those reasons, with reluctance, we will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment.

         I thank Senator Short for taking some of the hyperbole out of this debate. He brought some more sober assessment to the implications of it—both for small business and for the revenue, and he was correct on both counts. His contribution about macro-economic policy was not quite so considered and does not stand as a very sober reflection, but it is a debate for another day. Looking at what is happening in interest rates in other countries would perhaps expose some of the weaknesses in his points; but this is not the time to get involved in all that. It is interesting to see this conflict going on and I expect to see more of it as the struggle for credibility between the competing opposition parties continues. Good luck to them both.

         One of the things to remember—and I will talk about the basis for setting the provisional tax uplift factor in a moment—is that a substantial number of people who pay provisional tax get a lot of their income from interest. If that is where a person's income comes from, it certainly has increased substantially.

         The other thing to remember is that those most likely to gain most from those income sources rising quickest are those with the highest income. So the unintended consequence of Senator Kernot's proposed amendment to clause 65 is that some of the people with the biggest incomes in this country are the biggest winners. That seems to me to be a distributional problem.

         There is not the sort of information base to break that down.

         The level of aggregate income subject to provisional tax is difficult to predict with accuracy. Nobody should pretend that we can predict with precision for any one year exactly what it will be. Whatever we do, it will be too high for some people and too low for others. That is why we have the arrangements that allow taxpayers to approach the Taxation Office to vary their provisional tax, as some do, and those figures were given to the Senate committee. That goes to some of Senator Harradine's points but not all.

         So we try to get an uplift factor which is on average, over time and across taxpayers, a reasonable reflection of the growth in income of provisional taxpayers, and the eight per cent uplift factor has regard to the expected average annual growth in income subject to provisional tax over the next several years. We do not want to provide a timing advantage to recipients of income subject to provisional tax compared to PAYE taxpayers. I think we have to balance the fairness and equity measures in that.

         So there are a number of hidden equity issues in this that are important. There are significant revenue measures but I would just be wasting the committee's time if I went through those—Senator Short has already dealt with them—and there are redistributive factors. But some of the areas of income most prone to having provisional tax applied to them are those which are increasing most quickly. So one has to realise the balancing factor.

         I do not want to pretend there is great science here; that we could predict that next year it will be 7.9 per cent and bet the house on it. But one has to look at the medium-term prospect. Looking at the nature of income involved, the low but still existent rate of inflation, and the increase in interest rates and profitability, this is a reasonable assessment. I would be surprised if we found a significantly increased number of people seeking a reassessment, or finding that they had significantly overpaid and were seeking a rebate but the statistics will show that up afterwards and those are matters we can pursue over the years. However, when it comes up next year and we have a look at those figures, we will see.

         —I rise on behalf of the coalition opposition to speak on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994. The major amendments proposed in this bill will do two things. The bill will set the level of Commonwealth vocational education and training funding for 1994 to 1996. Secondly, it will provide for payments to the Australian National Training Authority for additional trainees under the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships.

         The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and the territories for the provision and support of vocational education and training, primarily in the technical and further education system. Prior to 1 January 1994, grants to the states and territories were provided in accordance with the provisions of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989. These grants contributed to general operating costs and infrastructure—in other words, they were recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants. From 1 January 1994 the funding arrangements under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 were replaced by funding arrangements under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Under the new arrangements a single pool of funds, comprising the previously separate recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants, is passed to ANTA for allocation amongst the states and territories.

         The Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 gave effect to an agreement announced by the Prime Minister in July 1992 between the Commonwealth, states and territories for the establishment of ANTA. The objectives of the agreement include the establishment of a national vocational education and training system, closer interaction between industry and providers of vocational education and training, an effective training market and improved cross-sectoral links. The functions of ANTA include allocating and remitting funding to state and territory training agencies on the basis of guidelines determined by the ministerial council, and administering any programs agreed by the ministerial council as requiring national delivery within the guidelines approved by the council.

         Within the bill currently being debated the main provisions are in clause 4, which will insert new sections 9, 9A and 9A(1) into the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Section 9 currently provides for payments to ANTA for allocation under the ANTA Act 1992 of $638.96 million in 1994 and $719.7 million in 1995. The effect of the new section will be to amend the amounts payable to ANTA in the following manner: it will increase the amount payable in 1994 from $638 million to $673.6 million and the amount in 1995 from $719.7 million to $755.7 million, and it will set out the amount payable for 1996. It is a very substantial amount which we are putting into this part of education in Australia.

         In the area of administration, a lot of difficulties are surfacing. The real issues that we need to face are: what are the intentions of the federal government, and what are its strategies as outlined in the white paper? Is the government really focused on increasing and improving the skills of Australians, or is it more interested in trying to pull down the unemployment figures just for a gloss effect for public perception purposes?

         My colleague the shadow spokesperson and member for Braddon, Mr Miles, informs me that there are deep concerns being expressed in relation to the questions of training and skilling in this area of education. For example, a recent report by Vince Fitzgerald, which was commissioned by ANTA and was entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Successful reform: competitive skills for Australians and Australian enterprises
         </emphasis>
         , expresses some of those concerns. In its chapter entitled `Successful reform', under the heading `Inadequate performance planning and reporting', it says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Continued reliance on Frameworks, Guidelines, Policies, Procedures, Protocols, Memorandums and other paraphernalia of government avoids the central question of what is the performance target, what is the work and business plan and where are the annual reports against reform targets for each of those agencies or organisations actually responsible for the reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not going to skill this country and we are not going to develop a more competent work force unless this money is effectively used and unless there are administrative arrangements in place which set up clear, measurable targets that are identifiable publicly and that can be achieved. At the moment, all the evidence indicates that money is being allocated by the parliament, but the progress is not very great. There is deep concern out there expressed by a whole range of people, organisations and industry involved in the area.

         This report said that there are confused accountabilities and responsibilities. If we are going to make progress and if there is not to be so much red tape and bureaucracy in this field, the government has got to give some clear direction in this arena. The Fitzgerald report says in its conclusion to this particular chapter:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our assessment . . . relates to both the substance of the national training reforms themselves and to their strategic management. In both areas they have been found wanting.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The report finds the reforms wanting with regard to strategic management. The whole direction of ANTA really comes back to the federal government and, clearly, there is lack of direction from this government. There are literally thousands of people out there in businesses who are ignored or locked out of the training procedures.

         The act also set out the goals of an effective training market and other objectives which the government and the council have agreed to, but they are simply not being realised. There is also a concern that the proposed funding levels as set out are unrealistically low, and the government is really trying to force an agenda onto the states which is going to cause problems.

         The agreements between the states and the federal government have not yet been made, and there is a suspicion that the federal government is pushing off responsibilities to the states and giving them a certain amount of money, but expecting them to do far more than that money will ever achieve. That same approach is also being taken in the areas of health and law and order. They are state areas of responsibility for which the government keeps cutting the real funding while still expecting the states to do something about them. It is about to do the same, I suspect, with regard to vocational education and training.

         The other aspect worth highlighting in this bill is that it gives the Commonwealth minister power to determine whether states are meeting targets for new trainees rather than leaving that task to the ANTA board. Why does it have to be the federal minister who has the power to determine whether the targets have been met?

         This government has had an abysmal record in TAFE education over the past 10 years. This bill is a very late response to the decline in apprenticeships and traineeships which has occurred over the past few years. For example, the 1993-94 target of 46,000 apprenticeships is less than half the 1992-93 level. Even if the 1995-96 target of 60,000 new apprenticeships is achieved, that number will be less than the levels achieved four years ago. The question of funding for ANTA is only one aspect that needs to be addressed. The government needs to give ANTA some sense of direction so that it can get on with the job it was established for. The opposition does not oppose this bill.

         —The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994 is largely about funding the Australian National Training Authority in terms of growth funding for the Finn participation targets for young people, funding for off-the-job training provider assistance and funding for an additional 50,000 entry level trainees for the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships as part of the white paper initiatives. Of course, we realise that business was let off the hook in relation to the changes in the business training levies. That is part of the reason governments now find themselves being required to pay more into training schemes because business is less and less willing to provide research and development and training schemes. Business does not want government regulation but is expecting governments to do more and more for it.

         The Greens will be voting for this bill. We encourage the provision of extra traineeship positions for young people. There is some concern, however, in the traineeship sector that traineeships are being provided in haste and the quality is being sacrificed. The big question, though, is: where are the jobs? Where are the permanent jobs for these people when they train for three to four years and finally qualify as professionals? The government has not addressed this fundamental issue.

         I know the government would probably turn around and say, `It is through economic growth,' but we do not have to be an Einstein to see that the type of change we have made in many policies in recent times has meant that the type of growth has changed. We are concentrating very much on imported capital which actually sheds jobs. One does not have to be terribly intuitive to see that there is further job shedding within the government sector; at the same time as some positions are being created, unemployment is being created in other areas. In reality, what we do see is a growing number of people in part-time or less tenured positions in short-term jobs. That is, fewer jobs within regions and fewer jobs for younger people.

         We have growing social problems. One does not have to look very far in Western Australia to see that the kind of growth we have is mainly holes in the ground or smokestacks. So we have growth and environmental problems, but they do not necessarily translate to growth in the jobs in the areas where there is the greatest need for employment in our society. Economists recognise also that the tactic of wage subsidies is only useful to the short-term unemployed as an incentive for an employer to take them on. Wage subsidies are not the way to go to help the long-term unemployed.

There was a potential under the regional development strategy—where it was possible to create regional based development and community based development—to ask people about the real needs of the communities. The whole exercise ended up being a waste of time. All that happened was that two people from the regional development task force went to the major industries and said, `What do you want?' We got more of the same as we have had for a long time. There is a lack of vision by this government about what is needed within a region. It does not ask the right questions of the right people. If the government does not know what is needed that is very sad. I think it is time the government found out.

         The job compact at large was a process of negotiation between the government and training bodies, but did not adequately involve employers. If employers are not involved, how can they take on the responsibility for employing people? How do we get them to change their mind-set and inherent bias when it comes to employing the long-term unemployed? Some employers have already been quite vocal in their response to wage subsidies. They have said that it does not matter how many wage subsidies the government throws at them, they will not take on a long-term unemployed person over someone who is short-term unemployed, because of their personal problems, their potential emotional baggage and their deteriorated skills and confidence. We need to do a lot of work to involve employers more in the training process so that there is a smoother transition between the training of marginalised groups and employment.

Government is fighting a losing battle by constantly giving sweeteners to big business to try to woo it into establishing its head offices here and offering tax reduction strategies to create jobs.

The options for the government include providing jobs in community services, infrastructure, public sector employment, capital works, et cetera. We also need to concentrate on creating jobs in areas that young people perceive as important in terms of their future, and areas that they would like to be involved in. Some of these areas are capital works projects, land care, environmental programs, maintenance of World Heritage areas, recycling and waste disposal, labour intensive agricultural activities and implementing energy efficient power sources—perhaps some decent energy policies would create a lot more jobs than are being created at the moment.

What we are talking about is this: when we have well-trained, quality staff we can pay them much higher wages because their productivity and the quality of their work is substantially improved. If we want a non-trained work force, a no-skill work force, then we do have to pay them wages at a Third World level, because in terms of productivity or quality they cannot produce a competitive product. But when we have well-trained staff with the right skills, and the competency in those skills, we can pay decent wages equivalent to a First World economy—which we want to be—which can provide the standard of living which ordinary Australians desire to have. That is what this government is committed to. ANTA is going to be an essential part of that program in providing those skills.

         It is a big achievement to get the states to agree with the federal government that we will have a national system of skill based competency training and change the whole structure of training for skill and vocation from what has been traditionally done in Australia through four-year apprenticeships and so on. We are changing all of that to ensure that our community and our industry is internationally competitive—a better economy and, above all else, a more civilised economy, where people can live with some dignity because they have decent skill based jobs.

         These four pieces of legislation span a range of primary industries and, taken together, demonstrate an admirable commitment to self-help. The National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for the maximum rate of the national residue survey levy to increase from 0.02c a head to 0.06c a head. Almost all primary industries in Australia contribute to the national residue survey to ensure that the food they produce is free from harmful residues. The survey for each industry is fully funded by that industry.

         In this case, the Australian Chickenmeat Federation sought an increase in the levy to provide the industry with greater flexibility in long-term planning. The chicken meat industry has developed from so-called backyard status in the late 1960s to a modern, dynamic industry, now second only to beef in terms of meat production. Some 40 years ago, Australians consumed about three million birds annually, or less than half a kilogram of chicken meat per person, per year. In 1993-94, Australians ate their way through 325 million birds. That equates to two Kentucky Fried Chicken snack packs or three Mc Chickens, or perhaps 13 bowls of chicken noodle soup per person, per week, per year.

         It is important to note that the chicken meat industry in Australia directly employs 16,000 people, indirectly involves 45,000 people and has retail sales figures approaching $1.7 billion. Having said that, there is mounting concern about the impact of the drought on intensive animal feeding industries which rely on grain. The chicken meat industry is a prime example. Should grain prices continue to rise, the industry will have to decide whether to absorb the extra costs or pass them on to consumers.

         Clearly, the impacts of this drought go beyond the farm gate. Our chicken meat industry is also hamstrung by the high cost of capital, the high cost of labour, and the subsidies provided in rival countries. The United States and the European Union are aggressive protectors of their domestic chicken meat industries, while Thailand has rapidly become a major chicken meat exporter, through tax incentives and cheap labour.

         For all of these reasons, the possible relaxation of Australian quarantine regulations relating to imported chicken meat causes great concern to the Australian industry. This concern is twofold: first, the impact on local producers, and second, the possible introduction of the world's most feared disease in the poultry industry—the newcastle virus. I am pleased that AQIS has decided against allowing raw chicken meat into Australia and I trust that its position paper, which suggests cooked chicken meat will not pose a disease risk, is correct. The chicken meat industry upholds high standards and, on behalf of the federal coalition, I hope the industry's commitment to the future is matched by the same level of commitment from the government.

The remainder funds the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Funding spent on research is matched by the government on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

         As the reputation of Australian wine grows throughout the world, our export trade continues to strengthen. In 1994-95, it is estimated that we will export 162 million litres of wine. This amounts to an increase of almost 400 per cent since 1989-90. In value terms, exports are expected to come close to $500 million.

         One of the most recent developments in the wine industry has been the agreement reached between Australia and the European Community signed in January this year. The agreement paves the way for improved access of Australian wines to European markets and eliminates technical trade barriers in return for the phasing out of European geographical names as names for wine. The search for new names to replace beaujolais, hock, madeira, chianti and, eventually, champagne, chablis, moselle and others will be a challenge for Australian winemakers. But it does provide an enormous opportunity for Australian wines to further establish their market niche with distinctive names. Given the industry's vision and foresight, the federal coalition has no doubt that the industry will achieve its $1 billion annual export targets by the year 2000.

         The final piece of legislation in this cognate debate, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, covers a range of minor changes to various primary industry acts. These include the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council Act 1984 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. The Farm Household Support Act, for example, covers the operation of the farm household support scheme designed to provide assistance to farmers unable to meet living expenses or to access commercial finance. This assistance is provided for a period of nine months. If, during that time, the farmer leaves the farm the assistance becomes a grant. If the farmer remains in the industry, the assistance must be repaid at commercial interest rates. Those who leave the industry within the nine-month period will receive the balance payable for a period as a lump sum in addition to their re-establishment grant of $45,000.

         This bill makes a small but important change to the administrative arrangements for farm household support. It extends from 14 to 30 days the time allowed for farm household support applicants to obtain a certificate of inability to access finance. Many farmers have experienced problems in obtaining such a certificate within 14 days because of the difficulty in physically accessing financial institutions. So I am pleased that the government has acknowledged this difficulty.

         Although the household support scheme is, in theory, a useful form of assistance to farmers in difficulty, in practice it has not worked and only some 260 farmers currently receive benefits. For this reason, the government has been forced to introduce the drought relief payment in order to put food on the tables of drought stricken farmers. We will later today be dealing with that legislation comprehensively. As I said earlier, the consequences of this drought go beyond the farm gate. They impact on small businesses in country towns, and on the people who work for those small businesses. It is evident that Australia will bear the high personal and economic costs of this drought for many years to come.

         —The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is an omnibus bill amending numerous acts within the portfolio. I would like to restrict my comments today to those amendments relating to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act and the Farm Household Support Act. In relation to the second of those, I certain support the comments made by Senator Tambling.

         Looking firstly at the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, amendments contained in this bill will ensure that the organisation when performing its functions takes into account the principles of ecologically sustainable development. These principles will be written into the charter of the organisation and, in future, a person with expertise in environmental and ecological matters will be required to be a serving member of the organisation's board. I expect that this provision will come into effect when the new AWRAP board members are appointed some time next year.

         Following these amendments, ESD principles will need to be considered by AWRAP in its corporate planning, in its annual reporting and in its allocation of funding for research and development activities. The Democrats have said on previous occasions—almost ad nauseam—that the definition of what constitutes principles of economically sustainable development should be more clearly spelt out in legislation. I urge again that the government take this suggestion on board.

         Further amendments contained in this bill, which I understand are being made at the request of the AWRAP management, would provide the organisation with greater flexibility in the way in which it allocates its funds. More specifically, it would be able to direct moneys received from patents and trademarks to activities other than research and development. The Democrats will be supporting these amendments.

         I turn now to the Farm Household Support Act. The explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of the amendments is to improve the delivery of farm household support to farmers experiencing financial difficulties and to allow for the more efficient administration of farm household support. Experience I have had with social security legislation has made me very wary when an explanatory memorandum uses terms like `improve the delivery' or `allow for more efficient administration'. Often these terms seem to be `draftese' for measures which leave a lot of people worse off. Fortunately, after we have gone carefully through the amendments to the Farm Household Support Act it does not seem that there would be too many in a worse situation. We are thankful for that.

         Firstly, the amendments would allow farmers more time to obtain a certificate verifying that they are unable to access any further commercial finance. This extension from 14 to 30 days would be useful because of the problems many farmers have in simply getting time to travel into town to a financial institution. Those problems are exacerbated by the fact that financial institutions have been exiting the bush almost as fast as some farmers. Secondly, the act currently provides that, where a person is attempting to sell his or her farm but is having difficulty doing so, the secretary or a delegate can extend the grant period of farm household support beyond the normal nine-month limit. Amendments in this bill would allow recipients who have been refused an extension of their grant period to ask for a review of that decision.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A third amendment in the bill would ensure that a farmer can access the nine-month grant period of farm household support only once. In other words, a farmer who sold up and received a lump sum payout of the grant period would not, if he or she should subsequently re-enter farming, be eligible for a second grant period. The final amendment in the bill is one I want to talk about at slightly greater length. It would require people with farm household support loans to inform the Department of Primary Industries and Energy if they change their address, sell their farm or have some change in their financial position which may affect their capacity to repay the loan.

         The amendments set out also that the penalty for failing to provide this information would be imprisonment for six months, which the explanatory memorandum says is consistent with similar penalties in the Social Security Act. I note that many of the clauses in the Social Security Act relating to imprisonment have an accompanying note which says that a court can, if it wishes, impose an appropriate fine instead of a term of imprisonment. I am interested to know if similar flexibility is available under the imprisonment clause contained within this bill. Prison terms, surely, should be a last option. Perhaps the minister would like to comment on this provision in his response to this debate. I ask him to note that.

         One final comment I would like to make about farm household support is that the Democrats have always been concerned that this payment is made as a loan and not as a straight-out grant. In the House of Representatives debate the member for Maranoa, Mr Bruce Scott, made the very good point that the last thing that people who have exhausted every source of commercial credit available to them need is another loan hanging over their heads. Of course, given that the chances of being able to sell a drought stricken farming property are pretty slim, that is exactly what they end up with—a loan accruing interest at commercial rates.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Since the object of the farm household support payments is solely to cover day-to-day living expenses for farm families who have no money whatsoever, and no capacity to borrow from any sort of financial institution, I believe they should be made as a grant. When it was first introduced in 1992, my colleague Senator Lees criticised the loan aspect of the scheme when she said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Basically, this amounts to the Government making money out of alleviating poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely that is an obscenity. She continued:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To make it clear, we are talking about farmers who need a payment to put food on the table, but may end up after two years with a debt of some $20,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two-year limit, for those farmers who qualified when the scheme was first introduced, will expire early next year at which time they will begin to be charged interest and will have to start making repayments. What we are talking about here is some of Australia's worst-off farmers being penalised for not selling up and getting out of farming altogether. With conditions in rural Australia the way they currently are, most farmers would be lucky to give their farms away, let alone sell them.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Yet in March next year we are going to see people having to repay a debt to the Commonwealth—a debt accumulated while those people were basically living in poverty, and a debt on which the Commonwealth is going to charge a commercial interest rate. I simply reiterate that the Democrats believe that, since the object of farm household support payments is solely to cover day-to-day living expenses, they should be made as a grant.

         —I do not intend to comment for long given the time and some albeit critical comments. The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is an omnibus bill which gives the opportunity for senators to make fairly wide ranging contributions. The bill goes to amendments in relation to the Wine and Brandy Corporation members of which, I should mention, I was fortunate to have dinner with last night at one of their meetings in Canberra. I think that corporation, together with the research organisation, are doing a fine job in assisting the exports of wine and meeting the $1 billion target.

         I just mention a particular problem that the export of wine has caused. Unfortunately, the dried fruit industry has been a victim of the wine industry's success. I talked to some dried fruit growers and packers in Mildura on Monday during my visit to that city. Unfortunately, many of the grapes that are required for dried fruit production are going to wine production. Clearly, that is a supply and demand situation—the better price being offered by the wine industry. The unfortunate aspect of that is that the dried fruits industry is not able to supply the market. The dried fruits industry has been a fine example of a very successful and innovative industry, particularly over the last decade when it faced significant competition in the form of cheap dried vine fruit from countries such as Turkey and Iran, where labour is obviously much less expensive.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         An interesting aspect of the dried vine fruit industry is that it has met that competition by innovative technology. In the technology that I have looked at, every individual piece of dried vine fruit—every piece of sultana—that is packaged is individually scanned, cleaned, sized and colour coded. I think there are a million and a half pieces of fruit in one tonne of fruit so it gives us some idea of the sort of technology required to do that. Because of that type of technology, the industry has been able to maintain its market and defeat imports, not just in Australia but also in Europe—primarily Germany. Until this year, Australia was the largest dried vine fruit exporter in the world.

         It is an interesting issue because it highlights the fact that the basis of success for rural industries is not in maintaining high tariff protection. There may be some industries where tariff protection at times is necessary, but at the end of the day the dried vine fruit industry has defeated the competition by technology and by innovative marketing. It is the most successful industry of its type in the world. As I said, it is an unfortunate downside of the wine industry's success that it cannot obtain the grapes now to export and meet its export markets. I notice Senator Lees has just come in. She may want to comment on the legislation. I will leave my remarks there. I thank senators for their contributions.

         As has been mentioned, these bills seek to end the levy exemption for Australia's small wine producers, or those who are processing less than 10 tonnes of grapes. In the past, the small producers have effectively paid the levy through the costs passed on to them by the larger producers so eventually the money has filtered through the system somehow. However, they have not been recognised as official levy payers and therefore have not been entitled to become involved in the activities of the Wine and Brandy Corporation.

         Today's changes mean that the small wine producers as official levy payers will now be able to access the marketing, labelling, and research and development activities of the corporation.

Australia's wine industry supports the changes implemented by these bills, therefore the Democrats will obviously have no problems in supporting these bills as they stand. They provide significant recognition for small wine producers. As Australia's wine industry is surging towards its billion dollar export target by the year 2000, the small producers will continue to play the very vital role that they are playing in achieving that target.

         —The Drought Relief Payment Bill is the federal government's belated response to the drought which has ravaged so much of Queensland and New South Wales for the past four years. I am concerned that this legislation, like so many other primary industry bills, is cobbled together for passage through this parliament but really does not do justice to that important industry, the primary industry. It is a pity that we see primary industry bills hastened through on the last day of a sitting week, usually in a manner that frustrates the program. It is a pity that we have to deal with this bill in such a manner again today.

         The bill acknowledges the hardship faced by farmers in exceptional circumstances due to drought, by offering a new welfare payment called the drought relief payment. I understand that the DRP will be subject to the income and off-farm assets tests that apply to jobsearch and will be on the same scale as the jobsearch allowance. The federal coalition welcomes the drought relief payment and, in particular, the government's decision to exclude consideration of farm assets, life insurance and superannuation when DRP rate calculations are being made. For some time the federal coalition has called on the federal government to lift the assets tests in times of severe economic hardship. We are pleased that the government has seen the light.

         While the federal coalition is keen to expedite this legislation through parliament, we want to place on record our concerns and our criticisms. For a start, we are at a loss to understand why the government has taken so long to recognise the plight of drought stricken farmers in this country. Similarly, we are disappointed that the government has ignored the consequences of the drought for our important small business sector. It is a matter of record that the government was forced into announcing this package by pressure from opposition members of parliament and through the power of the media.

         Once Australians realised the extent of the drought, the fact that there was a real crisis on the land, the government had to act. But not before the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, had arrogantly dismissed the drought as something farmers had to live with. `Look,' he said, `It's always out there. Farmers have just got to learn to manage it.' The reality is that farmers are ill-equipped to cope with such severe droughts, particularly in the current economic circumstances. It is worth repeating that small businesses, particularly those dependent on the rural sector, are hurting and have been forgotten by the government.

         As my colleague the shadow minister for primary industry, Mr John Anderson, said in the other place this week:

        Machinery agents probably start to hurt before most farmers do. In anticipation of tough times, farmers close the cheque books early. Many of the machinery agents out there, who are an absolutely vital part of the farm infrastructure of this nation, have long since folded. I do not know how some of them keep going under the current circumstances.

        He added that everyone from fuel agents and contractors to the corner store operator were feeling the pain. It was therefore incumbent on the government to acknowledge the full impact of the drought on rural Australia. My colleagues and I believe in a three-tiered approach to severe drought. First, the adequate delivery of welfare provisions; second, the retention of farms and farm assets; and third, recovery.

         Drought is not just a welfare issue. It is also an economic issue. The farm sector is extraordinarily important to Australia providing a quarter of our export dollars. Hopefully, that figure will improve, once the drought breaks and we take advantage of rising commodity prices and expanding export opportunities to Asia.

         Our farm sector also provides enormous opportunities for employment not only at the base farm production level but also in the food processing sector, which employs some 200,000 people. The government has acknowledged the need to establish new mechanisms to ensure that the farm sector is able to recover and plan for the future once good rains come. Those plans must include preparations—such as commitments to income equalisation deposits and farm management bonds—to help farmers prepare for the next downturn. Again, that has long been federal coalition policy.

         We must not forget that the farm sector is as much a victim of the drought as it is a victim of Labor's failed economic policies. Our farmers have suffered years of farm inflation—sometimes two and three times that of their overseas competitors—while sending 70 or 80 per cent of their agricultural product abroad. The fact is we are price takers on international markets. So, when our competitiveness is gutted by high domestic prices and ever-rising costs, farmers—not the government—make up the difference.

         Over the last decade or so, high inflation rates have been accompanied by high interest rates which at one stage exceeded 20 per cent for 18 months. The damage done to the farm sector, at a time of historically low commodity prices, was immense and incalculable. It left farmers, in net terms, with a debt load of about $17.3 billion.

         We are now witnessing the end result of a decade of federal Labor government—that is, a financially weakened and vulnerable farm sector. Given the financial hardships faced by farmers in the 1980s, they have been unable to prepare themselves for a modest downturn, let alone a severe drought such as this one. Also relevant to the drought debate is the government's refusal to grapple with the problem of high cost imposts, post-farm gate. Report after report has made it clear that the Australian beef industry is disadvantaged by the high costs involved in processing beef in this country compared with our competitors, New Zealand, Argentina or the United States of America.

         The latest report, released six weeks ago, explains why our producers are internationally competitive: they take a lower return at the farm gate. Farmers are still bearing the brunt of the federal government's decision that the farm sector should face a level playing field, ahead of anyone else. As a nation, we need to address the problem of post-drought reconstruction and, as far as possible, prevent our best farmers from going under. Clearly, the government agrees with the federal coalition on this point. It has picked up one of our rural assistance policy commitments: that the maximum allowable assistance with interest rates be significantly upgraded from $50,000 a year to $100,000 or $300,000 over five years.

         The government has also picked up our policy to extend relief beyond the end of the drought. That extra time will allow farmers, farm leaders, lenders and governments to negotiate ways of reconstructing debt loads. Now that the government is committed to post-drought assistance, it is not unreasonable to ask lenders to offer a similar long-term commitment to farmers. To that end, the coalition has set up a shadow ministry subcommittee to investigate this issue.

         While the severity and rapidity of the drought caught many by surprise, I would like to remind the Senate of comments made by the shadow minister for primary industry last year. Speaking in the other place, Mr Anderson warned that a severe drought was emerging in parts of Queensland—a situation so serious that it demanded food parcels and donations from charitable organisations. He also highlighted the growing human tragedy: the strain on farmers and on their families as they struggled to hold on to drought stricken properties. That was May 1993.

         Now, more than a year later, the government has bowed to public and parliamentary pressure and announced a drought relief package. It is worth noting the comments of the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association at a drought meeting in Sydney this week. Mr John Crawford put the crisis in historical context when he said that New South Wales was facing its worst drought in 50 years, and that many farmers were killing their breeding stock. Given the severity of the drought—and the anomalies in the existing guidelines—it is clear that new mechanisms need to be developed in order to better identify areas of greatest need.

         For instance, there are enormous needs in the Scone, Maryvale, and Mudgee areas, which have somehow been excluded from the list of exceptional drought areas. Those farmers face extraordinarily difficult circumstances yet, under the current rigid guidelines, may have to wait many months before receiving assistance.

         In winding up, I would like to reiterate the federal coalition's concern about the devastating effects of severe drought on the small business sector, as well as the farm sector. Small businesses in badly affected areas have experienced a severe and sustained downturn in trade, with a corresponding reduction in income and, what we all have to acknowledge, the threat and constant problem of rising interest rates. We need to ensure their survival. After all, small businesses have substantial investments in assets and expertise which will be crucial to reconstruction after the drought.

         The federal coalition has called on the federal government to return severe drought to the national disaster relief arrangements. This would provide a mechanism for assisting small businesses where currently no mechanism exists. Overall, the federal coalition welcomes the initiatives in this legislation, and is pleased to support the bill.

         The meeting of 29 November was not a final decision meeting; it was a meeting between senior ministers to establish what a common view would be. Having established that common view, each of the relevant ministers would then give instructions to their departments; a cabinet submission would be drawn up; that would be considered by cabinet; the opposition leader and defence spokesman would be consulted; the caucus would be consulted; and a statement delivered in parliament. That is the process. So the meeting on 29 November was not a meeting of a cabinet committee or of a cabinet subcommittee. So in terms of that process, that is why there are not cabinet note takers, and this is a constant process of government. No doubt those on the opposition side, in the long dark memories of when they were last in government, followed a similar process.

         —I am aware of the Yellow Pages small business index special report. I have already issued a statement saying that it should be treated with some caution. All of us who have any connection with small business realise that the small business community is a pretty robust bunch of people. They usually have a very direct attitude about the government and politicians, whether they are federal, state or local. Many of their complaints, as reflected in this survey, deal with those perceptions. We recognise that those perceptions are strongly held but, despite that, this government has a good working relationship with the small business community.

         However, there are a couple of reasons why we should view some of the responses with caution. For example, one of the areas in which the small business community disagrees with government policy or has a negative view is taxation—39 per cent of the respondents mention taxation. Clearly, they want reduced taxation. Twenty-five per cent of the respondents also said that they disagree with the federal government on the so-called absence of incentives for small business.

         There is quite a contradiction. All incentives cost the federal government revenue. Whatever the government provides costs money. If we provide increased incentives, we either have to increase taxation or cut expenditure somewhere else. So there is clearly a contradiction. But it is not unusual for people in the community to say, `Increase taxation elsewhere, but not on me. Give my sector of the community increased government assistance.'

         While I am talking about assistance to the small business sector, I point out that the sectors that have access to the programs announced in the industry part of the Working Nation statement earlier this year have responded very well. The Small Business Coalition—representing 37 small business organisations—unanimously welcomed the initiatives in Working Nation, as the initiatives helped small business. I also point out that there have been other surveys recently indicating the health and growth in small business. The Yellow Pages small business index report on industrial relations, released by the very same organisation, showed that nearly a third of employers surveyed took on more staff in the past quarter.

         Another comprehensive survey with the Australian Bureau of Statistics—a business expectations survey—has been developed by the ABS in response to the need for better information on future trading conditions in Australia. The survey is conducted by mail each quarter, and 3,000 representatives of Australian businesses are sampled. That survey showed the expectations for the December quarter 1994 and September quarter 1995. They both showed that the outlook for small business is very good indeed. Profits in the medium term are expected by small business to rise by 26 per cent and employment is expected to rise by 1.5 per cent. Small businesses are also expecting to increase capital expenditure by a remarkable 19 per cent in the medium term.

More Australians are employed than ever before, and of these the figure for female employment is 3.4 million.

It shows the grasp this minister has of his portfolio because he told me in answer to a question on notice two days ago that there were 750 applications, which therefore means that 97 out of every 100 applicants were rejected. Is the minister seriously telling the Senate that persons such as Mr Alevizos and Mr Labbozzetta, preselected Labor Party candidates for the next election, and others appointed because of Senator Bolkus's political patronage and nepotism, were better qualified for appointment than the 730 or thereabouts applicants who were rejected, many of whom had outstanding and highly relevant qualifications?

Not only has he got formal qualifications in education with a graduate diploma in business administration, and head of the humanities faculty of Seymour College—he is senior teacher of history and legal studies of that college—but he also is a former member of the executive of the South Australian Greek community and has other associated interests. The matter is not as simple as Senator Short portrayed yesterday. The point I make is that every time Senator Short has raised a point about any of the appointments, he has come in with a slanted view, a critically biased view and he has blackguarded reputations. For instance, he mentioned yesterday Pam O'Neil, the person who has been the head of the tribunal since 1989. She has developed a good reputation over that period. Senator Short himself has not criticised her but probably has praised her in the time that he has held the shadow portfolio, and I am sure other shadow ministers have praised her as well. But yesterday he came in and accused of her being politically biased.

But it would be premature to draw any conclusions about longer-term Iraqi intentions and, in that context, the United States, while cautiously acknowledging that Iraqi withdrawal, is continuing to deploy forces in Kuwait. Kuwait itself is continuing its defensive deployments, and the UK, France, and some other members of the Gulf Co-operation Council have also deployed forces there.

         As I said in this place on Monday, the Australian government does, of course, fully support the statement by the President of the Security Council on 8 October emphasising the necessity for Iraq to fully implement all relevant Security Council resolutions and reaffirming the Security Council's commitment to Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Australian government also supports efforts by the United States to implement measures to ensure that Iraq is unable to invade or threaten Kuwait in the future.

         We also strongly support efforts now under way in the UN Security Council to ensure that Iraq withdraws all its troops which it has moved into the border region to prevent Iraq from threatening its neighbours now or in the future. In that context, the precise form of the Security Council action, whether a resolution or a presidential statement, is still at an early stage of discussion, but measures which are under consideration, if accepted by the council, would preclude reinforcement of the troops that Iraq would be permitted to leave behind and would threaten serious consequences should Iraq not comply.

         One possible measure which has been publicly discussed is the imposition of a demilitarised zone, also referred to as a no-drive or a no-tank zone, south of the 32nd parallel, 230 kilometres from the Iraq-Kuwait border. The implications, I have to say, of such a measure would need careful consideration as there has to be a clear perception by Security Council decision makers, even if this is not made fully public at the time, as to what actually happens next in the event of such measures of prevention actually failing—the trip wire being crossed, in other words.

         As to the second part of Senator Loosley's question, I am aware of UNICEF's report detailing the appalling humanitarian situation facing the people of Iraq, but it needs to be appreciated that Iraq is already permitted under the terms of UN Security Council resolutions 706 and 712, passed in 1991, to sell oil to an amount of $US1.6 billion over a six-month period, of which 30 per cent has to be available for humanitarian relief. But the Iraqi government has chosen not to exercise that option. It has always been within the Iraqi government's capacity to comply not only with that oil-for-food resolution but also with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions that would lead to a lifting of all sanctions.

         The responsibility for the situation in which Iraq now finds itself is, therefore, entirely and unequivocally that of Saddam Hussein. That said, one's heart does still, of course, go out to those ordinary people of the country who are victims of this appalling man's intransigence. In that sense, I should also point out that we in Australia have contributed $3.6 million in emergency food aid to Iraq. This included $700,000 given to the non-governmental organisation CARE in November last year for emergency food aid for the needy and particularly for children.

         Senator Foreman asked me specifically whether we could get an assessment of the likely export outcomes. Of course, it is speculative, but Austrade's estimate at the moment is that our presence at the fair, based on claims of previous participants, could conservatively result in an extra $200 million in export earnings for participating companies. Previous individual participants have claimed to have each gained between $1 million and $2 million worth of business. So we can see from the level of participation, and the previous history of success, that about $200 million in extra export earnings is a reasonable expectation. That is not a bad return on taxpayers' money when we realise that it will cost Austrade $2.8 million to participate.

         In that context, the annual report for 1993-94 shows that on a weight basis seizures were down from the previous year.

         I want to put the record straight about the presence Customs has in the Torres Strait. There are eight Customs officers on Thursday Island tasked with maintaining Customs control. Customs cooperates with the Australian Federal Police, the Queensland police and the PNG authorities to continually assess the risk in the Torres Strait area and exchange information. Customs staff carry out their role with a 42-foot launch and there is also a Customs Coastwatch presence. Torres Strait is the most heavily patrolled area of any area of the Australian coastline. So that is what we are providing. In the recent new Coastwatch contract we gave special emphasis to the upgrading of Coastwatch surveillance in the Torres Strait area.

         As a party to the framework convention on climate change, the most practicable approach for Australia that would advance our national interests is to remain actively engaged in the negotiation process.

         Senator Chapman has the gall for some reason or other to raise our involvement in an international convention on desertification. Let me say in relation to this convention that Australia was active throughout the five negotiating sessions, reflecting our very strong commitment to international efforts to promote sustainable development and in view of our experience as a developed country in addressing arid land management. The Australian delegation included officials of government departments, representatives of the states, representatives of the National Farmers Federation and also the Australian Conservation Foundation.

My understanding of the ANZMEC meeting is that national minimum energy performance standards for refrigerators, freezers and electric storage hot water heaters were not rejected at that meeting.

         —My question is directed to the minister representing the Minister for Justice. I refer to recent investigations by the Australian Federal Police into alleged illegal telephone monitoring and recording by Telecom, and ask: does the minister acknowledge that Telecom lost its shield of crown immunity in February 1992, under sections 26 and 29 of the Australian Telecommunications Corporations Act? Can the minister confirm that, surprisingly, the Federal Police have been given legal advice which is in conflict with that generally accepted view, namely, that they cannot execute search warrants on Telecom because Telecom is protected, presumably, by the shield of the crown? What is the source of this astonishing advice? To what extent has this advice prevented the Federal Police from gathering evidence?

We are in a strong position to speak to the banks on this occasion because the federal government in its drought package has provided an extremely substantial package of assistance, a great deal of which is directed to subsidising the interest on the loans that the banks are providing.

         —On Tuesday, 11 October 1994, Senator Faulkner asked me whether it was in order for a senator to move to take note of two answers to questions. As I advised then, senators have frequently moved to take note of two or more answers, including answers by different ministers. This has been allowed on the basis that the relevant procedures empower a senator to move to take note of any answers given that day, and a senator is therefore able to move to take note of one or more answers.

         There is no substantive infringement of the rights of any senator, in that a senator who wishes to speak to any of the answers covered by a motion may do so. A senator may wish to speak for five minutes on each of two or more answers, and if those answers are the subject of only one motion, the senator is limited to five minutes on all of the answers, but any particular senator cannot be guaranteed five minutes speaking time on any particular answer in any event.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Jones this day, relating to the Torres Strait Islands border.

        Senator Schacht obviously wrote the question for Senator Jones, and he could not even get the question right, let alone the answer. Senator Schacht has shot off his mouth yet again and made an absolute fool of himself, an absolute and unmitigated fool of himself, and it is no wonder the South Australian Labor Party wants to get rid of him off the ticket. He is an embarrassment to the government, to this chamber, to the parliament and to the Labor Party in South Australia, and I can well agree with even that miserable lot that want to get rid of Senator Schacht.

         As Senator Schacht has crawled back in here and conceded—he did not have the grace to apologise for that—I did in fact write to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on 4 October explaining exactly my concerns. I will seek leave to incorporate this letter or a copy of it. In the last paragraph, I say to the Attorney-General:

        Senator Schacht says that there are plenty of people there to look after what everybody in the territory knows is a gross, illegal trade which is continuing. There are people coming from New Guinea through the Torres Strait islands into Horn Island, flying to Cairns. As I said on TV, I can identify the person that people raised with me. They tell me it is a man in a red hat, that they do not know his name, but they see him coming down regularly. In a small town like Thursday Island, if everybody can identify him it should not require any great investigative work by the Federal Police or Customs officers to find that person and do it.

It is not just the drugs and the traffic of people, but there are very dangerous diseases in plant and animals in Asia and New Guinea. They only have to get into Cairns on the leaves of some of these marijuana plants and we have a major problem on our hands.

Senator Schacht says, `We have plenty of people up on the border.' There are seven.

         Let me tell senators how many Customs officers there are in the whole of Queensland. There are 577. There are 4,372 in the whole of Australia. But on our doorstep, where people can get in a tinny, a little aluminium boat, to come across, how many do we have? We have the great number of seven—seven out of 4,000 officers—and Senator Schacht says it is all okay. It is a major problem which is why I, with all responsibility, wrote to the Attorney-General and wrote to the Queensland minister. Then Senator Schacht accuses me here of not even raising the matter. He is a dill and a buffoon. It is a wonder that Mr Keating leaves him there—

         —Senator Ian Macdonald said that they could identify a man with a red hat. I must say that this is the most extraordinary explanation I have heard in the Senate for a long time. Senator Macdonald does not have a red hat but a red face for trying to explain the contradiction in what he said on North Queensland Television on 29 September. He said in his interview:

       <para>
        In the letter he has just incorporated, all he says is, `I have no information which would enable police to take action.' All he has said is that it was a man with a red hat. This is extraordinary. He is running around North Queensland, bagging the Australian Customs Service and the Australian government, saying that he can identify one individual.

         He writes to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) saying that he has no information—that is in his letter—and then he says in this chamber that it was a man with a red hat. What an extraordinary comic opera he is performing. What he has been caught out on is seeking publicity in North Queensland for his own political motives—probably his Liberal Party preselection in particular. When he wrote to the Attorney-General, the letter he has incorporated, he said that he could not give any evidence. I think Senator Macdonald is the one who has been caught out and I thank him for tabling that letter to the Attorney-General.

         I think it is really unusual that Senator Macdonald would write a letter of such importance and simply ask the Attorney-General to pass it on to any other relevant minister when he knew that I am the Customs minister and when, as I understand it, there is a Customs office just around the corner from his own electorate office. One would have thought that he could have at least made an effort to write to me or raise the issue with me during the past two weeks, but he did not—he raised it with the Attorney-General. The reason Senator Macdonald did not want to raise it with me is obvious: he had no information. He has been caught out in a publicity stunt.

         The other issue Senator Macdonald raised was the resources of the ACS in the Torres Strait. Yes, it is true that there are seven officers. Of course, he did not mention the contract officers we employ under Coastwatch who operate in the Torres Strait and who add to the resources of Customs. That area is the main area of surveillance. It has been upgraded in the recent new contract for Coastwatch that the ACS has just let to a North Queensland helicopter company. I am sure Senator Macdonald would be very pleased to hear that we are employing a local company to provide specialised surveillance of the Torres Strait. That company has been very appreciative of the fact that the Australian Customs Service, through proper procedures, was able to give that contract to a North Queensland company.

         It is true, as I said in my answer, that I would never claim a 100 per cent ability to stop the illegal importation of drugs into Australia. With our coastline of over 20,000 kilometres, much of it uninhabited, it is extremely difficult to guarantee that. In conjunction with other authorities and other services, we make the best effort that we can to stop the illegal importation of drugs.

         We are quite open about our successes. I have mentioned the fact that last year, compared with the previous year, there were fewer seizures, which is one way of describing it. But in recent months we have had some spectacular seizures, including some in Queensland. I think Senator Macdonald should give credit to the officers of Customs and the Australian Federal Police for their success in making those seizures and in protecting our border from illegal drugs.

        I think my comments might be helpful to the government because there is a bit of a problem. I want to make sure that farmers get the full benefit of the government's intent because there are a few little slippages in terms of what was said.

         The issue is the application of the investment allowance to water conservation projects. I refer to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of 21 September in which he said that the government will provide incentives for farmers `to better protect the agricultural resource base during drought and encourage improved land management'. In particular, the government will consider providing a generous investment allowance for farm storage and water facilities.

         The difficulty is that the present income tax investment allowance remains in effect for units of property for which  contracts of acquisition were entered into or for which construction commenced prior to 1 July 1994, if those units are installed and ready for use prior to 1 July 1995. It applies expressly to a range of structural improvements, on land used for the purpose of carrying on a business of primary production, for the purpose of conserving water or such improvements for the purpose of conveying water. The section involved is 82AE(b)(iv) and (v).

         The purpose of my raising the matter in response to the minister's answer is that there is a problem with this provision and I think it has not been clearly understood. Section 82AM states that the investment allowance is not allowable for expenditure incurred in respect of a unit of property if a deduction is allowable under section 75B of the act. Section 75B covers all of the items listed in section 82AE(b)(iv) and (v), so it appears that either, firstly, the reference to section 75B in section 82AM is a drafting error and ought to be amended so that there is no doubt—and this is the point—that those farmers who invested in dams, wells or irrigation qualify for the investment allowance; or, secondly, the policy of the government is to deny the investment allowance for expenditure on conserving and conveying water.

         I do not believe this is the case, but it is certainly a matter that needs to be passed on to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) because I think the position as to these two alternatives needs to be clarified. I certainly hope that farmers will be able to get the full benefit of what I think was intended because there are certain restrictions in terms of the current wording of the Income Tax Assessment Act in relation to the investment allowance. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, who is at the table, to pass that information on to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister so that the farmers involved can get the full benefit, which I think was intended, arising from the problems with the drought, in terms of the availability of the investment allowance.

         I refer to your Committee's Interim Report on the provisions of the Evidence Bill 1993.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee's first recommendation was that
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         `matters noted [in the Report] be addressed by the government as soon as possible after appropriate consultation between the governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales.'
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government has acted on this recommendation. All the matters listed in the Committee's report have been examined by the Government in consultation with the New South Wales Government.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Government amendments will be moved to the Bill relating to some of the matters mentioned in the Report, and to some other matters. These amendments have been developed in consultation with New South Wales. The Attorney-General for New South Wales, the Hon John Hannaford MLC, has advised me that he has examined the proposed amendments.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Mr Hannaford referred to 2 specific matters in his letter: the commencement date and the test for legal professional privilege. Otherwise Mr Hannaford said that he has `no in-principle objection to these matters. However, I also note that my concurrence is subject to final Cabinet approval of the proposed amendments'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         An indicative list of the proposed amendments is attached.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In his letter, Mr Hannaford expressed a firm preference for the dominant purpose test for legal professional privilege. Mr Hannaford said `Although any divergence between the State and Commonwealth Bills would of course detract from the goal of uniformity, I am strongly of the view that a `dominant purpose' test would be more appropriate for New South Wales.'
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I believe strongly that the current sole purpose test is appropriate. Accordingly, this appears to be an area where complete uniformity is not possible.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee's second recommendation was that
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         `there be a period of at least six months between the passing of the Bill and its coming into operation to enable the legal community to familiarise itself with the Bill's provisions.'
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government believes that there should be a substantial period between passage of the Bill and its coming into force. It had originally hoped that the Bill would be passed in time for a period of 6 months to elapse before its commencement. However, the Government does not believe that the period before commencement need be as long as 6 months, especially since the Bill has been around for so long.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Nevertheless, the Government proposes to move an amendment to the Bill to substitute `18 April 1995' for `1 January 1995' in the commencement provision. This will provide for a 6 month period if the Bill can be considered by the Parliament promptly. This date has the advantages of providing an appropriate period after passage and of being after a break (Easter) in the sitting of the courts.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In relation to the commencement date, Mr Hannaford said
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         `Ideally, I would prefer a joint proclamation date for both Bills. Passage of the New South Wales Bill, however, is subject to the State Cabinet and Parliamentary processes and as such may not take place by the proposed date. In such circumstances, and bearing in mind the lengthy and extensive amount of preparation involved with this Bill, a separate Commonwealth commencement date of 18 April 1995 may become appropriate.'
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Mr Hannaford`s comment reflects the fact that it would not be possible to do more than table a NSW Bill before the NSW Parliament rises this year, and the NSW Parliament will no doubt not resume until some time after the NSW election on 25 May 1995.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee's third recommendation was that:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         `the legislation should be monitored after its enactment. This monitoring should be undertaken by a panel comprising representatives of relevant courts, legal practitioners and the Attorney-General's Department. The Committee will invite members of this monitoring panel to appear before the Committee in 1995 to report on any problems encountered following the implementation of the legislation.'
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and some courts have been consulted about the Committee's recommendation and the issue of monitoring.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government agrees with this recommendation in principle. Subject to consultation with the courts and the legal profession about their participation, the Government hopes to have the necessary arrangements relating to the proposed committee complete before the legislation comes into force.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government will also be coordinating monitoring arrangements with those in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.

         THIRD REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE FUNCTIONS, POWERS AND OPERATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I am writing to you to respond to the recommendations of the Third Report of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee made six recommendations which concern the nature of the Loan Council and the presentation of the financial information relevant to its operation. The key recommendations were directed towards accountability and disclosure of information. In recommendation Three it was proposed that the uniform reporting requirements established by Loan Council should include auditors' reports. Recommendation Five proposed that annual reports be presented to Parliaments including a consolidated, audited report by the Loan Council to the Commonwealth Parliament. In recommendation Six it was proposed that these arrangements should be made legally binding requirements on the Commonwealth and the State and Territory Governments by virtue of an amendment to the Financial Agreement.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As you would be aware, a significant reform of the Financial Agreement was formally concluded at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in February of this year. The signing of the new Financial Agreement was the culmination of a consultative process that took place over a number of years. The Financial Agreement Bill 1994 and the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994 which will give effect to this reform were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in June this year. The States and Territories have also been playing their part in bringing this work to fruition. Legislation has also been passed by Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory. In the other States complementary legislation to that passed by the Commonwealth Parliament has either received Cabinet consideration or has been introduced.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The revised Financial Agreement will give effect to Recommendation One of the Committee's recommendations which favoured the continuation of the Loan Council. The Commonwealth Government is of the view that there will continue to be a role for the Loan Council in the coordination and disclosure of financial matters for the foreseeable future.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In respect of the other key recommendations by the Senate Committee, I should say that the Commonwealth Government has no difficulty, in principle, with the idea that the Loan Council Allocation or the Statement of Financial Assets and Liabilities that the Commonwealth is to submit to the Loan Council should be open to ready scrutiny by the Auditor-General and the Parliament. The current powers of the Auditor-General provide scope for the Auditor-General to look at this area and the Loan Council Allocation has been reported to the Parliament in Budget Paper No 3 and, more recently, in the Final Budget Outcome 1993-94 document tabled in the Parliament at the start of the current sittings.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The basic thrust of the arrangements which have been developed by the Loan Council in recent years has been to emphasise the provision of comprehensive information about the public sector's need for funds to the public and to the financial markets. In the `Future Arrangements for Loan Council Monitoring and Reporting' adopted by the Loan Council on 5 July 1993 Loan Council noted that the Auditors-General of the various jurisdictions would fulfil their usual roles in relation to each jurisdiction's financial statements. That is, Auditors-General would continue, within their powers, to audit and report on the financial transactions of governments including, where relevant, those relating to a jurisdiction's Loan Council Allocation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While the Government is open to proposals which will materially improve the public presentation of the Commonwealth's financial affairs it must be noted that the Committee's recommendations go beyond the Commonwealth's jurisdiction and deal with matters which are within the responsibilities of the State and Territory Governments. In particular, Recommendation Six envisages that the States and the Territories would be prepared to have reports on their affairs audited and tabled for review by the Commonwealth Parliament.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is necessary to appreciate that the Loan Council is not an institution that is under the control of the Commonwealth Government but is comprised of representatives of sovereign Governments who are accountable to their individual State or Territory Parliaments. By its nature, the Loan Council is a cooperative institution in which durable agreements can only be achieved on a voluntary basis when there is perceived to be a common interest. Voluntary and informal arrangements have been a significant feature, and probably the major feature, of the Loan Council's operations throughout its existence. In these circumstances, the views of the State and Territory Governments are central to the Senate Committee's proposals. It is not possible or, indeed, appropriate for the Commonwealth Government to respond to the Committee's recommendations insofar as they relate to the affairs of the States and Territories.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I am not aware that there has been any response made to the Senate Committee's report by State or Territory Ministers although I note that the Premiers and Chief Ministers of the States and Territories signed the revised Financial Agreement together with the Commonwealth at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in Hobart on 25 February 1994 in the knowledge of the Committee's recommendations for further changes to the Agreement. The recommendations in the Committee's third report have been drawn to the attention of State and Territory officials. The responses received at official level indicated that there may not be a consensus amongst the States and Territories in favour of their implementation. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth proposes to keep under notice the recommendations of the Committee that involve the responsibilities of the States and Territories with a view to their being an input to the discussion when relevant issues are discussed in the context of the Loan Council.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The foregoing comments have concentrated on the major elements of the Committee's recommendations as they affect the nature and operations of the Loan Council as a cooperative Commonwealth/State body. I should also respond to other matters which the Senate Committee has raised in its report.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In Recommendation Four the Committee proposed that all authorities which could generate public sector debt that is subject to Loan Council review be advised of the reporting requirements with which they must comply. The Commonwealth Government fully endorses this recommendation which is already encompassed by the process for formulating the Commonwealth's LCA nomination in the lead up to the annual Loan Council meeting and the subsequent reporting of outcomes. Under this process Commonwealth departments, agencies and statutory authorities are notified of the information requirements under the new Loan Council arrangements. The States and Territories are responsible for advising their Departments and authorities of Loan Council reporting requirements.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In Recommendation Two the Senate Committee proposed that the State and Commonwealth Governments adopt accrual accounting as a matter of priority for the purpose of reporting all government financial transactions, including Loan Council disclosures. As a practical matter, the Loan Council could only move to an accrual system when all member jurisdictions had done so on a consistent basis. The implications of accrual accounting for Loan Council matters will need to be explored as jurisdictions become familiar with its general use for government operations and in the light of the objectives of Loan Council reporting. However, the Committee's recommendation goes considerably beyond the application of accrual accounting to Loan Council reporting and it would clearly not be appropriate, in the Government's view, for Loan Council matters to drive the broader issues which bear on the implementation of accrual accounting.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In relation to the broader issues, the Government announced several years ago that Commonwealth Departments and agencies were moving progressively to preparing their financial reports on an accruals basis. It is currently expected that all agencies will be able to report on an accruals basis for 1994-95. I understand that the States and Territories have also given considerable attention to the adoption of accrual accounting. The timing of their adoption of accrual accounting is a matter for the States and Territories to consider in the light of their own priorities.

         —The Senate is debating the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994. This is the government's long awaited response to assist rural families in drought afflicted areas, many of whom have lived on negative or very low incomes for up to four years. The drought relief payment will provide eligible families in certified extreme drought areas with income assistance equivalent to the jobsearch allowance, partner allowance and family payment.

         This bill amends the Farm Household Support Act so that its objectives include `to provide financial assistance to farmers who are experiencing difficulty in meeting living expenses and who are in exceptional circumstances due to extreme drought'. In order to be qualified to receive the drought relief payment, a farmer must have a drought exceptional circumstances certificate issued by the state RAS authority. Importantly, farmers on farm household support may transfer to the drought relief payment, which has the advantage of not being repayable in the future. Drought relief payments are inalienable grants.

         Farm related assets, farmers' life insurance and superannuation are all disregarded in calculating the value of the farmer's assets in assessing eligibility for the drought relief payment. The JSA income test will apply. A farmer does not have to put his property on the market to qualify; nor does he have to have a letter from the bank saying that he has been refused commercial finance—a Stalinist tactic tried unsuccessfully with the farm household support payment.

         Drought is a national issue and a national problem. The Senate cannot do its job and review the government's performance in combating drought unless this information is brought to its attention. There are many parts to the drought problem. This bill tackles the poverty aspect of many families whose stories have been so well highlighted in the media. It is true to say that the Australian people, by their generous response, have led the government to recognise the serious nature of the drought and its effect on Australian families in the bush.

But because of the courage of a few, many thousands will benefit. Their actions have been very much a public service.

         This legislation is expected to lead to expenditure on the drought relief payments of $43.45 million in the current year and $19.31 million in 1995-96, with an additional $4.36 million this year in family payments and $1.93 million next year. Much of the drought package and the coalition response is already on the public record. I would like to reiterate that, as far as providing a living allowance for families stung by years of low and negative incomes is concerned, this bill will be most welcome.

         Rural families have not had the same access to income support as have families in the city areas with access to JSA, for example. The farm household support was essentially a  loan and was therefore most unpopular. It was extremely difficult to be eligible for the JSA, so there was virtually no way for these cash-starved families to support themselves while their stock and crops failed season after season. The mushrooming of drought funds committees and the networks of charities and organisations—including the international aid organisation Care Australia—demonstrates not only the generosity of Australians but also the large hole that needed to be filled and should have been filled by government long before this.

         Even so, winning cabinet support for this legislation was a singular achievement for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, as he faced a cabinet used to imposing fees, charges and taxes on the rural sector rather than implementing incentives. The government's promise of tax incentives for farm storage and water facilities, and further initiatives in the areas of taxation and income equalisation deposits, will simply return to farmers some of what the Labor government has taken off them in the past.

         We must keep this drought package in perspective. This is not government charity or even generosity; it is merely paying an instalment on what this country owes rural Australia. So this bill is good so far as it goes. It serves to redress some of the imbalance between the income support available to urban families and the income support available to rural families. This bill does something. Queensland has issued some 3,000 claim forms to date, according to a Social Security spokesman yesterday.

         The Queensland state government has instituted a small business drought assistance scheme to help locally owned small businesses affected by the drought. Businesses may be eligible for interest subsidies of up to $5,000 a year on new or existing commercial loans for up to two years. They must demonstrate that their need for assistance is related to the impact of drought, that they would be considered viable in normal conditions and have long-term prospects of profitability. To businesses on their knees, this is not much of a lifeline. It would be far more effective if backed up by federal support which matched the state effort dollar for dollar.

         If we have learned anything from this drought, it is that long-term drought is a national problem affecting the health of a variety of communities, not just farming. A host of other economic performance indicators are affected—indicators such as employment, capital investment, savings, inflation and, most importantly, exports and trade. One cannot tackle a long-term drought by just focusing on income support payments for farmers. A holistic support approach is needed to prevent wholesale damage. And that means including structural assistance for agricultural and other small businesses in drought affected areas.

         It would be a repeat of the shameful failure of the wool rescue package if RAS eligibility criteria were not changed to reflect the fact that it is survival stakes out there—and those in a position to consider productivity improvements are in a luxurious position compared with farmers facing their fifth year of drought. The minister has given a commitment to review the eligibility criteria, but what every farmer wants to know is when will it happen. I personally asked the minister a question about that last week and he said that he was doing it now. I would like to know when is `now'.

         I mentioned the wool rescue package because it is a salient example of how a well-meaning package can go terribly wrong if there is a hitch in delivery due to overly restrictive eligibility criteria. Aimed at 5,790 growers, the wool package was received by only 1,960. Only $15 million out of the allocated $42.2 million for wool exceptional circumstances got to the farm gate. Farmers could not meet the conditions—not because they were too well off—and that meant that far too many efficient growers were left with nothing to get them through. The performance to date of RAS drought exceptional circumstances does not lead to optimism about the future.

Yet we are told there are 12,000 to 15,000 farming families in dire straits due to this drought. The criteria are too restrictive. Removing some off-farm assets and raising the RAS cap does very little to get RAS to the many farmers with no off-farm assets and unable to get RAS so far. Unless the situation is addressed, the drought package will not go very far towards keeping devastated rural Australians going as a sustainable economic unit.

         With the drought looking as though it may stretch out until autumn next year, the pressure on Australia's family farmers is greater than it ever has been. It is inevitable that by the time the rains finally come—and we all hope that is sooner rather than later—a large number of farming families will have been forced to leave the land and forced to leave farming operations which may have been in the same family for four or five generations. These properties will be bought up at rock-bottom prices, and the expertise and character that farm families have provided to the Australian bush for so many years will be lost forever, as will their contribution to the social and economic framework of regional Australia.

Drought is obviously the most striking of these, but high interest rates, low commodity prices and the gradual decline of country towns and services are still inflicting a heavy burden on farm families.

One man who has now retired on his farm in central Queensland said to one of my staff that some of his 10 children and 28 grandchildren are farmers. While he is very worried about them and has much to offer, he is scared to help them out in any way for fear of losing his pension.

         Others are younger families who have done as much as they could to prepare for the droughts that inevitably occur in this country but have found that their preparations were not enough for this latest extended drought. Ironically, it is some of these farmers who have made preparations that have found the financial preparations they have made for drought are the very factors that to date have precluded them from any government assistance. A number have complained that the only way they can get any assistance from the government is through interest rate subsidies under RAS, which means they would have to rack up more and more debt in order to get the subsidy—a crazy, circular, unending trail of debt and more debt. The effects of rural debt then are just as crippling as drought for these particular families.

         So let us look at what the government is doing for farmers. Today we are considering the drought relief payment, and again I say that the Democrats welcome the introduction of this new payment. The drought relief payment will be available to those families whose incomes have been affected by extreme drought for 24 of the past 36 months. It will be subject to an income and off-farm assets test and will be paid at a rate equivalent to the jobsearch allowance. Partner allowance and family allowance will also be paid where these are appropriate. Importantly, these payments will be made without any activity testing.

         Farm assets, life insurance and superannuation will not be included in the assets test for the drought relief payment.

I am not so sure about that.

         In some cases, farm assets are already exempted from the assets test—such as under the farm household support scheme—just as they are for some payments made under the assistance for isolated children's scheme. Perhaps it is not so much a revolutionary change on the part of the Labor Party, but a limited and begrudging acceptance of the fact that the assets test harshly discriminates against all farmers and has done so for many years. It seems to me that the Labor Party has assessed that the electoral cost to it of maintaining the inequity is minimal, except in this particular case.

         I believe the intense media attention in this case—the media has done a service; let us compliment them, because sometimes we are very critical of them—has been instrumental in bringing the real plight of farmers to all Australians. Because of the attention that has been focused on the assets test and its affect on drought-stricken farmers, the government has made this concession. Of course, the government was fully aware that, without this concession, no farm family would have qualified for the new payment.

         If either the government or the opposition had listened to what we said for years when we tried to ease the assets test for farmers, some of the suffering that farm families have had to endure throughout this drought might already have been alleviated. Thousands of farmers throughout the country have had negative incomes for a number of years due to low commodity prices, high interest rates and other factors, including fire, flood and mouse plagues. Despite those negative incomes, those farmers have been unable to access the most basic social security or student assistance payment. Many of those farmers will still not gain anything from this package. I believe farmers need to be given the same assistance that all other Australians have available to them.

         The Democrats are pleased to see farm assets exempted from the assets test on the drought relief payment. We urge the government and opposition to consider extending this principle to all other social security and student assistance payments. Overall, the Democrats welcome the introduction of the drought relief payment, just as we welcome the additional funding that is to be provided for RAS and rural counselling services. The drought package addresses the most desperate, short-term issues being faced by Australian farm families. It is not, however, a cure-all for our primary producers, and I hope it does not mean that people will lose interest in the plight of farm families.

         For the farmers who have lasted this long and are still on the land, it will take many years to return to a position of profitability—when herds can be re-stocked, run-down machinery can at last be replaced, more time and resources can be devoted to landcare issues and they can once again afford to send their children to college. Australia needs to stand by its farmers now and will need to do so for many years to come.

         I know that the drought in the eastern states is the worst drought—by any stretch of our imagination—since 1982. In Western Australia, we have not had a bad drought since 1983. I have had the experience of going through a drought. I am not talking as someone who watches from a distance. In Western Australia, I went through the bad droughts of 1969, 1976 and 1977—two years in a row—and, of course, 1983. Even though Western Australia has had a reasonably good season, I feel for the farmers who are in that situation.

         I am also pleased that the government has attempted to help farmers by way of social security measures rather than any other way. I believe that is the fairest and most basic way to help people. I believe it is a person's basic right to at least have food on the table, whether living in a country town or the city. Even a bankrupt person who might have been bankrupted by his own stupidity should have food on the table. It is the same for someone who loses a job—and jobs have been lost by stupidity. A person who loses a job through stupidity still has the basic right to have food on the table. The responsibility to provide basic needs for farmers—no matter where they may live—probably falls on the rest of the people of Australia who are doing better.

Outside a farmer's own plight on the farm, if he or she has children going through the education system who are not receiving Austudy, one of the worst things that can happen—on top of the drought—is if his or her children have to break their education. I have quoted figures in this place on the drop-out rate for children receiving an education—when they take 12 months off or have a break during their course. Those figures are fairly high, although I do not know what they are at the moment.

         I commend the government for taking away the assets test on farmers affected by the drought and for allowing farmers to meet the other criteria for 24 out of the previous 36 months. I believe that that is one of the most important measures, alongside having basic commodities. I also commend the government for putting in the flexibility for farmers if they have been affected by drought for 24 out of the past 36 months.

         I know it is very tough when farmers fall over one side of the line and qualify for assistance and then fall over the other side of the line. The government has to look at extreme cases like that. In the 1980s, with the devastating 1983 drought, the Western Australian government looked at its system. It used to declare droughts by shires and split shires. The bigger shires acted further on the recommendation of the local shires saying that a drought could be declared in a pocket within a shire without that area even including half the shire. I believe that system worked very well, and I think we could look at that situation in extreme, isolated cases.

         It is not only lack of rain that at times creates drought. I know that Peter Walsh laughed when he was asked for drought aid because it had rained too much. It may seem stupid on the face of it, but those sorts of things, including frosts, can wipe people out. Of course, one can be insured for thunderstorms and hail, but not for a lot of the other things that I have mentioned.

         I also commend the government's move to pay social security rather than the farm supplement six months after a drought is declared finished. I welcome that. Because there is a big rain one day, people do not have an income the next. I remember the eastern states drought of 1982 breaking in March 1983. In fact, it broke very soon after Ron Barassi gave a pep talk at a bull sale in northern New South Wales. He said, `Have confidence and buy some of these bulls. The rains will come.' The rains did come within a few days, and Ron Barassi has claimed that fame forever and a day. The rains did come the next day, but it would have taken at least six months, and more in the case of a wheat crop—if there were a drought in March, it would certainly be November or December before it was over—before people's incomes started again. I commend the government for building in that flexibility.

We are on a limited speaking time of about six to eight minutes each. What I want to do, though, is emphasise two points that illustrate the shortcomings of this government and the neglect it has shown of Australian rural industries. Those two points are quite simple: first, the delay in recognising that we had a drought of enormous magnitude upon a large part of Queensland and New South Wales; and, secondly, when at last the government responded and reacted to that drought, the administrative systems that it put in place were either inefficient or non-existent. It is only now, three weeks after the announcement was made, that there might be something in place to deliver the measures that were promised by the Prime Minister.

They are just three things that have made life very difficult. They have diminished the profitability of rural producers in Australia and, in so doing, have limited their ability to provide for themselves.

We will have spent $25,000 million more that we earned. That has to be paid for by our exports. So, by any standards, there is a need to cosset and to look after our rural industries.

I was told by the rural adjustment scheme office in Brisbane that it had had more than 800 calls a day about this scheme and that staff simply could not cope. I was told that when the staff phoned around the country areas, Department of Social Security officers said they were being besieged by inquiries from farmers and applicants for assistance but that they did not have the information to provide to them.

When we get a drought of the magnitude of four or five years, such as the one we are facing now, is very difficult to cope in terms of water storage, fodder storage and so on. It does have a major effect.

         Basically, that package dealt with the three prongs of immediate relief. The first area related to welfare. The government's response of the drought family payment and the removal of the assets test from Austudy certainly goes a very large way to meeting the principles enunciated under immediate relief. The second area that John Anderson talked about was the retention of the breeding herd, and that is something that remains largely unattended by this package. The third aspect that he talked about was reconstruction. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said that later on, perhaps in November, the government will bring down a broader approach to taxation in dealing with severe drought in the future.

         Two months ago, the Prime Minister was in Queensland. He said, `Droughts are natural.' Droughts are natural, but severe droughts are not. Some weeks ago, the government was moved to act because of the widespread publicity and the charity concert held by media celebrities. I noticed that Senator Collins just yesterday, in answer to a question from me, said, `Those areas that are not in exceptional circumstances can look to getting some help from the farmhand appeal.' I am very thankful that the farmhand appeal has been operating; I believe that it has brought city and country closer together.

The drought will go on for an awful lot longer than the money available under farmhand will last. The reason the Prime Minister acted was that he could see that the drought was electorally damaging. He sort of discovered the drought. The media fell upon his visit in a frenzy. The day after the package was announced, I read an article by Asa Wahlquist in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        I think she has gone a little overboard there, especially when we consider that the previous response from the government had been so pitiful—$14 million in extra RAS funding—and especially compared with the Prime Minister's instant response of $150 million for the Cahill Expressway, and the multimillions of dollars that were pushed in the way of the waterside workers to get them back to work recently and to get ANL to be a saleable proposition. But I do not wish to proceed further with that.

         I just want to make a couple of brief points about the ongoing problems. The first concerns the feed grain situation. It was reported earlier this week that there was a three-week supply of feed grain available in the eastern states. The minister said that he has ABARE working to complete a national grain audit. I am pleased that the minister has said that, despite the pessimistic forecasts, the government expects that in aggregate there will be enough grain to meet domestic food and feed requirements.

         There will have to be movements of grain around Australia and the importation of feed grain and specialist grain, such as high quality durum wheat, that is required for pasta production. Even if the minister is correct and there will be enough feed grain available, there is a feed crisis, as there is a cash crisis to pay for the feed. The intensive livestock industry is particularly affected. Piggeries are closing. Poultry industries, especially those in areas situated away from the coast and unable to access imported grain because of the necessary AQIS protocols, and the feedlot and grazing industries are all affected by the unavailability of grain.

         I know the minister has approved the importation 120,000 tonnes of sorghum and 10,000 tonnes of maize. That is to be applauded. We, as a nation, are not set up to import large amounts of grain—we just do not have those sorts of ports—so it is a whole new crisis for us to face. Just to put it in perspective, New South Wales normally has a winter cereal crop of about 5 1/2 million tonnes—and half a million tonnes are expected this season. In Queensland, the normal crop is about 3 1/2 million tonnes. Again, there may be half a million tonnes produced. New South Wales normally produces about 500,000 tonnes of sorghum, half of it on the Liverpool Plains, an area from which I come. The shortfall for feed grain in New South Wales will be three million tonnes; and if the sorghum crop fails, it will be five million tonnes.

         The price of feed grain has nearly doubled in the last two months. Wheat has gone from $160 a tonne to $230 a tonne and maize has gone from around $180 a tonne to $300 a tonne. Hay and baled sorghum stubble are virtually unprocurable. The inflationary and trade impacts of this crisis are very hard to quantify. Food prices are already going up. The prices of wheat, cereals, fruit and vegetables are already going up. The CPI will certainly be affected by this drought. The price of chicken, pork and eggs is going up. It will damage the worst balance of payments figure but one, that being in January 1990. The August balance of payments current account deficit was $2.1 billion, which will require higher government borrowings—and can only flow on to higher inflation,.

         ABARE suggests that rural exports will decline by nearly six per cent in 1994-95. That will amount to around a $3 billion loss for farmers. The blow-out in the current account will certainly have an effect on interest rates. It must be remembered that, for every one per cent rise in interest rates, debt repayments for farmers will increase by about $150 million a year. It is worth saying that, if the government will not cut its spending, everybody in the country must cut their spending, because the fact of interest rates going up means that farmers, mortgagors and everyone else who owes money will have more money to pay back.

New South Wales farmers are calling for a summit; the coalition is calling in addition for a fodder subsidy. That would certainly be part and parcel of a discussion on the feed audit. I ask the government to look again at the possibility of a fodder subsidy. The minister indicated that in 1982-83 it was rorted. He has given no evidence of former convictions. He also said it caused a blow-out in the price of grain. I can tell senators that the price of grain has gone up very substantially this time, without any sort of a feed subsidy.

         I would like to make a point about the inclusion last week of the six areas initially said to be in exceptional circumstances in New South Wales. Over the last 36 months, these areas have been in drought for a considerable time: Dubbo, 16 months; Grafton, 17 months; Merriwa, 23 months; Mudgee, 19 months; Nyngan 19 months; and Scone, 17 months. Mr Harry Woods, who heads the rural task force for the government, naively suggested that the farmers in these areas who did not at this stage qualify under exceptional circumstances should rely on charity from farmhand. Whilst I applaud farmhand and all that it has done, it is a very sad day for Australia when our farmers are reduced to receiving handouts from the Salvos or the Smith Family. I do however applaud the city for identifying with this country problem.

         Like Senator Panizza, I am an optimist. People on the land have to be. So I would like to finish on a slightly optimistic note and say that it looks as though when this drought breaks, as it surely will, prices for grain, wool and beef will be strong for a couple of years. But high prices are good for farmers only if they have something to sell. Prices can go up 300 per cent, but that will not benefit farm families in the broad because they have been so weakened by this drought. At the end of the day, I have to agree with an editorial in

         We also need to keep in mind the parlous economic state of the agricultural sector prior to the drought which was the direct result of anti-rural government policies. I think most of them can be attributed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer or since he has been the Prime Minister. Those policies include increased primary industry charges, fuel excise increases, wholesale sales tax increases, investment allowance removals and the removal just recently of the exceptional circumstances provisions for wool growers.

         The government reneged on its election promise to remove the assets test for farm families to receive Austudy. It imposed and extended the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax and basically imposed de facto death duties on rural communities. The government also gutted the IED scheme, removed the wool floor price scheme and gave us high interest rates that especially hurt the farmers. The result of that was that farm borrowings moved from about $5 billion up to $17-odd billion, and today's farm indebtedness is now $17.3 billion. I think it went from $5 billion to $16 billion in the five years prior to 1993.

Along with all the things I have mentioned, the farming community had adverse terms of trade throughout the 1980s.

It shows the priorities of this government that at the same time that he is doing that for all of those drought stricken farmers in absolutely tragic situations, he is offering the New South Wales government the same amount—$150 million—to pull down a perfectly good, working highway, the Cahill Expressway, because he does not like the look of it and he thinks that tourists coming to the Sydney Olympics will not like the look of it. It works; it is there; and he has offered $150 million, the same amount that he is offering for drought, to the New South Wales government to pull it down, to get rid of it.

         Madam Acting Deputy President, I suppose you know the joke that is going around the bush. It is, regrettably, a wry sort of joke. It goes like this: what is the difference between the drought and the Cahill Expressway? The answer is: Mr Keating cannot see the drought from Kirribilli House. It is all too tragically true. This package that is before us is welcome. It is good to see that something is being done.

         We will await what the government proposes to do to try to drought-proof Australia—the long-term rebuilding and infrastructure. I hope that Mr Keating will again follow the lead set by the opposition, as he has done in this drought package, by looking at some major infrastructure projects for the future that might lessen the effect of drought in the future. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will recall that the Leader of the Opposition, Alexander Downer, in his major directional statement

         did indicate that the coalition would be setting aside a portion of the proceeds of the privatisation of government assets to reinvest in major infrastructure projects.

We remember the Fairbairn Dam, the Ord River—a series of other dams back in those days when it seemed to be a proper thing to have infrastructure and dams. It seems to be politically incorrect now to have dams and infrastructure in inland Australia. I do not know why this government does not give some thought to getting involved in major dam work again. Since the Liberal government went out of power we really have not seen the construction of any dams.

I have been mentioning this for a couple of months now, but the government just does not seem to have heard. I am very pleased that the shadow cabinet is looking at it. I pay tribute to the shadow minister for small business, Mrs Judy Moylan, who has been very active in raising this matter in coalition areas. She has made a very good point that I support, and have supported for a number of months now.

         Farmers have had real difficulties, and fortunately they are getting some assistance now, but small business has been completely ignored by this government. I have raised this matter a number of times in press releases and otherwise, and I have given examples of where small business people in drought affected communities have been forced out of business. The executive director of the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association, Mr Ian Baldock, has supported the things that I have been saying. He has given an example of what has happened in the Toowoomba area. That is an area that has been badly affected by drought, and five businesses have been forced to close due to the drought conditions.

They know that the farmers have no money.

         —I am delighted and proud to be associated with the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994 because what this package does is recognise very clearly and very carefully that there are droughts and there are droughts. There are droughts which it is impossible for the average, normal, good farmer to anticipate and prepare for. This package is going to provide a safety net for those people who have experienced four years of drought in some areas. Farmers on the Darling Downs have lost eight crops and have had no income for four years. It costs between $50,000 and $60,000 just to put in a crop. Those farmers may as well have stood there and burnt eight cheques for $50,000 or $60,000. Half a million dollars has been lost by farmers in trying to get a crop, but the rain has not come at the right time.

         This package is designed to help those people to live through the rest of the time that this drought is with us. It is designed not to stop on the day when the rains come; there is a period of six months before it will be reviewed. This is a very good part of the bill because it recognises very clearly that, when the rain comes, the cashflow does not start. Those who have wool will have to wait until the normal shearing time, which could be six to 12 months away. Those who have crops have to wait until the crop has been sown and harvested. It will give farmers a buffer of extra time after the drought has finished and allow them to continue with an income and not be faced with the situation where they are totally bereft of income.

         This package is estimated to cost $164 million over two years. Anyone who says that that is not a significant amount of money does not live in the real world. Senator Ian Macdonald was speaking today about the plight of small business. This package will help the small businessman as well because it will guarantee the farmers an income with which they can buy commodities from the shops in the towns. It will provide at least some of those shops and businesses in the community with income as that money is spent on food and essentials that the farmers have to buy. Those opposite keep forgetting that point. They seem to forget that the farmers will actually spend that money and that the recipients of that money will be those small businesses which are very dependent upon those farmers buying goods and commodities in their towns. So it will have an effect.

Those opposite need to look at what their recently outlined policy would do. It was formed without any cooperation or consultation with the industries. I believe there are two versions of the policy enunciated by Minister Anderson in both of which, New South Wales, which I represent, would have been significantly worse off. In the first formulation, that of two consecutive years of drought, only one New South Wales rural lands protection board would have qualified. Under the second proposal, that of three years of drought in five, six districts would have qualified. That is the proposal of those opposite who are saying that we are not doing enough.

         There are something like 15 lands protection boards included in our proposal, but ours is not enough; theirs obviously must be better. In my state, depending on which criteria we want to look at, either one board or six boards would be eligible; but our proposal is not good enough. Their  proposal would provide less assistance than ours; but that is not the way they choose to look at it. They just want to continue with their opposition mentality of saying, `Oh, dear. This is not very good. Mine's better than yours. You can't do that. This is what is wrong with it.' This is the sort of thing that we have to put up with all the time from this opposition. It is opposition for the sake of opposition, and that does nothing for the farmers or for this country. Our approach has been to say that those people who have been affected by drought for 24 out of 36 drought declared months will attract support from this package.

         —But even prior to that, Senator Ferguson's party, which has been the predominant government in that state, had never done anything about defining drought.

         The list that has now been approved of those who qualify as being in exceptional circumstances is not set in concrete. As time passes, if there is no rain—and please, God, let it rain today or tomorrow—and more areas become affected and qualify for the 24 months out of 36 category, they will have to be considered and placed on the list. It is very important for people to realise this. The other thing that people need to realise is the amount of money people are getting, which is related to the jobsearch allowance.

         All in all, this is an excellent package. This is a package that, once the drought is over, can stay on the statute book because this is the legislation that can be the guide long into the future for farmers, states, federal governments—everyone. They will be able to say, `This is how it should work.' This package gives farmers an idea of the length of time that they have to be self-sufficient—and it is a reasonable length of time. I have not had any farming organisation tell me that it is not. It also lets them know that, at the end of that time, they will not be cast out or forgotten and will be given assistance. That is very important. That is what this bill is about. As the Prime Minister said after the election, we will extend our hand to help up those who are unemployed. This package is us extending our hand to help those who are suffering severe drought.

         We heard Senator West say why that will not be the case. We also know that they will receive some benefit from the farmhand appeal. We have heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and Senator West talk about the $5.6 million that this government is contributing on a dollar for dollar basis matching the money raised in the farmhand appeal. When we really think of $5.6 million, we realise that it is about half of what we would pay for a good house in Sydney these days. That money has to cover all of the people in dire need and in dire straits throughout the rural areas of Australia who will not receive benefits from this drought assistance package.

         Senator West also said that one cannot prepare oneself for the type of drought we have at present. If the right incentives were provided through a properly constructed IED scheme where people could put away money for bad times such as this, they could work. Of all the various industries throughout the country, the one industry that likes least to look for any sort of handout is the tradition of the farming industry. For over a century now the farming industry has worked the land and, in many cases, has been able to put up with many hardships that people living in metropolitan areas would not put up with, although I am pleased to say that some of those hardships have been alleviated through modern technology. Farmers are prepared to live on very low incomes. They are prepared to go through very hard times and not look for a handout because there has never been a handout mentality throughout rural communities.

         While this bill addresses the immediate problems of some farmers, we need to remember that in most rural areas throughout Australia it is not just farmers who are suffering. Senator West referred to how this scheme will help inject money into the small businesses throughout Australia. If one took the time to travel through those areas, one would realise that it would take more than drought relief payments to get many of the small businesses in rural communities back on to a profitable basis again.

She may remember that 12 1/2 years ago a coalition government set aside something like $356 million at a time of drought—in 1982 dollars. So I would not brag about the amount brought forward in this package being an enormous amount of money to help farmers in 1994 dollars.

         Only two weeks ago I spent some time in the worst drought affected parts of South Australia; that is, the west coast and the Eyre Peninsula. My colleague the honourable member for Grey, Barry Wakelin, is a farmer in this area and he understands the problems. He has done a tremendous job in trying to do what he can for the people in the electorate of Grey. Having been through drought himself, he understands the problems. The honourable member for Grey certainly has done everything in his power to make sure that people in the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia receive any possible help.

         During that trip I was able to see in some of the smaller rural centres the extent of the run-down of the communities. It is not just businesses that get run down; it is total community structures. Once the community structure is destroyed through poor economic times and hardship, it never recovers. I have yet to see a small town survive which has lost its businesses, its doctor, its hospital or any major business like a machinery firm. The other day I went through the town of Wudinna where there were beautiful, almost new empty buildings which will never be used for the purposes for which they were built. In one case a machinery firm built a large building. The community is now trying to use all of these buildings for something else—in this case the development of a telecentre—to try to introduce some new skills for the people in the area so they will not be totally reliant on primary production in the future for their incomes.

         I could take the Prime Minister to a lot of other places that are suffering just as badly as some of the places that he has been to in northern New South Wales. Some of these places have been suffering for a variety of reasons. One area that has suffered tremendous hardship got a small amount of rain and then only three days later had a severe frost which wiped out any existing crops—unusual weather circumstances, and not the sort of weather that they normally expect. So there are lots of other things besides severe drought that can impact on people's incomes in rural areas. It is fair to say that the government has been very slow to recognise the needs of farmers in particular who have suffered over a long period of time now. By the time this package reaches those people who are suffering, they will be nearly at the end of their tether.

         As well as help for farmers, some consideration needs to be given to providing the right incentives so that when the drought breaks and farmers become more viable there is some mechanism to encourage farmers and primary producers. Maybe such a mechanism should not necessarily be restricted to farmers and primary producers. Business people could do the same thing—prepare for such terrible times as they are having now by putting aside some money via a revamped IED scheme or something along those lines. They would rather have a mechanism where they could provide for their own future than come cap in hand to governments when things get really tough.

         Lest anybody be under any misapprehension about how bad things are, I would like to convey something of what I have seen. I spent the greater part of last week travelling by road around some of the worst affected areas in central and northern Queensland. There were places I visited where I could not tell the road from the paddock because there was not a blade of grass. The paddocks were like crushed gravel—sad, tragic places where tough, resilient people eke out whatever they could to survive while they wait for the drought to break.

         One of the concerns echoed many times was that, while there was something in this package for farmers, there was nothing in the package that was seen to be of help to the working man on the property. That is a grave concern. The number of properties that used to have three or four people working on them and now have none is huge. And we must remember that, on the whole, every one of those working men represents a family which is now without income. While I know that those people are eligible for jobsearch allowance, they have a particular difficulty because, in most cases, working men on properties receive not just an income but accommodation and often a bit of tucker as well. So their families not only lose an income, they also lose accommodation and they may lose some tucker.

         If the drought continues, the government must consider making available the money that it would otherwise have to pay in jobsearch allowance to farmers so that they can keep working men on the property. This will prevent families having to move out of on-farm accommodation and into the cities, which in most cases will mean their having to move to coastal areas. That is certainly something we need to avoid and the government must consider this aspect if this drought continues.

         I am also concerned about the effect of debt. The climatic conditions are terrible. The resilience of the cattlemen, the woolgrowers, the grain growers and all those people out there making a living from primary industry is incredible. But debt could still sink our primary industry sector unless something is done to tackle the problem. That is why I believe that it is absolutely critical and a matter of utmost urgency that the government, the banks, small business organisations and the farming representative bodies get together for a debt summit to give some consideration to debt restructuring. This is not just for farmers but also for the small business sector because incomes are drying up there as well.

Our small sales of wire and chemicals are not being paid for because we are having to carry people. But at the same time we have outgoings every single week.'

         Unless we can come up with some creative ways of dealing with debt, it will be not only farmers who lose out.

As a consequence of that, the public purse will lose out.

         I think it is critical that the government gives some incentive so that banks which want to make a partial write-down of debt can do so. Banks should be able to look at their loan portfolio and form the view that 20 per cent of their loans would be more viable if they wrote them down—10, 15, 20 per cent or whatever—and got the farmers or the small business people in a situation where they were viable and could continue after the drought.

         We may well find that when interest rate subsidies go, the level of drought induced indebtedness is such that those businesses just will not survive, even with the best will in the world. That is why I believe a debt summit is absolutely critical; it is the way forward in this community and in this country. I am not saying that banks have an obligation to write off loans willy-nilly, but there is a lot that can be done if banks, government, small business organisations and farm bodies get together and look at the problem. I believe that unless the government calls a debt summit then a crucial part of the equation is missing and this nation as a whole will suffer.

         I am also concerned that something is done to ensure that precipitous action is not taken against farmers whilst they are in the drought. I draw the government's attention to part 11A of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides a mechanism by which the relevant minister can effectively create a stay of execution of proceedings against farmers who are in particularly bad circumstances. I think it would be appropriate if the government gave some consideration to invoking the provisions of part 11A of the Bankruptcy Act to at least provide protection for people who are on exceptional circumstances rural adjustment. That would enable them to not worry about those extra debts—the ones not covered by any interest subsidy they receive—until such time as they start to come out of drought.

         With a list of people who are drought affected and in exceptional circumstances, it makes it very easy for the relevant minister to comply with all the requirements under part 11A of the Bankruptcy Act and to give these people not a release from their debt but just a breathing space to get them up on their feet again. I am sure that these are the sorts of people who would bend over backwards, do anything and work any hours to ensure that they can repay the debts they owe. The people we are talking about who are out there struggling and scraping are the people who could have walked away a long time ago. They are there not just because they want to survive but because they have a very real intention of paying every cent they owe and doing whatever they can to look after their farms and their communities and make sure that nobody suffers as a result of the suffering which they have to endure.

         My final point is in relation to provisional tax. My concern is that when farmers come out of drought and get their first income, they will be hit not only with tax but also with provisional tax. At high marginal rates of taxation they could be looking at provisional and income tax bills that could effectively be as high as 80 cents in the dollar, which would wipe out any ability those people had to repay their debts or even pay the interest due as interest subsidies were withdrawn.

         Therefore, when the drought ends the government has an obligation to look at provisional tax with a view to releasing people from provisional tax in that first year after drought. These are all real issues that the government can address, that are not going to cost the government an enormous amount of money and that would be of immense value. I believe they ought to be adopted.

         —I am not surprised that the government's drought package amounted to $160 million, which is significant and substantial. There was criticism of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he made comments about drought being part of the landscape, comments which were taken out of all context. This package shows he is concerned, as is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and as was Mr Crean before him, all of whom have made visits to drought-affected areas.

         The background is that we are a caring society. We do look after people in many walks of life. People in the farming community are entitled to that sort of care, help and support. I guess people look at drought and say that drought is drought, but it is not. Drought can mean arid conditions, a lack of water. But severe drought is another matter. It is a condition which creates circumstances where suicides occur, where people lose properties that have been in the family for some generations.

         I always recall your remark, Mr Acting Deputy President, when we were on the rural and regional affairs committee. You said that as a member of the committee and as a farmer you were shocked to see in Queensland the Salvation Army putting food on farmers' tables—that you never thought you would ever see that day. Well, it did happen and it certainly brings home even more starkly the problems facing the country people.

         There have been drought inquiries which have made certain suggestions as to how drought can be managed but again I emphasise that a drought of this nature cannot be managed; it is not possible. It is a time when the whole community—as it has done, and it should be commended for so doing—should come to the support and aid of the farming community.

         The situation has been made even worse by depressed market prices. It was good to see members of the National Farmers Federation and others in the rural communities commend what the government has done. They, like others, would have liked $260 million, but there is a limit to how much money can be allocated to various areas to help industries and people.

         Senator O'Chee made a point about the working men. I would not like anybody to read that and think that the only reason the numbers of workers on farms and grazing properties has been reduced drastically is drought. There has been a reduction in the number of people working on farms over some time because of better management techniques, better technology and larger machines.

         But what Senator O'Chee said about the working men needing some assistance is valid. As with city people, they are entitled to and do get paid the jobsearch allowance. When they were seeking help from the government previously the assets test substantially got in the way of their getting assistance. In many cases where they did get assistance, it was to get off the farm. If that did not occur in a certain time, they had to pay the money back. This package does away with that, and I am very happy about that.

         Before I move away from the comments Senator O'Chee made, I would like to say that I very much agree with his proposition that provisional tax should not be levied on farmers within the first year of coming out of drought. The package is there to help the farmers. I hear people say that the rural industry will become defunct and it will be a catastrophe. That is not true; it will always be there. But it would give an opportunity for large companies and absentee landlords to buy land that is currently, and has been for many years, held by family farmers. I do not think anybody wants that to happen. That is one of the important parts of the package where these people will be assisted. I think that is really great.

          Time and again people talked about the unfairness of the assets test and that they should have access to social service payments because their circumstances were just as difficult as those of people in the city and, in some cases, even more difficult. I think it is a great thing that we have done away with the idea of the assets test. It did prevent people from getting that payment.

         Another matter that was raised, and correctly so, was that if the sons of farmers, for instance, or farmers themselves were to get a jobsearch allowance, they had to be prepared to go away and work at a time when their presence was required to look after the property and to see that the stock and the property were not damaged any more than they had to be. The fact that they can now get a payment and stay on the farm is very important. It is not something that just came to the minister or the Prime Minister; it is as a result of the pressure that has been put on over time by people from all walks of life in this situation. I think it is a fair set of circumstances.

         I would like to wind up by saying that I do not think some of the banks or the lending institutions can hold their heads very high because of the way in which they behaved on many occasions by encouraging people to go into debt over their heads and then not helping when the circumstances became grave as a result of people overextending themselves. But we cannot label the whole banking group as being bad because of the practice of some. I would just say that I disapprove of those who engaged in bad practices and appeal to them to change their attitude. They should be patient with people who, after all, have the potential to come good and to repay their debts. I hope that those who have been doing the right thing, and those who have even had a moratorium on the payment of interest rates—I think it might have been partly for a commercial reason, but I do not look any gift-horse in the mouth—continue doing that. I believe the package is a very good one, and I certainly commend it to the Senate.

         The package is, of course, a package which is not yet complete; I want to stress that. We are interested in now proceeding with the next step in this package, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced at the press conference when this package was announced. This package, as it stands, is costed at $164 million but, importantly, the Prime Minister gave a commitment that the government will consider what are essentially post-drought measures that are very important in providing, as he termed it, generous investment allowances for drought proofing properties.

         The reason I want to stress that, even more than the package in front of us at the moment, is that there is no question that we have to get much better nationally at managing primary production in Australia than we are now. Most members of the farming community are well aware of and fully agree with that sentiment. As I have said on other occasions, prior to 1992—when all primary industry ministers in Australia, irrespective of their political persuasion, adopted for the first time in this country's history a national drought policy, extraordinary as that may seem—and as the drought task force and the Senate committee that examined this issue clearly found, we had gone through a never-ending cycle of good seasons, bad seasons, crisis and government assistance. Then when the crisis is over, everybody goes back to doing what they were doing before—until the next crisis.

         I was very heartened by the fact that this got a lot of discussion at the special meeting of ministers—the ARMCANZ meeting—called recently to discuss the drought. There was not one dissenting voice in the room; and as you, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, know, and as we are painfully aware, five of those six governments are conservative, not Labor. Not a single dissenting voice in the room supported any move to go back to where we were before, to where we looked after drought as part of the national disaster arrangements. I put it squarely on the table because I wanted to hear what the other administrations in this country thought about it. Not a single person supported that proposition. Every single minister supported the notion of all governments working together to help farmers plan and manage better for drought in the future until, hopefully, we can get to that halcyon day that Peter Walsh painted—which certainly will not occur in my lifetime, but is a good goal—when all national disasters, such as drought, fire, flood, low commodity prices, frost, mouse plagues, and everything else, get capitalised into the value of the asset in this wonderful, pure economic model that Peter painted and we do not have to give farmers any assistance at all.

         We all agreed that that would be a very desirable end for everyone, including the farmers, but it is not going to occur for a very long time. However, in the meantime—while we are moving to that ultimate goal in a perfect world, which we do not live in—we all acknowledge that state and federal governments do have to devote their efforts to providing much more focused resources for primary producers to help plan for and manage these events.

         The farming a sunburnt country package, which was a combined effort of the Bureau of Meteorology and my department and which was released just a short time ago, contained, in some views, dramatic information. But it is a fact that across Australia primary producers make an income in three years out of 10. Of course, there are vast regional differences in that. That is a national measure across the whole primary industry sector, but it is a valid measure in considering the importance of management in this new and sophisticated age that primary producers must live in.

         I mention this because I have just come to the chamber from a meeting with the people in the departments of agriculture who developed the Rainman computer package, which we are launching in parliament next week. That package is the most highly sophisticated database of information available to primary producers on historical rainfall patterns in this country that I have ever seen. It is an extraordinarily useful package.

         One of the reasons I mention it is that the people who are working on this are also planning the next phase of Rainman, which also plots in the areas where this sophisticated data is available—and there are many areas where departments of agriculture have kept this data—in combination with the rainfall patterns, the levels of pasture growth and grain production, and profit and loss as well. It was interesting to see a graph of a typical Queensland cattle station in a good area and to look at the plot over the last 20 years of the pasture growth patterns—positive and negative—on a typical cattle station. The thing that hits us when we look at a graph like that is that we say to ourselves, `My God, what a sophisticated and difficult exercise it is these days managing a herd on a cattle property, dealing with those peaks and troughs and deciding how many head of cattle to run on a particular paddock or on an entire property.'

I want to make the point that this is not the end of the package—this is simply the instalment to this point.

What is achievable, however, is a far greater degree of national uniformity than we have at the moment. The problem—and it is a real problem—is that there are criteria that determine drought declarations in Queensland, there is a different set of criteria in Victoria, and a completely different set of arrangements again in New South Wales. Then, of course, there are states, such as South Australia, that have no drought declarations at all. That is obviously totally unacceptable. If we cannot continue to pursue a national definition, we can at least achieve a far better measure of consistency with the way in which drought is declared in respect of government programs, state and federal. I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to this debate.

         However, given that it is now five months since the budget announcement was brought down, and given that all the schedules have been printed, it would be irresponsible to change budgets. We change budgets when there is retrospectivity involved, blatant political promise, inconsistency or technical defects. But there are problems with an upper house picking and choosing items. However, we put the government on notice that, unless it is able to establish a better rationale for determining the uplift factor, we reserve the right to make amendments next year. I think it necessary to clarify that. For that reason, this amendment put forward by the Australian Democrats is not in line with that commitment.

Why does Senator Watson not do the same thing for this matter? Here is an opportunity for him. I know how he feels about small business and the effect of provisional tax on cash flow. In my view, it is a bit much to keep using these avoidance tactics.

         —I am a little unhappy about the way the Australian Democrats misrepresent this whole situation. In terms of cash flow, the figures are not a complete loss to small business because anybody, including small business, subject to the provisional tax arrangements, has the opportunity to put in a variation. The majority of people subject to this would put in a variation. I think the issue has been misrepresented, particularly the position that we have taken. A number of organisations have subsequently tended to distance themselves from the stand that the Democrats have taken in terms of the manner in which they have attempted to embrace their supporting of their ideas in relation to this particular budget.

        The purpose of this series of amendments is to deal with a matter that we have raised in the past. On that occasion, Senator Watson said that there was a great deal of merit in this particular proposal. So I hope that he will see fit to support this amendment the second time round, as he has now had time to think about the merits of it. Indeed, there are very many merits. After clause 85, we are inserting a new division which states:
       </para>

        "85A. The object of this Division is to provide a rebate of tax for gifts of real property to natural heritage conservation organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the essence of this amendment; all the other parts of it are really conditional and necessary to bring this into effect. So the first statement under `Object of Division' in relation to 85A is what we are really seeking to achieve.

         Further to what I have just said about Senator Watson supporting this proposal the last time we raised it, Mr McLachlan in the other place has also spoken eloquently and very frequently about the desirability of private citizens becoming involved in the conservation effort. Mr McLachlan, whom Senator Watson and Senator Reid would know has achieved considerable environmental improvements to his own property, has spoken frequently about the fact that it is impossible for governments to achieve everything in the area of acquisition of land for conservation purposes, environmental protection and protection of threatened species and that it is not only necessary but highly desirable that private citizens become involved in these activities.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We agree that private people and private organisations can do a lot in caring for the environment and should not be disadvantaged in any way for carrying out those activities. That is the point of our amendment.

         Already we have a situation in which donations of money to recognised conservation bodies are tax deductible. Those moneys are used for environmental protection purposes. This amendment simply seeks to extend that desirable facility to gifts of land. We see that as being a perfectly reasonable and sensible extension of the same principle. I think the government would be the first to agree that it is not in a position to acquire all the land that should be acquired for the purposes of environmental protection. It also would be aware that in a number of instances tax deductions are available for environmentally damaging purposes. So extending the range of tax deductibility for environmentally protective purposes would help somewhat to redress that imbalance.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Why should any distinction be drawn between donations of money for environmental purposes being tax deductible and donations of land being similarly tax deductible? A person who owns land and who would like to see that land used for environmental protection could go through the process of giving that land to a recognised conservation body, being paid for it and then donating the money back to that conservation body. That donation of money would then be tax deductible. But what a ridiculous situation we are expecting that person to go through, because that person may then be exposed to capital gains tax if the land had improved in value and would be subject to conveyancing fees, and the full benefit of the donation made for the purposes of conservation would not be realised.

         For those reasons we strongly urge the committee to support this amendment and to include donations of land as a tax deduction. I point out that all the other parts of the amendment are consequential to that first one. All honourable senators need to do is understand and agree with the broad principle of this amendment to agree with it in its totality. I ask honourable senators to support that principle.

         —In terms of the success of this amendment, if the coalition were to agree to it, it is true that we might be able to get it through the Senate. But the likelihood of convincing members of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives to support it is a major difficulty. I acknowledge that there is some merit in this measure. I will certainly take it to Mr McLachlan and, in government, we will certainly give this sort of measure very active consideration. We are about practical politics at the moment. I think it was somewhat remiss that Senator Coulter did not put it to Mr McLachlan at an earlier opportunity for appropriate evaluation. I rest my case there, and I thank the committee.

In this case it is land care and the protection of remnant vegetation that are of concern.

         In the bad old days, the idea of farming and land use was that cleared land was productive while land with trees and bush was seen as useless. Measures were put in place to ensure that farming and pastoral land was cleared. Some of those were direct requirements or penalties under land laws; some of them were incentives and disincentives. The tax regime reflected those priorities and to some extent still does.

         We now know that those older views of land and nature were wrong. Farmers know this, and that is why they have been a major force for land care, pushing the government. The result of unrestricted clearing is not greater productivity; clearing results in land degradation, salinity and soil loss, and loss of habitat for birds and other creatures that work to biologically control pests. It also has a very detrimental effect on the ecology and species generally, including effects on weather. It results in wider forms of degradation.

         The Great Barrier Reef, like other reefs in the vicinity of intensive agriculture, is showing signs of severe stress and is dying in some areas. This is due to two factors: siltation and increased nutrients, factors which change the ecological balance that favours reef polyps over algae. The silt and nutrients come from run-off of soil and fertilisers. One method of natural control is through the use of fringing vegetation—plants that stop much of the run-off. Clearing simply exacerbates the situation.

         The tax laws favour clearing and disadvantage saving bush. The deductions for the value of timber felled on land in the first year after acquisition, for land where the purchase price is attributable in part to the existence of merchantable standing timber, is basically an incentive to clear. In line with this, we also support a change to section 15 of the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976, which deals with farm management bonds to allow deposits to be specifically allocated for landcare purposes. Likewise, we support a measure to ensure that all tax concessions, grants and loans to farmers and farm enterprises be contingent upon the development by January 1997 of approved whole farm plans, which include targets for environmental protection and restoration and are in accord with regional biodiversity strategies and catchment management plans.

         The problem for farmers is not just one of eliminating incentives to clear. We need positive incentives to retain or plant bush. As the coalition knows, farmers are having a hard time. One of the worst aspects of this is that farmers simply cannot afford to do what they know they should do to make their farms sustainable. I would like to repeat myself and say that farmers have been at the forefront in the push for land care. It is their land and their life, and they know that over-farming does not help. They have experienced the pain of seeing their land turn to salt pools and the soil blow away. For this reason, the Greens also support a number of measures designed to generate some economic gains for farmers to offset the immediate losses of over-farming.

         We support 150 per cent tax deduction for land care work. Although there is a distinct lack of figures, businesses claiming in 1991-92 at 100 per cent deductibility cost the government only $36 million. This component would be expected to cost around $54 million in total, an increase of $18 million. Section 75D of the tax act should also be amended to make additional measures, for instance, restoration of riparian zones, wetlands, costs of protecting remnant vegetation, eligible as landcare expenditure. This is a small amount compared with the cost of land and water degradation.

Tax deductions for use in commercial plantations would be set at 25 per cent for seedlings and saplings of Australian trees and 50 per cent for local native trees.

         Senator Coulter has proposed tax deductibility for leaving bushland as it is. This can be achieved by extension of tax laws which make conservation of built heritage deductible. It brings natural heritage into line with built heritage and says that natural things have value. This seems to be a minimum measure in ensuring that the tax system reflects the values of the community and the policies of government. It also seems likely that farmers who donate remnant bush that they wish to preserve understand that it will make their farms better and see this as the most cost effective way of doing so.

By that means, there would probably also be volunteers to help manage that land. Any weeding and fencing work that needed to be done would be more available through those means.

         —The government will not be supporting this amendment. In dealing with Senator Margetts's contribution, I agree with many of the points she made about the need for conservation of the environment, particularly in many areas of Australia where, incorrectly, land has been cleared and there has been obvious degradation of the environment. But I do not think Senator Margetts has read the amendment. This amendment does not provide for any of that. What it does in terms of programs specifically targeted at curing those problems is to provide for a very open-ended deductibility for land to be donated. It does not specify what should occur to that land or what sort of land should be donated. It is totally open-ended.

         There are a couple of reasons why we oppose the amendment. This four-page amendment is unrelated to the legislation before the committee. Senator Coulter has moved an amendment like this before—I acknowledge that—in a similar manner, by attaching it to a tax provision that is unrelated to the nature of the amendment that he is attempting to move. I am sure it is legitimate; there is nothing illegal about it. But in terms of assessing a proposal that is open-ended and could cost tens of millions of dollars, it is not the correct way to assess something of this nature. We do not know the cost of this measure to the budget. It could be $10 million, $20 million, $100 million.

         Returning to the earlier argument, I would make the point that this land may not be land that needs attention. We could donate any land. That is one of the critical weaknesses of Senator Coulter's proposal. It is not a reasonable way in which to target what may be necessary and what I accept we need to be doing in many of these areas. But surely if we are to provide finance via way of a deduction—whether it is $10 million, $20 million, $100 million or more—we should work out to which areas of this country the assistance needs to be directly targeted. We are very sceptical about very open measures of tax deductibility that do not have appropriate checks and balances. This government has funded a number of programs. Landcare is an obvious and very successful one that has been acknowledged by all, right across the environment and primary industry sector and across all political parties.

I do not know whether he would be advancing that principle with respect to his position on other legislation. Perhaps if we were to declare that we were not going to support it in the House of Representatives, those opposite might support all our future legislation on that basis.

       <para>
        This clause affects sales tax and what are known as remanufactured goods in Australia which are sold to exempt users. The coalition amendment will provide a sales tax exemption for parts used in the remanufacture of goods sold or leased to exempt users, such as government departments, schools, libraries and so on.

         The amendment is necessary for two main reasons. Firstly, the existing treatment of remanufactured goods was not apparently intended by the new sales tax legislation and is inconsistent with the sales tax treatment of both new goods and imported remanufactured goods. Secondly, the current treatment is a disincentive to the burgeoning local remanufacturing industry. Remanufacturing plays a beneficial role in the Australian economy. I thank the Greens and the Australian Democrats for their support for this measure.

         This amendment will encourage the remanufacturing industry, which has great potential for significant future growth. There is growth in the overseas demand for remanufactured goods, and Australia's remanufactured goods are substitutes for the new and remanufactured imported goods. Of course, there are also significant employment and recycling advantages.

         In the bill the government is extending the availability of sales tax exemptions to parts used to repair goods to be exported. The coalition amendment goes one step further and follows the logic in the same direction. It will therefore restore the status quo of the sales tax position as at 1 January 1993. It is no good for the government to say that for decades the law was unclear because the law operated very clearly in relation to this issue. The restoration of the sales tax exemption, while generating significant benefits for the economy and encouraging the use of recycled products, will have a very minor impact on revenue.

         We think the goods should have been made to last longer in the first place, and I think this will encourage manufacturers. It is important to note that this sales tax exemption is being sought only for the non-taxable sector. It should result in a reduction in the price of goods by encouraging remanufacturing. Charitable and educational bodies will be able to obtain photocopying, photographic and other equipment at a much lower price. That will enable those bodies to release funds for other purposes, and I think that is an important principle.

         Provision has been made for a sales tax credit to be given where spare parts are used in repairing goods for export. This follows amendments last year in relation to spare parts used in repairing machinery that is ultimately sold to farmers, miners and manufacturers. Xerox and other companies are seeking a sales tax credit on spare parts used in repairing remanufactured goods that are ultimately sold to exempt persons such as government departments, schools and libraries.

         The government is opposing the amendment that the opposition and, obviously, the Democrats and the Greens are supporting. There is nothing in the structure of sales tax in Australia which requires a credit ground of the kind being sought. It is simply an extension of a concession, that is, the concession given to government and benevolent bodies to not pay sales tax on goods they use. The basic design of the sales tax system is to tax the output of manufacturers; that is, the sales tax is a tax on goods.

         To avoid double taxation, the inputs of manufacturers are exempt from sales tax because their value is picked up in the outputs which are taxed. But the inputs of service providers—for example, the tourism industry—are taxable because they do not produce other goods which are subject to tax. Thus, the tax free status of inputs to service providers such as government departments and hospitals is a concession which the opposition amendment seeks to extend.

         The economic impact—and I have already partly dealt with this—of providing the credit ground would appear to be very marginal at best. I have already outlined some issues in respect of that. It is material to note that sales of remanufactured goods to tax exempt users is only a part of the picture. In fact, around 60 per cent of sales of remanufactured goods are to taxable users. Australia positively discriminates in favour of local remanufacturing where sales are to taxable users. Imported remanufactured goods are subject to sales tax on their whole value when sold to taxable users.

If there is a problem with making sales to the tax exempt sector, it must be because of something other than dollars of sales tax. Remanufactured goods are already in some industries 20 per cent cheaper than new goods and carry the same warranty. If government departments still will not buy them it has to do with something other than the sales tax issue.

I will come to that point later. There are administrative complexities in having credit grounds on parts used in second-hand goods. Given the marginal benefits of providing the credit ground, the government is not inclined to add to the costs of operating the sales tax system. The opposition frequently criticises the government for the cost of the sales tax system. The opposition is proposing to make it more complex.

         There can be no guaranteed way of ensuring that the benefit of the credit ground would flow through to the end users, in which case the credit ground could simply be a transfer from the Commonwealth to the bottom line of the remanufacturers.

This draws my attention to a failing of the government at the time to include the leasing arrangements. Farmers in this day and age cannot always pay cash. They increasingly are entering into leasing arrangements. I draw Senator Sherry's attention to the major problem with that amendment at that time. If he is going to be consistent, he needs to address that issue to include the leasing as well as the payments in cash in the mining and agricultural areas.

         We ask Senator Sherry, on behalf of the Labor Party, to honour his undertakings. Effectively the government is casting aspersions on the quality of its purchasing officers in the various exempt areas because they are unable, according to the government's criteria, to push a case as to whether the reduction in sales tax arising from this would be passed on in the form of lower charges. That argument is a reflection on the ability of purchasing officers to negotiate and to be aware of the components of the cost structures.

         The amendment has not only economic advantages to Australia in terms of relief, the balance of payments and employment opportunities but also advantages for the environment. I wish Senator Faulkner were here because I am sure he would have given this issue much more consideration.

Here we have a facility to reuse that equipment in an environmentally friendly manner and this will be used always by exempt users. We are referring to Commonwealth governments, state governments, hospitals, charities and all those sorts of agencies which deserve the maximum consideration in being able to purchase their goods at the lowest price.

         I ask people listening to this debate: do you not think it is wrong that these goods can come into Australia without sales tax being paid on them whereas the locally produced products attract very high sales tax? I asked the minister what the rate is and he will not tell me because he is embarrassed by it. Is it a sort of penal rate? Is it a pretty high rate?

The only point I want to make is that, at the last election, our commitment was that this package would be revenue neutral. That is not what the opposition is doing now. This industry knew the approach we would take on this issue. It is unfortunate that the opposition is making this amendment, because the outcome will not be revenue neutral. It will mean the loss of many millions of dollars in revenue to the government.

         —Clauses 156 to 159 concern the Royal Flying Doctor Service. During the second reading debate I pointed to the anomalous sales tax position which exempts from sales tax only the purchase of transceivers which are used `mainly' for communicating with RFDS. I strongly urge the government to review this situation. Not unlike the sales tax anomaly which I spoke to a few moments ago with respect to the parts used in the re-manufacturing of goods, here is another example of what I call the streamlined sales tax revenue regime failing to accord with the old sales tax law. I remind Senator Sherry that the commitment I am referring to was not a government election commitment but a commitment made in relation to the transition from the old sales tax regime to the new sales tax regime, which came into effect on 1 January 1993.

         I remind the Senate that the `for use mainly' test in the current legislation has the unintended effect of removing the exemption for wireless transceivers used by most people in remote areas for maintaining contact with the RFDS for emergency medical assistance. I remind honourable senators who were listening to the Ian McNamara program on Sunday when they were raising lots of money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service of the eloquent service that is provided by that organisation and the reliance of these people in the outback on these transceivers. I therefore draw the attention of the committee to this anomaly, which is disadvantaging those people in the outback, in relation to the new sales tax regime compared with the old one.

         As I indicated during the second reading debate, it is interesting to note that the Adelaide branch of the tax office is not actually following the letter of the law. I applaud it for that because, as Senator Chapman, who is from South Australia, knows, there are a lot of people who benefit from these transceivers. In permitting certain organisations to apply the `for use' test in the previous legislation, obviously the tax office holds the view that the current legislation is incorrect. The government, I believe, needs to address this issue immediately, and I ask for a commitment from Senator Sherry that he will address this issue.

         —Earlier today I gave a notice of motion and subsequently also asked the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) a question urging the government not to sign the United Nations convention on desertification tomorrow as this government plans to do—and with very good reason. There has been an overwhelming response to the Liberal and National parties' committee of inquiry into the United Nations convention on desertification. Among the many and wide-ranging submissions, not one supports the signing of this convention without reservation. There are a few who do not oppose the signing, but even they believe that there should be much greater community consultation before signing and are implacably opposed to ratification should the government determine to lodge a national action plan.

         Today Senator Faulkner, in reply to my question concerning the government's precipitous signing of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, stated that he did not give a damn about the coalition's inquiry. That comment from the minister is simply another reflection of the arrogance with which this government treats the Australian community. There should have been a full-scale Senate inquiry into the government's intention to sign this convention. That was a motion that I put to the Senate some weeks ago. It was only narrowly defeated—by two votes.

         The inquiry not having been established, the Liberal and National parties, aware of the enormous community concern about the proposed signing by the government of this convention following the conclusion of treaty text negotiations in June of this year—community concern which I am sure Senator Panizza is also aware of, representing as he does the rural areas of Western Australia—determined that we would conduct our own inquiry. Therefore, we set up a committee of inquiry which consisted of me as chairman, Senator Kemp, Senator Crane, and Senator O'Chee from the National Party. The coalition believes that it is important to permit Australian individuals and groups an opportunity to present legitimate concerns about this treaty and to provide a forum for that to occur, given that this government in its arrogance failed to consult adequately with industry groups, with state governments and with rural communities potentially affected by this treaty.

The minister has effectively told those people—individuals, and some significant Australian companies and industry associations with a wide cross-section of membership—that he does not give a damn about them.

         This treaty might not be as headline-grabbing an issue as sexual privacy but let me say to this Senate that it essentially deals with the same issue. That issue is the centralised grab for power by this government—in the case of the desertification treaty, to wrest control of rural land management from state governments. The central issue is the use, yet again, of the external affairs power to enact legislation to take away the management of problems which are best left to local communities to solve, to people who are close to the problems and who can assess which techniques may best be used to suit unique local conditions.

         There is another issue—the fundamental weakness inherent in treaty negotiations of this sort. Parameters which may initially be set by the federal government at the beginning of negotiations are rarely re-examined during the treaty negotiation process. Each negotiating session results in a markedly different text to the one on which the government may have set its original parameters. Negotiating teams are left to protect the nation's interest as the texts alter and only report back to the government at the conclusion of each negotiating session.

         A small group of people on the negotiating committee are therefore left to battle with protecting Australia's national interests, often in an arena where Australia's traditional United Nations negotiating blocs and allies, due to different trade and economic structures, may not have negotiating positions consistent with our own. All this is done without reference to the parliament or even the cabinet. The dangers or challenges of these treaties often cannot be foreseen and the impact on Australian domestic policy, including trade implications, should be fully investigated prior to signing. In the case of this treaty, this government has simply failed to do that.

The government is perhaps to be commended on its restraint, and I applaud the economy of multi-tasking in designating the Treasurer to sign this treaty rather than perhaps Senator Evans or Senator Faulkner taking another overseas junket to perform this function.

         Experience with the climate control convention has shown that the government clearly does not understand the implications of these treaties, nor can we meet our obligations under them in time. There are often hidden impacts which may take years—and a High Court decision—to be revealed. Surely the government should learn from its mistakes. There is every reason for us to urge it to do so. The only reason that one can possibly give for the government signing this treaty tomorrow is that it wants to grandstand at the opening ceremony for the sake of international popularity. That is simply not good enough when, as I said, the Australian community has many concerns about this treaty. The signing ought to be delayed until some later period.

In particular, I want to focus on and talk briefly about one of the great workers in this field, Bill Crews. Bill is the minister at the Uniting Church in Ashfield, which is in my former electorate of Lowe. He is a delightful fellow and one of my great heroes. He came to Ashfield some years ago and I think it is fair to say that he sent some shock waves around that local church which was, until then, the average local Uniting Church.

         Bill Crews decided that Christianity should be not only theological but practical and, as a result of his work in this area, he set up the Exodus Foundation. The Exodus Foundation essentially offers food and shelter to homeless kids. He has worked tirelessly on this particular project and has turned it into an example of what Christianity should be and sometimes is not—that it should not be a dry theological religion by itself; it should a religion in action, a religion helping the community.

         But the issue today is a sad one. Two weeks ago, Bill had to close his refuge for homeless kids. Why? There are essentially two different reasons. The first is a reduction in funding from private sources. Bill has done a fantastic job throughout the recession in raising enormous amounts of funds to keep this project going, to reach out to literally thousands of homeless kids and unemployed and disadvantaged people in the area. He has performed minor miracles but for some reason the funds have recently dried up.

I am proud to say that all the profits and income of the New South Wales Premier's cocktail party—that is, John Fahey's Liberal Party cocktail party—will be donated to the Exodus Foundation. Even though that may be a small gesture, I am delighted to be part of that.

         The second reason the refuge was closed relates to government. This has happened in a number of different ways. The first relates to the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy has interfered in the caring of homeless children. It used to be a simple matter. Bill used to do it in a nice, simple fashion. He used to offer shelter, food, support and counselling. He did it, I think it is fair to say, on a shoestring but he did it remarkably effectively. I think the results of his pastoral ministry speak for themselves.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But then the bureaucracy got involved. The bureaucracy put in regulations, red tape, requirements and forms—most of which was unnecessary. The regulations that now have to be followed in this area by people like Bill Crews mean that something like $4,000 per homeless kid has to be spent per month—mainly to meet the requirements of the bureaucracy. Bill can provide shelter and food for something like $10 a day, so there is a great discrepancy there.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bureaucracy is requiring social worker support and other such things, many of which are very desirable. But it has become counterproductive when the requirements of the bureaucracy are such that refuges such as Bill's are being forced to shut down. I have to say that the bureaucrats in this regard are all too often raising barriers rather than lowering them. They are excluding people rather than including them. There was a recent article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         by Amanda Meade who, in reporting on some issues, indicated that something like 40 per cent of the needy were still sleeping on the streets in spite of the apparent investment in homes for those people.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Bill rightly pointed out that it would be cheaper to send the homeless kids to a high cost, first class, upper level boarding school than to care for them in the way the bureaucracy wants. That is a terrible indictment of the bureaucracy. But there are more problems and, again, sadly they are with the government. One is the difficulty of accessing government funds. Today, Bill said to me, `They just keep changing the rules. They tell us to put in applications on appropriate forms, so we ask for the forms. Then they tell us the forms aren't available because they are being redrafted and reprinted. We then ask to get into the system anyway, only to be told, "You can't get into the system unless you have the applications on the proper forms; and the proper forms are not there." It just goes round and round in circles. If you are already in the system you are okay; but if you are not in the system, it is very difficult to get into it.'

         Very recently, the foundation was told that there was no more funding available for the next two years. It is clear, according to sources in the area, that there are people in that system who are known to be doing a substandard job but they can get extra money from the pool because others, who may have better plans, cannot get into the system because of all the red tape. As Bill describes it, it is an unbelievably frustrating bureaucratic nightmare. I emphasise that Bill is the most reasonable of men. His views on this matter are to be taken with the utmost seriousness.

         Another indication of the problems he has faced is that at the back of the Uniting Church in Ashfield there is a building which is rather like a gym or a warehouse. It is nothing very fancy. It is financed, if I remember rightly, by Burns Philp. My commendations go to Burns Philp for investing in this. It was planned to be a crisis refuge but it cannot be opened as a crisis refuge because the bureaucrats have said that to be a crisis refuge there cannot be a dormitory arrangement; there have to be two separate dormitories. There have to be partitions; there have to be privacy arrangements. Because of that, the kids who would be sleeping in this refuge are not allowed to go there. Instead, they are sleeping in the gutters.

         It is unbelievable that there is not enough commonsense in the bureaucracy to realise that whether or not there is a partition is of no great moment when the alternative is sleeping in the gutters amongst the addicts, the thieves and the muggers who are outside. To meet the requirements of the bureaucracy, the foundation would have to spend another $20,000 to $40,000. It is such sadness. It breaks my heart to see people like Bill and his wonderful team of volunteers working their hearts out, to have it thrown back in their faces like this, by an uncaring bureaucracy.

         There is still a problem. I do not know how big it is. Seven or so years ago, Burdekin told the country that something like 25,000 people are affected. There seems to be no doubt that there is still an ongoing problem. Bill told me that only last night a doctor called and drew his attention to the plight of a woman and her five children. They had been living in a car since the recent death of her husband. Bill sorted things out. As he said, the organisation gives priority attention to the plight of kids. It is basically into providing food, shelter and support. But it cannot get the bureaucrats to realise the enormity of the problems. They continue with their tail chasing and buck-passing and invent new ways of stopping people from accessing government funds, rather than helping people to do the work and to deal with the realities of the problems in the community.

         The government, as I understand it, spends over $100 million in this area but, sadly, it is not effectively spent. If people like Bill Crews have to close down a refuge, it is the worst possible indictment of government expenditure and management that I can imagine. There is a duplication because the system is organised and run by the federal bureaucracy and implemented by the state bureaucracies. So, on top of that, we have duplication in this area. How anybody could imagine that would be effective is beyond me.

         We have a system where the nature of the regulations means that it costs $20,000 a month to put through the four or five kids and youths that Bill was looking after before. It had managed to operate for 12 months and that project almost sent the Exodus Foundation broke, in spite of all the fund raising and hard work that Bill and his volunteers are doing. They had to close the program to enable them to keep operating in other ways in the community. They followed all the rules for their refuge and that is what made it expensive. They followed all the rules, but they could not get the money. They were between the devil and the deep blue sea.

         There seems to be nobody really caring about the plight of the kids in the system. It fills me with embarrassment to be part of a supposedly great, leading nation in this world which has a problem like this on its own back doorstep, where kids could be easily looked after, cared for, fed and housed and yet they are not because of the bureaucracy not really caring about the real world, only about their own comfort, their own empires and their own promotions. I say to the minister responsible, Brian Howe, a man who claims to have compassion in these areas: show some of that compassion and some of that commonsense and fix this problem.

         One of the questions is to do with legal advice that we understand the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, may have received on the extent of the Commonwealth's powers to intervene in the construction of the Port Hinchinbrook resort. I believe that many of us would like to see that advice. We would like to know what the advice says. We would like the minister to release that advice. That is the first matter.

         I give the minister credit that he has made some effort to try to protect native forests, for example, in states such as Tasmania, but I do want him to act to protect this precious site in Queensland. So another question I ask is: will he do this to the extent of the powers he has?

         Again, I give Minister Faulkner credit that he has insisted on adequate scientific studies to be carried out in the Hinchinbrook Channel, which is part of the World Heritage area, before approval is given for dredging. However, there does not seem to be recognition from either the state or federal governments of the problem of allowing construction of the resort to go ahead while assessment of the impact of its operations is still being undertaken. What is going to happen, I ask, if construction continues for another six months and then the evidence comes in to show that World Heritage values of the area will be significantly affected?

         Given that the developer insists on not changing any aspects of his development, although I give him credit for reducing the number of beds from the original proposal, will we be faced with a half or fully built resort which is, quite justifiably, refused permission to operate? Honourable senators can see the problem. Will the Queensland government, which has done all it can to push this development through, be prepared to pay compensation for the expenses incurred by the developer?

         It is very unclear whether the baseline study of the Hinchinbrook Channel, which is required by the federal minister, will be adequately carried out. The Queensland environment minister talks of a study which will be concluded in a few weeks and which is being carried out by the Department of Primary Industries, which can hardly be seen as an independent or objective participant.

         I need to place on record the lack of confidence I have in the processes presently and formerly undertaken by the government. I have a letter, obtained under freedom of information, from Mr Williams to the Coordinator-General's department dated 15 April 1994. It is his comments on the environment report. He writes:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a result of the meeting on Wednesday night, 13th April, at which Chris Pattearson, Jan Bimrose and I discussed major issues as contained in the document I have now had the opportunity to fully consider the contents of such document and Jan Bimrose has already received by fax my comments and suggestions which must be incorporated before it is released to the public.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, he says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        My suggestions for amendments to the report are not negotiable on the grounds that I am not about to embark on this major project with skeletons in the cupboard that I will have to argue about at a later date.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators can see how concerned someone could be that Mr Williams should have had such input to what I would have hoped would be a totally independent document. Mr Williams further states in his letter to the Office of the Coordinator-General:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I stated earlier in this letter that I am not negotiable in regard to my requirements for an amended document and, furthermore, I am not negotiable in regard to the date established for the issue of permits (6th June, 1994).
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, Mr Williams concludes his letter to the department by saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In view of the above I feel that I have unshakeable grounds for insisting that such delays as have been caused by non compliance of the grounds rules established should be compensated for by shortening the time from closure of public comments to the issuing of permits.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also quote from the fax from the Coordinator-General to Mr Williams responding to his letter:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I refer to your two facsimile messages . . . and a third facsimile message of 15 April 1994, in relation to the draft Environmental Report.

       <para>
        I wish I had a little more time to read those changes, but perhaps another occasion will suffice. Honourable senators can understand the concerns that we have when we discover that Mr Williams had such a significant input to the writing of that environment report.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another concern which has been expressed is the pressure from the influx of people into the area. Many people are worried about this. Contrary to statements made by Mr Williams, many of these people come from Cardwell and the surrounding areas. I will quote from just one of the letters that I received today. It is a letter to Senator Kernot. The gentleman who wrote this letter is a former overseer for the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service. He writes:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Should a channel be allowed, people pressure alone will be devastating to the small islands of the family group, including both Gould Is. and the Brook Island group, Hinchinbrook Is. in particular would suffer from the effects of visitation, it would be a tragedy to see this beautiful island (degraded) because of too much visitation. Qld NP&amp;WS have a system regards limiting the number of campers on an area at any one time, but this does not apply to day visitors, so large numbers of people can use an area daily with tragic results. I was o/seer in charge of island parks in this local area from 1972 until 1988 and saw first hand, damage that can be done to areas with only light visitation . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I received a phone call from another gentleman who was born in Cairns, who lived in Cardwell in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and who still visits the area regularly. He says that it is a marvellous area, and I concur in that, but he believes the environment is under pressure from people being attracted by the development. He says that a large number of people in Cardwell are not convinced about the development.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let me conclude by saying that construction of this oversized resort is happening today, yet all these questions are yet to be answered. It will soon be too late. I urge the minister to visit Hinchinbrook and to use all of his power to convince the Queensland government to start playing by the rules.
