         —Why? That is the question that I wish to ask. This is quite a serious matter. This is an order of the Senate that is due to take effect today. Today the government is supposed to have tabled in the Senate an indexed list of file titles of government departments as ordered by the Senate. This particular motion seeks to rescind that order. That order should take effect before the close of business today. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) owes it to the Senate to say why the government wants to have this matter postponed. If it is—as I think it might be—that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, wants to give the Senate an excuse as to why he wants to renege on his solemn undertaking to the Senate given at the end of the sports grants rorts affair, the parliamentary secretary should tell us so.

A senior Thai official told me in 1992 that protecting the Khmer Rouge was an important element of Thai security.

These are questions of the implication of the sale to a nation in which at least some elements of the military have been implicated in transfers to an insurgent force of extreme brutality. There are implications that this may be a deliberate strategy of destabilisation of a neighbouring country by elements of the Thai military. The arms proposed for sale are small arms, the sort that the Khmer Rouge would use. Even should those arms not be directly on-sold to the Khmer Rouge, we admit it is likely that the arms they replace may be.

         This is a very poorly framed motion in the way it has been designed. It is poorly framed because it calls on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to do things which are, in fact, the responsibility of the Department of Defence. It also tends to send the major request to the wrong committee. In any event, it would not matter what the issues were in current debate, Senator Margetts would not support the export of Steyr rifles to any country around the globe because, fundamentally, she does not support any defence exports.

         I will just put a few facts on the record. Firstly, there is no application from ADI or any other Australian company to export rifles to Thailand. The Thai government has not made a decision as to which country or even which type of rifle it will source and it will probably not make such a decision for another 12 months. We have in place procedures and guidelines that will adequately cover all Senator Margetts's concerns; that is, guidelines that are constantly revised—the last revision was in March 1994—in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Attorney-General's and all these other departments have a say on the committee and an equal vote with Defence as to whether export approval will be given. A whole range of activities are taken into account in any decision made.

There has been no allegation from this government that the Thai government has given any material assistance to the Khmer Rouge. There has also been an acknowledgment by this government that the Thai government has tried to cut off any Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge.

         Our fundamental point is that we would like the Thai government to redouble its efforts to prevent any individuals in Thailand giving aid to the Khmer Rouge. We recognise that, because the Thai-Cambodian border is as rugged as it is and also because there are traditional trading routes across it, this is a fundamentally difficult task. There is a sensitivity from Australia's point of view. I think the horror that all Australians would feel if that general who was responsible for the brutal execution of an Australian citizen were able to find refuge across the border from pursuit by the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces would be something we could not live with. I want to make it very explicit where we stand on this particular issue. We are not in any way accusing the Thai government of giving aid and succour to the Khmer Rouge. We are asking it, wherever it can, to redouble its efforts to prevent any individuals getting any particular assistance.

I am not going to run the argument that we are busy doing other things because we can always fit things in. But this is an appallingly drafted motion. It is one that is, in fact, a little duplicitous on the part of Senator Margetts because the implication is that if we fixed everything else up and these other problems did not exist she would support the export of Steyr rifles. We all know that Senator Margetts will not support defence exports to any area whatsoever. So I think at this stage this matter will have to take its chances with all the other competing priorities in general business.

         There is a very worrying situation occurring in Cambodia and it is ongoing. We were told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) that he was confident that, after the change of policy by the Chinese government, the sources of supply and maintenance of the Khmer Rouge would quickly dry up and their capacity to wage an ongoing civil war would be severely impeded. In effect, he was arguing that after the elections in Cambodia the Khmer Rouge could be no more than a nuisance factor and within a relatively short period their cause would be lost and the future for Cambodia would be much brighter.

         We always believed his assessment of the Khmer Rouge was naive. We believed he was naive when he embraced the Khmer Rouge within the peace process. Looking at the history and record of the KR, we could not understand how he ever believed that they would genuinely participate in a democratic process or how they might ever genuinely participate in a democratic government. We thought he was naive in his assessment that they would not continue their armed conflict after that election process. Their whole approach to politics in Cambodia has been to take power and influence through the barrel of a gun. There had been no indication upon which he could have reasonably relied that should have led him to the view that they had fundamentally changed.

         I think it is fair to say that what we have is a Cambodian government that is in a shocking state of repair. The assessment of the previous Australian Ambassador to Cambodia is that of a government that would appear to be severely corrupt, a military that seems to be largely out of control—some would also say corrupt—and a civil war that is continuing. All the signs are that the Khmer Rouge is as dangerous and as influential as it was before that process. They are being sustained and armed by someone. We thought we might get a hint yesterday because apparently the Minister for Foreign Affairs had a document prepared by his department which was going to give the parliament an up-to-date assessment of the strength and capacity of the Khmer Rouge, the government's view as to their ongoing war-waging potential and the government's current assessment of safety issues regarding Australians in Cambodia.

We can only be gravely concerned about that. We are puzzled as to whether the Australian government is confused as to what is going on in Cambodia, whether it is giving sound and adequate advice to Australian citizens in Cambodia, many of whom are doing very worthwhile work in aid projects, apart from those who may be visiting as tourists or for other reasons.

         We are deeply disturbed that that assessment by the department was not put on the record yesterday so that Australians would be better informed. There is no doubt that the Khmer Rouge are continuing their conflict. They are as ruthless and shocking as ever. It has perhaps become more apparent to Australians because of the sad death of an Australian recently at their hands, but that does not change the fundamental issues. There are a lot of important issues relating to this matter that ought to be debated at an appropriate time.

One of those bits around the edges was that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ought to have a far more significant input into where our defence exports go and why they go there.

Senator Margetts and I, and the others who signed the additional report into this, believe the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should have a far more significant role in this whole area of defence exports. This is one of the parts of Senator Margetts's motion and I absolutely agree with it. They should have a far more significant role.

As the foreign minister has said, the Khmer Rouge are getting aid and ammunition and goodness knows what from certain people in Thailand who are not necessarily—in fact, they are probably not—under the control of the Thai government, and that is the problem. That is why the department of foreign affairs ought to be looking at this, that is why the standing interdepartmental committee ought to be looking at this and that is why we ought to be looking at this.

So I believe it is urgent, and if we do not deal with it today and if it is fobbed off, it puts the credibility of any sentiments of willingness to do their utmost in doubt.

         Unless this parliament can be informed of better ways to phrase the motion, of more appropriate ways in which the government can deal with this matter, it is being left in the air in a way that is quite damaging to the government. I cannot believe that the government would not be sensible enough to think of that.

         The best way to deal with the situation is to present fairly and squarely what the government feels is the most strategic, positive and useful approach. It also allows those in the chamber who do not agree with those views to express those views of dissent and have them addressed properly and thoroughly on the public record, rather than adjourning to a media debate, to take it to other avenues hoping for a voice there.

The reason for that is that the priority for debating those bills has not been determined by content, importance or urgency, but simply because of the order on the government program. I believe that this is a matter that all honourable senators need to consider and that is why we should give it urgent consideration this morning.

         —We on this side of the chamber do have concerns about the way in which government business has been managed this year and in previous years. It is an almost inevitable fact of political life at the moment that, every time we get to November, there is a huge number of bills introduced into the parliament which the government wants dealt with before the end of the year. Many of them, as far as primary industry is concerned, are introduced very late into this session. That places enormous pressure on honourable senators who wish to speak on primary industry bills to pull off the bills so that the legislation can get through. That causes enormous concern and angst on this side of the chamber.

There are also a few unforeseen consequences of the legislation.

         I only have to go to the last sitting day we had before the last federal election. We were here at 2.30 in the morning debating a bill to set AQIS inspection charges for the export of primary produce. Former senator Archer quite rightly pointed out that the per tonne inspection charge for onions was 40 times the per tonne inspection charge for potatoes. It was quite obviously a typographical error.

         There was a very nasty debate in the chamber—I remember it distinctly—in which the government said it was not going to amend the legislation and was not going to enter into any discussion with the opposition because it was 2.30 in the morning. Eventually the Democrats relented and voted with the government. What happened? One of the first bills we had when we came back after the federal election was a bill to amend the amendment act that we had put through on the last day of sitting, altering the per tonne inspection charge for onions because, yes, there had been a typographical error. When that sort of thing happens, we have to have some concern about the quality of the management being exercised in relation to government business and the way legislation is brought forward.

         I guess the real question in this part of the debate is whether it is necessary to deal with this at this moment, for indeed we had an opportunity 24 hours ago for Senator Chamarette to give a notice of motion so that today this matter could be either declared formal or, by using a contingent notice of motion, be discussed. I am debating today a motion I have not seen; and that is difficult. Where is the written version of this? Why the ambush right now? Why the ambush at 25 minutes to 11 on this Thursday?

         If this Senate were to follow any decent and proper procedures, it would defeat this motion, and Senator Chamarette would give notice of motion of it today and seek to have it debated, through a similar means, on Monday. It would also be more appropriate, of course, for the motion to be debated when the Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner) is here and not away on government business—he will not return till midday. I would oppose Senator Chamarette's motion at this stage on this basis: I have not read it; I do not know what discussions have taken place; and the Manager of Government Business is not here.

         There has been ample opportunity to put a notice of motion down, even this morning, to have it debated on Monday. If we have to get into the substance of the debate, I would argue that many of those bills are urgent—some are budget related and some are necessary to go through. I would also adduce arguments that this government has not had ample opportunity to debate legislation in the spring session and that the Senate has gone off on many romps, as it often does, on disallowance motions and many other things. The percentage of time so far devoted to the legislative program as compared with the totality of Senate time spent is quite low—but normal; I stress, it is normal.

         I return to the central point: it is rather hard to debate a motion I have not got in front of me and of which I do not know the conditions. It was absolutely unnecessary to do it this way, unless the Greens were looking for a thrill kill. Was that the reason? Do they want the excitement of moving their contingent notice of motion by way of ambush? They can have their thrill; they have had their thrill. But that is not really a position they can argue in a principled way, having had ample opportunity yesterday and today to give a notice of motion so it could be considered at whips' meetings and knocked around.

         Maybe they will get support, I do not know; I am not involved in that process, and I have not been involved in that process. Maybe they will; but they have not sought to go down that particular path, which is the normal path. They have sought, by way of ambush, to have a motion we do not have in front of us debated now, on Thursday morning. What is urgent? Why do we not move on to the legislative program today? The Greens can then give a notice of motion if this motion gets defeated and then they might have an opportunity to debate it on Monday. I really think this is an unwarranted ambush. It is a very difficult motion to debate in principle or anything else when it is not before us in a written form.

         —We will not support the suspension because the principal motion is not before us. I think it is in the terms that all bills that were not introduced in the last session of parliament cannot be dealt with in this session. An undertaking was given by the government that under normal circumstances that was how it intended to do business in this session, and it has not done that. It is not as if it is simply matters of urgency which the government has sought to bring on without their having been introduced in the previous session. It is simply a matter of convenience for the government to basically deal with the program as it has evolved according to its timetable—with a total disregard of the undertakings that were previously given to the Senate.

         So I can understand the sentiment and the annoyance of the Greens that has led them to move this suspension, but that does not mean that this is the right way to deal with the matter. However, on a matter of principle, we will agree to deal in this session with bills which were not introduced in the last only if the government can make out a real and genuine case of urgency.

         The sorts of circumstances we are talking about may relate to grants for the needy or whatever and the government's attempt to deal with the mass unemployment in this country. Obviously, if there are bills coming out in the government's program to address such matters, we will look sympathetically at a request to deal with them in this session. But where the government is just continuing in total disregard of the undertakings that were formerly given, we will not.

         The opposition suggests that the parties sit down on Monday morning and look at the program. If agreement cannot be reached as to which bills will be and which bills will not be dealt with in this session, then we can debate this in a sensible way on Monday and we will see where the numbers lie in relation to any particular bill. I told you, Mr Acting Deputy President, where the opposition stands in principle on the substantive issue. That is the way we would approach discussions on Monday or in the debate that would subsequently ensue in this place.

         However, I have to repeat what I said yesterday. The program in this session is a shambles. The government did not have its legislation ready, despite all the promises to the contrary. During the first half of the session the opposition was being requested to raise matters to fill in the day for the government. Now those opposite come here and say that they have insufficient time. The minority parties have been joining with the government to allow extensions of this sitting to enable the government's incompetent planning to, in effect, be implemented, which we say is a totally unsatisfactory way of doing business.

         So we will be interested to see on Monday morning how the minority parties approach these bills that the government is introducing or seeking to debate in breach of its earlier agreement. Obviously, the Greens have said on the record today that they are prepared to vote against the debate of those matters and hold the government to its agreement. If that is so, I commend them for that. We have never had such an undertaking from the Australian Democrats.

The Democrats agreed with the government to curtail the sittings of this session.

        Finally, looking to the future and moving beyond this budget session, we are conscious of the need, if we possibly can, to do even better than this.

        Under the present budgetary process, obviously budget bills will always be an exception. However, that may not need to be the case under our proposed new system for dealing with budgets before the end of June.

Obviously, it will make it potentially possible for that category of exceptions to be removed or modified.

        So we are dealing with, as he says, what is potentially possible for the categories of exceptions to be removed or modified. We are dealing with a motion to suspend standing orders, but as I understand the substantive motion, it would be up to the government to bring us into its confidence as to which of those bills which have been introduced in this session, contrary to the optimal desire of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, fall into those categories of urgent bills.

         In fact, this has not come out of the blue. The Greens have been expressing these concerns to the government for months. We were not given reasons for the bills being introduced. We asked for reasons and they were not given to us until we asked. Therefore, even the process which was foreshadowed, promised or mentioned by Senator Evans did not happen until it was forced. Therefore, without this kind of debate today, how could we have thought that there would be any action at all to deal with the real concerns about proper notice, proper consultation and proper consideration of important matters that get lumped into the process at this time of the year?

         Once the reasons were given, there was no effort by the government to then go to the various parties, let alone in the Senate chamber, to find out whether those reasons were acceptable reasons for the urgency. Senator Chamarette's motion mentions the seven new bills for today. Under this Senate process, if this motion were to go through, it would be perfectly possible for the government to bring its reasoned arguments to the Senate as to why any particular bill on that list should not be recommitted to this session. That gives the proper scrutiny process.

         If there is a general method of operating that the urgency of that particular bill has to be proven and argued to the Senate, at least it is out in the open and at least all parties have the opportunity to participate.

The urgency is that in the morning or at the whips' meeting we get a list of bills and the ability to properly scrutinise the reasons for dealing with that at the time is not there, and that is not the correct way in which parliamentary scrutiny should be taking place, considering the undertakings that were given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans).

I think it is an appropriate right of government to say that, but I also think it is a right of the Senate to hear that in the chamber and to decide in the chamber whether it is acceptable to it or not and to vote bill by bill.

         I assure Senator Ray that the Greens have no desire to debate any bills that have been introduced only in this session, with the government giving the Senate no opportunity to consider them. In a notice of motion I requested that the reasons for the practice be tabled. They were tabled, and I appreciate that, but there was no opportunity given for the Senate to decide whether those reasons were legitimate. I believe that the Senate has a legitimate decision making power. It should not be having to deal with bills on a day-by-day basis.

If we do not debate the motion today and we deal with bills that have been introduced only in this session, that makes it very difficult for the Greens to argue, as we strongly believe, that this should not be happening. We will raise this matter time and time again if the government does not face its responsibility to organise the program in such a way that only urgent bills—if the reasons for them are publicly available and agreed to—go through the Senate in the last 12 sitting days that we have left in parliament this year.

         —I want to put on the public record that at the time we adjourned this debate last night I was very distressed by the comments that were coming from the government and the Australian Democrats imparting personal characteristics to this motion. I want to reiterate that the Greens moved this amendment on the basis of principle. It was quite rightly pointed out by the opposition that to have an amendment that says that all the commissioners be elected commissioners is a statement of principle. It does not prevent anyone who has been an appointed commissioner from becoming a member of the board. It simply ensures that the principle of election is maintained in the legislation on an ongoing basis.

         I ask those people who made those comments on the basis of some kind of friendship with the only appointed commissioner, David Ross, whether they were really acting in his best interests by making those comments on the public record. There is nothing personal in this amendment and I distance myself from any of the aspersions and allegations that were made either by Senator Evans or Senator Kernot when they implied that this was somehow—

         Nevertheless, I am not convinced of the merits of this amendment. I have listened carefully to what was said. An opposition senator commented last night that it does not matter whether or not this amendment goes through; it will not affect the personalities appointed to the ILC. I am not convinced by the arguments that have been put forward that the legislation needs to specify `elected commissioners' rather than just `commissioners'. People are commissioners; if they are commissioners, they are commissioners. As has been said, each person who is a commissioner will be elected anyhow at the next election, which I think is in 1996.

It may be the case that the commissioners will be elected in 1996 but, when this bill becomes law, it will talk about the establishment of the board. Therefore, the sensible principle that Senator Chamarette's amendment encapsulates is that it is better that people are elected and, to that effect, responsive to their fellows.

         The argument that the commissioners will be elected in 1996—just as President Clinton will try to get re-elected in 1996 as well—is important now. It will be less important in 1996. The fact is that we are establishing a board that will hold office for four or five years. So the principle is important now. It will be less important in the future. It is an important distinction, and the coalition will support it. It is not a life and death amendment, but I think it is a sensible and important principle.

        This amendment is the second part of the plank that seeks to ensure that the board is well structured.

         I think it is a sensible principle that envisages a broad representation across the regions and states, and from the various Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It gives a broad direction to the minister. We do not think it is an onerous requirement that he have regard to ensuring there is broad representation. It simply seeks to ensure that the board is not representative of a small set of interests and that it does reflect the hopes, aspirations and needs of people from across Australia. For that reason it is worthy of support. I commend it to the chamber.

         —I think Senator Campbell has provided the precise reason why the government will not be supporting this amendment. Senator Campbell's reference to the board not being representative of small sets of interests is a fascinating point to make in support of this amendment. ATSIC is the primary source of policy advice to the government on Aboriginal affairs and ATSIC is the primary deliverer of the implementation of that policy advice in the administration of programs for the benefit of Aboriginal people. Therefore, it is appropriate for ATSIC to be appropriately represented on this board. The effect of the opposition amendment is to decrease that representation. I reiterate that ATSIC is not only the government's primary source of policy advice but also the primary administrator of the delivery of that policy and the implementation of programs. We are absolutely opposed to this attempt by the opposition to dilute its representation.

What this Indigenous Land Corporation would end up being is an alter ego of ATSIC. That is a recipe for disaster because we have seen in recent times how the Aboriginal community has had varied opinions. I recall the evidence of Aden Ridgeway, who appeared before the Senate finance and public administration committee, when he said, `Of course there are going to be differences in views within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is only natural.' It is the same in the wider community. Therefore, we should not just accept the bureaucratic body which supposedly represents that community as being the be all and end all.

         So what we are saying is that there are mechanisms in the appointment of the board to have an ATSIC commissioner on the board. That is mandatory. It is in the bill. But there should be other areas of the community from which the government can draw for appointments to this board. There is absolutely nothing wrong in stating that the minister needs to ensure the broadest possible representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on this board. I would have thought that it stood to reason—and that any objective viewer would agree—that we should try to get the broadest possible representation.

There are differences of opinion. There is a diversity of representation in ATSIC at the moment, as Senator Ellison saw from the press conference that was held yesterday.

          I think he has an outdated view about the way ATSIC works and the people who are currently elected to it.

         When Senator Collins said that ATSIC gives policy advice to government, in no way can we extend that to say, `Therefore, the ILC will be a mirror image of ATSIC.' It gives policy advice. ATSIC, through its regional council structure—imperfect or perfect, depending on the way in which some of the councils work at the moment—has an opportunity to canvass a broad range of views from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and therefore to mirror these views in policy advice to government. I can say that it is very judicious in doing that. It always makes sure that, where there is a difference of opinion amongst its commissioners, that is recorded and that is passed on.

         Senator Ellison is right in commenting that there is nothing wrong with saying that there should be the broadest representation on the board, but I just do not like the arguments he used to prove that. I do not think we should all fear the way in which ATSIC is involved as the primary, but not the only, organised representative view of Aboriginal people in this country.

         I repeat to Senator Ellison that it is probably more representative than ever because of the way in which Aboriginal people have chosen to be more actively involved in it. It is only a few years old. Senator Ellison made the point that Aden Ridgeway said that it was not monolithic. I have made that point many times. I do not think it logically follows that, because ATSIC has a role in this, it will not be broadly representative.

There is a rationale for saying that there should be one commissioner from ATSIC rather than two when we consider that there are only seven members of the board in total and that possibly only five of those will be Aboriginal people. Under this arrangement we would have two out of the five members who are already represented within the ATSIC structure and representing the views of ATSIC.

         It is important to emphasise the difference between the ILC and ATSIC, even though both in their own way—but perhaps the ILC more so—are government appointed boards and de facto government bureaucracies. Nevertheless, because of the structure that we have seen emerging in this bill, this is yet another structure that is being created to conform to our white cultural understanding of a bureaucracy that distributes limited resources.

One commissioner would have no less capacity to consult all the other commissioners before coming to a decision. One commissioner has no less capacity to report to the ILC board what all the other ATSIC commissioners feel—rather than simply a personal view or two personal views. Two people might be able to do it as well, but one person can do it just as well as two can. When I was here previously, when Senator Margetts was here, and when Senator Vallentine was here before that, we had a responsibility to glean the views of all the people to whom we felt we were accountable when we voted or spoke in this chamber. When there are two of us we both do that. It does not mean that we both would not, but it defeats Senator Kernot's argument that having two people is a mechanism for ensuring that two points of view are presented. One person, with the right attitudes towards representation of all views on that board, has that capacity. There is a trust in that person to do so.

The government has been making threats through the media that, if we do not comply with what the government wants in this legislation, it will give it all to ATSIC. That is fine, but this threat has led to some considerable concern in the Aboriginal community, which I am sure the government was well aware of before it made the threat.

What Senator Ellison delivered was a bit rich. Senator Kernot made these points very succinctly, but I want to reiterate them. Senator Ellison said that one of the reasons why the opposition has proposed this amendment is that `ATSIC does not properly represent all of the Aboriginal people of Australia'. The coalition and the Greens, in supporting this, have a hide to keep chucking around the word `patronising' in respect of the government, because one cannot get much more patronising than what they have said.

         ATSIC is a body which is elected nationally in national elections which are funded to be run nationally. I know of the intense interest among Aboriginal people in participating in those ATSIC elections—interest which is growing, I might add, from election to election. Every Aboriginal person in Australia is entitled to nominate and stand for office and to cast a vote in those elections—in other words, it is precisely the same basis on which this parliament is elected. There is no better system available in this country. Having provided that democratic process and a democratic method of electing that body—as Senator Kernot said, rightly or wrongly, depending on which region elects whom—Senator Ellison is patronising enough to assert in here, on behalf of the opposition, that this body does not properly represent the Aboriginal people of Australia.

         The second and final point I would like to make, and it should be an obvious one, is that there is an absolutely crucial need—considering the necessary interlinking of the job that the ILC will do and the programs that are delivered by ATSIC—for the ILC and ATSIC to be inextricably linked. One of the fundamental reasons for the level of ATSIC representation on this body, which was carefully considered by the government, is the essential link that has to exist between the ILC and ATSIC so that these programs can be delivered effectively on behalf of the Aboriginal people of Australia.

Secondly, in the appointment of all of the directors, the commission has a power that no other organisation in the country has. The part of clause 3 of the bill that the Greens unsuccessfully sought to amend last night provides that before a person can be appointed as a director, the minister must consult with the commission. He does not have to consult with anybody else. He does not have to consult with any other Aboriginal group or any other Aboriginal person. He does not have to consult with anybody, except with the Minister for Finance, which the Greens do not like. Before appointing a director, he must consult with the commission.

         This amendment does not say that there can be only one commissioner. It says that, as of right, there should be one commissioner and that all of the other commissioners should be broadly representative. Frankly, it is conceivable that every single board member of the ILC could be a commissioner. All we are enshrining is a very fine principle. It is not onerous to the extent that it requires the minister, as clause 3 of the bill does, to consult the commission in relation to the appointments. Clause 3 says he must consult the commission in relation to the appointment of the directors. So a name is put up—Senator Collins might be put up when he retires from here—and the commission has to be consulted. `Would former Minister Bob Collins be a good director of the ILC board?' Senator Collins would probably say, `No, I don't want the job because I'm sick of sitting on Ansett aeroplanes all my life.'

I would love to be able to send that quote out to every Aboriginal person in Western Australia—that Senator Gareth Evans does not want the ILC to consult with traditional owners before it goes to buy land. That is a phenomenal statement.

         Today we have a minister who is saying that when making appointments to the ILC board the minister responsible should not have to have regard to ensuring the broadest possible representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is phenomenal. I would love it if the media were able to write a little feature piece on the incredible hypocrisy of this government when it comes to Aboriginal affairs saying, `We are not going to consult traditional owners, and we don't want broad representation of ATSIC people on the board.' I would love a feature piece to be written about the hypocrisy that has come out of the mouths of these two ministers. I find it quite incredible that the government could oppose this amendment. I say again: I commend this motion to the committee. I will be appalled if it is opposed by anybody.

         —I would like to say one thing in response. I just want to build on a couple of facts. ATSIC has an important land acquisition and management component. I think it is very important and appropriate to have processes by which two members of ATSIC are on this board to make sure that the maximum information is passed on because under ATSIC different commissioners have different portfolios. Both the chair and deputy chair of ATSIC are on the council for reconciliation. We hear from both of them because we need to know about their perspective on the portfolio responsibilities they have.

         In terms of land acquisition and land management, I think it is really important that the chair and an ATSIC commissioner be there to make sure of what we need to know to avoid duplication and to have sensible management of this regional and national strategy. It is possible. I think that the sharing, the fact that they are both there to say, `This is what ATSIC is doing; this is my area of responsibility and this is your area of responsibility,' means that we have an opportunity to make sure that the ILC and the ATSIC nexus works properly.

         Senator Collins was extolling the virtues of ATSIC and started this whole line of debate on ATSIC. I am quite content to leave it as the amendment is stated; that is, there must be a need to ensure the broadest possible representation and if they happen to be ATSIC commissioners, so much to the good. If not, so much to the good, as long as they are broadly the most representative group we can get. That is all we are saying; nothing more, nothing less. It is Senator Collins who has this phobia about ATSIC and brought it into the debate.

        This completes the Greens' series of amendments in relation to what we believe is the principle of independence of the ILC from the government. We have already dealt with—and the Greens have lost—three of those amendments. But the remaining amendments address the issue of whether the ILC board should approve the paid employment of outside duties for directors, rather than the minister, as is in the bill.

         They are all part of the same principle, which is that if we are setting up an independent board that is not an extension of the minister's office or of the government—and I do not know how effectively we are doing that—a consequent requirement should be that the ILC board is given the autonomy at least to determine the terms and conditions of its members in regard to duties and leave of absence.

        I think I shocked Senator Evans when I referred to the government's amendments and the problems that the Greens have regarding the relationship between a national strategy and a regional strategy. We believe the regional strategy needs to be reflected within the national strategy. His solution was to remove the national strategy from any mention in the bill.

         The dilemma is this: in the bill as presented by the government the ILC board has the responsibility for developing a national indigenous land strategy and also a regional strategy. The bill does not actually spell out any relationship between the two; that goes along with the government's feeling that it should have maximum flexibility. However, our amendments are not necessarily about making the board more flexible and more open-ended in its powers—we see it essentially as a government appointed board, which it is—but about ensuring the accountability of the board to the wider Aboriginal community and on a regional basis.

         If people would like a bit more discussion on it, I will simply state what I believe the intention of these amendments is and then we can move to discussion of that. I think perhaps the most important one to raise here is J2A, where it basically says that the national indigenous land strategy is to be based on regional strategies. We believe it should be derived from and reflect the regional indigenous land strategies provided for under section 191N. Then we have a second clause that says that the national strategy should be  amended. If the regional strategy varies from time to time, the national strategy should be varied accordingly so that it continues to be based on, derived from and reflect the regional indigenous land strategies.

         To ensure that those regional strategies are developed in a way that gives consideration to the wider benefits of Aboriginal people throughout Australia, the J3A amendment covers the functions of the ILC in relation to that. The first one states that it should consult as widely as possible with representatives of those Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to whom the part is directed—presumably, every Aboriginal community in Australia which is in some way dispossessed. As every Aboriginal person is dispossessed—there is no disagreement on that—it means as wide a consultation as possible. It also states that the ILC must consult with the commission and that it may consult such other persons and bodies as the board considers appropriate.

         So it is not excluding a consultation with ATSIC, but is ensuring that regional strategies are developed regionally independent of any other existing organisations or structures that exist. It does not mean that those structures cannot be adopted as regional structures; it just means that there is no presupposition that that is the basis of regional consultation. It is about adopting a regional strategy.

         The clauses that go on from that refer simply to a copy of those strategies being made available to the minister within two months of the board agreeing to them and that moneys are not to be distributed until the regional strategy is prepared. I think the reason for that is straightforward. Many people around Australia will feel that if a proper consultation process is not developed for this ILC land fund allocation, those who will be consulted last will have the last attempt at gaining any money from what we know to be a very diminishing fund. Therefore, we feel that the money should not be distributed until the regional strategy has been prepared by the board. The other amendments deal simply with consultation processes.

         Finally, the reason why we could not agree with Senator Evans's solution was that it is not sensible just to say it can be on a regional strategy. It is a reasonable request that a board would have some kind of national strategy either explicitly stated or implicitly operating. It is our position that it is better to have it explicitly stated because, as Senator Evans pointed out, then it can be found to relate to the regional strategies, and if it does not, that can be challenged. It is an accountability measure back to the Aboriginal community which is supposed to be the beneficiary of this fund.

         We feel it is inappropriate to strike out `national strategy.' We want a national strategy. We think that that national strategy's priorities should be set from the grassroots, from the regional strategies. We want it made explicit in this legislation so that those two mentions of `national' and `regional' do not give an implicit approval that a national strategy should be set and then regional people consulted about where they fit into it.

We saw the difficulty that may arise out of having two different but concurrent strategies that may be inconsistent. I wish to clarify the public record at this point, because I had a discussion about this last night with Senator Evans. I hope that Senator Chamarette, when she said that Senator Evans did not consult the Greens on this and just sprung it on them, was referring to the actual draft of the final amendment. Senator Evans told me explicitly last night that not only had he discussed this with Senator Chamarette, but he had done so in the presence of her advisers—good old Cathcart, who I know, and lawyers—and had proposed a solution to this problem having seen the merit of what Senator Chamarette was raising and, to quote Senator Evans, `The Greens had agreed with the concept.'

         The government was proposing, in the amendment that we have circulated, to go one step further and remove the explicit requirement in the legislation to have a national strategy. We want these organisations to be regionally based for the simple reason that we do know that the needs and requirements differ so widely across Australia from region to region. Of course the organisation, by necessary inference, would develop its national strategy simply by considering the regional strategies that come before it. That would be the actual effect of the government amendment.

As we all know, there is a whole range of Aboriginal organisations which will have an interest in this.

         Equally when it comes to regional strategies—and I am trying to cover the whole rationale behind the coalition's view of this series of amendments—we believe that, when going into a region and developing a land management program, it is quite stupid not to be talking to the state or local government that has jurisdiction in the area. In just about every state of Australia, as Senator Collins would know, state governments have programs which relate to providing land and support for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I think it is plain commonsense that, before the ILC comes along to a region, it should at least make itself aware of the goals and plans the state government—and, where necessary, the local government, but particularly the state government—has in respect of that.

         By way of example, it would be quite stupid of the ILC to go to a town like Broome, which is familiar to me, and not talk to the Court government about the plans that it has for in and around Broome. Senator Chamarette and I might have disagreements about what those plans are. Broadly speaking, the government has plans to improve Aboriginal access to and ownership of land around Broome—a town that has become famous around Australia for its fantastic Aboriginal culture, its crocodiles and its tourism potential. This is a classic case of where it would be absolutely mad for the ILC to enter into a regional strategy in the Kimberleys—a strategy which would include towns like Broome—while not being aware of the plans of the state government. I think it is very sensible that the ILC be required to consult with the state in relation to its plans.

         Although I am not so familiar with the plans of other states, I am sure that would apply equally to places like the Northern Territory and Queensland.

I am not familiar with them, but I am sure that the Queensland government has programs that specifically deal with land for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I do not know enough about the Queensland situation, but it would be absurd if the ILC went to Queensland and did not talk to the Goss government and its people about their plans in this regard.

         I will make some final points about our plans. We plan, firstly, to increase the consultation and, secondly, to ensure that strategies are made available to those who wish to see them. As I said, under the government's scheme the strategies will be set out in a document for the board but no-one else to know about. We have a plan to ensure that the strategies are tabled at least here so that anyone who wants them knows where they are and so that they can become the subject of public consideration and discussion, if that is required.

         That is the broad thrust of the coalition's proposals. Based on those arguments, we indicate that we will be supporting most of what the Greens are proposing. As I have said, a number of the provisions—J6, J7, J3A and J4A; specifically, 18, 19, 22, 23 and 24—are effectively amendments that were drafted by the coalition. We will be supporting them. However, we have a problem with the concept of the tail wagging the dog. We do not think the national strategy needs to be or should be amended every time there is a change in the regional strategy. We think the regional strategies need to be tied together. We cannot just have a whole bunch of potentially, as Senator Collins quite properly says, inconsistent strategies. There needs to be a national perspective. I think it is important to address particularly the point made by the minister that it is important that the national strategy takes into account the regional strategies.

         Senator Collins has talked about the problems of having concurrent strategies that are inconsistent or conflicting. Quite clearly, if we take the bottom up approach, where we look at the regions first and then devise the national strategy, there is no reason at all why it should be inconsistent. All the regions have different demands and different needs. They therefore require entirely different strategies, one would expect. As Senator Ellison has said by way of example on many occasions, the strategy that would relate to urban fringe-dwelling communities in Sydney or the Swan Valley in Perth would be extremely different from those for the Kimberleys, the Northern Territory or Cape York. So we will have very different regional approaches and regional strategies, and that is quite proper. It is crucial, therefore, that the national strategy takes those into account.

         I disagree with the minister when he says that we could have a national strategy that is inconsistent and conflicting. The national strategy should be a broad directional document that provides the strategic railroad for the ILC to run down for—as the bill provides—a three to five year time span. It is important that once the strategy has been put in place, once it has been the subject of consultation, and once it has been the subject of public scrutiny and tabling in this place, it should stay in place until the time provided in the act for it to be reviewed.

         Later in this set of proposed coalition amendments we are also suggesting further parliamentary scrutiny by the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title.

         I have to say that I am indebted to Senator Campbell for his example. I will make sure that Aboriginal organisations in Western Australia are well aware that the Greens are very happy to support a mandatory requirement for them, in the formulation of their regional and national policies, to consult with the Court government of Western Australia. Something has suddenly occurred to me in respect of the attitude of that government to all Aboriginal issues—which has been one of obstructionism and white-anting, but mostly obstructionism. If this amendment is carried, with the support of the Greens, it will be a mandatory requirement that this consultation be carried out. What will be the situation if the Court government of Western Australia simply declines to consult, thereby having the effect of blocking that from happening at all under this legislation? I do not place any weight on that, but I simply say that I am indebted to Senator Campbell. Aboriginal organisations in Western Australia will appreciate the support of the Greens in imposing on them a mandatory requirement, in developing their own Aboriginal regional and national strategies, to consult with the Court government of Western Australia.

I think Senator Collins raised—as Senator Kernot did—the mandatory requirement implied by the use of the word `must'. Amendment J7(a) says that the board `must consult, as far as practicable' with everybody. That is a recognition that, even if we consult right throughout Australia with every particular Aboriginal community we know of, there may still be others we never get to. So that is a recognition of the impossibility of the extent of consultation that is required.

         However, state governments are stationary bodies. Western Australians know that only too well. Therefore, we feel happy to support this amendment because we do not think there is anything to be gained by being blissfully unaware of the state government's stance, whether it is one we agree with or not, when we are making plans. It is a matter of courtesy to consult but, more than that, it is wise. It is foolish to set up regional strategies that do not take into consideration any new information the state governments may have. They might hide it and not give it to us; but that is beside the point. We should give them every opportunity to do so. It is a bit like Senator Gareth Evans assuming that his amendments had solved all our problems and not asking us whether we had a different idea. That is all that is implied here. I believe that, within the cabinet, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) must consult the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) before export woodchip licences are issued.

         I would urge the government to rethink its refusal to support our amendments at this point. As Senator Evans was so generous spirited as to contemplate the removal of the words `national strategy', he has already given in-principle agreement to the regional strategies being the most appropriate ones to be mentioned in devising a strategy at all. That has underlain the spirit of the amendments that the government put and then withdrew.

         The in-principle acceptance that regional strategies are the logical base by which to move forward is accepted by the government's willingness to write out the words `national strategy' throughout the bill. Only a very little is being added to that. So it needs to be on the record that that is what the government opposes—it actually opposes having anything that guarantees regional groups that they will be consulted, or that the board will attempt to consult them as far as practical. And it writes out of the bill any responsibility that the ILC might feel it needs to state and territory governments relevant to those regions on the issues that it wishes to put in place. I think there are two very good reasons why we should have those provisions, and I am amazed that that is the basis on which the government is not supporting these amendments.

         —It is still in there? If the Greens are taking that out, that is fine. Senator Chamarette should listen to the wording. It is not the mild effect that the senator is suggesting. The Greens proposed amendment to clause 3 states:

        I am not saying that we are going to support this but, from Senator Chamarette's own philosophical base, I am suggesting that the questions Senator Kernot has raised are absolutely pertinent to this issue. If the Greens put a full stop after that, they might not be in the trouble they are going to get into. The problem is the hook that they then get into. The proposed amendment to clause 3 says that the board must consult to ensure that regional indigenous land strategies complement each state, territory, etc.

         In terms of being able to lay this organisation wide open to mischief-making by state governments the requirement is, in Senator Campbell's words, to consult with the Court government in Western Australia. We should not just consult with it, which is how Senator Chamarette has very mildly portrayed this amendment just now, but ensure that that consultation results in a decision that these things complement state government programs. What if the state government of Western Australia refuses to consult or says, and I am sure it will, that anything that is being proposed by this organisation flatly contradicts what is being done by the state government of Western Australia.

         As Senator Kernot said, it is a value judgment that then has to be reached. There are questions that need to be asked: who reaches it; who makes that decision; who determines at the end of the day whether the requirements of this clause have been fulfilled; and who makes that decision? The problem is that if Senator Chamarette amends this section to comply with the explanation she has just given to the chamber, there might not be such a major problem. But that is a substantial hook that then goes in afterwards. If Senator Chamarette put in a full stop and deleted those other words, the proposed amendment might be in better shape.

In fact, recently the native title committee heard evidence from Robert Bropho from the Swan Valley community that he had been granted an A-class reserve by the state government.

If they say, `No,' that is fine; they can get on with their strategy. If they say, `This is what we've got,' then they do not duplicate it by purchasing the land twice. It stands to reason.

Senator Chamarette was asked that question. I say to the committee that the government has not shed any light on this aspect, either, because there is nothing in the bill that says how quickly they have got to develop their regional strategies. What the bill does say is that a regional strategy should cater for a time period of three to five years, as should a national strategy. This means we would have some consistency for the future, which means that under this scheme proposed by the Greens we would not have some uncertainty. The decisions that are made are going to be for quite some time.

Again, I stress that they are legitimate concerns and I think we should check what the impact is of any amendments before we put them in place. However, one of the things we have to realise is that we are not talking here about trying to work out a strategy that distributes $1 billion on the ground. The reality is that for the next three years the ILC will have $21 million.

If there is, say, $21 million, as we know, available through this fund each year for the next three years, and we arbitrarily divide it among the seven states—because it is up to the ILC how it deals with the money—then there is $3 million to WA. When the ILC is considering regionally, after consultation with regional groups, what the needs are in Western Australia, then with that $3 million, which, believe me, is not going to go far, it needs to find out what areas are going to be the easiest to access and what areas are going to be the most difficult to access.

This is saying, `We have $3 million to spend in this state in the best possible way.' If the board consults with people and finds out what their plans are, it helps them to devise a much more effective way of operating. If it makes a plan without that consultation and then finds that it has actually chosen something that would be ideal in every other way except that the state government is intransigent and has a different plan in place for a particular area, it has wasted a lot of time. If it can find that out first what is practicable and what the states are doing—I think Senator Kernot pointed this out—that gives direction to its plan. There is no doubt about that.

We are taking nothing out; we are just adding two things. It was the government that was going to take something out, namely, the national strategy. We are just adding the requirement for consultation with the people who, and the agencies which, in our view, will have some de facto authority or capacity to thwart or assist the plans that are put in place. We feel it is better for that to be known when the strategy is being devised. It is just a sensible precaution.

         The government seeks to criticise the Court government in relation to Aboriginal affairs. Mr Court is considered to be fair game by government senators. I will remind the government of a few facts about the performance of the Court government. Just because Mr Court and his government opposed the government's native title legislation does not mean that they are not fundamentally committed to improving the living standards and opportunities of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. The Court government is fundamentally opposed to the constitutional abuses contained in the Native Title Act. It is fundamentally opposed to the procedures that the federal government set up under the future acts regime and, it is fundamentally opposed to the government's creation of an unworkable regime in native title.

         I want to put on the record a fact that was determined and supported by the Joint Committee on Native Title and recognised by Justice French and members of the National Native Title Tribunal. Our obligations and requirements under section 206 of the Native Title Act are that our committee is to go around the country and consult with state governments to see how the Native Title Act is going. When we set out to do that, the committee—of which Senator Chamarette is a member—decided that we would go to New South Wales and Queensland, specifically Sydney and Brisbane. We also went further north in Queensland. We went to these places to make it easy for the state governments to talk to us about what they were doing about the Native Title Act.

We know that not a single state in Australia has proclaimed legislation to implement native title. Two weeks ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) told us, `Don't worry, compensation will be negotiated. It will all be fixed.' We are no closer to a conclusion on the compensation issue.

         —Mr Deputy President, I rise to speak on the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1994. The bill enables the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, known as AQIS, to refund money to various industry groups it has overcharged. The refund will take the form of a rebate. This decision vindicates the concerns of industry groups who succeeded in persuading AQIS to establish an industry charging review committee. The committee subsequently found that AQIS had overcharged those industries by about $13 million and that the money should be rebated.

         In effect, this bill amends the Quarantine Act to provide a limited remission power to apply to fees for quarantine services. The remission power will allow for revenue collections which are surplus to cost recovery requirements in any year to be returned to the relevant industry groups in the form of uniform fee rebates in the following year. It is proposed that $6.1 million will be rebated through this legislation and $6.9 million through regulations.

I understand the industries have been consulted about the rebates. Some have agreed to use part of the money for specific projects such as quality assurance facilitation and residue testing programs. However, the bulk will be used to provide fee rebates during the current financial year.

         With that in mind it is timely to reflect on the role of AQIS. Over the years, AQIS has been condemned for obstructing the development of primary industry in this country, and for inefficiency, irresponsibility and inhibiting competitiveness. Let me quote a letter from Mr Nick Truelove, the managing director of a small, innovative meat exporter called the True Foods Corporation. In November 1993 he wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy saying:
        </tab>

        I have had nothing but obstruction, discouragement and costly problems from your Department.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Quite frankly I have become so sick and tired of it (AQIS obstruction) that if I had not been a farmer and ultimately dependent on export business for the survival of the family property I would have long since chucked it in and gone into an easier business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        AQIS is the greatest single impediment to Australian meat exports and is costing Australian farmers who it is ostensively set up to serve, dearly.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is damning criticism, but justified in the context of a series of examples that highlight the burden of 100 per cent cost recovery, excess staff and inefficient practices within the AQIS organisation. One example is meat inspection. The average meat inspector earns around $30,000 a year, but is charged out to the abattoir at over $70,000—well in excess of AQIS's 100 per cent cost recovery. If that is not bad enough, an Australian inspector only manages about 79 carcases a shift, while an American inspector gets through more than three times that amount, with around 300 carcases a shift.

It is hardly a piece of legislation that one is likely to oppose. Senator Tambling has already outlined the groups and the moneys involved for some $13 million currently. Of more importance, this overcharging is another administrative flaw in the operation of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service.

         This service is our flagship to the world in terms of quarantine standards. We have an enviable record in Australia of being disease free in so many areas. The current drought and the need to import grains highlight the almost unique position we have in Australia. We need to import grain, but our grain industries are free of so many diseases, fungi and bugs that are found elsewhere, that import protocols are having to be developed to protect us.

         We rely on AQIS to protect our industries; we rely on its  integrity and attention to detail. Yet, last year we had example after example of AQIS making mistakes at the administrative level. We have had relatively minor matters of travel irregularities, the Audit Office has been concerned about auditing practices and now, as a result of industries complaining about charges, we have this bill to pay back money that AQIS has wrongly collected. The need for this legislation reiterates my ongoing concerns about AQIS and the need for an objective and thorough examination of its administration and operation. I moved for an inquiry to see what reforms have been put in place in regard to AQIS—quality assurance and all those other things. It is a user-pays organisation, it is based on that and it has to be responsible and up front.

         —I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This bill amends the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 by introducing a conversion factor which will allow the levy to be calculated where only a cold carcase weight is available. The bill also proposes other minor amendments to levy acts. The levies collected for research and development, promotion, disease eradication and the residue survey, are currently calculated on a hot weight basis. The difficulty arises when the carcase weighed cold produces a lighter weight. This legislation introduces a conversion factor of 1.03 which allows for a weight reduction of three per cent for chilled or frozen meat and provides the hot carcase weight equivalent for levy calculation purposes.

         Where neither the hot nor cold carcase weight is determined, a deemed carcase weight of 240 kilograms will be assumed in order to calculate the levy. It is worth noting that penalties are imposed for offences relating to the failure to use hot carcase or cold carcase weight when available. The maximum fine is 60 penalty units, the current penalty unit being $100.

         In addition, the bill makes it clear that an agent, if involved in the sale of cattle, is responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy to the Commonwealth. The abattoir proprietor will only become responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy if an agent is not involved. Abattoir proprietors can also refuse to slaughter livestock, including pigs owned by someone else, unless levy payments are first made.

         Meat processing is one of Australia's largest rural based industries. It employs more than 30,000 Australians, generates about $5.6 billion turnover a year, and is gaining increasing recognition and market share in Asia. Currently, more than 75,000 farms and pastoral properties in Australia produce livestock for slaughter. Together, beef and veal are our fourth largest export earner, generating $2,949 million a year. Certainly, the GATT outcome promises more opportunities for the Australian beef industry in the United States, Japan and Korea. Other breakthroughs are likely in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Canada and Mexico. It is important to note the beef industry's commitment to research and development, and promotion and disease eradication, as well as the industry's potential for growth and expansion. On behalf of the opposition, I am pleased to support this bill.

This bill is before us because the ACT Legislative Assembly has enacted its own legislation covering the conduct of elections and related matters. There now exists an ACT Electoral Commission and its functions and powers are determined by the procedures laid down in the ACT's Electoral Act 1992, and amended in 1994.

         The main aim of this bill is to amend and repeal those parts of the Commonwealth ACT self-government legislation which are no longer appropriate.

         The transition to self-government has not been without problems. The first ACT elections were held in 1989 under what was then known as a `modified d'Hondt' system, where counting alone took some nine weeks. It took more than two months from the time of the election to determine who was going to be a member of the legislative assembly. Furthermore, some 117 candidates stood for 17 positions and, as a result, the ballot paper was a metre wide. There were 108 different parties and nine independents. Apart from the Liberal and Labor parties, there were parties variously called Party! Party! Party!, Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party and Surprise Party. There was also a party committed to abolishing self-government. It was the biggest ballot paper ever seen in Australia and the second largest seen in the democratic world.

         As the shadow Attorney-General of the ACT, Mr Gary Humphries, has said, it is appropriate that the ACT parliament take control of its own electoral system following a decision by the people at a referendum in 1992. This referendum involved a choice between single member electorates and the so-called Hare-Clarke voting system with a Robson rotation. Some 67 per cent of Canberrans supported the Hare-Clarke system and there was support for that system from every political party except the ALP.

This significant volatility in the labour force surveys seasonally adjusted series over recent months is not unusual. The key issue is the unambiguously positive underlying trend. That trend is as follows: full-time employment has been increasing since September 1992; unemployment is at its lowest level since May 1991; and the unemployment rate continues its steady fall since October last year.

         I make this further point to the opposition: the DEET leading indicator of employment released earlier this week showed a continued rise in September 1994, suggesting that cyclical employment will continue to increase faster than its long-term trend through early 1995. The ANZ job vacancies index rose by 1.7 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in October.

         That inflation rate is a particularly good outcome. Economic growth was well over four per cent. I have already mentioned that we have had employment growth of over 270,000 in the past 12 months, and a reduction in unemployment of 160,000 in the same period. Real household disposable incomes are on the increase. These figures starkly show the improvement in the economy and also show why those opposite are in such turmoil that, after only six months with one leader, they are now talking about dumping him.

Irrespective of what multilateral trade negotiations are current, we always press unilaterally for particular trade advantages in areas where we perceive a necessity for that. I might say that, when we balance the size of the Australian economy and the international clout that we have against the size of the United States economy and the international clout that it has, unless we can point to particular areas of strong leverage in bilateral negotiations, it is a hard thing to do with a major country like the United States.

It says that if the United States does not obtain the authority during the forthcoming special session of Congress to accept the World Trade Organisation agreement, it would be a factor affecting the timing of entry into force of the World Trade Organisation agreement, which is to be considered at the implementation conference scheduled to be held on 8 December this year.

         It is speculative because the new members of the US House of Representatives and the Senate elected yesterday will not be sworn until 1 January 1995. The Uruguay Round implementing legislation is due to be considered at a special congressional session in late November-early December and thus will be considered by the members who currently hold their seats prior to the newly elected members coming on board. This was anticipated in the lead-up to the congressional elections when the leaders of all parties indicated to the President passage of the Uruguay Round legislation.

         In relation to the other questions, I can inform the Senate that the benefits that accrue to Australia from the Uruguay Round outcomes are part of the global endeavour. That is, they do not come exclusively from the United States; they come from our negotiations with Europe and other countries, including Japan. Obviously, the securing of these outcomes is dependent on the World Trade Organisation being joined by the major powers and on when it comes into operation itself. We are therefore consistently pursuing all of the macro-economic reform settings and the trade and industry policies directed to improving our international competitiveness in the expectation that the World Trade Organisation is established and that lower trade barriers exist so that we can take advantage of the Uruguay Round outcomes. But it also helps us improve the efficiency of the Australian economy and makes us more competitive, which makes it worth doing in its own right.

         —Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister misunderstood the first part of my question. I did not ask whether we would engage in negotiations with the United States. I asked whether we would engage in unilateral disarmament in the trade area, as we have over the last few years, irrespective of whether the Americans sign. That is the question the government needs to consider. My question is: is the government ready to consider this question and what is its basic stance? Will the government simply continue to meet our GATT arrangements and our GATT commitments, even if we do not get a quid pro quo?

         We are talking about meeting trade obligations which strengthen the ability of the Australian economy to be more efficient, strengthen the ability of the Australian economy to be more competitive and enhance our ability as an economy to capture more world trade—things worth doing in their own right. The fact that they are part of a multilateral agreement gives extra reason why we should do those things. It means that other countries are doing them too, and access to their markets is improved. That is a debate between Senator Spindler and me that we have had a hundred times in this chamber. I do not expect my persuasive advocacy this time will change his views.

The other side of that, which I am very pleased to be able to advise the Senate today, is that figures released on the number of jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance recipients for October do indeed show that the economic recovery is flowing through to the people who are unemployed.

         The figures already speak for this government's policies making a considerable difference. If one is not sure about it on the figures, one only has to look at that Working Nation document—a commitment by this government to forget no-one in this community. I believe that one will see, particularly with the social security changes under the One Nation statement, that our concern for people on benefits is shown in the commitment to reducing those numbers by getting people job opportunities and training and also by making those payments kinder through the introduction of the partner allowance and the income test for the jobsearch allowance. In all sorts of ways, the news that Senator Schacht reports and that I report is very encouraging indeed.

         I do know that the opposition has been speculating about interest rates and is continuing to do so. It is now in this form speculating further about imposts on home borrowers. The issue of alterations to interest rates is an indication of how strong the Australian economy is. It is an economy in strong growth. As we see today from the average weekly earnings figures, it is growth that is not being fuelled by wage-push inflation. Strong growth and low inflation—these are the problems of a growing economy.

         That may not be something that is familiar to the opposition because when it had the chance it presided over deteriorating economies. This is a growing economy. The adjustments to interest rates which the Reserve Bank has undertaken, in the first instance, have not been fully passed on to home borrowers. Indeed, there is clear evidence of competition among banks, given the more competitive settings we have been able to introduce to ensure that there is still strong competition between them, not to pass on the full extent of the adjustments. Secondly, the purpose of making those adjustments is to ensure that inflation is kept under control or that larger interest rate adjustments do not occur in the future. In other words, they come into the category of responsibly managing an economy; that is what the Reserve Bank has tried to do, I believe successfully. It is because this is a strong and growing economy, producing the employment—

         last weekend, which the minister obviously did not read, but it is also in a bulletin of the tax office—bulletin No. 23, produced by the withholding and indirect taxes program of the Australian Taxation Office, to apply from 1 November 1994. And the minister does not even have a brief on his desk! There is something wrong in the minister's communications. This is an issue that affects elderly people, it affects young people throughout Australia, it affects Aboriginal people, yet the minister is not in a position to confirm it and has the audacity to waffle on about the interest rates the government has already caused. My supplementary question is: will the minister deal with this matter as a matter of priority? Why should factory built homes be treated differently from homes constructed on-site?

         —No, it is not illusory; it is a real brief. As the question implies, the Australian Bureau of Statistics today released the quarterly figures for the August quarter on average weekly earnings. The figures show that average weekly earnings for all employees rose by 1.1 per cent in original terms in the quarter and were 3.3 per cent higher than in August 1993. But the best measure for an accurate picture of what is happening in the earnings area is average weekly ordinary time earnings. On that index, for full-time adult employees the index increased by 0.4 per cent in original terms in the quarter, and was 2.9 per cent higher than in August 1993.

         However, the underlying wage growth is lower than the gross figure of 3.3 per cent for the year, or 1.1 per cent for the quarter, than the AWE figure suggests. The reason is that underlying wage growth is best estimated by that second index I referred to, average weekly ordinary time earnings. This removes the influence of overtime, changes to part-time and full-time work, and the changed average hours worked by part-time employees. In seasonally adjusted and original terms, growth in average weekly ordinary time earnings in the year to August is 0.4 per cent lower—that is, a reduction—than it was in the year to May.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other salient factor of this index that was released today is that the labour force survey indicates that part-time employment grew faster than full-time employment between May and August. Thus, the higher AWE figure cannot be explained by a reduction in the proportion of part-time employment. It is therefore likely—and I am quoting from the brief here—that the higher AWE growth is attributable to part-time employees working longer hours. In other words, not only are more Australians in work, as the employment figures have indicated, but the tendency is for those Australians in work to work longer and to earn more money in overtime.

         The fundamental message in these figures is that there is no wage push on inflation. These figures are well below the inflation level; they are not exerting any upward push on inflation at all. Businesses that have regard to these figures can now factor into their long-term planning very low inflation horizons for the future.

         —No, very low inflation performance for the future. If we take these figures as well in terms of what is happening in the labour market, we have to consider that during the year 1993-94 productivity rose by 1.6 per cent in the community. A lot of the higher earnings that I have referred to are because wage increases have been generated by productivity increases; in other words, productivity is fuelling the economy and there is no cost push pressure of the sort that we saw during the Fraser years. That is a reference, too, to the fact that this government has been successful in generating workplace bargaining in the enterprise based on productivity as a way of capturing wage increases for workers in the community. It is the best scenario that we can have—high growth in the economy and low inflation.

         —Senator Chapman asked me during question time today a question relating to Australia Post. I gave an undertaking to ask the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) for information, and he has very promptly provided it to me. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, Australia Post is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Like any other efficient enterprise, Australia Post continually reviews its services by examining costs, revenue and performance, including most importantly the capacity to meet contemporary customer needs.

         Against this background I understand Australia Post is currently implementing an extensive modernisation of its retail network, known as Retail Post, which focuses on better meeting customer needs while eliminating over time the significant losses incurred by the network. The loss incurred in 1992-93 was around $60 million. Australia Post has advised that the basic tenet for this new retail direction is to improve customer service.

         Market surveys have confirmed Australia Post's view that customers want the convenience of one-stop shopping.

        The important aspect of this matter is that the department has indicated to some people that it is very behind with payments. Husbands in families will lose the benefit of the deduction that they previously had under the dependent spouse rebate. That is making things difficult for those families when budgeting. I would contrast the difference between this scheme and the child-care rebate which is not means tested and which can be obtained so easily. The families affected by this situation are frequently those with less income. By losing the dependent spouse rebate they lose about $28 a week in the husband's take home pay.

         It is all very well to say that it will be back paid, but in the meantime it is making life very difficult for these families. I would urge the minister to make sure that the department is up to date with payments. Some people may not have provided enough information, which may not be their fault. It is something new and difficult. At this stage families do not need to be left with less income than they would normally have had. It is quite clear that $27.50 a week is a big reduction in the breadwinner's pay packet. A lot of families still function on that basis. It is very important that this money becomes available very quickly.

        The minister has come back at the end of question time with a supplementary answer to my question about why Australia Post should be allowed to set up these Australia Post shops.

         In his supplementary answer, the minister said that the capacity for Australia Post to establish and promote the shops is consistent with the act under which Australia Post operates. I assume he meant the pre-existing act. I am not sure whether the bill that recently passed through the Senate has been proclaimed; I expect it has not. That legislation amended the operation of Australia Post to some small degree.

         The minister does not seem to recognise that there is an inherent inconsistency in Australia Post operating in this way. He says that under the existing act it is quite allowable and quite acceptable for Australia Post to set up stationery shops. It is not simply the postal services that are expanding or being added to. Australia Post is setting up specific stationery shops which will sell writing instruments, pads, books, envelopes, accessories, filing and storage material, business machine supplies, social stationery—a wide range of stationery items. As I said in my question, the shops will sell ballpoint pens, marking pens and rollerball pens produced by private sector manufacturers such as Fabercastel, Pentel, Bic and others.

         All of these sorts of items will be selling in these shops in direct competition with the private sector, particularly stationery shops, which by and large are part of the small business sector. So here we have one of Australia's major government-owned corporations, the primary purpose of which is to provide postal services for the Australian community, setting up auxiliary businesses which really do not have any relationship to the postal services they are providing—if there is any relationship, it is extremely tenuous; I would say that there is no real relationship to their primary purpose of providing postal services—to sell these private sector stationery items. That is what is happening, on the one hand.

         On the other hand, a piece of legislation has just gone through this place which continues the very severe restrictions on the private sector's capacity to compete with Australia Post in the provision of postal services. The legislation that went through this chamber did not allow any significant competition with Australia Post or adequate levels of competition with regard to the provision of courier services. It did not allow extended competition with Australia Post in the provision of direct mail services. In a whole range of other postal services, the legislation that went through this chamber continued the monopoly powers of Australia Post in the provision of postal services.

         This is the sort of inconsistency we see on the part of this government. It is quite all right for one of its government business enterprises to set up direct competition with struggling small businesses, but it is not allowable for the same sorts of businesses to compete with Australia Post in postal services. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If we are going to have Australia Post competing with small businesses in the provision of items that are traditionally the preserve of small businesses, then give them a fair go.

         We have to get government off the backs of small business. That is the only way to increase employment and make real, long-term jobs available. Right around regional Australia the statistics on those still looking for a job and unable to get one are an absolute tragedy. This government is not interested. If we get rid of taxes and make the industrial relations system a bit more flexible, we will encourage small business to expand and, in doing so, create real jobs. We will then not have this tragedy of 800,000 unemployed—a tragedy about which this crew opposite is today running around Australia saying, `Isn't that brilliant?' I do not think 800,000 people without a job is worth rejoicing about; it is a tragedy.

The tragedy of unemployment in Australia is ongoing. Every Australian will welcome the upturn in the economy after Australia's deepest recession in 60 years and the highest unemployment rate in living memory. The reality is that for young Australians—on whom I now have to focus a lot of attention as the shadow minister with responsibility for youth affairs—the government's Working Nation document aims to reduce unemployment in Australia to five per cent by the year 2000.

         The point was made very well yesterday by Julian Pocock, Executive Director of APAC, the peak youth organisation. For young Australians, this means that the federal government has adopted an unemployment target of 15 per cent. Julian made a very good point yesterday when he said that politicians should go to primary schools because, by the year 2000, it is young Australians now in grade six who will be entering the employment market. He said that we need to pick out 15 per cent of the children in a class of 30 and say, `The Australian Labor Party's policy is to ensure that 15 per cent of your class will be highly unlikely to get a full-time job in the year 2000.' That is the human tragedy that Senator Macdonald referred to.

         We must all welcome the turnaround and growth in employment. We must also look at the other problems in the Australian economy. The poor people who get jobs these days have bought houses in the hope of an economic recovery. A hell of a lot of people have believed the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis), who are saying that we have this brilliant recovery, and have bought a house. More people have bought houses in the last year or so than ever before. We have been told, `It is all hunky-dory. The economy is going along very nicely.'

         But what happens? We had the admission by Senator Cook in another answer today that interest rates are going up and that that is just a natural part of a booming economy. As Senator Kemp interjected, if interest rates hit 20 per cent, will that mean we have got a really good economy? We are heading into double digit interest rates again. Those in middle Australia with the Australian dream of owning a home are now being forced to pay $100 or more a month extra for the privilege of having a house and a mortgage, and $100 would go a heck of a long way towards paying for a week's groceries. I know in my home we used to be able to buy a week's groceries for $100. For mum and dad with a couple of kids and their grocery bill, by the time interest rates reach the 11 or 12 per cent mark, they will be up to $100 to $150 a month worse off. That will impact on middle Australia very badly.

         Senator Macdonald made the point that fundamental reform of the Australian economy means getting away from centralised labour laws. We have seen the most massive centralisation of labour laws in Australian history in the last two years—more central control than ever before. We have training systems that are not working. We have a community sector which is dealing with the problems of youth unemployment, youth homelessness, youth suicide, youth drug abuse, vandalism, crime and graffiti. Non-profit community organisations such as the Salvation Army and the Central City Mission—a whole range of community initiated groups—are struggling to meet these overwhelming needs, and we have this crisis out there.

         The government is promising young Australians a 15 per cent youth unemployment rate by the year 2000. I do not think any of us can accept that that is a worthy target. So every time these employment figures come through, we should, of course, welcome them. Every time someone who has been unemployed gets a job, that is a welcome relief for one family somewhere in Australia. But we should never lose sight of those young Australians, particularly in the 15- to 25-year-old age group, who have no hope of getting a job. They are totally dejected about the training schemes. They know that they go into many of these training schemes, come out at the other end and there are still no jobs.

         Even though, as Senator Kernot pointed out, retention rates are rising, what Mr Pocock pointed out yesterday, quite rightly, was that the retention rates do not look at what is happening to kids under the age of 15. We have the greatest drop-out rate and truancy rates that this nation has ever seen. We have the highest youth suicide rates in the world. It is a national disgrace. It comes back to the failure by this government to implement fundamental economic reforms—reforms that could change the lives of so many Australians right across this nation.

         Mr Hawke said to us that by 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty. It is a memorable quote, and we keep reminding members of the Labor Party that that is what he said. I suppose they cringe when they hear that, too—like they ought to cringe when they hear the national anthem. Two years later, on 12 April 1989, Mr Keating said in parliament:

         As I said before, all that is being advanced in this country is in fact a lack of fairness. What we are seeing is an ever increasing gap between the rich and the poor. The fact is that almost 700,000 Australian children are living in poverty in 1994. We can flip figures around so that they do not sound very much. But we are talking about 700,000 children. That is a disgrace. For those of us who grew up in a country in respect of which we were proud to use the words `advance Australia fair', it is a disgrace that there are 700,000 children currently living in poverty. The gap between the rich and the poor is widening.

         The government would have us believe that we live in an era of social nirvana. We have only to look at three important measures and their social indicators to comprehend the huge deception being perpetrated by this government. If we look at the number of long-term unemployed in this country, we see that the number is exploding. Last year or the year before I predicted that we would have 300,000 long-term unemployed people.

As I said, he mocked me across the chamber because I said that I thought in a year's time we would have 300,000 long-term unemployed people. Unfortunately, I have been shown to be correct.

         The other thing that causes the gap between the rich and the poor in this country to widen is that this government has allowed the net foreign debt to increase seven-fold from the time it came to power. In 1983 the net foreign debt was $23 billion; in June of this year it was $161 billion. We cannot continue to live beyond our means in that way without there being ramifications.

         What is the government's response to this undeniably shameful record? It is painfully predictable. When Mr Keating answered a question the other day he rolled out his script, rolled out the sort of lines that he likes to use to salve his conscious and hide the figures and the facts. How did he explain that the rich had got richer and the poor had got poorer, and that this had increased over the 11 years that Labor has been in power? He did not have the answers.

         Mr Keating stood there, he shot the messengers in the foot by castigating the reports of people who have said that this is happening. He gave us a whole lot of figures. He fudged around. He did not tell us the facts in the answer to that question. He said that the Labor government had addressed poverty through employment growth, through transfer payments of over $6 billion such as family allowance, et cetera, and through tax cuts. Then he said—I found this amazing—that the tax-free threshold is $5,400. In 1983, when the coalition was in government, it was $4,750.

         Taking those figures into account in terms of the rate of inflation, if the tax-free threshold was going to be at the level it was in 1983, it should be around $8,500. How he could stand there and give us the tax-free threshold figure—considering what it was in 1983 and what it is now—and not index it is beyond my comprehension. But that is the sort of fudging he does all the time. He makes the figures fit his story, which is fallacy, which is fabricated and which does not hide anything from the Australian public, because they know. They see poverty every day; they see people lining up at the welfare agencies looking for assistance and help.

         He either ignores or he does not realise—but I do not think that is the case; I think he most probably chooses to ignore—the statements made recently by a large number of people who are highly regarded in this area. For example, the director of the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, Dr Peter Saunders, stated that poverty grew rapidly in the 1980s despite growth in employment and the introduction of the family allowance supplement for workers on low incomes.

         A Bureau of Immigration and Population Research study, commissioned by the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, released on 30 September 1994 found that an increasing number of children from non-English speaking backgrounds are living in poverty and sometimes going without food or adequate clothing. Then we see another study by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, University of Canberra, a report released in the middle of this year. Professor Ann Harding reported that the rise in unemployment and the decline in full-time male employment between 1990 and 1993 would lead to a greater increase in inequality in the early 1990s than was experienced in the 1980s.

That is where the biggest gap is, between the poor in Australia and our rich Prime Minister, who chooses to engage in buying French clocks and a $2.2 million house. `Advance Australia unfair' is the refrain we ought to be hearing in our national anthem.

         In the last 11 years of Labor government there has been a dramatic improvement in the lot of people in this country, and no widening of the gap. If we spend the time this afternoon, as I suspect we will, with my quoting my sources and Senator Patterson quoting her sources, I do not suppose we will feel any more convinced at the end of the time. But I think it important to put on the record some of this government's achievements and, in particular, to again remind those opposite that none of the calculations of poverty or measurements of inequality calculate in the social wage, which has made such a considerable difference not only to the quality of people's lives but also to how they are able to manage their lives.

Sole parent pensioners with two children, renting privately, have had a 37 per cent increase in real terms, from 91 per cent to 103 per cent above the poverty line.

That is what our social security payments are about. In the past people eked out a very miserable existence or had no access to social security at all. I can remind those opposite what it was like in Australia 100 years ago and of what in fact it was that women were campaigning for: improving the lot of families, a fair wage, equal pay, health—

I have just read the figures that point out how inequality, the gap between the poor and the rich, is not as Senator Patterson says because in particular of the increase in payments, which means that people have an assurance of food and shelter and assistance with the rent—all benchmarked and indexed payments on behalf of children, particularly those in low income families. All those things are in place, and all those things have dramatically increased in the life of this government. They are real increases, not just increases.

         This fact is not captured in many of the academic studies, which generally use the ABS distribution survey. That undercounts social security and veterans' affairs expenditure by $3 billion. A few other important things do not get counted: Medicare, for example, whereby families earning below about $20,000 and single people earning about $11,000—I do not have exact figures—do not have to contribute to the Medicare levy. Those families have complete health coverage with not $1 outlay by them.

Senator Patterson is saying that there is a gap. For a number of reasons, I am saying that there is no gap.

        At the end of the 1980s most Australians were indeed `living decently'. Material affluence was at an all-time high. Australia was not the world-leader in equality, but it still ranked around the middle of the dozen most equal countries in the world. Australia is a world-leader when it comes to social mobility; that is, both privilege and disadvantage are less likely to be inherited in Australia than in any other country. There is disadvantage, of course, but one of our more positive findings is that disadvantage in one aspect of life is often offset by advantages elsewhere. Our positive picture of high levels of affluence and of relative equality is at variance with the `gloom and doom' that is typical of many editorial writers and political and social commentators.

        I will move on to some figures about the so-called comments attributed to Ann Harding and the claim that her papers purport to show that 1.8 million Australians are living in poverty. These figures are a gross exaggeration. Indeed, Professor Harding herself suggests that her work should be used in analysing the distribution of poverty, not its total level. Her analysis uses the so-called Henderson poverty line—an arbitrary line based on the 1966 basic wage, adjusted for family composition according to a study conducted in New York in 1954. By fairly common agreement, it is no longer a reliable baseline which, by the way, has increased by 16 per cent over the last decade as a result of increasing household disposable incomes, partly as a result of rising labour force participation by women. This means that this poverty measure has the perverse result that rising affluence in the 1980s actually increased poverty. So I do not believe we can settle for those kinds of conclusions.

         An earlier study by Harding which used actual social security payments suggested that there may be as few as zero sole parents in poverty. We have to appreciate that these studies do not include all of the same data, nor do they compare apples with apples or pears with pears. It is difficult to make any reasonable conclusion on studies that are not using the same data, not analysing all of it in the same way or, in fact, including much of the social wage data anyhow.

Pension rates, when measured against the CPI, have increased by 15 per cent under this Labor government but fell by two per cent under the Fraser government. The evidence shows that countries that have experienced the greatest increase in inequality are those countries that have implemented the sorts of labour market policies proposed by the opposition. One example of this is the United Kingdom. The opposition wanted to slash $10 billion off the social wage at the time of last year's election—and it still tells us it wants to slash the deficit. There is only one place we can go to slash the deficit—that is into welfare; cutting welfare payments.

In 1994, the Year of the Family, nearly 20 per cent of Australia's children live in a family with no breadwinner. Only three short years after that ill-fated date in 1987, and some 11 years under the Labor government, Australia is no closer to solving the problem of inequality and poverty. In fact, studies show that during the past decade, poverty and inequality have risen dramatically. Poverty, Adam Smith wrote, is `not having enough to live without shame in your own community'. In communities around this country it seems that more and more Australians are forced to live in shame.

Yet this perception of a middle-class society is nothing more than a myth, a vestige of the 1950s and 1960s ethos when the middle-class was a growing sector in our society. In the 1990s we are a much more polarised society. Australia's middle class is shrinking while both ends of the economic spectrum are growing.

For the low wage earner, benefits, like those provided by the state to the elderly and the unemployed, are scarce. In fact, studies show these working poor are the most affected by the inequalities in wealth distribution. So by just looking at income levels we may get a distorted picture of the poverty levels and wealth distribution. In measuring wealth transfer levels in Australia we need to draw comparisons between those at different stages of the life cycle and different levels of the work force and assess just how the scarce public funds are to be distributed.

         One of the greatest arguments for the redistribution of wealth is founded in the area of health. Health is too often treated like economics. People are encouraged to think that the size of the cake is more important than how it is shared. This argument is particularly sensitive in the area of health and inequality. There is a stronger belief that a nation's health and living standards are positively correlated, but such beliefs can be misleading. The constant rhetoric about rises in GDP gives little comfort to the ailing in our society. In fact, it is estimated that between only 10 and 25 per cent of the improvement in life expectancy can be directly attributed to rises in living standards. Thus in health economics the connection between living standards and health standards is tenuous. The real relationship is between income distribution and health.

Senator Herron, in making some of his points, highlighted the first point that I wish to make, which is that at this stage we are not able to get a proper measure of wealth and of income distribution in Australian society. That is partly due to some of the issues that Senator Herron raised about the changes that are occurring in Australian society—the different work patterns, the different family living arrangements and a whole range of other issues that mean that references to things like the Henderson poverty line are woefully out of date.

         This points to the need for a much more reliable analysis of wealth and income distribution in Australian society. All of the measures, such as the ABS income distribution series, fail to address the totality of the picture that one would need to have to make a proper analysis. I question whether there is a widening gap, but it is difficult to come to any conclusive view on that question because there is no proper analysis that takes into consideration all the necessary points, such as those the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, mentioned—the social wage and in particular Medicare—and other issues such as the increase in superannuation in the Australian work force and further changes in the taxation area, which will also need to be accounted for in any proper analysis.

The impact of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax on wealth distribution in Australian society also need to be taken into account. With the fringe benefits tax, the cashing out of previously uncounted income will have quite a substantial impact on some of the measures that were traditionally used in assessing these issues. We have to move towards a much better analysis in this area.

         There is poverty in Australian society but I think the record of this government in attacking the causes of that poverty is a good one. The key issue in determining poverty in Australian society is employment. No government has been more committed to creating employment in its economy than the Australian federal government. We realise that the general condition of the economy is the key to that employment growth, but we have also been very conscious of the need to help the long-term unemployed—those who are most likely to become the long-term poor.

         The cupboard is bare because the Keating government has a big city focus, and has had this focus for the 11 years that it has been in power. It is myopic to the changing face of rural Australia. The tale going around is, `When did the Prime Minister see that there was a drought?' The reply is, `It was when his backbenchers told him.' The reason it took so long  is that there are not too many ALP members in the vast tracts covered by the present calamity of drought.

         Firstly, for many years this government ran a high inflation economy. The farmers who export most of what they produce are subject to the vagaries of international markets. Because they could not pass on the increased costs of production they found that their costs were rising by anything from 10 to 14 per cent every year throughout the 1980s. That helped to precipitate a massive collapse in their terms of trade.

         Secondly, interest rates soared way above the levels of those of our competitors and have continued to stay there. It should not be forgotten that, for over 18 months, farmers paid interest in excess of 20 per cent per annum. Even now, many farmers are still paying in excess of 14 per cent. While the government bleats about what it is doing to help farmers and the rest of rural Australia, it is still pursuing economic policies that continually push interest rates up for everybody—not just farmers, but for home buyers as well. With the current account running as it is, and with the deficit increasing, there can be no other result than higher interest rates. The recent one per cent rise in interest rates alone will cost the farm sector approximately $170 million extra in yearly repayments.

         Thirdly, the government stands condemned because it has allowed the farming community to bear the full brunt of the costs of deregulation. This government has left everyone else insulated from the harsh realities of economic life while it has stripped away virtually every assistance that the farming sector receives. It still costs up to three times more in this country to process a kilogram of meat than it does in America, or twice what it costs in New Zealand or Argentina. These are the nations we are competing against in Asia. Take a look at the shipping industry in this country. It is still disappointingly ineffectual after the now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, was put in charge of reforming the waterfront. That process cost taxpayers nearly $400 million. I do not think we got value for money.

It has burdened isolated employers with the fringe benefits tax. It has pushed fuel prices unnecessarily high by using fuel excise as a way of raising nearly $10 billion per annum, of which only $870 million is returned to the national roads program.

         —It is not really surprising that two-thirds of the 1.8 million Australians living in poverty are families with dependent children. Firstly, the income tax system no longer recognises the number of people who live on a given income. Secondly, there has been a stagnation in real incomes over recent years. We heard Minister Cook today almost boasting that wage levels have been kept down and that the income from that area has been kept down to point something per cent. Thirdly, both the federal and state governments have increasingly resorted to increased indirect taxes which bear more heavily on families, especially larger families.

         Fourthly, governments are moving towards either increased charges for basic facilities, such as water, or are levying disguised taxes on consumers of basic utility services through forced dividend requirements on public utilities. Fifthly, because family payments were inadequately indexed, their real value is less than what it was in 1979 when family allowance was introduced in place of tax rebates and child endowment. I have talked about this before and I do not want to go into that further today.

         Faced with these unfavourable trends, there has been a predictable but sad economic and demographic response. Fewer people are choosing to have children, and many are having fewer than they would otherwise prefer. Couples are hanging on to living standards by both seeking paid jobs and avoiding, in many cases, having dependent children. Fewer and fewer families can now exist on one income, and that is devastating. Much of the demand for child care for children of mothers in the paid work force is really generated by necessity, and not choice. One of the big demands that is not fulfilled is for infant places in child-care centres.

         The government should come clean and stop pretending that its child-care policies have anything to do with the welfare of families, children or women. The reality is that the government wants to force women and mothers with dependent children out of the home and into the paid labour market. I have been working for many years, and still am, for the cause of women in the paid work force. I am proud to do so. I am proud of our record in that case. But we have to look at the question of choice, and what occurs when we do not have that choice and the effect of that not only on the people concerned, but also on others.

         If it is not the government's intention to try to force mothers into the paid work force, why else would it discriminate so harshly in financial terms against those mothers who wish to care for their own children and not compete for scarce jobs. Indeed, the government has implicitly admitted that its policies are not directed towards free choice. Have honourable senators heard that? The government has admitted it. On page 12 of Australia's national report on population at the recent Cairo conference on population development, the government stated:

        The government goes on to state that one of its responses has been to foster an increase in the size of the labour force through encouraging the increased participation of women. So there we have it—admissions in the International Year of the Family that the government sees mothers with young dependent children as just another pool of tax slaves. Forget choice; forget what is good for children or for their parents; forget what they want; Treasury needs and must have its taxes. That is what a lot of this is all about.

         What seems to be passing unnoticed, however, by both the government and most economic commentators is that the government's policy is not even economically rational. The more mothers are forced into the paid work force by the declining real wages of their husbands—or vice versa—and increased tax burdens and charges to take up paid employment, the less able they are to have the children they might otherwise want. The more mothers or fathers are forced into the labour market when they would prefer not to be there, the higher the participation rate and the more difficult it is to reduce unemployment.

         We reap what we sow. The shocking statistic that one in 10 families with children has both parents unemployed is a logical result of an economic system which has been designed to force labour force participation by both parents. Surveys by the Institute of Family Studies have shown that many mothers want genuine choice. Why does the government not give them genuine choice? They and their husbands value direct parental input in bringing up healthy, well-adjusted children. They are being told by the government that they are second-rate citizens and that, unless they are clocking a nine-to-five workday on top of their obligations, they are somehow slack halfwits.

         —In the very few minutes available to speak on this report, I should like to briefly point out to the Senate and, of course, to the taxpayers of Australia the situation we are facing with road funding. It might be all very well for Mr Brereton to put out a glossy report like this on what has happened in land transport in Australia in the last 12 months—and worthwhile programs have been carried out or even completed in the last 12 months—but unfortunately road funding in real terms is dropping and dropping and dropping.

         The situation is that we spend on roads not quite 7c a litre from the fuel excise gathered by this government. At the last count, the fuel excise is about 32c and, of course, will rise again under indexation twice a year. That excise escalates without anyone knowing—it just turns up at the bowser on the appointed day; and the government does not really get the flack it would get if a bill went through each time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of that 32c or thereabouts, give or take a few decimal points, just under 7c is going back on roads. It is certainly far short of what should be going back to maintain roads at a standard expected in a country of this size, where there are massive road distances and massive rail distances—after all, this report covers rail as well.

         I notice that at the last count the National Rail Corporation's network is not as up-to-date as we were given to believe in the Working Nation package. I do not know quite how long ago that was, Mr Acting Deputy President; you might be able to fill me in on that—but it is a while ago now. Whatever was supposed to have been spent on rail in that time, to my knowledge, has not led to the completion of that network.

         We did have one good measure from one of the programs some time ago when, I think, Mr Brown, who was Minister for Land Transport at the time, put in place the black spot program. I criticised it at the time as a vote catching exercise in places where the government had marginal seats.

         However, I am happy to admit that I was wrong in that criticism because, under Mr Brown, that plan worked successfully. The program having worked successfully by fixing a lot of the black spots that existed around Australia, I thought the government would have kept that program up and picked out priority areas where the highest number of accidents occurred and concentrated on those, as well as on the other areas on which road spending should have occurred along the line.

         Of those black spots on which work has been done, the engineering has been well done and the works have been carried out to make them safer. I can point to a particular spot in Western Australia where, unfortunately, a son of a good friend of mine was killed last year.

         Unfortunately for him, that particular road was rectified under the black spot program only a matter of months after the accident, and now one would have to be blind to get into a bad situation there. It is not too late for the government to look at getting this program on track again.

         Outside of that, this government must increase spending, because in real terms what has been allocated to roads is far below in real terms that spent by the Fraser government in its last year in office. With the ever increasing excise on fuel, at least some of that extra funding should go back on roads.

Some of the projects being entered into are appropriate, but I wonder what progress has been made and what limits have been imposed upon those groups using the money as to when those moneys have to be expended. I have put some questions on notice to the minister, though they seem to be taking a long time to be answered.

         —I, too, would like to make some remarks on the annual report of the Department of Administrative Services, following those made by my colleague Senator Kemp, the shadow minister for administrative services. One of the matters which has concerned me over the past year is, of course, the way in which the Department of Administrative Services runs its property operations, particularly in relation to the Casselden Place building in Melbourne. On the last day of the previous sitting week a report by the Auditor-General into the Casselden Place building revealed that there had been significant financial incentives offered to DAS businesses within that building which, of course, is also owned by a DAS business and, ultimately, by the Australian taxpayer. That report revealed that the department has lost, on its own valuation by the Australian Valuation Office, no less than $103 million.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Walker QC, has said in a press release that that is only a paper loss. He compared it with losses made by the private sector in other buildings in Melbourne. Of course, his defence of that loss of $103 million of taxpayers' money entirely ignores the fact that no other landlord in Melbourne—and he referred to a number of landlords who have lost money on property deals in Melbourne during Mr Keating's recession—had the benefit of captive tenants who were not only forced to go into the building by the lessor, that is, the Commonwealth Keating government, but also were captives in relation to the terms and conditions of the rentals.

         The crucial point to make here is that in the government's handling of the Casselden Place cover-up, it initially sought to refuse to table documents relating to the leases in Casselden Place. I refer specifically to what occurred on 5 May 1994 when Senator McMullan said in the Senate, `There were no particular incentive packages involved in these deals.' Senator McMullan actually misled the Senate. Mr Walker not only misled the Senate by having a letter tabled which stated there were no incentives involved; he also repeated that in his press release of 20 October in which he said, `There were no incentives involved in these deals.'

         On that day, 20 October, Mr Walker tabled two letters, both from the Australian Property Group and both addressed to the DAS business units that lease these buildings. He said in his press release—and he probably hoped that no journalist actually read the letters—that they proved conclusively that there were no incentives involved, so he had not misled the parliament. The sad thing is that at least I read the letters, and the letters specifically describe the incentive packages offered to all the individual DAS business units.

         These incentives were offered to business units such as the Australian Archives. In a letter dated April 1993 there is specific mention of incentives, including a free fit-out and rent free periods to Support Services; Asset Services—contribution towards fit-out, rent free period; DAS Interiors—free rent, contribution towards fitting-out costs; and Project Services was given the same incentives. All of these businesses were offered incentives. They were used as inducements to ensure that these groups entered into leases with the Commonwealth. Those leases have yet to be signed. So they are incentives; they are inducements.

Both of those ministers need to be required to explain why they sought to mislead this parliament. If that explanation is not satisfactory, those ministers should certainly be called on to resign.

         Detailed planning started in 1980 at government request. Out of many consultations, arguments, options, world-wide investigations and expert advice, emerged a superb architecturally low-key treatment of the wonderful site that Yarramundi offers—and which we are now being told we must give up. A vision of display pavilions sited to allow the spacious environment, the lakeside, and the Brindabellas, to contribute their essence to what the museum will tell of land and people. Displays that will also emphasise the interactions between Aboriginal people and those who came later. And interactions between people and the environment.

         As a former member of the Museum Council and chair of its site development and buildings committee, since the closure of the Royal Canberra Hospital I have often been asked whether we would have preferred the Acton Peninsula in 1982 when we chose Yarramundi. At that time the interim council assisted by the NCDC rejected 12 other sites in the ACT (including the parliamentary zone) but did not consider the Acton Peninsula as an option.

         Certainly, we should never reject an opportunity to consider a better option. And it may not be too late to look at this alternative—but the option could only be considered after wide consultation with the people of Aboriginal Australia. Their story must be an indispensable feature. The museum must be as much theirs as it is of post-Aboriginal Australians.

         If the Acton Peninsula is a real option then it must be reviewed honestly and publicly. It would not be a cheap option. The present buildings on it would have to go and planting be replaced if the vision is not to be lost. Any consideration of the Acton Peninsula must not form part of a hidden proposal to scrap the great concept of a unified national museum in a spacious setting incorporating both indoor exhibits as well as outdoor vistas, events, and displays to tell the story.

         —We should all do what we can to see that this absurd decision is overturned and that Australia joins the other OECD countries in having a museum of which it can be proud, so that the children and grandchildren of those of us now making decisions will be able to see what this country is and how it has become the sort of place that it is. I do not believe we should abandon these ideals. It has been put in legislation. It is something that really ought to go ahead. One can only speculate about why the Prime Minister is so totally opposed to a national museum. I cannot imagine why any person in his position would have so little regard for his country, for its history and for how it has been developed that he would want to abandon this project. As I said, it is with considerable sadness that one reads the report this year, knowing that everybody who is concerned about it would want it to go ahead.

This is a Prime Minister who wants to abandon our flag and wants to abandon our constitution. He has no respect for our past. This is a government, for example, that refuses to allow the Navy Hydrography Office in Wollongong to be called after the extraordinary achievement in the

         One would have thought that `Matthew Flinders' was a very appropriate name to put on the Wollongong Navy Hydrography Office. One would have thought that it was appropriate that there should be a national museum of Australia. Whether it should be a Rolls-Royce one or a Mini Minor one is perhaps something there could be some discussion about. But the fact is that there is a determined approach to destroy the things that so many Australians regard as vitally important to them, and that is their heritage.

         This Prime Minister and this government, by seeking to damage the symbols of our history, of what we stand for, the symbols that are so important to so many people, are seeking to make changes that happen to suit their own agendas. Those agendas relate clearly, it seems to me, to the holding and exercise of power by any means. In other words, there is something far more sinister, it seems to me, in this general rejection of our heritage than simply in some sort of view that the particular heritage the Prime Minister comes from, an Irish one, should be one that predominates and should destroy, say, the Anglo-Saxon traditions or any of the other traditions that exist in Australia.

         We see in this parliament the way this government is seeking to make the executive all powerful and how it resents the role, for example, of the Senate, which has involved itself in the vital roles in Australia's history, part of our heritage. I would see this not simply as an isolated attack, but part of a general pattern of disregard for the things we stand for. I must say I think it is in very close association with the negative approach to the Australian flag, the national flag, which in one form or another has been with us since Federation. It is all very well having these nonsensical arguments about whether it had a red background, a blue background or a white background; the fact is that that flag in structure has been with us since Federation. It is that aim of destroying our heritage that, I believe, motivates the government in this negative attitude to the National Museum of Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —by leave—I thank the Senate and I thank the parliamentary secretary. The Australian Sports Drug Agency report clearly demonstrates that Australian professional boxing has got to smarten up its act. It has to clean up its act. We have a situation, as is evidenced on page 114 of this report, of two failures to comply in boxing—in other words, people refusing to take a drug test. When that happens in other amateur sports we find that sanctions are applied.

         For example, in athletics on 30 July 1993, there was a failure to comply with a drug test and the athlete was suspended for four years. In powerlifting on 16 August 1993 there was a failure to comply and the athlete was suspended for three years. But what do we find when we go to boxing? Failure to comply, no sanctions, because the people involved were professional boxers. I do not know what professional boxing thinks is the right thing, but apparently if you are a professional boxer you can be up to the eyeballs in dope and still be allowed to participate in that profession.

         It is not a matter of professional sports not abiding by the rules. Look at rugby league. Rugby league accepts the proper and reasonable role and, in fact, hires the Australian Sports Drug Agency to ensure that the sport is clean. There has even been testing for cannabis, which one could hardly regard as a performance enhancing drug, in rugby league. There have been cautions for inadvertent use of stimulants and also anabolic steroid tests—in fact, there was a ten-week suspension for one rugby league player.

         It does seem totally inadequate that professional boxing does not end up with sanctions against those people who have been found by the Australian Sports Drug Agency to have failed to comply with its tests. We have not seen a situation where there is a positive test in boxing, presumably because there must be some sort of instruction around the professional boxing business that says, `Look, don't get tested, just refuse, because there are no sanctions and it doesn't matter anyway.' That is totally unacceptable. I do not know what should be done about it but it seems to me that there should be the capacity for firmer action to be taken. One would hope that whoever runs professional boxing in Australia—in fact, in the world—should do something about this sort of ludicrous behaviour.

         There are some problems that strike me from the tables on pages 113 and 114 when the Australian Sports Drug Agency has not yet been advised of positive tests that took place up to a year ago. It is very important not only that these tests should be taken but that there should be appropriate follow-up action, and that the Sports Drug Agency should be advised of what it is.

         There are couple of other matters that I want to raise. One is that the report reveals that in May 1994 a review of the cost of drug testing services was initiated, and Price Waterhouse has been engaged to develop a costing model and provide advice on the full cost of the drug testing service. These results should be available in the current financial year.

         As the Senate would be aware, the coalition has long taken the view that there should be a great deal of cost recovery in this area, and I hope this Price Waterhouse report leads to this. I would also like to stress that the agency maintains its emphasis on out-of-competition testing by allocating 56 per cent of tests to this purpose. That is a very sensible approach, and I think we lead the world on that. Over 2,220 elite national level athletes identified by their national sporting organisations were exposed to year-round testing throughout this program. In other words, it is not good enough just to test people in competition, we have to do out-of-competition testing to see whether they are trying to build themselves up illegally and improperly away from the testing area. It is a very effective operation, because the threat of testing is very effective.

I see there was a visit to China by members of the Australian Sports Drug Agency following a visit to Australia by Chinese officials, and my understanding is that they are now some way towards setting up a bilateral agreement between those two countries. It is very important because even the most casual observer will notice the similarity between not only the training methods but also the confirmation of the Chinese athletes, particularly the Chinese swimmers, with the East Germans of an earlier time. Now that we are working towards that bilateral arrangement, it will give an opportunity for testing. There is very little testing presently done in China and it will give the Australian officials an opportunity to test, as I understand it, both in contests and outside the period of competition.

         The work of ASDA is very important. It is fair to say that when the agency was established it had what could only be regarded as a very large and enormously important task ahead of it. That task was to bring into existence a regime that would control the use of performance enhancing drugs—which, in many cases, can severely hurt the wellbeing of those who use them—thereby making competition in Australian sport, and international sport where possible, fairer. People who choose to use performance enhancing drugs against the rules of competition should not be able to achieve an unfair advantage over athletes who choose to compete without using performance enhancing drugs.

         One of the dilemmas facing Australia in our fight against the abuse of drugs is, as Senator Crichton-Browne said, that it is all well and good testing during competition, but unless random testing is done outside major competition as well, abuses can and will continue and the regime will not be fair. ASDA is to be commended for the initiatives that it has taken in this regard.

         or some other current affairs program highlighted the problem encountered by so many Australian athletes who compete internationally. They live by our rules under a strict drug detection regime but they have to compete against international athletes who abuse performance enhancing drugs. It is crucial in the years leading to the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000 that ASDA remains in the forefront when it comes to entering into negotiations and agreements with nations that still have problems. That way, come the Olympics, Australian athletes will not be at a disadvantage.

Of course, that will be an enormously difficult thing to achieve. Among the nations of the world there are different levels of enforcement. In some there is very little enforcement and little motivation, incentive or intent to introduce appropriate regimes.

         The dilemma was highlighted by Lisa Curry-Kenny. Talking hypothetically, she said that if she came 11th, 12th or 13th in an international swimming race against the sort of competition that we have seen in recent months, she would still regard that as a great achievement. She said that if she knew that the 12 people who beat her were all on performance enhancing drugs, she would know in her own mind that she had won because she had played fair.

         I can say from my own experience in international sporting competition that it is not a lot of fun coming second or third, knowing the person in front has been cheating. Australian athletes have to sacrifice so much for athletic excellence. When they compete internationally and are the best on the day—they have done the preparation and training, they have made the sacrifices in terms of income, family and home life to be able to travel and compete internationally—it is not fair if they are denied a gold medal or a world championship or whatever because they are beaten by a drug-enhanced performance.

         That is the challenge for ASDA. We, as parliamentarians, and all Australians should be proud of ASDA as being a very successful Commonwealth agency.

          —I rise to speak on the government response to the report on video and computer games and classification issues by the Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies. I am pleased that the minister responsible, the Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, has responded positively to most of the committee's recommendations. I will come back to some of the crucial issues raised by the committee, and which the Attorney-General detailed in the government response, about regulating X- and R-rated computer games in Australia. Firstly, I would like to give the Senate some background to this matter.

          The advent of new technology in computer games saw promoters developing violent and sexually explicit material in a new format. The absence of any regulation by the government when the technology first came to Australia created a new gateway for X and R type material that states and territories needed to close. State attorneys-general became alarmed by the access of youth to this material, particularly after a lot of strong parental and community concern. This was stated to all parties.

          The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards became involved and after representations from similar groups, it decided to undertake a full inquiry into this matter. People should really understand that the material in this new type of technology which is driven by CD-ROM is very different from videos and films. It is far more graphic and intensive. It is very repetitive in nature and the material can be interactive. The impact on young minds is dramatically greater than the impact just from videos. The difference between videos and this material is as great as the difference between sound and video. The quantum leap in the effect is that great.

          The psychological impact, particularly on young minds or disturbed minds, can be very great. It is believed that there can be long-term effects on users. Overseas evidence seems to demonstrate that 17 per cent of minors gain access to this material as the technology spreads in other countries. The committee was so concerned that it undertook a series of hearings across Australia. We took evidence from child psychologists, educationalists and people in the medical profession. Most importantly, we also took evidence from people out in the community—parents and children. We had one very dramatic day here in the parliament when we brought in children from a local high school to tell us about the way they use these sorts of games and materials. It was a very eye-opening session when we heard from the young people.

          After these hearings we recommended that no R or X material would be allowed in computer games. What was needed, we felt, was a very strong regulatory regime to control this material across Australia to protect youth. The Senate report pressured the state and territory attorneys-general to rethink the need to bring in further regulations in their jurisdictions. We stressed at the time the need for full cooperation in our federal system to close this gate.

          At this point, in late 1993, one state, the ACT and the Northern Territory would not go along with this recommendation. Terry Connolly, the Attorney-General in the ACT, in particular was holding out strongly, wanting the R and X classifications to be allowed in this state. The great worry with that, even though the ACT is only a very small area, is that it would create a gateway like the one we currently have with X-rated videos through to the rest of Australia. The worry was that by mail order and computer modem transfer, this new material would also spread to the children of Australia.

          The information superhighway which is now developing would be a great conduit for carrying a lot of this material. It does not necessarily have to go through the mail. In the Northern Territory, our committee had heard evidence of the terrible impact on the Aboriginal community of the less graphic R and X video technology. The committee heard evidence that this material was causing social chaos with Aboriginal families. One suspects that this was the major reason why the Northern Territory then joined with the other six states in agreeing to stop R and X video games.

          The state, Northern Territory and federal censorship ministers agreed to act to ban R and X classifications for computer games. In April this year the Governor-General signed the ACT ordinance allowing the X and R classifications. This was a crisis point as the gateway to distributing the material to Australian children was now open, irrespective of all other governments' proper actions. It could all come in through the ACTU—I mean the ACT.

          —Yes, it is. It could come in through the ACT because of the ordinance the Governor-General had signed. This situation, I believe, made the federal government rethink and act to close this loophole. The minister, Mr Lavarch, gave an undertaking to amend the ACT ordinance to make the ACT conform to the national standard. Ministerial cooperation from the Northern Territory and the states was a high point in action to protect our youth. I thought that when the ACT was forced to join, that was an excellent demonstration of cooperative federalism.

          I would like to pay particular tribute to the work of the New South Wales Attorney-General, Mr Hannaford, who even took on Terry Connolly in debate on radio over this matter. His argument, particularly about parental concern, was one of the things that finally determined the issue.

          This issue raises considerable concern about the whole area of classification. It points to a number of problems with the national classification code. On the one hand, this code says that adults should read, see and hear what they want. On the other hand, the same code says that minors should be protected from material that is likely to harm and disturb them. Those two principles clash constantly in the area of this video game material in this time of very rapidly changing technology.

          Recommendation 2 says that ministers need to enforce measures with strong penalties and prosecution as a realistic deterrent. Mr Lavarch must emphasise this to his ministerial colleagues in the states and territories, because they are the people who have the power to enforce penalties. Recommendation 4 says that parents will not able to stop children viewing material if the gateways are open. We were pleased that the minister saw the weight of this argument. Recommendation 5 says that there is a need for an MA classification for video and computer games to protect children 15 years and under from unsuitable material. The minister says that some states and territories will not have this MA rating, allowing access to games for people under the age of 15. This loophole will be closed very soon because the parliament now has before it new uniform Commonwealth legislation, the Classification (Publications, Film and Computer Games) Bill which will solve that problem.

          Recommendation 11 says that the length of tenure of censorship board members needs review. Unfortunately, the government has ignored this recommendation. The committee during the hearings became greatly concerned about the way the office of film and literature classification operated. We believe a lot of the problem comes back to the way the board is staffed. People are there for a very long time. A number of them are ideologically driven. They are desensitised and there is no proper community input.

Virtually all of them are either lecturers in journalism or are journalists. The chief censor keeps telling us that it is a representative cross-section of the community, but it is not. It is a number of trendy journalists who have a particular ideological view—and it is driving censorship in this case. We have made a number of very sensible recommendations including that the chief censor becomes the chief executive officer. We believe that the government would be wise to follow this recommendation.

          My motivation for becoming a part of this committee—and I believe every other member of the committee had similar motivation—was the number of people who approached me on a personal basis about injustices they believed had been forced upon them, whether they be in the Public Service, the police force, the bureaucracy or private enterprise. I know that one of the reasons why the chairman, Senator Newman, brought this matter forward was a case involving a person in Tasmania who, I am pleased to say, has received some sort of justice since this report was brought down. He has received a financial payment from the bank that he was having problems with. That all appears in the evidence.

          We were most impressed with the genuine evidence that was given to us throughout the inquiry. Whilst I will later touch on some of the personal things that I remember so well about this report, I would like now to touch on the major recommendations. They fell into three categories. We felt, first, that it was very important to change the attitude of people towards whistleblowers and the public interest benefits that proceed therefrom. It was very easy to get the impression during the hearings that people can easily be tagged as dobbers. I suppose most Australians do not like a dobber. In the cases of the people we spoke to, they were genuinely concerned not only about their jobs but about the organisations they worked for. They were mostly concerned that no action had been taken in lots of cases and in other cases they had been victimised and shunned for trying to do the right thing.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Secondly, we felt that the procedures that currently exist fall very short of the mark. The internal systems and reporting systems that should exist within organisations, whether they be in the private sector or the public sector, were just not good enough to deal with the cases of maladministration or corruption that people were finding in the system. In estimates committees and as part of our parliamentary duties we get evidence all the time of waste, of mismanagement and of fraud. It is most important that people be encouraged to report those matters so that not only can justice be done but also the government can save what would run into many millions of dollars.

          The most important recommendation we made was the recommendation for the creation of an independent public interest disclosures agency and a board to undertake and oversee that agency. One of the concerns we had was that a lot of the people who came before us had been through the system as it exists. They had been to merit protection and review agencies, the ombudsman and all sorts of people. Initially, these people went straight to their immediate boss. One of the things that came to my attention and impressed me was that, in these long drawn-out cases, the initial report that was done on a particular public servant, or whoever, almost became the benchmark. If people looked at a case further down the track or went for justice somewhere else, whoever was investigating that—whether it was the ombudsman or whoever—always went back to the first report that was made by the superior officer or the manager of the person making the complaint, and there was a mind-set. No matter what happened, that initial report—no matter how good or how bad it was—became the standard for what followed.

          I think this is why it is most important that we have an independent agency to which a person who feels he has not received justice by going through the normal process can go and know and trust in the people he is dealing with. The board we recommended would consist of nominees from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, the Privacy Commission, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office, the Merit Protection and Review Agency, a recognised whistleblower support group, a public interest advocacy centre, an ethics group, a trade union and other national community organisations. There would also be a parliamentary involvement, with the appointment of a senator and member of the House of Representatives. I believe we would have a totally independent and well-intentioned board and agency that could handle the huge amounts of requests which are coming from people within the Public Service and private enterprise.

          We were somewhat critical of one or two cases, particularly in Queensland. I will not go into any great detail about those particular cases. My colleague Senator Woodley, from Queensland, has touched upon one of the cases involving a person called Kevin Lindeberg. My colleague Senator Parer spoke about the same matter. I know that Senator Chamarette has the same sorts of feelings that I do about this. So we have four senators who, after hearing dozens of witnesses, at the end of the day came down with the same opinion: that Mr Lindeberg was sadly done by. I refer to a press report which appeared in a newspaper in Queensland and in which he had the opportunity to put his point of view. He said that he was still a member of the Labor Party even though he has not received any justice from the Labor Party in the state government in Queensland. We noted in our report our concerns about this particular matter and about unresolved cases.

Senator Woodley has already very eloquently put that matter forward.

A professor who was giving evidence to us had, on that very day, been removed from his office because he dared to criticise the vice-chancellor about research in the university and where the money was going. It was not only unusual but very memorable.

         I refer to the report of the Committee's Inquiry into Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment in Australia which was tabled on 9 June 1994. The report was very timely for the Program as it amassed a large body of information, including statements of view from many influential individuals and groups. This information will be extremely useful in developing policy and planning for the future of the Program.

         A Government response to the report was due within 3 months of tabling. However, many of the issues raised in the report are outside the scope of the Department and we are in the process of consulting widely with other Commonwealth Departments, and the State and Territory Governments to formulate a response.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The following general comments in response to the report are provided for your information at this stage. On the whole, the report supports the general direction that the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer is taking. The outcome of the Inquiry was strongly supported by the State Program Managers.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The report recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in co-operation with the States and Territories, undertake a national education campaign promoting the Program. Such a campaign is currently being developed and is due to be launched in February 1995. The campaign will be targeted at both women and General Practitioners and will specifically address some of the issues raised in the report. In addition, a Working Group on the Provision of Consistent Information to Women has been established. The role of this group is to liaise with the States and Territories to develop consistent messages on a variety of issues within the Program. This will ensure that State/ Territory education campaigns and general methods of information provision carry consistent messages across the nation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The report recommended that the supply of radiographers and radiologists be regularly monitored by Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments. This is currently an issue of great importance within the Program and workforce issues remain a standing agenda item of the Commonwealth and State/Territory Managers meetings. The Commonwealth is currently developing a strategy to investigate the problems related to the supply of radiographers and radiologists for the Program.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The report also recommended that the Program improve access for women in rural and remote areas. Under the funding arrangements for the continuation of the National Program, funding will be provided to better enable the States/Territories to provide services to these women. That component of funding will be calculated at a higher cost per woman screened. The formal offer of this funding to the States/Territories will be made in September.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The National Advisory Committee has recently endorsed a paper titled Policy and Practice in Relation to Symptomatic Women in the Program. The statements in the paper are consistent with the recommendations in relation to symptomatic women in the report (Recommendations 11 and 12). It is intended that a number of similar policy papers will be written and included in a Manual of National Program Policy Documents. This will also assist in the promotion of consistent information about the Program to various audiences.

         It has not been possible to undertake the level of consultation necessary to prepare an adequate response for tabling by 8 September 1994. It will also not be possible to respond to recommendations 18 and 19 until after the House of Representatives Committee has reported. It is expected that the Government response will be available for tabling by mid-November.

         GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE INTERIM REPORT OF THE JOINT/STANDING COMMITTEE ON ELECTORAL MATTERS ENTITLED `FINANCIAL REPORTING BY POLITICAL PARTIES'
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In May 1994 the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSC) resolved, pursuant to its more general reference covering the conduct of the 1993 election, to take evidence on the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act). It did so in response to a number of representations on the administrative burdens imposed by the requirement for registered political parties to furnish to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Annual Returns of income and expenditure. This requirement was introduced by the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         2. The JSC advertised its inquiry in the national press and in response received nine submissions from individuals, political party organisations and the AEC. Public hearings were conducted on 6 and 7 June 1994.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         3. The Interim Report of the JSC entitled `Financial Reporting by Political Parties' was tabled in Parliament on 30 June 1994 and contained nine recommendations.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 1
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         4. That Division 5A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and associated regulations be amended as necessary so that Annual Returns by registered political parties list a total amount of expenditure, rather than individual transactions within that total.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         6. The Government remains fully committed to the essential objective of disclosure as expressed in the second reading speech of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 that "electoral financing in Australia should be open and transparent" to minimise the risks of corruption in funding political campaigns. The Government does not believe, however, that this objective is significantly enhanced by the requirement for parties to record and report transactions within set categories as currently set down in the regulations. The Government proposes, therefore, that the requirement for parties to disclose their expenditure under particular categories should be removed.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         7. In order to maintain the spirit of the current legislation, the Government would wish to retain the requirement that payments to any individual or organisation equal to, or exceeding the threshold of, $1500 be disclosed. It would no longer require parties to disclose the individual transactions within that total. It proposes that the legislation be amended so that only transactions of $500 or more need to be aggregated when determining whether the threshold is reached. These changes would apply to individual party units and therefore substantially lessen the administrative burden placed upon them.

         10. This recommendation is welcomed by the Government as it would enable more timely processing of Annual Returns by the Australian Electoral Commission prior to their release for public inspection. The Government realises, however, that the shortened reporting deadline would be a further burden on political parties if the reporting requirements were not streamlined and acknowledges that the shortened period is only practicable in terms of party administration if recommendations 1 and 3 are implemented.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         13. The Government proposes that the recording and reporting of income received by political parties be simplified. This would be achieved by removing the reporting categories specified in the regulations and the requirement to report certain individual income transactions. It is proposed therefore that only where individual transactions exceed $500 will the particulars of those transactions be required to be recorded by party units. In addition, only where the total of such receipts (i.e. sums exceeding $500) by a party unit from an individual or organisation aggregates to $1500 or more would the source and total of that income then need to be disclosed. The requirement to disclose each individual transaction within those aggregates would be removed.

         17. While the Government is in favour of simplifying reporting requirements as far as possible, it is of the view that there remains a need for sufficient checks to ensure that the integrity of the system is maintained. The Government sees one means of achieving this as being the maintenance of third party reporting which would enable an appropriate level of verification to be conducted by the AEC.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         18. The Government does believe, however, that third party reporting should be made consistent with the disclosure requirements of political parties. The Government proposes, therefore, that the legislation be amended to require donors to lodge annual disclosure returns rather than submitting returns following an election. Consistent with this annual reporting requirement, the disclosure threshold would be reduced from $4500 to $1500.

         Recommendation 5

        <para font-size="-=2">
         21. There is nothing in the current legislation which prevents State agents or any other party official from being present at local audits, and indeed it has been the practice of the AEC to allow them to attend. The Government acknowledges, however, that the present provisions do not guarantee party agents the right to be present if they so desire. Accordingly, the Government is prepared to amend the legislation to provide party agents with the right to be present but, in order to retain an appropriate degree of flexibility for all involved, it proposes that the agent be given the power to delegate this responsibility or waive the right of attendance.

         22. That Part XX (Election Funding and Financial Disclosure) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to clearly require disclosure of income received by registered political parties from any trust fund or similar fund or account, where such income is above the disclosable amounts set out in the Act.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         23. The Act already requires the disclosure by political parties of all income received from any trust fund or similar fund or account. The Government proposes that disclosure be extended to include not only the donations made to political parties but also the deposits of capital into such funds and accounts where the fund or account functions substantially for the benefit of a party or parties. The Government does not seek to impose retrospective disclosure in respect of past returns, rather it proposes that if the Party receives any future interest payment from the same fund or from any new fund containing all or part of the original fund then the base source of capital that earned the interest must then be fully disclosed.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         30. Currently a Senate vote attracts a funding rate equal to one half of the rate payable for a House of Representatives vote where both elections are held simultaneously or three quarters of the funding rate for a House of Representatives vote where the Senate election is held separately. The election funding rates applicable at the 1993 federal election were 100.787 cents for a House of Representatives vote and 50.393 cents of a Senate vote.

         31. The Government proposes an increase in the level of public funding for a Senate vote so that it is equal to the funding level for a House of Representatives vote. The level of public funding for both Houses will be increased to $1.50. On the basis of election funding payments made at the 1993 federal election, this proposal would result in a budgetary increase in a joint House of Representatives and half Senate election of around $14.656 million.

         33. To give effect to what it understands to be the intention of this recommendation, the Government proposes to amend the Act to require a party agent making a claim for election funding to provide a statement either nominating a registered political party to which payment is to be made or advising that the claimant party does not wish to make a nomination. Where a nomination has been made the AEC must make the payment to the nominated party. This will enable State/Territory branches of parties to nominate that payment be made to the National Secretariat of the party.

          The committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated cost of $21.5 million. Most of the buildings at Kapooka were constructed in the 1950s and the 1960s and are now in need of refurbishment. Present working and living conditions at Blamey Barracks are below standard, with the rank and file and the recruit kitchen not meeting the building codes of occupational health and safety requirements. A need therefore exists to provide suitable working and living conditions for the recruits and staff stationed at Blamey Barracks, Kapooka.

A feature of the redevelopment, which those honourable senators who travel to and from Canberra airport will notice when the work is completed, will be the provision of a new main entrance. This is dictated largely by the ACT government's proposed duplication of Morshead Drive, which was examined by another committee some years ago. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence and the ACT government should discuss coordination of road construction with a view to the work being undertaken concurrently as soon as possible.

If the pilot project proves feasible, substantial savings in water and funds will be achieved. The committee has therefore recommended that, if no salinity problems emerge, the use of grey water should be extended to all playing fields at Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy, as well as other defence establishments where practical. I commend the report to the Senate.

       It was my privilege to lead the Australian delegation to Hong Kong and China. There were eight members and senators on the delegation. The very able secretary was Ms Andrea Griffiths, from the Department of the Senate. I think she would be known to all in this chamber.

        We went to Hong Kong for four days prior to our visit to China. It was not my first visit to Hong Kong. I was a member of a parliamentary delegation that visited the territory of Hong Kong four years ago. It was interesting to compare some of the changes that have occurred just in that brief four-year period. The major and quite overwhelming issue for the future of Hong Kong is the reversion of sovereignty to China to occur on 1 July 1997. Clearly, that is a major economic and political issue for people who live in the territory of Hong Kong.

We paid a visit to one of the detention centres, where we were able to meet boat people from Vietnam who are held in detention. I find this particularly depressing in the sense that these people are locked up for very long periods—in some cases, for years.

        What really hits one in China is the enormous economic changes that are occurring. China is one vast construction site. One cannot help but be impressed by the very significant economic growth, averaging about 12 per cent. That was clearly  evidenced everywhere we went. Generally, the economic growth is widely welcomed by all sections of Chinese society. Of course, that comes at some expense. The pollution of the environment was quite obvious everywhere we went. There was quite severe air and water pollution.

        Health and safety are issues of major concern, particularly in the workplace. Just before we visited Shanghai there had been a major industrial accident at a building site where a concrete pour had gone wrong and a number of people were killed. There is quite a serious level of accidents at the workplace in China. Interestingly, that issue and the issue of pollution of the environment are matters that are relatively openly discussed by Chinese people and by the official Chinese media. Corruption appears it be a significant problem. That, combined with the other issues, undermines confidence in the economic progress that is quite clearly being made.

        The events of Tiananmen Square are certainly remembered by people. The delegation raised the issue of human rights on a number of occasions during the visit. Interestingly, China is not a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and is very actively seeking entry into GATT. The delegation raised a variety of issues, including better access for our semi-processed wool in particular. Various issues relating to access for horticultural products were also raised, including the issue of access for apples from my home state. I am pleased to say that, since returning from China, that has been listed as an issue of priority for consideration for technical assessment for phyto sanitary conditions to allow access for apples into China.

        As part of the restructuring of the economy, there is a requirement by the Chinese government that a significant number of business enterprises become profitable and, in doing so, many of them are entering into joint ventures with overseas firms. The modernisation that is occurring in a number of areas—for example, management and capital upgrading—is again obviously leading to significant economic growth.

        Also of interest was the fact that a number of the plants that we visited—for example, the ACI bottle factory in Shanghai—were employing the very latest in technology. The Chinese were not simply relying on lower costs—for example, lower wages—but they were also relying on the latest technology to ensure not just a significant increase in production but a significant increase in productivity.

        It was again of interest to consider a bottle factory in Shanghai, amongst the most modern in the world, one of the largest in the southern hemisphere. However, the nature of the Chinese economy is such that the distribution system is very basic. In fact the bottles are hand-packed into hessian bags and then hand-loaded onto trucks for distribution within China. It is a very outmoded system of distribution which leads to a significant wastage of bottles through breakage. So one has this contrast between a very new technology, very modern techniques and high production and productivity levels in some areas of the economy, and a very basic distribution system in other areas.

        Senator Sherry mentioned economic development. Although China is indeed one vast construction site, it has reached rather differential stages of development. On our trip through Shaanxi Province, when we visited a school where the Australian Embassy had provided school books, which in itself was an experience, it was quite apparent that work both in the countryside in agricultural pursuits and in the cities in semi-industrial activities work was still being carried out in a very primitive manner.

        If one adds to that the speed of development and the introduction of technology, one cannot help but wonder what the social and employment effects will be.

I got an undertaking to have these lists processed through the department of justice and through the department of internal security to answer two questions which I posed: firstly, what is the well being of these people at this stage? Secondly, is there any likelihood of an early release? So far, no answer has been received, but I have written to the department again today, coinciding with the tabling of this report, requesting that an answer be provided.

        The argument that finally seemed to sway the departmental representatives to pay some attention to the human rights aspect was interesting to me. It was the argument that, if the legal system were being reformed to cope with corporations law, to cope with contract law, to cope with the general opening up of economic affairs with other countries, then people dealing with China or being asked to deal with China could not expect to have any confidence that the laws on corporations and contracts would be observed if the laws on the freedom and safety and security of individual persons were such that people could be, without due process, arrested and held. When in future we put forward human rights issues in our dealings with China, it will perhaps be useful to use that argument. If China wants to deal with us on an even footing as commercial partners, it must also accept the responsibilities of a legal system that guarantees the security of its citizens.

        It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to Senator Sherry as the leader of the delegation. It is in large measure due to him that the delegation was a success and was received with respect by dignitaries and other people in China. The delegation had the benefit of the services of Ms Andrea Griffiths, the Deputy Black Rod, who made sure in a very difficult environment that all the administrative details, of which there were many, were attended to with superb efficiency and with a cheerful face. The thanks of the delegation are due to both Senator Sherry and Ms Andrea Griffiths. I might add that although the delegation comprised members from across party lines, not only did we manage to survive the 15 or so days in a cooperative and friendly manner but we actually enjoyed each other's company. I will recall that trip with great pleasure in the future.

        Mr President, one of the major commitments in Working Nation is to ensure that the long-term unemployed get extra assistance to enable them to participate better in the jobs growth. The success of Jobstart in targeting long-term unemployed assistance is reflected in the drop in the number of long-term unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has fallen by 53,000 over the last year and by 73,000 since the last election, that is, out of a total seasonally adjusted job growth in that time of 356,000 people. This is against a backdrop where, during the 1980's, it took seven years and 1.6 million jobs to cut long-term unemployment by 109,000.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This legislation takes the targeting measures one important step further; it significantly extends case management services and opens those services and their provision up to competition. Experience is that this targeting of intensive one-to-one servicing is very successful in improving the opportunities for long-term unemployed people to obtain jobs. Case management will provide a continuing relationship between a job seeker and a case manager. Together they will develop a personalised package of assistance that will focus on effective job searching and matching to identify job opportunities. Where job search activity fails to result in employment, labour market program assistance will be provided.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The aim of this legislation is to promote full employment by providing a free employment service and to draw on a diversity of public sector, community and private sector resources, to achieve this goal as cost effectively as possible.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation provides the framework for development over time of an open competitive environment for the supply of case management services. A new regulatory body, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA), will be established independently of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET). One of its central responsibilities will be to encourage and facilitate contracted case managers to provide case management services in competition with Employment Assistance Australia which will be DEET's case management organisation, formed from part of the CES.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        ESRA will promote competition and fair and efficient market conduct. These arrangements are intended to meet the needs of job seekers, employers and the local community while maintaining high standards of accountability and probity in the use of the public resources. The longer term aim of the legislation is for job seekers to have a choice of case manager. The legislation also ensures that there are reciprocal obligations on job seekers through the use of Case Management Activity Agreements which will outline an agreed course of action for the case manager and job seeker. Agreements will focus the efforts of case managers and job seekers firmly on attaining employment for job seekers.

        the government made an undertaking to tackle long term unemployment by providing individually tailored case management services.

        One of the responsibilities of ESRA will be to fully determine what are and are not considered to be case management services, which will be set out in a disallowable instrument.

         Working Nation
        </emphasis>
        emphasis on the reciprocal obligations of job seekers, especially those who have become eligible for the Job Compact. For example, the case management activity agreement will require a Job Compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any offer of a placement under New Work Opportunities or the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. Contracted case managers will have a responsibility to monitor a job seeker's activity against his or her Agreement and to provide relevant information to the CES.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation will also require the job seeker's compliance with the case management activity agreement. The legislation provides that a case management activity agreement will take the place of a Newstart Activity Agreement or a Job Search Activity Agreement for the purposes of the Social Security Act 1991. Failure to enter into a case management activity agreement or to abide by the conditions of a case management activity agreement will have the same effect for the job seeker as failure to enter into a job search or newstart activity agreement or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of those agreements. In other words, it will lead to a deferment of allowances fora period of time.

       <para font-size="-=2">

        The legislation does, however, stipulate that a case manager may not demand or receive any fees from a job seeker for the provision of case management services. All case management fees are to be paid by ESRA. In addition the legislation requires case managers to lodge case management activity agreements with the CES and to provide information to the Secretary of DEET concerning a job seeker's compliance with a case management activity agreement.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        One of the more significant accreditation decisions ESRA will be empowered to make is to specify classes of case management services. ESRA will ac credit case managers to provide either general case management services and/or one or more classes of specialist case management services. The initial classes of specialist case management services are likely to include, but not be limited to, services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with disabilities, people from a non-English speaking background, youth and people seeking employment in particular industries. ESRA will be able to change specialist classes as expertise develops and increasing numbers of case managers make specialisation in case management services more viable.

        Establishment of Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA)

        The government has made the commitment to provide case management services to all long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. This will involve approximately 500,000 people. The services are to be opened up to outside competition to help meet this commitment. Community and providers are to be funded to operate in fair and open competition with EAA in the delivery of case management services. Wherever possible, people being case managed will be able to choose between government and non-government providers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government has set clear targets for the numbers of cases it expects non-government providers to manage. In 1994-95, 10 per cent of cases will be managed by external providers. This will be increased to 20 per cent in 1995-96 and 30 to 40 per cent in 1996-97. The commitment to case management and the introduction of competition in its provision will ensure better outcomes for the long-term unemployed, improved levels of services for employers and better value for the money committed to funding the services.

        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This legislation reflects a bold and imaginative venture by the Federal Government. Together with the Job Contract and new incentive to employers through training and wage subsidies, it will better equip us to tackle unemployment and, in particular, long term unemployment. It will encourage into this field many community and business organisations which will bring with them special expertise, local knowledge and links with employers. In doing so they will provide a much wider range of choice of service for job seekers, and improve job seekers' chances of returning to employment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This represents a radically new approach. There is currently no well developed non-government case management market and many providers will be learning as they go. Equally for the government and for ESRA it will be very much a matter of learning by doing. While the legislation seeks to be as specific as possible, it also reflects the certainty that many new problems will emerge over time and there will be a need to set down detailed aspects of the new arrangements quickly to address unanticipated needs and problems.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation includes a number of safeguards against inappropriate use of powers. It provides for disallowability of instruments that define a number of key aspects of the arrangements. This will allow Parliamentary scrutiny of those arrangements. At the same time, the legislation gives ESRA and the Minister the power to act quickly and effectively to ensure proper protection of one of the most vulnerable sections of our community—long term unemployed people—from exploitation by the unscrupulous.

        The bill provides for the Ombudsman to investigate complaints about contracted case managers. The Ombudsman would be able to refer those complaints to the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA) where it is considered the complaint could be more appropriately dealt with by ESRA. The current provisions of the Ombudsman Act would already extend to the operations of Employment Assistance Australia.

        Proposed amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 also address difficulties created by recent amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1994. The amendments related to the reciprocal obligations of persons who receive Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance under that Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments were intended to provide for a period of notice to an allowance recipient before a deferment period was imposed because she or he had breached her or his obligations under the Act. The intended effect was that a person would receive an additional two instalments (four weeks) of Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance before payment of allowance was cancelled.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In practical terms, what these amendments seek to accomplish is a return to the procedures that existed prior to 4 July 1994. It is the Government's view that these procedures ensured that a person received sufficient notice of the consequences of failing to respond to a particular requirement made by the CES, before a decision was taken that the person was in breach of that requirement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Prior to 4 July 1994 the process for activity test breaches was that when an apparent breach of the activity test was identified, the person was contacted by the CES and given an opportunity to explain why he or she had failed to meet the particular requirement (for example, a request to attend a job interview, or participate in a training course). If the person's explanation satisfied the CES that the person had taken reasonable steps to comply with the requirement, or had sufficient reason for not complying with the requirement on this occasion, he or she was informed of this and no breach action was taken. If on the other hand, the CES was not satisfied with the person's explanation, the person was told that breach action would proceed and that a penalty (deferment period) would be applied, usually at the end of the current allowance pay period. These procedures ensured that the person received direct, personal notice of the penalty before it was applied.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The process ensured that a person was fully informed of the consequences of his or her failure to respond to a specific requirement to contact or attend the CES. If the person did not respond within 14 days of the first requirement, a second warning letter was sent to the person, reiterating the requirement and stating explicitly that if the person did not contact or attend the CES by a date 14 days hence, the person's allowance would be cancelled. This second letter not only gave the person a second chance to respond, but also gave prior notice of the penalty and when it was likely to be imposed, if the person failed to respond.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examined these procedures as part of its consideration of the proposed amendments. On the whole, the Committee was satisfied that the procedures provided sufficient notice of deferment of income support, without the need for additional payment periods.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments have also raised a number of matters of administrative and technical concern for both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training who are responsible for the administration of this legislation. For example, a deferment period cannot be expressed to commence until after the notice specifying the commencement date is actually received by the client. Therefore the decision maker is being asked to make a decision on an event about which he or she could not be certain at the time the decision is made.

         —Prior to lunch, I was addressing some comments about the issue of cooperation between the state and federal governments. I was speaking in response to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Collins). He said that the effect of our amendment mandating that the federal government consult with state governments would be that, if a state government were recalcitrant and did not cooperate, the process would fall down. The minister had picked on the Court government, saying that there would be quite a lot of potential for it to be recalcitrant.

         I had made the point that every state government besides Western Australia had agreed to pass complementary legislation under the native title regime, although none of those pieces of legislation have been proclaimed. The Western Australian government passed its own legislation, which both the federal and state governments regard as being not complementary. I also made the point that the Court government in practice had been extremely cooperative with the National Native Title Tribunal. Senator Chamarette has been made aware of that in hearings. I think it would be worthy of the minister if he is aware of the facts—and he may not be—to recognise that.

To this inquiry he appointed Mike Daube, who could never be considered a Liberal Party sympathiser and was formerly a very active member of the health department and a strong campaigner on smoking and health.

         Some of the recommendations—and I refer specifically to page 280 of volume 1 of the task force on Aboriginal and social justice—do refer to the issue of Commonwealth-State relations.

Remember, this report came out after 11 years of Labor government in Western Australia, with ministers, such as Ernie Bridge, a very dedicated Aboriginal affairs minister, and 11 years of federal Labor government. It is committed to Aboriginal affairs and has won a perception for the Labor Party that it is dedicated to Aboriginal affairs. This is a report that takes a snapshot of Aboriginal affairs after 11 years of federal and state Labor governments. This is the report which Mr Daube authored as chairman. It states:

        The operation of these parallel systems results in much duplication and even more confusion and cannot be seen as working to the benefit of either Aboriginal people or the community at large. The remit of this task force is to consider the role of State government agencies. The role of Commonwealth agencies is, however, of such importance that it is relevant to discuss their role and structure also, in the context of making structured recommendations on a more fruitful and co-operative relationship.

        I recommend this report to the minister, particularly the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner. I guess it would be against his principles to read anything that emanated from WA, just on the basis that it came from that state. But it provides very good reading. I certainly hope that the people who have responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, both within PM&amp;C and, of course, Minister Tickner's office, would at least read some of that report. Even if one research officer were to read it, it might help relations between Western Australia and the Commonwealth in this very important area. The issue of consultation which is highlighted in that report again makes the case for the amendment that would require consultation with the states.

         The issue of timing was raised by Senator Kernot and by the minister, again building up this picture that all of this consultation would ensure that it would take forever to get these strategies up and running. I will knock that argument over as quickly as I can. The minister argued this morning that the current consultation provision—that is, that you must consult with the ATSIC regional office and then you can consult with whoever else you may think is appropriate—was a catch-all that would obviously envisage consultation with other people in the area and possibly even, dare we suggest it, state governments.

         The reality is that if the ILC operates efficiently, as we hope and expect it would, as a matter of course, it would negotiate with the state governments and, as a matter of course, it would, we would hope, negotiate with other land councils and other Aboriginal communities that would have a stake in the process. The reality is that by actually saying, `We think you should do this and it is important that you do it,' the time that it takes to do it should make no difference because if the job is done properly, these things should be done, anyway.

         By way of example, if you wanted to go to the Kimberleys in Western Australia—and this is a very practical example—you would be mad not to speak to the Aboriginal affairs people within the state government. You would be absolutely stupid not to do so. They have shown they will cooperate. They have already cooperated with the Native Title Tribunal. When the ILC goes there and starts determining its regional strategy, we know that in effect it would probably be a matter of ringing up the Premier's office or Minister Kevin Prince's office, making an appointment and having a briefing from those officers who are responsible for that part of the government's land policy in relation to Aboriginal affairs. The briefing, I am quite sure, would take possibly half an hour or an hour. They could quickly lay on the table some maps, programs and policies and be cooperative, and that meets the requirement of this provision. I think that is all that it practically takes. It is just common sense and I think it is important that it be mandated and not left to the ILC. I think it would be inadvisable for it not to proceed along this track.

         So on the point of timing, I summarise by saying that the answer to the question raised by Senator Kernot by way of interjection is that if the ILC is doing its job properly, it will not take one nano-second longer under the provision that the Greens and the coalition are supporting than it would under the existing provision in the bill. It would not take one nano-second longer to get the strategies up and running and get the funding into operation.

         The principles that we are supporting in this amendment ensure that in the legislation there will be an obligation to have an integrated strategy that is open and able to be assessed for its validity. That is not to constrict anything. It is to help the Aboriginal community see that there is something in place to balance justice and equity across Australia. I think there is a danger of ad hoc allocations, even on urgency. I am one of the worst offenders. If something is urgent, I am more likely to address it than if it is important. I think that is the same danger here, where we have a very small amount of money.

         There may be people who are well prepared to make an urgent request. It may be an obvious urgent request, and there may be a great temptation on the board to meet it because of its validity. But there may be an unseen, equally urgent case somewhere else. By allowing that whole process, even if it is in relation to management, to hold matters up is a problem. I see not putting a time limit as leaving it in the ILC's hands as to how it devises that strategy. Hopefully, it will balance the immediate and urgent needs that we have had in this country for years and years of the need to establish credibility as an equitable agency in terms of allocating the funding, whether it is for management or acquisition. My support of the amendment does not alter. Obviously, it is something that the chamber should take into account.

        This amendment relates to section 191N(6), which relates to the tabling of the national strategy. Subsection (7) says that the minister must cause a copy of the national indigenous land strategy, or any changes to it, to be presented to each house of parliament within 15 days of that house sitting after the minister has received the document. There may be a typographical error there; my copy does not have `the house sitting'. I think it should have that in there. In any event, I will return to that in a moment. Subsection (8) states:

        On behalf of the opposition, I can see that there is some concern with subsection (9) because that would mean that nothing could happen until that time for disallowance had passed.

         The coalition is conscious of that one. However, the problem is that if we are to make it disallowable and say, `In the meantime, you can go ahead and purchase the land and perform your other functions as outlined therein,' and the ILC has gone ahead and purchased land and entered into all sorts of arrangements and then we disallow it, we run into trouble because it has then acted in a way which is ultra vires really because we have now disallowed the strategy. We cannot untangle the web which already would have been weaved. That is why we have inserted subsection (9).

         The main interest that the coalition has in this amendment is in subsections (7) and (8); that is, for parliament to have some sort of scrutiny over the strategy. It may be argued that if we set up a board like the ILC, we should not have any scrutiny. I would point to other areas where regulations are made, are subject to scrutiny and all sorts of instruments  are disallowable across a whole range of activity in the quasi-government jurisdiction.

         It would take a majority to disallow it, so it would be no mean thing if, say, the Aboriginal community at large were at great odds with this national strategy and went to its elected representatives and said, `Look, we don't like the strategy as it is. We want it changed. We believe the ILC has not considered the matter carefully enough and we want parliament to debate the matter and to disallow it.' Of course, if the matter were of sufficient importance and attracted a majority of parliament, I would submit that it would need to be ventilated in this place. It would have to be the coalition plus the Greens, an Independent, the Democrats or even the government agreeing. Nonetheless, for it to be disallowed it would have to be a matter of grave concern.

         The opposition is perhaps more ambivalent about subsection (9), to the extent that there are conflicting interests. We do not want to unnecessarily delay the delivery of the benefit. But, at the same time, we want to have some parliamentary scrutiny so that there is some other access for the strategy to be reviewed by parliament. It could be successfully reviewed only if there were a majority. I submit that, if we were able to get a majority to disallow, we would have to have pretty strong arguments to begin with. That is basically the sum of this amendment.

It is possible that, under the disallowance provisions, in an election year, for example, the regional strategies might be prepared in December and 15 sitting days may be a hell of a long time coming. I think in 1993 it took something like about four months to get 15 sitting days. The coalition does recognise that problem.

          No, it is okay. We do need, as I indicated privately, to divide on these things. I am just saying that I do recognise the problem. It should not be a problem unless there is an early election, because if the strategies are prepared on time, it would not take long for 15 sitting days to occur. I wanted to address the one argument and that is the `we know better' argument. It is not actually `we know better' because all of us represent Aboriginal constituents.

         This was the thinking behind the coalition's amendment, to ensure that it is tabled and to ensure that any Australian, and particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, will have access to the strategy. In the meantime, we have come up with some other consultation provisions which have just been passed. That ensures that the consultation is broader, but it is still important that anyone who is going to be affected by the strategy—any Australian at all—does have access to it. Subsection (7) will cover that. The thing about disallowance is that it does create an imperative upon the strategy reflecting the views of those people.

         —What do we do with this when it is tabled in parliament? We should uphold the very important principle that the parliament have a final say on matters about which the citizens of this country have specific concerns and on which the government of the day has a major input. The key point is whether the government of the day has a major input. Part of our responsibility as auditors of executive government actions is just that—to ensure that measures which result from a decision of a board appointed by the executive government of the day in some way come back to us.

         It has been said by Senator Ian Campbell that there may well be a number of Aboriginal people who are very concerned about a particular aspect of the strategy and that, if that is the case, they should have some final right of appeal. It is not that the government is going to determine what the strategy will be. Even if it were able to get the majority view of the particular chamber, all it would be doing is disallowing the matter and the strategy would go back to the ILC.

I am not happy with part (9) because it would unduly interfere with the way in which this is run, so I am not able to vote for that. It is important always to uphold the duties of this parliament in respect of the executive government actions, whether they be direct actions or indirect actions. Here the minister appoints the members of the board and the members of the board make the decisions. I cannot readily accept that any minister at some stage might not try to influence a member of the board he has appointed. Therefore, in my view, this is the way to safeguard undue exercise of ministerial pressure.

         The Greens feel that at all points our amendments have been directed to trying to make the ILC as separate from government as possible. We feel that, if we make it something that is answerable to parliament, while it may recognise that government component this may cause it to have more power than it should. We feel that the responsibility of the ILC is to be accountable primarily to the people. That is why we have moved the regional strategies approach.

         I think this should not be dismissed out of hand because—and I think this is where there is a slight difference between the government and the Australian Democrats in terms of what the opposition, Senator Harradine and the Greens have been saying all along about some of these amendments—we see the ILC as a government body. All our amendments have been derived around controlling that in order that it be more responsive to the people and more separate from government control. The only measures that we have included are the ones that we feel support the ILC's accountability to Aboriginal people and communities. The measures that we resist are the ones that tie it into government. Unlike the opposition and perhaps Senator Harradine, I feel that parts (8) and (9) tie it in far too much to government and parliaments. We are not at that useful stage where we have enough Aboriginal representation in this parliament to be an effective voice in those concerns.

I was using political rhetoric by saying it is secret. The reality is that the requirement is that the minister and clearly the members of the board get the document. The advantage of having it tabled here is that, if there is any controversy about it, it will become a national political issue.

         We all know that virtually any Commonwealth document is available to anyone who asks. People can go to an Australian Government Publishing Service bookshop and get virtually any document that this Commonwealth government prints. It prints a hell of a lot each year. So I admit that saying it was a secret document was of course political rhetoric and not intended to deceive my colleagues in this chamber or anybody else. But the reality is that the importance of tabling it, which I have stated twice already and I am very glad it was supported by Senator Harradine, is that it places a constraint on the minister and the board because it ensures that the whole world is aware of the strategy.

         The fine point about, and the importance of, part (8)—which I get to in a last-ditch effort to ask Senator Chamarette to support part (8)—is that the mere tabling of the document is, as Thomas Hobbs would have said, a covenant without a sword. It is of little effect. It does have the effect of ensuring that at least the document becomes public and, if people are unhappy with it, they can raise concerns about it. But the fact is that there is no penalty on the government if the strategy of the ILC does not reflect the hopes, aspirations and wishes of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whom we seek to serve.

         In relation to the point that Senator Chamarette makes about trying to keep it away from this parliament, I understand her philosophy. I am learning more and more about her self-determination philosophy—particularly over the last few weeks—and am beginning to understand it. As Senator Chamarette and I have said privately, and even on the Howard Sattler program on 6PR the other morning, there is a meeting of the ultra libertarian, anti-institutional philosophy of the Greens—I am again putting words into Senator Chamarette's mouth—and the libertarian aspects of liberalism. Even though we respect some institutions, we are very worried about too much government control over people's lives.

         This is a crucial issue. Part (8) is very important to me and that is why I said I would like to divide on it. The point I am getting to is that there is a difference. Many people in Australia think of parliament as government. They think we have too much government because we have local, state and federal parliaments. They conceive that government is actually all of the members of parliament, in their white cars and with their flashy allowances and overseas travel. Highly intelligent business colleagues of mine in Perth say, `Look, surely we could cut government by getting rid of state parliaments.' A bit of expenditure would be cut but parliaments are not a particularly expensive part of government. Senator Chamarette understands this because, on all of these principles of making government accountable to the parliament, she is always on our side. Just about every time since she has been here, she has voted with us when we have tried to have Auditor-General's inquiries, more responsiveness—

         Taking away the thing that I know worries Senator Chamarette most—which is that people cannot go and buy something until the national strategy is finalised—gets over the major hurdle. It is just saying that the strategy has to reflect the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people. If it does not they will ring up Senator Chamarette, me, Senator Ellison and the minster and say, `This is just a disgrace. We want you to disallow it.' Without that disallowance provision, part (7) loses a bit of its clout. I ask that Senator Chamarette give consideration to this. Time will ensure that a vote will not be able to be taken on this amendment tonight but I hope that, over the weekend or on the plane back to Perth, Senator Chamarette gives this amendment some serious consideration.

         —With Friday being Remembrance Day, and millions of Australians pausing at 11 a.m. to remember the fallen of all wars, I feel it appropriate to draw to the attention of the parliament, and the Australian people, the contribution of our secret army in the First World War. The secret army to which I refer is that group of Anzacs who were in fact ethnic Chinese and who, by virtue of the regulations of the day, were never meant to have been allowed to enlist in the first place.

         It must be remembered that, prior to the outbreak of the war, Australia's first years of Federation were absorbed in part by the efforts of the unions and the Labor Party to impose the White Australia policy. This was because of the fear that Australia would be taken over by Chinese.

         While many think that the Chinese population of Australia in the 19th century was composed entirely of itinerants on the goldfields, the truth is different. In fact, Chinese Australians were market gardeners, cabinet-makers, labourers, merchants and shopkeepers, but it was their role as shepherds and shearers in New South Wales that was most contentious, for it was part of the basis for the formation of the Australian Workers Union.

        One of the motivations for the formation of the union movement was the influx of Chinese workers into the pastoral industry, and the fear of their arrival in Queensland may have been one of a few factors behind the shearers' strike. Certainly the term `scab' was applied to the non-union Chinese who were thought to carry leprosy. Even after the turn of the century, Chinese and other Asians, especially Pacific islanders, were excluded from membership in the Australian Workers Union.

         Sir,—Having answered the Prime Minister's appeal for recruits, I journeyed to Melbourne to offer my services to my country. I attended the recruiting depot at the Melbourne Town Hall on Friday, the 14th inst., and after giving my name, age, and religion to the recruiting sergeant I was sent in with some others to the examining room, and told to undress, preparatory to the medical officer examining me as to my physical fitness. After my height, weight, and chest measurement had been taken by one of the officials there I was sent to the medical officer. Upon going before him I was told to get dressed again, and when I asked if I had failed to pass the medical officer said he would not swear me in. When leaving the depot, I received a certificate with "not substantially of European origin" written on it, and signed by the medical officer, Captain N. J. Gerrard. With the exception of being asked where I came from, I was not asked one question whilst before the medical officer. Now, sir, for your own guidance, I might state that my father was a British subject, born at Penang, S.S., and arrived in Australia in 1854. My mother was born in Tasmania in 1842, and I myself was born in this State in 1877. I have had six years' military training in the old Victorian Mounted Rifles, and 8th Australian Light Horse Regiment. My brother is at the front serving his King and country, having gone with the 1st Australian Division, and holds the rank of sergeant, but evidently the authorities at the Melbourne Town Hall depot seem to think I am not worthy of helping to defend the Empire. The Prime Minister has appealed to every man of military age to join the colours; but, if this is the treatment the native-born are to receive, I am afraid the appeal will fall on deaf ears. England and France deem it fit to use coloured troops to defend their shores, but the great Australian democracy denies its own subjects the same opportunities. I might state that I have gone to Melbourne on two occasions to offer my services to my King and country, and, after paying all travelling expenses, to be treated like this does not give one any encouragement to go again.—Yours, &amp;c.,

In spite of these regulations, many ethnic-Chinese did enlist in the AIF, and their heroism, bravery, and in some cases sacrifices, showed them to be truly the stuff of which the Anzac legend was made.

         While it will never be known exactly how many ethnic Chinese enlisted, in part because Eurasians with European fathers are now impossible to identify, I wish to tell the tale of a number of these brave men to preserve forever the contribution they made to the forging of our nation. One of those who enlisted at the outbreak of the war was William Edward `Billy' Sing, who was born in Clermont in Queensland on 2 March 1886. His father, John Sing, was a Chinese born in Shanghai. His mother, Mary Ann Pugh, was born in England.

         This small, dark man with the jet black moustache may have been Eurasian, but he was certainly not slow to enlist. His service number 355 shows that he was part of the original contingent of the 5th Light Horse. Arriving on the rocky shores of Gallipoli, he was assigned to the dreaded Quinn's Post, which was manned mainly by Queenslanders.

         Lest anyone think that all Chinese are short-sighted with thick glasses, I should point out that Sing was a crack shot in an army of crack shots. As a young boy growing up around Clermont, it is said that he was able to shoot the tails off piglets at 25 yards. So it is not surprising that he quickly gained a reputation as an extraordinary sniper who, during his time at Gallipoli, was officially credited with felling over 150 Turks and is believed to have accounted for a further 50 unofficial victims. It was Sing, too, who won a deadly duel with the Turkish sniper known as Abdul the Terrible. In recognition of his achievements and bravery, he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Belgian Croix de Guerre.

         Unfortunately, after returning to Australia, Billy Sing never did find a great fortune, although he did eke out a living on a gold lease before retiring to Brisbane, where he died of a heart attack at 304 Montague Street, South Brisbane, on 19 May 1943. Although he may not have been rich in monetary terms, there is no doubt that Billy Sing was rich in courage, spirit and loyalty to his country. A few years ago, a plaque was placed on the wall of the warehouse which now stands where Billy Sing passed away. I seek leave of the Senate to have a copy of that incorporated in

His conduct showed a never-failing example of fearlessness, resource and initiative."

         Les Kew Ming is also interesting in that both his father, Hi Kew Ming, and his mother, Louisa—the daughter of local bootmaker, Cum Moon—were Chinese Australians. In spite of this, he was given the opportunity to enlist and to serve his country, in large no doubt because of the attitude of a sympathetic local recruitment officer. No doubt a similar explanation is behind the enlistment of Walter Quan, who was born in Koondrook in Victoria to James and Ada Quan, and enlisted at Meekatharra on 23 September 1915 where he stated his occupation to be a miner.

I have seen a lot of Chinese and a lot of Eurasians, but I have never met one with blue eyes. Of course, if Quan's medical certificate said he had blue eyes, it was prima facie evidence that he was not substantially of European descent. It was no doubt on that fiction that he was allowed to join up. Having completed his training, Quan was assigned to the 13th Reinforcement 16th Battalion on 17 December 1915 and embarked for Egypt on the

The government has taken the jargon, used the rhetoric and hoodwinked us into believing that it might do something to protect our forests. Thanks to Senator Collins's recent information, we now know that there are still no adequate comprehensive and representative areas protected by the policy.

         The government has had about two years in which to implement it and it has only year to go before it is all supposed to be finished. But nothing is being done. I understand that, as part of the permit process, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) has to consider the advice of the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). But the way the woodchip export licence for north-eastern New South Wales was granted to Sawmillers Exports Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Boral, illustrates just how poorly this government implements its own policies and just how useless that process is.

         Senator Faulkner offered quite reasonable advice to Mr Beddall in that process, advice which sought to protect the best areas of old-growth and wilderness forest from logging, which sought to protect endangered species, and which attempted to set in place the comprehensive adequate and representative reserve system that the government's own policy requires. According to a detailed analysis by North East Forest Alliance, whose series of successful land and environment court actions in New South Wales has forced New South Wales State Forests to improve its EIS processes and endangered fauna measures, Mr Beddall's licence process is a joke.

         Of the 26 recommendations made by Senator John Faulkner, 17 were not accepted, four were heavily modified and only five were accepted without change. I suggest that it is the five that were the least onerous in terms of Mr Beddall's interpretation. Some examples of those rejected recommendations were: that areas nominated for wilderness should be excluded; that habitat trees should be identified and protected; and that harvesting should preserve adequate vegetation to protect water quality and habitat.

         Clearly, Mr Beddall has thrown out most of the environment minister's advice and put a little window-dressing in its place. But he has not stopped there. He has indicated to Boral that he will `consider issuing an additional licence to cover the increased volume if that proves necessary.' Where does that leave the government's commitment to phase out export woodchipping by the year 2000? Perhaps that was another joke like the licence and its other policies. If we return to the Boral licence we see that Mr Beddall in flagrant disregard for of government's commitment wrote, `I will consider issuing an additional licence to cover the increased volume if that proves necessary.'

         The notes I have here describe Mr Beddall's `incompetence', but I would suggest that as the resources minister he has been particularly overzealous and he is leading to deliver us an impotent environment minister. Whatever way we describe it, what we are left with is a failure to actually implement government policy. I really do not know what it is that is being implemented. We have a thing called government policy but that is not what is being implemented. It is perhaps an ideology or a direction, but it is not what is publicly paraded as government policy.

         However, in his wisdom Mr Beddall has decided that the current environmental impact statement for the Sawmillers' export licence should suffice not just until 1996 but perhaps for 10 or 15 years more. Not only does this prevent the federal government from phasing out woodchipping by the year 2000, but it is also questionable implementation of the legislation. Mr Beddall's suggestion that Boral's use of woodchips from sawmill residues and logging residues does not have a significant environmental impact is plainly wrong.

         The timber industry has developed the euphemism `integrated logging' to describe what is little more than forest mining. About half of the logs that are taken from the forest under clear-felling are woodchipped. The country does not get the sort of economic benefit from woodchipping that is touted by the government. The ordinary people of Australia lose out in two ways with export woodchipping. They lose the forests, our unique wild and diverse areas, and they lose out economically.

         Mr Beddall's woodchip troubles did not start with the Boral licence, they started during his early days in the portfolio. In June this year Mr Beddall announced that he had granted an export licence to Gunns Ltd in Tasmania to ship 200,000 tonnes of woodchips from Bell Bay or Burnie. At the time the company had no buyer for this product and it did not know where it was going to send it from.

         In documents obtained by the Australian Democrats under freedom of information, we discovered that Mr Beddall failed to require an EIS for this approval, arguing that the additional volume did not require an additional EIS. The minister seems very keen to exercise his ministerial discretion where the woodchip industry is concerned but not when the environment is at risk. The result of Minister Beddall's work on these two licences is that he is now facing two Federal Court actions which question his competence as a minister.

         Mr Bowra earlier this year travelled to the Middle East, as he had often done in the past, to secure a boat contract. He took with him an aluminium chaser boat which was to be looked at by the United Arab Emirates government. During a sales exercise on 5 August Mr Bowra took on board an air force colonel from that country, who was a guest for the day and who participated in the exercise.

         Later that day, the colonel drove another speedboat in the vicinity of the demonstration boat that Mr Bowra was driving. The colonel was accompanied by his son, and Mr Bowra had a passenger in his own boat. Whilst in the same vicinity, the two boats converged and it seems that the colonel turned incorrectly, contrary to nautical rules. Mr Bowra, being a skipper of some 16 years experience, anticipated that the colonel would turn the other way. As I understand it, Mr Bowra correctly steered to starboard, as was required by nautical rules in the circumstances. As a result of the collision, the colonel was killed and his son was severely injured. Mr Bowra survived the accident; however, his passenger too was injured.

         Unfortunately, the Australian government is under the misapprehension that Mr Bowra fled the scene. I am advised by Mr Bowra's lawyers that he in fact stayed on the scene. Help was rendered to the other stricken speedboat while Mr Bowra rendered assistance to his own passenger, who had a severe leg injury. The passenger was taken to a nearby vessel where first-aid facilities were on board.

         It was at that stage, as I understand it, that a friend advised Mr Bowra that he had best leave the country as soon as he could. He decided on the spur of the moment that he would go to the airport and try to board the earliest plane possible out of the country. Airline officials became suspicious. They held him at the airport and he was arrested by police. Mr Bowra was charged with causing the death of the colonel and the injury to the colonel's son. The Australian government mistakenly thought that he had been charged with murder. He was not; it was simply an equivalent of a manslaughter charge.

         On 27 September this year a judge, finding that Mr Bowra had been in custody since 5 August, ruled that he had spent enough time in gaol and ordered his interim release. However, this was not complied with by the police and there was an appeal to the United Arab Emirates appeals court, which upheld the interim release order. Unfortunately, the police deemed that this too was irrelevant to the circumstances. Mr Bowra finds himself still in custody in that country.

         Mr Bowra last attended court on 25 October.

However, the prosecution maintained a claim for the wrecked speed boat. The position is that the matter was not resolved and Mr Bowra was returned to prison.

I believe this case is most serious indeed and needs the full attention of the Australian government.

         Of their descendants, there were a number of distinguished Australians of Chinese origin. For example, Harry Chan became President of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory, the forerunner of the current Northern Territory parliament, and subsequently Lord Mayor of the city of Darwin. He was followed by Alec Fong Lim, who became the second Chinese-Australian Lord Mayor of the city of Darwin. Unfortunately, his tenure in that office ceased with his untimely illness and death. I think I would be speaking for most of the citizens of Darwin when I say that, without question, Alec Fong Lim would be considered one of the most popular and successful mayors the city ever had.

        (5) As stated in the reply to Question 330 to which the Senator refers, all matters which come to the Reserve Bank's attention relating to the prudential standing of a bank are treated very seriously; Mr Johnson's allegations were no exception. The allegations contained in his letter of 1 July 1991 were investigated thoroughly.

The Premier ordered an audit investigation of Tasmania Bank, which revealed the full magnitude of the bank's problems. During the relevant period the bank was being supervised under a voluntary arrangement by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank raised a number of issues of potential concern with the bank during this time but was assured by management that they were cognisant of the risks and were comfortable with the bank's position; the accounts of the bank had been subject to external audit and the Reserve Bank relied on the audit to detect any problems that were not evident in the data available to it.

The Governor also had a conversation with Mr Cullen of the Australian Bankers' Association, who had been approached by Mr Johnson.

The Government believes the best way to serve and advance the interests of the people of East Timor is by working constructively with the Indonesian Government within the framework of recognition of Indonesia's claims over the territory, rather than in a spirit of confrontation.

        It is common practice for Indonesia, when it negotiates a bilateral treaty, to insert a clause which defines Indonesia as that territory which is deemed by the laws of Indonesia to be subject to Indonesian sovereignty. A treaty which contains such a provision (if concluded after 1976) can be regarded as evidence that the relevant state party recognises East Timor as being part of Indonesia. The following twenty four states have signed such treaties: Austria, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.

        The Government does not accept that the transitional assistance for recycled paper manufacturers should be directed to the company that pays sales tax on certain 100 per cent recycled paper products. The transitional assistance is deliberately targeted to specialist manufacturers of 100 per cent recycled paper for the production of toilet or facial tissues, paper bags or exercise books, ie to companies that use waste paper as the sole source of fibre input to the paper they manufacture. The transitional assistance enables specialist recycled paper manufacturers who invested in equipment used to make waste paper into 100 per cent recycled paper to adjust to the removal  of the sales tax exemption. The transitional assistance is not available to downstream companies, such as those that convert recycled paper manufactured by other domestic or overseas companies into final paper products.

        Transitional assistance would be misdirected if, as suggested by Senator Coulter, it went to the company paying the sales tax on the affected 100 per cent recycled paper products. This is because sales tax is collected at the point of final wholesale sale, and the wholesaler, paper converter, or importer may have made no investment based upon the introduction of the sales tax exemption. Further, such arrangements would risk the duplication of compensation where the same stream of paper was involved in various transactions before the final wholesale sale. It would also lead to imported recycled paper products attracting the compensation, which would further disadvantage domestic products.

        (1) The earlier case referred to is Unilever Australia Securities Ltd v FCT which was decided on 22 June 1994. In each case the principal question was whether a profit or gain from a debt defeasance arrangement was income, within the ordinary connotation of that word. Drawing the distinction between income and capital receipts can sometimes be a difficult matter, and factual differences between cases can be very significant. The Unilever decision has been appealed to the Full Federal Court and an appeal to the Full Court is expected in the ICI Australia case. It is expected that any inconsistencies between the two decisions will in due course be reconciled by the decisions of the Full Court.

        SSA's, moreover, are not needed to address the so called small amounts problem, nor would they have effectively done so. The measures I announced on 28 June 1994 provide a universal and comprehensive remedy to that problem. Also, they do so in a way that does not impose further major structural changes on an industry that has already endured substantial and costly adjustment over recent years. Casual and part time employees, a majority of whom are women, will be the major beneficiaries of these latest Government initiatives.
