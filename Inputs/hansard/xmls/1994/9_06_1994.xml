         The decisions of the Senate print media inquiry, as it is shortly known, are of profound importance to all those who are interested in freedom of the press, and all those who are interested in seeing that decisions that are supposed to be made in the national interest are in fact made in the national interest. What we have seen in this instance is a despicable example of how decisions that are supposed to be made in the national interest have in fact been made for party political advantage.

          The most interesting aspect, and what I think is absolutely significant about this whole inquiry, is that Conrad Black, having come clean about the basis on which he was required to do business in this country—in other words, he was simply wanting an increase in the level of foreign ownership, which is not something that is unique to Mr Black, but presumably to any other businessman—was told by Mr Keating that such an application would not be considered unless a guarantee was given of balanced coverage.

          We have waited long and hard to hear a credible explanation of the meaning of `balanced coverage'. Indeed, we have waited a very long time to hear whether the Prime Minister would resile from what he said in Seattle. The fact is he has not and no-one in this parliament, and indeed no-one in this country, would for a moment believe that `balanced coverage' meant anything other than balance his way. That is a classic example of the prostitution of the process. What should have happened here is that decisions should have been made in the national interest; they were not. Instead, they were made by way of a private arrangement, a secret deal that would never have seen the light of day had it not been for Mr Black's autobiographical frankness. As a result, the committee makes a number of important findings in relation to both the propriety of Mr Keating's actions and a reform of the process. I will give a classic example of hypocrisy in this whole exercise.

I know that Senator Kernot will go into those in a lot more detail.

          Those opposite should face up to the fact that their Prime Minister has never denied what he said in Seattle. In an unguarded moment he spilt the beans. Caught red-handed, he made it perfectly clear that he believed the national interest consisted of putting a requirement on a media proprietor to provide balanced coverage. We are not dealing with euphemisms any more; we know what `balanced coverage' means. This bloke rings up journalists every day of the week, virtually, and tries to intimidate them. He has a long-standing hatred of the Fairfax press. A government senator had the cheek to say that the Fairfax press had been anti the ALP for about the last 150 years; he watered it down to 100 when he was questioned on it. The fact is that those opposite have long held the view that Fairfax has got it in for the Labor Party, and they have therefore been absolutely determined to tilt the balance fundamentally in their direction. That is what this whole exercise was about: Conrad Black blew their cover and Keating was not smart enough in Seattle to cover his tracks. Since that time, his only defence has been to resort to denigration of this committee and to have his acolytes get out into the community and bag individual members of the committee in the process.

          I simply say that the findings of this committee speak for themselves. They make it clear that there was impropriety—that Mr Keating did improperly seek to influence the committee. They make it clear that the 1991 process was fundamentally flawed and that there is an urgent need to overhaul the system. I am very confident that, despite all the blusterings today from those opposite, that will happen, and that this committee will have been responsible for bringing about a much fairer system of foreign investment review. Indeed, we would hope that there will be a much more arms-length approach. We would also hope that all the dirty double deals of those opposite will no longer be tolerated and that, having been exposed and caught out in this instance, they will never every try to do it again.

          —I rise to speak to the minority report of the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media. That report contains a rebuttal of every point that has been raised today and every point that was raised throughout these dreadful proceedings. Before I go to that, I place on record, on behalf of the Labor senators, our thanks to the secretariat, who acted with propriety and professionalism through what has been an extremely difficult inquiry, and despite the obvious malicious use of Senate committee powers to undermine the reputation of the Senate processes themselves and, ultimately, Senate committees.

          The majority report is the last gasp of those in the Liberal Party who refuse to believe that they actually lost the last election. What we have seen through this whole process is a presumption that somehow or other the media were to blame for their loss; that they were not to blame—the old scapegoat routine of the highest order. What we have seen through this process is an attempt by the opposition to harness the powers of the Senate in order to run a vindictive, amoral, and malicious campaign to undermine the integrity of many people within this country.

          We have got a long list of people who have been abused, assaulted and threatened through this committee—people such as Keating, Willis, Dawkins, Hawke, Kerin, Pooley, Hinton and Roberts; the list goes on. Those particular gentlemen have been the subject of vilification through this committee process. This outrageous attack on the civil liberties of those citizens of this country has demonstrated the grave danger posed by the Senate committee system itself to some fundamental principles of democratic government in this country.

          We suggested that if there were substantive issues to be discussed on the question of foreign investment, the most appropriate way to deal with them was through a standing committee—for instance, through the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Of course, what is behind this is the political motive of the opposition, in league with the Democrats. The opposition needs a high profile platform such as this committee provides to try to attack the reputation of this government by undermining and attacking the credibility and reputation of Australian citizens. That allows opposition senators to use the full powers of privilege—the full powers of the Senate—to try to attack Australians.

          It was alleged that there was a deal done, that somehow or other there was a connection between the government and Black in terms of political coverage in return for an extension of his ownership. What is often forgotten by Senator Alston is that headlines such as `The pork-barrel republic' appearing day after day in the Fairfax press actually supported the coalition, and give the basic lie to that proposition. It demonstrates that there is absolutely no evidence to support the notion that there was an arrangement between the Labor Party and Fairfax.

          It goes further than that. These days we are seeing from coalition members a change in attitude on foreign investment, suggesting that somehow or other they have become new-found economic nationalists. There are more backflips in the coalition these days than in the Moscow Circus. Again and again we see the pirouettes, the diving, the flipping. Once again we see notions of political opportunism being explored.

          Honourable senators might get the impression that Senator Alston might have opposed the sale of Fairfax. That is totally without foundation. His press release at the time supported the sale of Fairfax to Conrad Black. The coalition policy at the time was for the abolition of the FIRB. It was for an open slather policy on foreign investment.

         Mr Downer will have some difficulty explaining this switch in policy. We come back to the very basic fact that what is at stake here is the deal done between the Liberal Party and the Democrats. The deal is very simple: in return for bagging Keating, Senator Alston comes forward with this Peronist nonsense and a policy which he knows has not been tested in the marketplace, which he knows will not be carried by his party room, and which he has no intention of implementing. What he gets out of it is a bit of a kick-on for Keating—a `cheap political shot' as the

If the processes had been adequate, it would not have mattered what Conrad Black said to Paul Keating or Bob Hawke or John Hewson, or vice versa. It is the secretive nature of the foreign investment decision making process, the lack of transparency of that process, which has opened up the possibility for accusations of government interference, and that has been the basis of this inquiry.

          On listening to all the evidence, I have no doubt that the Labor Party in various ways did try to influence the outcome of the Fairfax sale, and I have no doubt that there has been an orchestration of Labor denials of this to the committee. To Fairfax's credit, it withstood this attempt at influence. But it is the operation of the foreign investment process to which I wish to direct my remarks today. The recommendations in this report about the future of the Foreign Investment Review Board are a huge policy win for the Democrats. There is no other way to describe them. After today, let us hope that the Foreign Investment Review Board processes will never be the same again. The Treasurer has indicated that he has always felt that they were in need of change. Let us see him act on that.

          I raised the need for fundamental reform of the Foreign Investment Review Board in my first speech to this parliament four years ago. I introduced a draft private senator's bill to reform the processes 18 months ago. It was at my insistence that the Foreign Investment Review Board term of reference was included in this inquiry. For years, I think it is fair to claim, we have driven this debate. It has been hard work. I am very interested to see that others, such as Mr Alexander Downer, are now recognising our arguments and jumping on the bandwagon, to a certain extent.

          It is incredible that the information contained in the only official minute from FIRB to the Treasurer which has ever seen the light of day in the organisation's 18-year history, contains a series of gross inaccuracies absolutely detrimental to the only Australian bidder for the company concerned. It is more than incredible, it is damning. It really makes one wonder why the government is so keen to prevent scrutiny of other FIRB advices to the Treasurer. It does make one wonder also how soundly based government decisions in relation to a whole range of foreign investment decisions have been over a number of years. It is a situation which must be changed.

          I listened with great interest to Prime Minister Keating talking about forging our new national identity, with which I agree. However, he cannot claim to want to do this—to forge this contemporary national identity—at the same time as his processes deliver a huge question mark over ownership of key components of that Australian identity. The foreign investment policies of this government have led us to that precarious stage where, in seeking to pay off our national debt, we are swapping that debt for equity and loss of control of things which are uniquely and importantly Australian. They are important to this contemporary Australian identity which Mr Keating says is so important to him and to the Labor Party.

This committee routinely trampled upon rights that Americans hold dear and which we hold dear. Unfortunately, as you are aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, and as people on this side of the chamber are aware, we do not have a bill of rights to guarantee fundamental liberties. I think, from my experience, and from the experience of Labor senators—I compliment Senator Carr, Senator Sherry and Senator Murphy on their performance; and I put on record my thanks to the secretariat for their cooperation—in terms of simple matters of principle, this committee trampled routinely on the first, fifth, sixth, seventh and fourteenth amendments to the US constitution in terms of guaranteeing fundamental liberties. The consequence of this is that I am absolutely reinforced in my view which I have long held—that we should have a bill of rights in this country. That should be the conclusion which is drawn. There is no question in my mind about that. We have had a political exercise, a political argument and political judgments have been made.

          —The report of this inquiry confirms what any fair-minded Australian has suspected all along. As the report says, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, did attempt to influence Mr Black regarding the political coverage of the Fairfax newspapers for the 1993 general election. This all started because Mr Black spilled the beans on those opposite in his extraordinary autobiography

          In typical Paul Keating style, the Prime Minister confirmed his attempted blackmail of Mr Black—that is what it was—in his interview in Seattle. Not once has Mr Keating resiled from the remarks he made in Seattle. The Prime Minister has confessed to holding a gun to Mr Black's head. That is what this is all about: he had a gun to Mr Black's head throughout the 1993 federal election. Mr Keating effectively told Mr Black that unless he, Mr Keating, was satisfied with the coverage by the Fairfax newspapers in the 1993 election, Mr Black could not get the 25 per cent of Fairfax that he wanted.

         Mr Keating's attempted blackmail fits a pattern of behaviour on his part, and that is why we were able to substantiate our findings. Recently there was his very extraordinary and clumsy attempt to intimidate the media over its coverage of the change in the coalition leadership. We saw that in the article written by Laurie Oakes last week, where he pulled back the covers on the way this Prime Minister went berserk when he thought the media were too fair to the coalition over its change of leadership. He tried to intimidate journalists, in particular female journalists, over the coverage of the change of leadership in the coalition. What he said about Niki Savva was absolutely and utterly disgraceful, and female members of the Labor Party should hang their heads in shame to have a leader who intimidates female journalists.

          Keating's style is to bully, intimidate and threaten everybody, but particularly the media. He has a dictatorial, autocratic style of government, as we saw in the way he dealt with Mr Black. That style goes back a long way. It was revealed in his speech to the Canberra press gallery—that infamous speech in December of 1990 where he bragged:

         This print media inquiry reveals that Mr Keating was trying to get Mr Black into his pocket. We know that the New South Wales Labor Right is hysterical in its hatred of Fairfax.

Here comes Mr Black walking in saying, `I have got to get 25 per cent of these newspapers.' All of a sudden, Mr Keating is handed his gun, and he sure used it, did he not?

Those opposite cannot champion someone to be a supporter of their view and then turn around and say that the version of events given by Warwick Smith and John Hewson was factual, and the version given by Mr Hawke and Mr Kerin was not.

          Opposition members claim that the Prime Minister influenced the Fairfax coverage of the last federal election. Again, the owner of Fairfax has totally denied that claim. When Conrad Black gave evidence to the committee, he made it quite clear that at no time was there any suggestion of a deal between him and the Prime Minister. In fact, as other speakers have outlined, the coverage of the federal election in 1993 by the Fairfax newspapers was totally biased towards the coalition. Nothing could be further from the truth than to say otherwise, and the headlines prove that.

          The claims made in this report have been refuted by people who gave sworn evidence before the committee. Yet the opposition members of the committee, led by the committee chairman, chose not to accept that evidence and report it. The preface to the report sets out the terms of reference. In particular, the Democrats sought to include a reference on the views expressed to Conrad Black by the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, on foreign ownership of the print media in Australia. On this matter the opposition could be likened to someone who has just seen the light—a reborn christian. The opposition has suddenly discovered that foreign ownership is something they ought to consider very seriously.

          However, prior to the 1993 election the opposition's policy, as stated by Dr Hewson, had no reference to controls over foreign ownership—no view on whether it should be 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 25 per cent or, indeed, 50 per cent. We do not get a grip on the position of the opposition until we get to chapter 11. Even then, the first two pages of that chapter are taken up with comments on the Prime Minister—highly unusual, considering that the chapter was about `views expressed to Conrad Black by Dr Hewson'. In the first two pages of that chapter one has a job finding any mention of Dr Hewson's name. It seems to be about what the Prime Minister said about Dr Hewson to Conrad Black or, indeed, to the media—quite an unusual position. Chapter 11 states:

          If we had wanted to deal with FIRB, Senator Kernot, we ought to have dealt with it in a balanced and proper way, and maybe we could have got a process that would have ended up with us seeing some changes. This committee is now bogged down. There has been a reference to the privileges committee with regard to Senator Kernot's private members bill. Lord only knows when we will see an end to the cost of this committee or anything worthwhile coming out of it.

          —This Senate report, which is one of the largest to have been tabled in this chamber, is important for three reasons. Firstly, it examined the public concern over allegations in an autobiography published by Conrad Black in November 1993 that Prime Minister Keating had agreed at a meeting in November 1992 to allow Black's company to increase its share in Fairfax. The relevant part of Black's book states:

        <para>
         As a result of this damning evidence—and I hasten to add that Prime Minister Keating did not deny this—the committee held that all his actions suggest that he is more interested in using the unique leverage of his position to influence the political coverage of Fairfax press in his favour in the lead-up to the 1993 election.

        —In his remarks, Senator Loosley said that I had sat down with the coalition and worked out a deal which said, `If you bag Keating, we will support all your proposals on the Foreign Investment Review Board.' I categorically deny that. Senator Loosley makes the mistake of applying the sort of grubby deal-doing view of the world in which he lives to the way I might view my role in the process. He is absolutely wrong. This has been the only opportunity we have had in recent times to look at the role of the Foreign Investment Review Board in a constructive way. I have listened to the evidence, and the evidence has been damning. There has never at any stage been one conversation between me and the coalition about what the outcomes of this committee inquiry would be. I make up my own mind, and the evidence was damning.

          Because time is limited, I will start by thanking the people who have been involved in this report. This matter was referred to the committee on 27 May last year. We received 137 submissions, had eight public hearings around Australia and took 1,800 pages of evidence. To do this we required the assistance of many people, including individuals and organisations who made submissions and who came forward at the public hearings. However, one does not do these things without the support of the committee staff, so to Pauline, Peter, Alistair, Leonie, Jean and others who have been involved, I say a very big thank you on behalf of the committee. This issue was being dealt with at the same time as the committee tabled 11 other reports, and it has six current inquiries. That is a tremendous workload, and it would not be possible for the committee to do it without the support of the secretariat. To them, on behalf of the whole committee, thank you very much.

          This inquiry provided a unique opportunity for both individuals and organisations to express their views on this important issue. Breast cancer is a personal tragedy for both the women involved and their families and friends. It is also a major health problem facing the community, being the most common cause of death from cancer in Australian women. The lifetime risk of women developing breast cancer is one in 15 in Australia, and in 1990 some 6,998 women were diagnosed with this disease. The incidence of the disease also increases with age. Trends would suggest that the lifetime risk may be approaching one in 12. We are not able to give any figures later than 1990 because the cancer registries from each of the states are that far behind in some areas.

          The committee believes that there are a number of important recommendations to improve the efficiency of both the screening program and the treatment regime. The aim of the national program for the early detection of breast cancer is to detect malignancy at a very early stage prior to its being able to be detected by physical examination. Evidence to the committee suggested that a fully operational screening program could lead to a reduction in mortality from breast cancer among Australian women of around 17 per cent.

          The committee reviewed the operation of the national program, which is jointly funded by the Commonwealth, states and territories. It offers an integrated and systematic screening program for asymptomatic women aged 40 years and over, with women aged 50 to 69 years being actively targeted. The program operates 58 screening units in all states and the ACT, with the Northern Territory due to begin this month—June 1994. The program aims to screen 1.7 million women every two years by 1996-97, when it will be fully operational. To date, some 377,375 women have been screened. I know that Senator Herron wants to address the issue of the number that have been screened and how the states are going to reach the target by the key years.

          The committee addresses the important issue of access under the program, especially as it relates to women living in rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, and women from non-English speaking backgrounds. The committee believes that access could be improved to women in rural and remote areas and that suitable strategies need to be introduced to achieve this outcome. The committee also acknowledges the unique problems facing the program in screening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Often these problems relate to cultural differences and the different health priorities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, who do not see breast cancer as a priority.

The committee also believes that strategies sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and values of women from non-English speaking backgrounds need to be introduced to increase the access of these women to the benefits of the national program.

          The committee believes that a concerted national education campaign should be undertaken to publicise the program more widely amongst women, the medical profession and the community generally. The campaign should emphasise the importance for women of the early detection of breast cancer, and clarify the limitations of the program, emphasising that mammographic screening is an aid to the early diagnosis and detection of breast cancer but will not prevent the disease.

          The committee reviewed the issue of whether women aged 40 to 49 years should be excluded from the program. It concluded that screening should continue to be available to these women, but that the program should not actively target this group. The committee is concerned that if these women are excluded from the program they will receive de facto screening under Medicare, and this screening may not meet the same quality standards as exist under the program.

          With respect to symptomatic women, the committee recognises that, although the program is for well women, should symptomatic women present for screening they should be accepted, especially as it may be difficult for them to access other services.

          We note that all the screening programs and screening clinics we saw did try to screen out symptomatic women at the initial phone call and at appointment making.

They should not be turned away. These women have made a conscious decision to seek help, and they may make that conscious decision only once. We must not deny them the opportunity to be linked into the services they need.

          We did have evidence that there was some confusion amongst GPs as to the difference between diagnostic and screening mammography.

While there is little data at present on the cost effectiveness of the program, a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the program should form part of any ongoing evaluation. The committee also believes that the program should avoid duplication in the provision of screening services by utilising both private and public sector services, provided they can meet the accreditation standards.

          With regard to funding arrangements, the committee is of the view that the present arrangements provide a more cost effective system than the alternative of Medicare funding.

Any move away from the current funding approach would compromise the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.

          In the area of radiotherapy services, the committee received evidence suggesting that women in rural and remote areas in particular often have difficulty in accessing these services, and this may affect their choice of treatment. The committee believes that it is essential that the distribution of these services be improved so that women living outside the major metropolitan centres can obtain better access. The committee also believes that the level of travel and accommodation assistance may need to be reviewed and increased to improve access to services for women living in rural and remote areas. This assistance varies from state to state.

          —At the outset, I commend everybody involved in the working of the breast cancer screening program. That ranges from the federal government to the state governments providing the funds to the people actually working in the program, ranging from the various bureaucracies to the counsellors, radiographers, radiologists, surgeons, general practitioners and the myriad people who are involved in the implementation of this program. It is the most significant advance ever in the management of breast cancer in Australia. I emphasise `ever' because it is only by the early detection of breast cancer that the mortality rate can be improved. The mortality rate has not changed in 50 years. Not only will the mortality rate be improved by the early detection of breast cancer, but the management of the individual woman who has breast cancer will also be improved in that less radical surgery may be performed to obtain the same cure rate as would be obtained by more radical surgery.

In contrast to the committee involved in the preceding report, this was a most harmonious committee that produced a unanimous report. There is no dissenting report, and I commend all those who were involved in presenting submissions to us. While there was some disparity between the states, there was general unanimity on the need for the program and on the need for a review of the program, which the committee produced.

          The latest available statistics show that one in 15 women get breast cancer in their lifetime. However, there is also evidence within the report that that figure is increasing, and it may well be one in 12 at present. If we follow the trends that are occurring in the rest of the Western world, within the next 10 years or so it will be one in 10, and may even be higher. In some of the states of the United States it is reaching one in nine. So it is an increasing problem, particularly with our ageing society.

          There has been a delay in the implementation of the program, and this is highlighted in the report in table 1, but it is probably related to the fact that the committee that determined at the outset what targets should be achieved set their targets too high. For instance, they set a target for New South Wales of 300,000 screenings a year by the end of 1993-94, but only 130,000 women were screened. I think it should be emphasised that not all women in the particular age group were expected to be screened because of the problems of recruitment and the fact that a woman, once recruited, needs to be rescreened every two years. If the recruitment of women does not occur in the first place, obviously we will not get them coming back in two years time.

          It is not intended, initially, anyway, that the whole population should be screened but that there be an implemented program over a period of years. I believe that the targets were probably set too high. Certainly they have not been achieved. For example, between July 1990 and February 1991, an average of 48,000 women were screened in New South Wales. Victoria set a target of 75,000 screenings for the financial year but by the end of last month had reached only 42,242 for the current year. In Queensland, 70,000 women—fewer than a quarter of the target of 293,000—were screened in the three years to last December. So there has been a significant delay in its implementation.

          I emphasise also that the report states that we believe women between the ages of 40 and 49 should not be screened because at present there is no evidence that there is an advantage in doing so, primarily because of the hormonal effects on the breasts in those age groups. There are two programs being developed in the world to check the age group between 40 and 49—one in Scandinavia and one in the United Kingdom—under the auspices of the International Union Against Cancer, which will give us the answer to that question in about 10 years time.

          But for the moment we do not believe that it has been proven that there is any advantage in screening the 40- to 49-year-old age group. Yet, if we look at people presenting to screening units, we see that up to 35 per cent of them actually fall into that age group because they are women who are more concerned and are more likely to develop lumps of one kind or another. We believe that they should be excluded from the program. However, if they do present they will have a mammogram and then be referred to the appropriate treatment agency.

          We also emphasise that there should be no duplication of services. In fact, enough mammographic units in Australia presently exist to screen the whole of the female population, and yet some states have duplicated services. We believe there should be integration of both the public and the private sector because, after all, the majority of radiologists in particular are in the private sector—similarly, the number of surgeons. It seems to be a waste of resources to duplicate these services.

          I believe this is a very important report. It will be of great use to the people in the states who are involved in the various state screening programs. Hopefully, it will help the states to come a little closer together, particularly when it comes to the collection of all the data that they are producing. Perhaps the one thing, the one result, I would like to see come out of this report by the Senate standing committee is just that: the getting together of that data in a useable, easily accessible fashion so that we can really put some research dollars into going through it and trying to work out what the key factors are that lead to more and more Australian women contracting breast cancer. If this report does nothing else but encourage and improve medical research in this area, it certainly will have been worth the many hours put into it and the time spent travelling.

          I want to stress from the beginning that in no way am I being critical of what is being done in the various states. Hopefully, what this report will do is show the enormous support—indeed, indicate the support of this parliament—for the ongoing screening program. But we do have a few bugs, and a few problems need to be ironed out. One of those problems is certainly access by rural women to this program. We also need to make sure that this program is appropriate for all women. That includes women from non-English speaking backgrounds and also Aboriginal women, who, as Senator West has said, do not see breast cancer as one of their priorities. They need a different sort of health support system, and we must be prepared to fit programs such as this into the whole health program for Aboriginal women and not have it as a separate add-on.

          If we look at the number of women being screened across the country, we see that some states still have some way to go. I hope that, again by looking at what other states are doing, not only the people involved in the screening program but also governments will take the hint and make sure that access to records is readily available, particularly the electoral records that are needed to invite women along to the program. I also hope that, thanks to this report, we will see greater support from state governments for the ongoing screening program. I conclude my remarks there for now and seek leave to continue them later.

         —The Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1994-95, the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994-95 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1994-95 are in essence what are commonly known as the budget bills. The bills give effect to the expenditure announced in the budget. Of course, not all government spending is contained in these bills. Indeed, expenditure of only $34.9 billion, or 28.3 per cent of the total of $123 billion announced in the budget, is authorised by these bills. The remaining expenditure is authorised by specific purpose legislation.

         We are debating these bills for the first time ever at this time of the year. Traditionally, the budget has been introduced in the third week in August, so this debate has normally taken place in September, October or even November of the financial year to which the bills relate. These appropriations are for the year commencing 1 July next. In that sense they break new ground and have produced some interesting experimentation on the government's part and some requirements for change by the parliament in the handling of the bills.

         That leads me to the first substantial point I want to make—that is, the fact that it seems to be the unanimous view of the Senate estimates committees that traditionally consider the appropriations of government departments as part of the budget process that this year the documentation with which we had to work was quite inadequate. We find that in the reports to the Senate of virtually all of the six Senate estimates committees. The main criticisms were that the information was inadequate, that it was difficult to follow, and that there was a lack of information on ongoing programs, et cetera, which were not subject to specific new budget initiatives.

         Certainly, those views were unanimously held by coalition senators, and I think the great majority of government senators would have had a similar view. Many coalition senators have expressed the wish to go back to the sort of material we have had in recent years in the program performance statements rather than the much truncated material contained in the documentation for this year's estimates—the portfolio budget measures statements.

         The committee of which I am a member, Estimates Committee D, in considering the estimates for the Department of Finance, raised the issue of documentation with senior officials of the Department of Finance. The report of Estimates Committee D records that the department is looking at ways to improve the situation. Certainly, I would agree that that ought to be the case. Indeed, Estimates Committee D made certain specific suggestions about the information to be included in future documentation. I think this is something the Senate needs to look at very carefully. I believe we ought to be holding discussions at an early date with the Department of Finance on our experience with the new documentation and that the Senate ought to insist on changes along the lines contained in paragraph 12 of the report of Estimates Committee D, together with any further suggestions from senators.

         Turning to the budget itself and the budget parameters, what we see in the 1994-95 budget is a further very large increase in government spending. A further $6.1 billion will be spent by the government this year, coupled with a huge increase in taxes and charges. The increased revenue this year into the government's coffers will be no less than $8.1 billion. That is an increase of almost eight per cent this year. Some of the individual items are much higher than that. The personal income tax take, in particular, is going to increase this year by 8.2 per cent. Some of the other items are even higher in terms of increases, and that is just for the year ahead. What the budget papers also show is that there will be a cumulative increase of a further $26 billion in tax take over the following three years, even allowing for no additional expenditure proposals by the government—of course, there will be additional expenditure proposals—and even allowing for the fact that those figures are based on the government's highly conservative inflation forecasts.

         What we have is a big spending, big taxing budget. Despite the fact that we have had this huge increase in taxes, we are still going to have a quite excessive budget deficit this year of $11.7 billion. Indeed, if we adjust for one-offs, the real underlying deficit this year is not $11.7 billion, but closer to $18 billion. That has to be financed, as do maturing debts of the government. The government's financing task this year, the amount of money it is going to have to take out of financial markets to meet these huge deficits, is no less than $20.4 billion for 1994-95. That compares with $19.3 billion in the year we are just completing, and $20.3 billion in the year before that, in 1992-93. So when we look behind the rhetoric of the government's deficit reduction hype, we find quite the contrary—that with regard to the call on the financial markets to fund its huge deficits, that figure is not decreasing at all. Indeed, this year it will be the highest it has been for three years—and, indeed, earlier than that.

         The government is talking about an economic recovery. Indeed, the March quarter figures that came out last week, on the face of it, do show welcome signs of strong growth—an annual rate of five per cent GDP growth. But when one gets underneath the figures, one finds that the substantial underpinning of them is much less certain than that. There is a very worrying failure to increase on the part of business investment. Most of the growth we have had in the GDP figures has come from an increase in consumption, particularly from a very large increase in government consumption. They are not statistics on which sustainable economic recovery can be based.

He said in relation to the 1990 pre-recession budget that it was `the Rolls Royce of budget documents'. In the year before that, the pre-election 1989 budget was `a budget which puts the nation's interests first'. We have heard all of this time and time again. The government has cried wolf once too many times.

If we compare the last 11 quarters of economic growth with the corresponding 11 quarters of recovery from the recession of the early 1980s, we find some very stark differences. In particular, the fact is that this time we have barely recovered half the ground that we lost, compared with the recovery in the mid-1980s.

         The undeniable fact is that the 1994 budget has squandered a golden opportunity to address this nation's fundamental economic problems; it has squandered an opportunity that might not recur for many years. The three basic problems facing the Australian economy are: firstly, lack of investment, which is the keystone of sustainable economic growth; secondly, lack of national savings, and increased domestic savings are the only way we can reverse the course of the ever-growing foreign debt mountain with which this government has saddled us; and thirdly, our huge current account deficit and that foreign debt.

         There has been overwhelming concern expressed about the budget strategy by many distinguished commentators. The major concern is the magnitude of the deficit, which is far too high for current economic circumstances. As Don Mercer, the chief executive of the ANZ Bank, said:

        Failure to seize the opportunity of strong economic growth to cut the budget deficit more rapidly is going to leave Australia with higher domestic and external debt than is necessary or desirable.

        He added that Australia was `back on the path to boom and bust'. The distinguished firm of Salomon Bros, in its report on the budget, said that the government had taken a high risk strategy in the budget and that this would lead to a rise in interest rates sooner because of the failure to cut the deficit further. Westpac's recent economic analysis said:

         What did we have from that report? We had 137 recommendations, very few of which have been taken up by this government. Not even this government is silly enough to follow some of Mr Kelty's recommendations. Mr Kelty recommended that we increase fuel taxes—the most damaging thing for the development of regional Australia. Few of those recommendations will be taken up by anyone; but it has given Mr Kelty some reward for his support for this government at the last election. The report refers to Brisbane as Australia's northernmost city. This is how good the Kelty report is. Perhaps he has never heard of Townsville, Cairns or Darwin, which are really Australia's northernmost cities; but the Kelty report seemed to think Brisbane was.

         The McKinsey report into regional Australia is a far more substantial document. The first round of that report, which has been released, contains very useful data about regional Australia. It points out that each region is different and it says to this government, `Look, you cannot have centralised control from Canberra because each region is different. You must have a flexible approach.' Both the budget and the white paper on employment and regional development failed to address this. In fact, the white paper, the budget and this government generally have a very inflexible approach to labour—and the McKinsey report clearly says that one of the greatest impediments to development of regional Australia is this inflexible wages and labour employment system which this government continually promotes. So I hope that the Labor government will take notice of what McKinsey says about industrial relations reform.

This government has to take the major blame for all of the on-costs, including payroll tax. Admittedly, that tax is a state matter but federal governments can fund the states so they can get out of payroll tax, which was our announced intention at the last election. But this government has shovelled on more and more taxes which impact upon the regions.

         What did we find in the budget for North Queensland? The departure tax went up by another $2, from $25 to $27—not a big amount in itself. Tourism is one of the main activities in many parts of regional Australia, so it has been taxed yet again by this government. People might say, `Well, $2 is not much.' But at a recent seminar on the taxation aspects of tourism, it was pointed out that this $2 is effectively a $9 increase because this government has changed the method of collection from little cages at airports, which we never agreed with anyhow. The government has now put the responsibility on the airlines to collect the tax. The airlines estimate that it will cost another $7 per person to collect that $27. The airlines have said, `We'll just pass that on in the price.'

No-one can explain why. There are ways around it but this government is again discriminating against the small business operator by encouraging such an operator to find ways around this.

         The expectations in the marketplace and media leading up to this budget laid the groundwork for the reactions which followed the budget. Summarily, there is disappointment in its efforts to tackle the real problems now a decade old, and there is a rejection of its estimates and projections of its likely outcomes. The only accolade given to this budget was the fact that it did not have any new, up-front, seen taxes, probably because the last Dawkins budget had enough taxes in it for the next two budgets. We are still paying for the last Dawkins budget, with tax increases yet to come in August—the final phase of the fuel taxes.

         In the lead-up to this budget Australian business leaders issued a very stern and clear message to reduce the budget deficit. The Business Council of Australia in its budget submission urged the government:

       <para>
        The council called for a budget deficit around $8 billion, which is down from the government's estimated $13.6 billion in 1993-94. The National Farmers Federation, in its budget submission, had a similar view regarding the budget deficit reduction. It said:

        The National Farmers Federation called for a budget deficit of around two per cent of gross domestic product in 1994 to keep pressure off interest rates, which translates into a dollar figure similar to that given by the Business Council of Australia.

         Moreover, in the run-up to this budget, the bond market indicated that the government should bring in an acceptable budget deficit or face the consequences of rising interest rates. In full knowledge of the government's usual fiscal form and monetary responsibility, the bond market, a week or so prior to the budget, factored in higher yields of some three per cent. So the overriding trend emerging from the bond market, the Business Council of Australia and the National Farmers Federation was the need to reduce the budget deficit or face the detrimental effects of hikes in interest rates and the consequential snuffing out of any possible recovery.

         When the new Treasurer, Mr Willis, handed down his first budget, he followed the form of his predecessors. Should we have expected anything less? It lacked the courage to maintain reform in our economy and the discipline needed to sufficiently reduce government spending. So, in essence, the bond market was duly correct in its pre-budget estimation. While the budget deficit was announced at $11.7 billion, seemingly at the lower end of expectations, the pundits were not taken in. One such pundit, namely the Westpac

         In 1990-91, the amount received from asset sales was $838 million less than the budget forecast. In the following year, 1991-92, asset sales were $323 million less than the budget forecast. In 1992-93, asset sales were $799 million less than the budget forecast. In 1993-94, while figures are not finalised as yet, the figure is again expected to be below the budget forecast. The 1994-95 asset sales are primarily dependent upon airport sales, even in the light of the fact that it will take some 18 months to prepare these airport sales—a la the sale of Qantas. It must be remembered that these sales are yet to be agreed upon by the union movement—and we see difficulty there already—and the Left wing of the Labor Party. It is a matter that must be settled at the ALP conference which I believe is being held in September at its usual venue, the Hobart Casino.

         To put the budget estimate on business investment into perspective, this amounts to an increase of around $5 billion from the previous year, which is equivalent to the investment rates of the so-called booming 1980s, which we would all be aware led to a high interest decade and, ultimately, to recession—the boom-bust cycle which we in this country so desperately wish to avoid but have been warned about by leading business figures such as the ANZ Bank chief. To date, business investment shows no sign of a sustained increase, rather it is maintaining its downward trend. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, new investment spending by private industry fell by five per cent during the March quarter.

         Regardless of the recently heralded surveys indicating optimism for business investment among some of the top 100 or so chief executives of this country, several points need to be kept in mind about these heralded surveys. The surveys were taken among the large institutional investors who do not distinguish between their investment in Australia and their investment overseas. This is significant as there has been a rather large surge of Australian companies investing overseas of late. Moreover, those sectors not included in the surveys were the very sectors that will bring the real and sustained surge in business investment, namely the small business and farming sectors. Any decent survey would surely have included these sectors, and would have found that their optimism did not match that of the major chief executives of this country.

It cannot be done without the rural sector. The National Farmers Federation claimed that the government's forecast of 14.5 per cent business investment growth next year was too high, especially when micro-economic reform had slowed.

         The figures show that retail turnover slumped nationally by some four per cent during April. So, at best, expectations for future investment growth should be cautious, and certainly the high forecasts in the budget should be rejected outright as they are simply not believed. The difference between what will be a surge in investment and a bleep in investment will depend on the extent to which interest rates rise—or even the expectations for rising interest rates—over the next 12 months. The truth is that farmers and small business are highly reluctant to invest in plant and equipment due to the fear of rising interest rates.

The small business survivors of the recession are working on historically low margins, and they are making profits more from the slashing of overheads than from the volume of trade. Moreover, they are working on overdraft interest rates, not in the range of the published rate of around 9.5 per cent or housing rates of around 8 per cent, but of double digit figures around the 12 per cent mark. Those are the interest rates that small business is facing today.

         Sadly, like the white paper, it is not a budget which will create a single extra job. Indeed, it will probably result in a loss of jobs. Again, like the white paper, it is simply about a range of statistics and about a little bit of training. Honourable senators will remember that the white paper itself focused on training. In this economic situation, with well over a million people either unemployed or underemployed, the government's main concern surely must be the creation and provision of real jobs which are useful, gainful and rewarding in every sense of the word; and that unemployed people should have a sensible choice of employment.

         Why do we need these recurrent statements from the government? I think there have been something like 26 budgets and similar statements. Why do we need these various statements? The simple answer is because the Labor government has created a terrible problem. Unemployment is that problem. It was generated, created, expanded and, indeed, expounded by the ALP. The government has presided over the most disastrous economic failure in the post-war era. It has pushed up interest rates, it has created the worse recession since the Great Depression, the highest unemployment level since the Great Depression and the highest levels of bankruptcy since the Great Depression.

         It is not simply an error, although goodness knows there have been enough of those in the whole process. It is a deliberately engineered attempt to suppress the living standards of Australian people. It is the ugly and very deliberate way of increasing productivity and increasing efficiency by creating a large pool of unemployed, by suppressing real wages, by lowering living standards and by tolerating the terrible social consequences of all these approaches.

        What a terribly sad indictment of a government that is. The government chose to put half a million Australians out of work for over a year, it chose to put one in 10 of our work force into unemployment and, sadly, in this budget and the previous white paper, it has confirmed that this is in fact its preferred choice. It is not an accident; it is a deliberately engineered policy. The government will not change the environment to create jobs; it will simply allow people to live in the false hope that they will get jobs at the end of the training—sadly a false hope.

         The government's attitude is to freeze and squeeze and cut rather than to create jobs. It is its bandaid, its temporary solution, rather than any attempt at a genuine cure. It is possible to create a climate in Australia where real jobs can be created, and they have to be created mainly within the small business sector.

         Let us look at our situation. Our wage levels in Australia—there have been some recent tables on this—are not too different from those of our competitors. We have resources galore. What we need is appropriate encouragement for real investment and for real enterprise. We need a range of initiatives to encourage worker and employer to work together towards greater efficiency and greater productivity. We need a carrot approach, not a stick approach. We need to encourage such things as bonuses for productivity, profit sharing and genuinely to encourage share ownership.

         If we ask the question, `Does this budget or the previous white paper reduce the numbers of people on the unemployment list?', the answer is a very clear `yes'. But the more important question is, `Will it reduce the number of people without jobs?' The categorical answer to that is a very clear `no'. How do we explain that paradox? It is simply because of fraud and fiddling. There has already been some fiddling by the movement of people off the unemployment list—people without jobs—into other categories such as invalid pensioner categories, et cetera.

         The essential fact is that when people are asked, `Are you looking for a job?' after the implementation of some of these initiatives, they will say, `No, I am not looking for a job.' That is because they are undergoing training or short-term work experience. If we asked, `Do you have a job now?' the answer is a resounding `no' for most of those people. There will be more people saying, `No, I do not have a job,' because of the financial consequences of the economic policies of the government.

         The data is very clear in terms of some of these fiddles. Let us look at some of them. The massaging of the numbers goes something like this: first, there is the jobs compact. That is around 160,000 people each year for between six and 12 months, let us say 120,000 people at any one time taken off the unemployment list. They will not have a job, but they will be off the unemployment list. What about the parenting allowance? If we say half of the 120,000 families come from the presently unemployed, that will be 60,000 off the figures. The CDEP program means that around 1,250 Aboriginals will be off the figures. The 1,000 new NEIS places will come off the figures and increasing the number of entry level training places—let us say three-quarters of 25,000—will mean another 18,000 people off the unemployment figures.

         There are close to 5,000 people potentially eligible for the partners allowance. If we allow for two-thirds of those being married taking it up, that is 3,300 off the figures. The Social Security newsletter—the government's own newsletter—tells us that 30,000 people have applied for the mature allowance. By and large, they are the elderly and the long-term unemployed. We do not get them a job or even the hope of a job; we simply put them under a different label.

         What we are doing is reducing the participation rate in the labour force in a very false and artificial manner. Essentially, as a result of this massaging—let us be polite and call it that—something like 240,000 individuals will be removed from the unemployment statistics. Not a single one of those people will actually have a genuine, worthwhile job; but at least for a time they will have vanished from the figures. But what is the result? If we look at the budget papers we see a streak of honesty. The budget papers say that unemployment will be down to 9.5 per cent. That, in itself, is a terrible indictment. Allowing for the fact that budget papers under Labor governments have traditionally got these things wrong—they almost make a point of pride, and wear the badge of pride, about getting things wrong—that figure essentially is in the same ballpark as the current 10 per cent or so.

         As I said earlier, this budget and the previous white paper are not about jobs but about training. The government has always pushed the training element. It seems to think that simply by training people it can get them a job. It does not think about creating the jobs for them to move into. Let us look at the facts. The Australian work force, by international standards, is very well trained and educated. There are an increasing number of people staying on to year 12, partly as a result of the alternative prospect—unemployment—or the carrot end which is the attraction of Austudy for some of those people who remain at school. But the increasing retention rates by themselves are not a panacea.

         The difficulty is that if the government of the day and the training agencies of the day do not know where the jobs are going to be created, in which industry or in which part of the industry, they will have no idea of what sort of retraining is really necessary to make a worthwhile contribution to the unemployment problem. How can they know what training is needed if the jobs in the first place are unlikely to exist or, if by some quirk of fate they do exist, it is impossible to determine in which industry or part of the industry they exist.

         The other point to bear in mind with retraining is that during the careers of those people who are fortunate enough to enter employment, their jobs may well change many times over the lifetime of their career. What is needed here is not simply a narrow-based training for a particular skill, but a broad-based, broad-skilled alternative. Broad-based education and broad-based training are very important before going out into the redefined training for jobs which, of course, may never exist.

         Although work experience is a very valuable way of obtaining a smell of a job or an understanding of some of the implications of a job, work experience by itself very rarely leads to employment. The government has to get away from its fixation on training and retraining, and look at the underlying core problem to creating genuine, worthwhile jobs for the almost one million people who are unemployed at this time. It must give incentives particularly to small business to invest and expand, and have the confidence to build up its work force to create genuine jobs. It is in the small business sector that the potential cure to the unemployment problem lies.

         There is an obscenity here as well—that priority will be given to the long-term unemployed. On the face of it, that sounds very praiseworthy but it does mean there is another side to the coin which is that those who have been unemployed for a month or two, in relative terms will be neglected. Those in the first few months of unemployment will have to wait while the so-called case managers prioritise—and those are the new politically correct words, I believe—those who are long-term unemployed. There is clearly a statement here that those who are newly unemployed will go to the bottom of the scrap heap in terms of priority and made to wait their turn until they may, potentially, have become institutionalised as unemployed.

         There surely can be no doubt that the best time to get a job is immediately after losing the previous job, before there is any damage to self-esteem, credibility and reputation, and before the skills become rusty. What the government seems to be saying is, `We are going to ignore that commonsense type approach and focus on the long-term unemployed.' I agree that there does need to be a focus on the long-term unemployed but, for goodness sake, let us not focus on the long-term unemployed at the expense of the newly unemployed, who are eminently employable if remedial action is taken at an appropriate early time.

The effects of those approaches on the self-esteem of the unemployed are appalling. The effects upon those who have become entrenched in the rut of unemployment, who get used to unemployment and then make only half-hearted attempts to seek jobs, are also appalling. It leads, potentially, to a long-term career on the unemployment list. Early intervention is just as important as late intervention. The fact is that intervention is crucial so long as there is genuine intervention for genuine jobs, rather than just playing around with training and the massaging or fiddling of numbers.

         In summary, this is the Labor government's—by my count—26th attempt to deal with the problem. It has had 12 budgets, nine May economic statements, four prime ministerial statements and, of course, the joke called the One Nation statement. Here we are, trying again. In spite of those 26 statements, the Labor Party's record is one of having one of the worst recessions in living memory, the worst levels of unemployment, the highest levels of bankruptcies, the biggest decline in real wages for Australian workers, and—not to be forgotten—the enormous social and medical consequences of all these actions, which have been deliberately introduced. The government said:

        By the benchmark of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the government has failed. Officially we have 900,000 Australians unemployed. The true figure is well over a million. We have 350,000 people who have been unemployed for a year or more, and 200,000 who have been unemployed for two years or more. This is a disgusting, appalling record by anybody's criteria.

         If we add to that record foreign debt and a higher budget deficit, it is certainly true to say about the white paper, as Paul Keating did—and it would also be true to say it about the budget—that only the Labor government could produce such a document. It is only Labor that could have created such a terrible problem in the first place. It is only Labor that could have shown such ineptitude in addressing such a sad and disastrous policy. No-one else could do this; only Labor could do things this badly.

Before doing so, there is a matter of pressing importance in relation to the Civil Aviation Authority that I wish to bring before the Senate today. This country has a very proud history in aviation, both in peace and in war. I have just come from the memorial service for Sir David Fairbairn, who was one of our distinguished RAAF pilots in the Second World War. We have developed as a nation as one that can hold its head high in the aviation world. We have done that because a lot of Australians are very interested in aviation; a lot of them have put a lot of effort, thought and time into it.

         We have also had a good regulatory body in the old Department of Civil Aviation. While not everyone in the country might have loved the old Department of Civil Aviation, it was always and universally respected for its professional expertise. Since the Whitlam years, when aviation became a subdepartment within the Department of Transport, it has been downhill all the way. The governments of the day have failed to see that aviation is a different branch of transport and does not have terribly much in common with other terrestrial or marine forms. At the end of the day, they are essentially two dimensional, whereas aviation is three dimensional. To be successful in aviation requires a different mind-set and different practices. The aviation world has learnt that at the cost of countless hundreds—maybe thousands—of lives over the years. That wisdom should be available to future generations and should not be thrown away through bureaucratic incompetence.

         last week by Tom Burton. He made the point that the authority hit the wall over the TAAATS contract a couple of years ago, and it has all been downhill from then on. He made a very telling point in saying that the members of the board of the CAA were appointed for political reasons. I do not think for one moment he was implying that he was talking about party political reasons, but political in the broader sense of satisfying interest groups around the country.

         It is a sad fact that the board of the CAA has hardly anyone on it who has any current operational experience in the aviation world. The board should set the policies. If I had been running it most, if not all, of the members of that board  would either have current and exceptionally good experience in aviation or have been successful operators in the business world. But sadly, that is not the case. Time does not permit me to go further than that beyond leading on to say that most of the senior management and most of the middle management of the Civil Aviation Authority now lacks the degree of professionalism that the task demands. It is only when we get down to the lower levels that we find some people who know something about the aviation industry, but they are confined and restricted by the bureaucratic load over their head.

Another case that came to my notice in Queensland recently was an allegation that someone had flown over and dropped oranges on another homestead.

The court threw the action out and I think it found that the person had not dropped any oranges at all. This illustrates the trivial nature of the action. That action, I estimate, probably cost the parties involved about $30,000 in legal and court fees. I know the Civil Aviation Authority paid out $6 1/2 thousand on various legal fees.

         The high water mark of the incompetence of the legal department involves this chamber of the Senate. Earlier this year the Senate disallowed a regulation of the Civil Aviation Authority. It was Civil Aviation Regulation No. 239 in the Statutory Rules of 1993. Notice was given by me in this chamber that the disallowance motion would be moved. Quite a few days passed between then and the motion for disallowance coming into the chamber. In that time, if the Civil Aviation Authority, and particularly its legal department, had not been slothful, it would have come along and said, `Hey, what's going on? Can we help? What's the intention here?' but it did nothing. It did not contact me or any other senator. The disallowance motion came before the Senate and it was passed.

The penalty for failing to do that would be $2,500.

One can see what the weather is like and one does not really need a weather forecast. I had a look out of my window just before I came down here today. There was about four octas of cloud outside between 3,000 and 5,000 feet, and I would feel perfectly safe, and I would believe I was acting responsibly, if I flew from here to Mudgee or to Wagga this afternoon.

         Anyway, the Senate supported the move that the motion be disallowed. The next thing that happened was that there was a phone call from a senior legal officer of the Civil Aviation Authority to the Office of the Clerk of the Senate. I happen to hold the Office of the Clerk of the Senate in some respect. It is one of the significant offices in Australia. The suggestion was put to the clerk that the Senate had not validly disallowed the motion. I can see there is a bit of interest being shown. The Civil Aviation Authority was advised that it was in error, that the procedures had been accurately followed. But I found it quite astounding when I heard this that a statutory body should seek to browbeat and stand over the legislature of Australia.

         —I said the phone call was to the Office of the Clerk of the Senate. Then there was a lot of argy-bargy under the Acts Interpretation Act that maybe it did not mean anything at the end of the day. The suggestion was then put to the Civil Aviation Authority that there were parallels with a case in 1986 involving one of the meat inspection authorities. When that case went to court the federal judge would not even listen to it—he just threw it out.

         But better things were to follow. The next thing that happened was that everyone in Australia on the mailing list of the Civil Aviation Authority got a circular called the `Aviation Bulletin'. I have now been involved in aviation for more than 30 years. I have never in my life seen anything like this. This is a real Third World, standover job—the sort of thing we would have expected in Haiti during Papa Doc Duvalier's days. This is an appalling thing. The document is titled `Disallowance of regulations' and, throughout it, it names me on three occasions. I am quite happy to stand up anywhere and say I moved the disallowance motion, but it was the Senate that disallowed the regulation—not me. All of us did that.

         What the document does is try to diminish my standing in the aviation community. That cannot be done because my standing is far higher than the Civil Aviation Authority's. The document makes the claim that, because the regulation was disallowed, the old one is valid. The old one is more onerous in so far as it requires everyone to get all the information about weather forecasts and the rest of it even if they are not flying 50 miles, just departing an airfield. The document makes the point that I objected to the regulation because it was over-regulation—yet we have a new regulation which is more onerous—and because there was a $2,500 fine, but the fine outlined in the regulation that the Civil Aviation Authority claims takes its place is also $2,500.

The motion that was before the Senate was—I quote from the

         I put it to the minister—he has run out of the chamber, unfortunately, but I still want an answer to this in his summing up of this debate—what is the exact legal interpretation? When I moved that motion, I moved it with the intention that the old regulation 239 would not apply. That is why the Civil Aviation Authority is wrong to claim that the current status is that the old regulation 239 is in place.

         Regulation 16 was to, first of all, `omit the regulation'—that is, the old regulation 239—and, secondly, substitute a new one. What we did in this chamber was disallow the new regulation, and therefore the body of regulation 16 as instanced in this publication called `Civil Aviation Regulations (Amendment)' of 17 November 1993 still stands. In plain English, so that the legal officers of the CAA can understand this, that means the Senate only excised the new regulation. The body of the changes before the Senate were passed and that meant that the old regulation, which is the lead part of section 16, does not stand.

         As it stands at the moment there is a void there legally, and I want the minister present, who is now Senator Schacht, to come up with an answer to this very important legal point. I have been advised that actions are before the courts at the present time where the Civil Aviation Authority is proceeding against pilots and that part of the claim lodged by the Civil Aviation Authority rests on the fact that regulation 239 was not observed. So this point is of some significance.

         My belief is that there is no regulation 239 standing at the present time and that the Civil Aviation Authority ought to move to fill that void and do it with great rapidity. The wishes of the Senate were that those pilots flying under the visual flight rules be excluded from a mandatory requirement to get weather forecasts, notams and all the other paraphernalia that they need to fly through the airways system because it is unnecessary. We do not argue that it is not desirable to do that, and we would encourage people to do it. But we recognise that it is not always practicable to do so.

         —I would like to make a couple of brief remarks about the true nature of this budget which was hidden away about 300 pages into the budget documents and not mentioned at all in the budget speech. I refer to the fact that total tax revenue is budgeted in this document, which is supposed to have no fresh taxes in it at all, to rise this year by $9.15 billion. This will lift the total tax collections by the Keating government to a record $103.3 billion, 2 1/2 times more than the total tax take of $41 billion in the Fraser government's last year in office.

         After adjusting for the forecasted inflation rate—and this is the real test of whether taxes are going up—real tax revenues in this budget will jump by 7.4 per cent. This is more than double last year's highly contentious rise of 3.9 per cent and represents an aggregate increase in two budgets since the March 1993 election of 12 per cent despite the government's election promise in March 1993 that there would be no tax rises and that the tax cuts were not only promised—they were l-a-w. In fact, the latest budget's real tax rises are the worst since the 11.6 per cent increase in Paul Keating's 1984-85 budget. Yet, here is the government still pretending, still putting out the propaganda, that there are no extra taxes and no tax rises in this budget. It is simply another of the major deceptions that this government has come out with.

The indecent haste with which this budget is in effect now being pushed through is totally inappropriate and diminishes the capacity of this Senate to give the sort of scrutiny that has been a significant element in trying to provide some supervision to a government that is out of control, arrogant and a government one should not trust with money.

         —Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. Mr Keating's purchase of a half interest in a $30 million piggery group was unprecedented, not only because of the incredible gearing of equity to liabilities. Other Prime Ministers have been long-standing owners of primary production interests, but none has ever while in high office, such as Treasurer, bought into a loss making, high risk, effectively bankrupt venture whose liabilities exceeded its assets, which was allowed by the Commonwealth Bank to avoid paying its annual interest bill for years and whose only prospect for viability depended on the granting of governmental approvals at federal, state and local levels, along with successfully negotiating a joint venture agreement with a foreign multi-national.

         The relevant FIRB approval and the joint venture with the Danes were both signed after Paul Keating became the Prime Minister of this country. Disposing of his piggery interests has not resolved the question over Mr Paul Keating's ownership. Not only is the public entitled to know the manner of its disposal—for example, whether Mr Keating avoided loss on his investment over almost three years while both the piggery group and the Commonwealth Bank lost millions of dollars during his half ownership—but his and his companies' actions during that period must be shown to be acceptable. Ceasing to misbehave does not remove the need to be responsible for and suffer the consequences of that misbehaviour.

This `disposal' therefore increases the need for Mr Keating to come clean about the very serious questions that have emerged, which are largely of his own making. Unless he answers these questions, which his own secretive actions have generated, there must remain serious doubt about the whole question of the integrity of this investment and the status of the office of Prime Minister.

         The status of the joint venture which Mr Keating had such an important role in negotiating appears to have changed considerably after the Danish partners found out that the finances of Mr Keating's piggery group were nothing like the rosy picture falsely presented at the time the Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, acquired his half ownership of the company. As a result, the Danes apparently were not prepared to expose themselves to an equity risk in Mr Keating's piggery and refrigeration group, which was technically bankrupt, and kept the `high-tech' pork processing end of the joint venture to themselves, with the only really joint part of the operation being in the local wholesaling of pork products from a new facility owned by the Danes and built by a Danish associate at South Strathfield.

         The piggery's profitability also depended on government action being taken against cheap imports of Canadian pig meat. After anti-dumping applications failed, quarantine restrictions which are unmatched in any other country that imports Canadian pork were imposed by the federal government. Mr Keating half-owned his piggery group from 15 May 1991 to 7 March 1994, almost three years. During only two years of that time, to June 1993, the debt of the parent company, Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, which was mainly to the Commonwealth Bank, increased by $5.2 million to $24.5 million but its assets decreased by $600,000 to $18 million. For the whole group the picture is clouded by inter-company loans and write-offs, some of a very questionable nature. But the trend is very clearly there. While Mr Keating was a half owner, this piggery group slid multimillions of dollars more into debt, a debt that the Commonwealth Bank believed 20 months ago it would not fully recover when it made a $4.5 million bad debt provision.

It cannot be because of expectations that the joint venture with the Danes would get the bank back the $20 million-odd it had lent by August 1992. By then, when the bank's credit committee made its $4.5 million provision for bad debts against the group—and remember that Mr Keating had by then been an owner for 1 1/4 years and Prime Minister for nine months—it was `on the basis that the joint-venture will proceed'. It expected to lose $4.5 million, even assuming the joint venture would proceed. According to that credit committee's report, it was `subject to the joint venture company arranging finance and should result in a reduction of the CBA's debt'. But this reduction would not be enough to save the bank as, it said, `the residual debt is projected to be around $10.3 million against security with an estimated value of $5.3 million', leaving a possible principal loss to the bank of $5.4 million.

         Against this, the bank made a provision of $4.5 million in the hope that cash flow from the piggeries could help the situation even though this `cannot be relied on to reduce the residual debt'. I repeat: whether there was to be a joint venture with the Danes or not, the banks stood to lose millions of dollars on Mr Keating's piggery. The credit committee's reason for the loss was the bank's `failure to investigate adequately the financial position of the operation'. Yet this bank had never required the group by then to meet its obligations under its mortgage documents to provide the bank with audited annual returns, which would have shown it how bad things really were. How could this politically well-connected group have managed to get away with this for years?

Was this money recirculated to provide, perhaps indirectly, the funds to finance Mr Keating's purchase of the Euphron shares, with none of it going to provide any financial assistance in real terms to the cash strapped piggery group? I stress, there is no evidence of that money going into the piggery group. I think it should be shown whether it did.

First of all, I want to canvass the issues relating to mobility and education problems. It is an area that I have spoken about before and it is one that I will continue to talk about whilst ever we do not have a national curricula and whilst ever we have differences between states on things such as student commencement ages, including the age and year that students enter high school.

         In this country, which has now been a federation for 93 years, whilst we have a standard national railway gauge, we are still unable to agree that we could have a national handwriting style. It was only in 1988-89 that we got the states to agree to the different handwriting styles for our students. We have not yet got to the stage of having a national handwriting style. It is a pretty simple, elementary and fundamental thing that people should be able to read what others write.

         Prior to that stage, schools made students change their styles of handwriting. I notice that some people are laughing about that. Yes, there are a number of us who do not write well. I would say that I do not write very clearly because I was one of those students who were forced to change handwriting style. When I did correspondence, we learnt how to do running writing. Then I went to a primary school, into third grade when I should have gone into fourth grade—but that is beside the point, although it proves that schools do not understand the different systems—and I was made to do printing, which I had never been taught. Those are the sorts of problems that students of defence families and mobile families who move interstate are forced to face each year.

         The starting age is one that has only recently been fixed. We had a ludicrous situation in 1988-89. There was a well publicised case of twins who started school at four years and nine months in Victoria and, in the middle of the year, their parents were posted to Queensland. Even though they had spent five months at school, they could not continue their school education. They had to go back to preschool. We have moved past that slightly, but it is still a problem and an issue that parents are having to argue out every time they move state.

         There is also the issue of the differing curricula. When I talk about national curricula, I am not suggesting that, at 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoons, all the children doing a particular curricula should be learning the same thing. What we need are the same outcomes so that, when students move from school to school, they can do so with the least disruption to their studies. There is no point in calling a subject economics when what is taught in each economic strand across each state, and sometimes within the states, varies and often is totally different.

         There is no point in saying that a student is doing economics when it has no relevance, no meaning—there is nothing to compare it with. It is just an individual subject. For these students we have to have a national curriculum. I thought, as many people thought, that we had actually got to the stage of agreement with the states on a national curriculum a number of years ago. But what we have seen of the last several council meetings of Australian education ministers is that they have not been able to agree on a national curriculum. The states are each still arguing that their curriculum is the best one and therefore they are not going to change. The other states' curricula are inadequate.

         However, each state still manages to produce about the same number of students who go to university and about the same number of students who end up getting PhDs. We do not see at the end of their education any major differences. Yet the states are still clinging like mad, like limpets to rocks, to the idea that their curricula are the best. They ignore the fact that, in 1987, some 70,000 students moved interstate. I do not know what the latest figure is but we are talking about approximately 70,000 students each year who move interstate and have to subject their education to disruption.

         Anybody whose education has been subjected to disruption understands the problems that that can bring. For students who are very bright that is not a problem; it is something that they can cope with and learn from. Moving can be a very positive and valuable experience. But the students have the right to be able to move without maximum disruption such as appears to be occurring at present. I would be very critical of the state ministers for their intransigent approach, for their lack of care, consideration and concern for the education needs of mobile children in our community.

         A number of them, when I was working for the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, would use the throwaway line, `It is only defence children that are affected'. That is a load of rubbish, the greatest piece of hogwash that one could ever see. Certainly, a number of defence families are involved. They are the most articulate and the best organised, and they are talking on behalf of every child in this country who moves state for education. There are also a number of people who follow the horticultural industries around. They move around, following the crops that have to be picked or to be harvested. Their children are affected. It is across the board. Industry, these days as it becomes more mobile, moves its executives, its workers across state borders.

The states keep ignoring the needs of these people. I make sure that I keep raising the issue for people to go and debate, for the media to go and ask the states and to say to the people from the NCGSF, the National Consultative Group of Service Families, that what they are aiming to achieve is highly commendable.

         Back in 1989 there was a committee set up by ministers in the Australian Education Council to look at the issue of mobility and education. It came up with a very good report. It had four books in a mobility package. Two of those were aimed at providing teachers with information about the differences between the state systems and about how they can reduce that difference. One package provided information for parents on how they can minimise the trauma to children as they move from state to state. It gave the parents hints on the type of material to collect for their children to take to the school that they were going to so that they could show the school what level the students were at. There was also a book in that package from the employer.

Nobody knows anything about it. It has not, at the state level, been disseminated to the grassroots teachers. That is the problem. It has not been disseminated to the principals of schools. I have asked principals and they do not know what I am talking about, unless they are among the small number of principals in schools who are very directly involved and have large numbers of defence family children. But for the rest of the schools in New South Wales—I can speak only for New South Wales—we have principals and teachers who do not quite understand as well as they would like to understand. It is not as well as they should understand; it is as well as they would like to. They want to give their students the best assistance they can but they are not being allowed to do this because the state of New South Wales did not disseminate that information.

For that I would condemn her most strongly. I would condemn the New South Wales state government most strongly for its lack of care and concern about that particular group of students in its care—the mobile students. As I say, 70,000 of them moved around this country in 1987. It is an issue that I hope keeps being pursued. I will certainly keep pursuing the ministers over it. I know that the federal minister will and I know that the service spouses and families will. I know that there are a number of other groups which will keep doing so.

         The other thing we see happening in New South Wales is that it is becoming more regionalised and schools are getting more local say as to what should be in the curriculum. In some cases, one cannot even move within the state without facing the same problems as those students face when they move across the state borders. This is an issue that has to be addressed. Another issue in relation to mobile students coming into areas in New South Wales is that the catchment boundary programs that used to be in operation have been done away with or relaxed. They meant that if students lived in a certain area they had to go to a school in a certain area and they had to seek permission to move outside that area.

         I have had complaints from defence families that, if they get a late posting or a transfer, if they do not know about that posting or transfer until October of the previous year and it is a week or two or even a month before they can go and visit where they are going to be posted to look at the schools, there are no places left. Those people who are outside the area have filled it up because they may perceive this to be a good school. The defence families and those people moving into the area are having to educate their children away from where they live. So not only do they have the problem of having to get used to difficult curricula and different schools, they have the problem that they cannot even have their own school friends come and visit them at home because they could be two or three suburbs away. For small children, this is discrimination. The states have to do something about it.

         Whilst I am talking about New South Wales, I would like to remind people here that I frequently get complaints about road funding—not enough money is being spent on roads. The opposition has frequently come up with that criticism. The week before last we saw the shires association president, Wally Mitchell, disclose that somewhere in the vicinity of $60 million of funding to roads in New South Wales got returned to consolidated revenue. Something like half the New South Wales roads budget went back to consolidated revenue.

         Senator Tierney is not here but I would challenge him to go and talk to his friends in the government in New South Wales, not come complaining here about road funding. I would encourage him to go and give Bruce Baird a shake in the leg and say, `Hey, come on, you have put money back into consolidated revenue. You should be expending that on roads.' It becomes even more horrific in New South Wales when we consider that in the last 18 months or so we have actually taken about 1,500 kilometres of road care, control and work from New South Wales because we have increased the national highway system. The Newell Highway and the Sturt Highway are now Commonwealth responsibilities and are therefore for us to fund. So there are fewer roads for New South Wales to fund but in fact it is returning something like $60-odd million to consolidated revenue. The area that is being discriminated against most there is definitely the bush.

         Down on the south coast there are councils that have to rip up their sealed roads and return them to gravel because they cannot afford the upkeep on them. They cannot afford the upkeep because the New South Wales government will not give them the funding that they are entitled to. The New South Wales government has basically taken the money given to it by the Commonwealth and whacked a whole lot of it into its consolidated revenue to help it with its debts. That is not fair on the citizens of New South Wales. Every time I have someone complain about road funding in my state, I intend to make sure that the blame is sheeted home to where it should go: the Fahey-Armstrong government is the body responsible.

         At that opening, I was present when a conversation took place between two people involved in the proceedings, one of whom was from Minister Griffiths's staff. I will comment on that later. The state member again stood up and pulled a cheque out of his pocket. Good stuff! They deserve it. The club needs more than $2,000; it needs about $40,000 from the state government so that a sprung floor can be put in, but that is beside the point. The conversation went something along the lines of, `The minister has the cheque to present, does he not?' at which the staffer looked a little sheepish and embarrassed and made the comment that the minister would be playing it by ear.

         —Mr Acting Deputy President, never let it be said that we on this side of the chamber are not charitable. I have listened for the last 15 minutes of Senator West's 20-minute contribution. I thought she was in state parliament in New South Wales, because I could not find any point of relevance to this federal budget. I certainly could not find any point of relevance to the appropriations; and Senator West, having fired off her great shot, is now going to leave the chamber. That is probably good for the relevance that we are going to have in this debate.

         —It is interesting to note that if this were Queensland Mr Willis would be probably on charges, because in Queensland it is illegal to tell fortunes. The reason it is illegal to tell fortunes is that some time ago we had a spate of con men fleecing innocent members of the public. And that is exactly what this budget is. It is a con man's budget, because none of the figures in the budget are of any worth or any substance at all. For example, it is suggested that the economy will grow this year by 4 1/2 per cent. The budget also predicts that the economy will grow the year after by 4 1/4 per cent, and each of the two following years by four per cent. That brings us up to around about 1998.

         There is only one problem with that, and that is that a week before the budget came out, in its white paper on unemployment the government predicted that economic growth between now and the year 2000 would average 4 3/4 per cent. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to know that if one starts with 4 1/2, adds 4 1/4, adds four, adds four more and then divides by four, one does not get to 4 3/4 per cent. In fact, we will need growth of around about 5 3/4 per cent in each of the last two years of the decade. Assuming there is no more boom-bust cycle, we are going to need a growth rate of 5 3/4 per cent to get to that growth rate of 4  3/4 that was predicted in the white paper.

         Which document, I ask, is correct? Is the white paper correct, with its predictions of 4 3/4 per cent growth on average for each year from now and until the year 2000, or is the budget correct? This is the problem, honourable senators, that faces those of us who attempt to read this budget: that it does not make any sense at all. It is a total and utter nonsense. If one goes to Budget Paper No. 1, one finds that on page 2.30 the Treasury itself states:

        The central feature of the economic outlook is the substantial pick-up in business investment. Forecasting business investment is, however, difficult since the timing of investment decisions is flexible and heavily influenced by changes in sentiment. While an increase in business investment in 1994-95 is certainly in prospect, the strength and timing of the pick-up are less certain.
       </para>
       <para>
        They certainly are less certain, Madam Acting Deputy President, because in the March quarter of the 1993-94 year we saw business investment decline by five per cent, instead of seeing the predicted continued growth in business investment which was a centrepiece of the budget estimates. It declined by five per cent in that quarter, so it is quite simply ludicrous to attach any credence to, or to have any confidence in, the predictions that this government has put in its budget.

         I am sure that Senator Minchin, who is coming into the chamber now, knows full well that the people on the other side have absolutely no credibility when it comes to economic forecasting. Senator Minchin comes from the state of South Australia. If the economic brains of the Labor Party in South Australia perpetuate their policies across this country, then we are really in serious strife, because it was the Labor Party in South Australia which managed to clock up the $3 billion debt, as Senator Minchin said before, for a state bank in a state with one and a half million people.

They would fail remedial mathematics. They are the most appalling economic forecasters that this country has ever seen, and yet here they are coming up with a budget in which they predict that everything is going to be great. Hey-presto! There are going to be no problems! Yet before we get to the end of this financial year it will undoubtedly be necessary for this government to revise its economic forecasts, if only on the matter of business investment growth. With business investment falling in the last half of the 1993-94 financial year—Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you will understand—we have to have even bigger growth than the 14 1/2 per cent in the 1993-94 year to get to the actual dollar amount of investment which is a centrepiece of this budget.

         Then, of course, we come to all the other great fiddles. One of the other great fiddles is the problem that we have with the government's borrowings. If one reads the budget, one might be fooled into believing that the government is only going to borrow $11.7 billion, because that is what the deficit is. Most people equate a deficit with borrowing. In other words, if they are going to spend more than they have, then they have to borrow the money to make up the difference. It is true that the deficit is part of the money that the government has to borrow; but the truth is that, instead of having to borrow $11.7 billion this year, this government is going to have to borrow $20.4 billion this year—almost double what the deficit is. What is the reason for the government having to borrow $20,000 million this year? The reason why the government has to borrow $20,000 million this year is because a lot of the other money it has been borrowing over the past years is coming up for repayment, and this government is incapable of repaying the money it owes.

         What is it going to do? It is going to roll that debt over. That is why this government will be taking $20.4 billion out of the economy this year. That is the amount that it will be sucking out of the lending institutions in this country. The surprising thing is that the $20.4 billion that the government is going to borrow is going to be borrowed, principally, in three- to 10-year bonds. Anybody who knows anything about business investment or who knows anything about banking, will be aware that they are exactly the same sorts of maturities that the banks and the lending institutions need to finance business investment.

         Here is the government pinning all of its hopes of an economic recovery on a 14 1/2—probably now 16—per cent growth in business investment. To fund that business investment growth, companies need to borrow money, but the money that they need to borrow has already been borrowed by the federal government. It stands to reason that there are only two consequences: either that the growth in business investment will not occur because the money will not be there to fund it; or, alternatively, if businesses do go ahead and borrow the money that the government expects them to borrow and spend, the price of that money will go up.

         The price of money is interest rates. Just like any other commodity, if demand exceeds supply, the price goes up. If there are more people out in the economy wanting to borrow money than there are people wanting to lend, it stands to reason that interest rates, which are the price of money, will go up. That is why an inevitable consequence of this government's budget, the budget produced by, quite clearly, totally incapable economic managers, will be higher interest rates for all Australians—not just business borrowers, but also those who are borrowing for their own home mortgage.

         Now, of course, we come to the great deception. Now, of course, we see exactly how this government operates. To anybody with any knowledge of economics it stands to reason that this massive borrowing, combined with an increase in the current account deficit, will see an increase in interest rates. But the Treasurer (Mr Willis) reassures us, with his hand on his heart, that interest rates will not go up. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) assures us, with his hand on his heart, that interest rates will not go up. When he was Treasurer, of course, he told us he had the recession in control, that he was pulling all the levers, that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket, and that he had the financial institutions in his pocket. It is a shame that he had his hand in his pocket at the same time.

         The truth is that interest rates are going to go up, and that is why the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, ran around telling banks that they had a responsibility to tell home buyers that interest rates were going to go up. But while the Treasurer expected banks to tell them that, he reserved the right as Treasurer of this country to tell blatant mistruths to the financial sector and to the mortgage borrowers, and to all of the other people in this country who owe money, not to worry because interest rates were not going to go up. What is going on in this country? Why is it the Reserve Bank is saying that interest rates are going to go up and that the banks have to warn their clients, and yet the Treasurer is saying, with his hand on his heart, `Look, do not worry, interest rates are not going to go up this year'? This is nothing but the most blatant, the most craven and the most dishonest deception that we have seen for quite a while. Yet these people say to the people of Australia, `Trust us. Put your life in our hands. Put your house in our hands. Put your family's future in our hands' because, they say, they are good economic managers.

Yet there is a different standard that applies to this government from that which applies to the borrowers and the business people out there in our community.

         He was referring there to 25 per cent foreign ownership. It was astounding that the Prime Minister refused to appear before the Senate committee. In fact, the Prime Minister indicated that he would not slum it before a Senate committee. On that basis, the committee could only proceed with the evidence before it. The rules of natural justice demand that, where there is an allegation against someone, that person has a right to put forward his or her version of events. That opportunity was more than amply given to the Prime Minister but he arrogantly threw it aside.

          I note that in the dissenting report the government senators stated that the Prime Minister's remarks were light-hearted and jocular. I would like to know where they got that from, because he did not appear before the committee to tell us so. There is no evidence to back that up. I submit to the Senate that this dissenting report from the government senators is without foundation and full of presumption.

          What is so damning is that at the time in question, November 1992, the government faced the run-up to an election, which occurred in March 1993. It was in that heady atmosphere, when the government thought it was about to lose the election, that foreign ownership of the print media was discussed. We find that on 20 April, some five weeks after the election—surprise, surprise!—Treasurer Dawkins increased the limit of foreign ownership in the Fairfax empire from just under 15 per cent to 25 per cent. Those figures belie the hundreds of millions of dollars we are talking about and the magnitude of this deal.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          So the committee reported in its conclusions that Mr Keating did attempt to exert pressure on Fairfax for favourable election coverage by making a linkage between balance in election coverage and an increased ownership limit for Mr Black. What the committee said was that the Prime Minister had improperly used his office in order to exert pressure on a media baron. It did not say that there was evidence of a deal being made, as some people on the other side have suggested or as some people in the press have misunderstood. The situation is that, despite Conrad Black's evidence that there was no nudge and no wink, we are still left with that evidence from the Prime Minister's own mouth, from the book written by Conrad Black, that there was this grubby attempt at influencing the media by the Prime Minister. The second point I wish to raise concerns the Foreign Investment Review Board. In examining the first point, the committee had cause to look generally at the regulation of foreign investment in Australia. As it did so, it had to cast its attention back to events in 1991 when the Fairfax publishing empire was taken over by a foreign interest. That takeover demonstrates vividly the shortcomings of the current system. What happened was that there were two foreign contenders—Independent Newspapers and the Tourang syndicate—and at home there was the all-Australian bid by Australian Independent Newspapers. Before the two foreigners could compete with the Australian product, they had to get past the Foreign Investment Review Board and be allowed into the arena to compete.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Of course, it was during the consideration of that that we had the minute of the Foreign Investment Review Board dated 5 December 1991, wherein one finds criticism by the author of that minute of the Australian bid. The Australian bid was criticised for having little newspaper experience and no financial backing. Of course, those points were absolutely false. The Australian bid was thoroughly competent and it was backed well financially. In fact, AIN, the Australian bid, had the highest bid in for Fairfax. What the committee found was that there was this Australian bid being judged in its absence, judged behind closed doors. On the basis of that, the foreign bidder was allowed into the arena. That is a disgraceful situation and the committee questioned that at length.

          That takes us to the third aspect of this whole inquiry—the stonewalling that the committee came up against from the Public Service. Now I do not make any criticism of the public servants involved for not giving evidence. They were between a rock and a hard place because they had been directed by the Treasurer not to say anything. They had been directed by the Treasurer not to answer our questions. There we were, elected representatives of the people of Australia, and we found that we were getting refusals as to our inquiry. The people of Australia were denied information. Democracy was suffering a severe blow that day. In fact, it is this aspect which has been referred to the privileges committee and on which that committee will report back in September 1994.

That is the power of this Senate and its committees to inquire, on behalf of the people of Australia, into matters of national importance. If a foreign takeover of an empire worth $1.5 billion is not a matter of national importance, then I do not know what is. That is what this committee came up against. That is the third aspect of this inquiry which is most important.

          It is entirely unsatisfactory that we have a Treasurer directing the public servants involved in this matter not to answer our questions. Who wrote that damning minute? Where did it come from, and on whose advice? Why take into account an Australian bidder when the process was that you do not? In fact, we were told that when the Foreign Investment Review Board considered outsiders, it did not have regard to any domestic bidders. But here we had this minute which damned the Australian bidder in its absence—a thorough disgrace—and all this done in secret.

He can see that this is needed. In fact, in the dissenting report by the government senators they, too, can see it. If anyone can query the work of this committee, one just has to look at the recommendations of this report—one of the largest reports tabled in the Senate—to see that the taxpayer of Australia, the Australian citizen, has got great value for the effort, time and expense that went into this report. Any question that is raised that we should found ourselves on the American system, a system which says that it is inappropriate for a house committee to investigate the workings of the press, I find thoroughly distasteful. In fact, recently the Australian press was found to be one of the freest in the world. I believe Australia has a great system. We do not have to look to America for advice.

I believe it is one which history will judge as having played an important role in assessing foreign investment review in this country, the workings of the press and the relationship of a government or, more importantly, a Prime Minister who tried to exert undue influence on that press. In the course of it we have touched on those most important issues of the power of the Senate and its committees.

          The 1991 level of foreign print media ownership permitted by the government was based on a caucus decision of 10 October 1991 limiting foreign voting ownership to 20 per cent. Both foreign bids in broad terms—and ultimately—made the obvious determination that their bids must comply with this. Both bids came under examination under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeover Act, in addition to the requirement applying to mass circulation newspapers referred to previously, and could have been blocked under the act. Both bids were approved by the government but the Black bid only became competitive by an 11th hour change. The nuts and bolts of these last minute machinations can only be speculated upon. Against the approved foreign buyers stood the all-Australian Australian Independent Newspapers bid which had an offer to the receivers that can only be described as more than competitive.

          However, it was not successful and neither was the O'Reilly bid, the winner being Mr Black. A number of reasons have been advanced for Black's success but Mr Burrows says basically it revolved around the lower risk of completion that could take place almost immediately. Clearly there was a trade-off between the early completion by Black and the higher price of the AIN bid which could have taken some weeks to bed down.

          It is fair to say that the receiver was looking at considerably more money if he had chosen the AIN offer. It is not appropriate for me to say more except that it is very puzzling in hindsight why the AIN bid was not successful; why the government took such a dim view of AIN's ability; why the FIRB refused offers to be briefed on AIN; and, why the FIRB gave damaging and incorrect advice to the government on AIN as Senator Ellison just mentioned.

          Before I speak of the substantive and long-term value of the committee, namely, the changes to FIRB, there is another matter with regard to foreign and Australian ownership of the print media I wish to canvass. Mr Cameron O'Reilly submitted to the committee that, notwithstanding the FIRB interest in all print media purchases, restrictions on foreign investment in regional newspapers should be removed. Regional newspapers are defined as those with a circulation limited to less than 50,000 per day operating in a restricted geographical area. In practical words, what is in the national interest for regional newspapers, those papers not setting the national agenda, is obviously different to the Fairfax situation which may, of course, never happen again.

          Mr O'Reilly pointed out by way of international comparison that Australia's foreign investment guidelines for the media are substantially more restrictive than any other significant country. As far as I am concerned, the relaxation of foreign investment in the print media generally is not something with which I have a problem although I have the obvious jingoistic belief in Australian ownership. Concern about what is in the national interest does not come down to a bald and abstract determination exhibited as a percentage only of foreign ownership. This may, of course, simply be a disguise for real foreign control with the existing media guidelines. I cite the example of the control that Canwest presently has on Channel 10 as the obvious example.

A number of witnesses, reflecting not only the 1991 decision, said that the rules by which FIRB operates must inevitably lead to a lack of foreign investor confidence and a diminution in our international reputation.

I refer to the continuing offensive comments in France by the Prime Minister, who has assured the French that after we become a republic they will find Australian culture more welcoming than in the past—a continuation of his anti-British sentiment. This morning he added the even more fanciful assertion that we cannot fully make our way in the Asia-Pacific region under our current constitution. Will Senator Ray please explain on behalf of the Prime Minister how our progress in Asia is in any way restrained or inhibited by our current constitution?

There will be many shots fired from both sides in considering the relative positions of whether Australia should or should not become a republic. But in the end, that is a decision that the Australian people will make. It is not a decision that governments or oppositions will make. It is a decision that the Australian people will make. The wider and broader that debate is, the more informed that decision will be. As evidence of that, I refer to a statement made on 22 March 1993, in which this individual says:

         —Mr President, Senator Burns has every right to look forward to the answer with great pleasure because this is unashamedly good news. Although we have always acknowledged that monthly figures can vary, the figures today are exceptionally good, with the unemployment rate for May at 9.8 per cent. This is the first time since August 1991 that the unemployment rate in Australia has dropped below 10 per cent. During May, employment grew by 30,500 to its highest level since August 1990. Unemployment fell in May by 23,000 and has fallen by more than 100,000 in the past seven months. Employment grew for both full-time and part-time workers, and the strong increase of 21,400 in full-time employment is particularly encouraging.

         This is the ninth consecutive month of employment growth in Australia. It follows the recent release of the government's historic white paper, Working Nation, which will encourage even more job growth because of its attractive array of incentives to encourage Australian businesses to employ more Australians, particularly the long-term unemployed. Since April last year more than 260,000 new jobs have been created, and the government's election pledge in March 1993 to create 500,000 new jobs over three years is more than well on track. It is interesting to note that the participation rate for May remains stable at 62.6 per cent. I think many commentators believed that it would have risen and that the employment rate would not have come down in the way it has.

Unfortunately, unemployment rose by 0.4 per cent in South Australia. Whether that reflects the impact of the policies of the new Liberal government is hard to know, but it cannot be ignored. It is something that should be taken on board by those opposite, who keep shouting at us about the virtues of the new Liberal government in South Australia.

If the FIRB wants lessons in openness, lessons in leaking, and lessons in prejudging, all it has to do is go to this committee. Before every meeting we saw Judge Roy Bean here giving us a preview. After every committee meeting he gave us a review of what happened at the meeting. If we have a long look at the record of Judge Roy Bean here—Senator Alston—we can see that he consistently put on the public record the deliberations of the committee. He consistently put on the record what his views were of what the committee was doing.

The forecast for next year is an acceleration to 2.9 per cent—up again on last December's forecast of 2.7 per cent for 1995.

         —The first two parts of the question are based on fallacy, and the third on a rather poorly drafted question in an opinion poll. I hope I get a chance to deal with the third part, but let me deal with the serious elements of the first and second. My advice is that it is not true that Australia was isolated at the recent meeting of the UN Commission for Sustainable Development, as Senator Spindler implies in his question. It is our view that there may well be more appropriate international organisations with expertise to take the lead on work on trade and the environment, specifically the World Trade Organisation, UNCTAD, UNEP and the OECD. All of these are actively looking at the issue at the moment: a proliferation of bodies looking at the same issue may be more expensive but not necessarily more productive. So there is a question of who should most appropriately conduct this work while avoiding duplication and building on the experience and background which those organisations already have in this area. That is the position which was taken by Australia and by others.

         It is also a fallacy to suggest that the government opposes the development of trade policies which take account of environmental consequences. Agenda 21 or the Rio declaration, both of which I think Senator Spindler supports, said that an open and non-discriminatory, multi-lateral trading system is an important contribution towards sustainable development. It is certainly the view of most people that reduced agricultural subsidies, for example, would reduce the production of agriculture in uneconomic and environmentally sensitive areas in Europe and in North America, for example, and they would make significant improvements in terms of sustainable development.

         Those are important issues for Australia to look at in its domestic policy and internationally to participate in these important international fora which affect the future of all Australians, even if some senators would like us to opt out of these organisations because they are trying to go back to the old certainties of the 1950s. I do not mean Senator Spindler: I mean those opposite.

         It is true that trade liberalisation also requires complementary domestic industry and environment policies in order to realise its potential in promoting sustainable development. On the third point of the question, there is an OECD meeting on 23 June. The broad approach that the government will take there will be consistent with the policies I have just outlined.

         I want to take up that part of Senator Spindler's question about the Saulwick poll. If the Saulwick organisation had gone out and asked, `Would you like inefficient Australian industry to be subsidised by a tax on cheap clothing and food?', people would have said, `No.' That is exactly what Senator Spindler is advocating. He is saying, `Let us put up the price of the cheapest food and clothing in Australia.' He thinks he is opposed to a consumption tax but he supports tariffs; he has got a problem. If we put a tariff on clothing we put up the price of clothes, and most effectively work on the price of clothing that goes to the poorest Australians. He is saying, `Let us keep efficient industries here by charging the poor more for their food and clothing.' If that question had been asked in the opinion poll there would not have been 75 per cent approval. Senator Spindler wants tariffs but he does not want prices to go up. I am sorry, it does not work like that.

To this end, community workshops will be held in each capital city during late June and early July.

         Our exports to China are already worth $2.3 billion. There is significant Australian investment in China and Chinese investment in Australia. The business that flows from these forums will ensure that these figures increase dramatically. This was a significant delegation in terms of its sheer size and in terms of the list of projects it proposed. The most important thing is that it shows the significant possibility that, when government provides its resources to make business possible and creates a climate in which the private sector can respond, we have a significant potential with the increased efficiency of our economy to participate significantly in the biggest market in the world and to succeed in ways that will create significant economic benefit to Australia and jobs for Australians.

         As I have indicated all along, there has been abuse of the rights of access to the CSIRO. The reputations of CSIRO's scientists and their professional opinions have been held up to ridicule under parliamentary privilege in this chamber by people without the professional qualifications to make the judgments to gainsay the opinions of those scientists. The names of officers of the CSIRO have been put on the public record when they were simply passing on information in an appropriate way, as if their standing is able to be attacked and their reputations damaged. For those reasons, the normal conventions of the Westminster system and access to the Public Service or public authorities such as the CSIRO need to be applied, and that is what has happened. It has applied across the board.

In the Queensland parliament today, the premier admitted that a compensation agreement regarding sand mining leases on Fraser Island was negotiated in 1990-91 between the Queensland government and Pivot Projects, a company belonging to Mr Peter Laurance. Pivot Projects then sold its interest in the mining leases to another Pivot company and assigned the compensation payment to that company, but not before it took a very healthy sale price, thereby effectively ensuring that much of the money ended up with Mr Laurance. Is this not exactly the same sort of scam that is about to occur if the federal government revokes the sand mining leases at Shoalwater Bay? Why was the decision made to go ahead with the granting of the leases in the first place against a wealth of advice from conservation groups, the Queensland government, federal government departments and the CSIRO? Why did the government change its mind and set up an inquiry so soon after the leases were granted?

Following a protracted environmental impact assessment process, which was hampered by the lack of proven mineral resource and the quality of information provided by the proponent, which was the then owner of Murphyores, Pivot Projects Pty Ltd, the government agreed, on 15 October 1990, to issue five leases for the mining of mineral sands.

An agreement for mining leases includes a process for the environmental oversight of a four-stage mineral exploration program and, if required, mining operation.

In reaching this recommendation, the inquiry had on hand what I believe was the best available information about the environmental and economic values and potential of the Shoalwater Bay training area.

         of 6 June that he supports the payment of a maternity allowance to all mothers, even if they are not in the paid work force. My question is whether such a payment is to be regarded as a welfare measure or an equity measure; what consideration is being given to a permanent increase in family payment or tax relief in respect of children to recognise the obvious fact that children do not become cheaper after 12 weeks of maternity leave; given that larger families have greater income needs, what consideration is being given to payment allowances on a per child basis; and, given criticism of the cost of social security payments, what consideration is being given to restoring tax relief for family members so that their support of each other out of the paid work force may be recognised?

         In Australia, whilst the majority of women have access to unpaid maternity leave, few employees, apart from those in areas of the public sector, have access to paid maternity leave. Professor Bettina Cass, chair of the National Council of the International Year of the Family, has advocated a two-part system of parental benefits that would provide effective choice to parents caring for babies to leave the work force to care for their child by the payment of a young child or infant parenting allowance for all parents taking care of a newborn or adopted child in the first 12 weeks, with the community sharing the cost, as with other family payments, through the social security system, or, by paid maternity leave, where workers have an entitlement under an award or enterprise agreement.

        There has rarely been a bigger leap in Australian history from branch stacker to Acting PM. That is what Senator Ray did today, and it was a mighty leap. On his first day as the acting leader of this country, he was given a very great task to defend the utterly absurd remarks that Mr Keating made overseas on his visit to Paris. It is well known, of course, that Mr Keating does not like Senator Ray. He calls Senator Ray names and there have been press reports that Mr Keating does not, in fact, speak to Senator Ray all that much. But, when Mr Keating comes back from Paris, he should give a big thank you to Senator Ray because today at least he tried to defend the indefensible.

         This issue was put to the leader of the Australian republican movement. Some weeks ago he was asked to comment on whether he agreed with Mr Keating's view. According to a newspaper report, Malcolm Turnbull basically said that what Mr Keating was saying in relation to our constitutional arrangements and our links with Asia was absolute nonsense and was not a line that the republican movement accepted or was prepared to run. Malcolm Turnbull, who has got it wrong on a number of occasions on this issue, has got this absolutely right.

         Senators Reynolds and Schacht should look at the logic of the argument that we have to express our national identity more effectively and become a republic in order to please our neighbours. That proposition is absolutely absurd. Those opposite run a nationalistic line and say, `It is absolutely vital that we change our constitutional arrangements because that will please our neighbours.' That is absolutely insulting to our people and, frankly, insulting to our neighbours, who could not care less. If any of our neighbours did care less—and I do not believe they ever would—and came to me and said, `Senator Kemp, you really should change your constitution because we are not too happy about it,' we would send them packing. But they are not the slightest bit interested, and the republican movement is not the slightest bit interested, in such a proposition.

         —I am not surprised that Senator Kemp would use this opportunity to express his view that everything in Australia should stay as it was in 1880 or 1890. The material that he has been persistently putting out over the last three or four years since the republican debate started basically says: leave everything absolutely the same. I remember debating him in this chamber before the 1993 election. At that time he pointed out to us that he was a Liberal senator for Victoria looking after a number of Labor held electorates in the western suburbs. He said, `Senator Schacht, you go out to Footscray, you go out to Coburg, you go out to those Labor electorates and see whether the working class are interested in the republican issue. We will debate you any time on this issue.'

         In the 1993 election speech, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it absolutely clear that the policy of Australia becoming a republic would be debated. There was a commitment as to the date—that is, 2001 on the centenary of federation. It was unambiguous, unequivocal in the policy speech. The Prime Minister made that announcement up front on television. The election took place, and guess who won, Senator Kemp? We won. Guess what happened in all of those western suburbs in Melbourne, all the traditional Labor areas? There was an outstanding result. Maybe it was because Senator Kemp campaigned there that we did even better than could have been expected. We did very well in those areas in which Senator Kemp campaigned. People knew that that was our policy.

         Senator Kemp asked `What does it mean?', and said that if someone came to us saying that we ought to change our constitution we would send that person packing. That is a typical antediluvian, troglodyte attitude of the far Right of the Victorian conservatives. They do not want to change from the 1880s. I suspect that in the Melbourne Club—that group of people who changed the leadership of the Liberal Party—one of the things they want to bring back is knighthoods. They want to give themselves gongs.

         Let us get on to something else. Why do we not talk about Senator Schacht's proposals to overhaul the legal system of this country? I spent three years on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs with Senator Schacht when he was advocating that we should not follow the current legal system and that, in fact, we should do away with juries and judges in the form we have them, do away with the adversarial system and, instead, have the French system with a judge who was also a prosecutor. He wanted the inquisitorial system rather than the adversarial system.

         This is the same Senator Schacht who says, `Let us make Australian law Australian.' What does he want to do? He wants to throw away our current legal system, which we have helped develop, and adopt the French or Italian legal system which has been seen and exposed as an utter joke in all the countries in which it is used. It is not surprising that Senator Schacht wants to take up the French legal system. After all, Senator Schacht supports the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who has gone to Paris to get advice on how to turn Australia into a republic. I suppose the French have a lot of experience turning their country into a republic; they have done it five times to date. They are on their fifth republic, not their first. Most of them have been lamentable failures.

It seems quite clear from that statement that the instigation of these demands or restrictions must have come from Senator Cook.

          That is the sort of incident that Senator Cook, quite rightly, says should not occur. It is embarrassing to senior officers when someone turns up like that and insists on sitting in on the meeting to get information. The officers do not know what the ground rules are and whether he got the permission of a minister and so on. I think that is the particular episode that Senator Cook is dealing with, and I fully support him.

         On the issue Senator Ferguson raised about the coming inquiry, I have listened to the remarks made by Senator Panizza and Senator Coulter about the inquiry and about funding for rural research in particular. I want to make this very clear: the decisions taken to reduce the research capacity of CSIRO in the rural sector, in the rural area, were taken by the board and the senior management of CSIRO; they were not taken by the government. Those decisions were made in a priority setting arrangement that was taken on by the board. With that capacity, it made those decisions.

         Even if we increased funding to the level that Senator Coulter might want, there is no guarantee that the funds would go into that area because the government does not direct where the funding goes in CSIRO. It is a one-line budget for three years, and the board makes decisions on advice from the senior management. That is what the act says; that is the power. So the reduction in expenditure and effort in the rural research area is a decision of the board and the executive.

         The example was raised in the debate of the Division of Wool Technology at Geelong. I was approached by the staff there, who were concerned about their future and about the cutbacks because wool levy money was going down due to the decline in wool prices and so on. I raised my concern with the senior executive of CSIRO, Dr Stocker, as a result of representations made to me by Mr Gavan O'Connor, the honourable member for Corio, whose constituents were getting concerned about their future. I thought there was a reasonable case for money being provided to get that division through this period until wool prices went up. But the decision in the end was made by the management and the board of CSIRO; it was not made by the government.

         I hope this inquiry, when all the information is before it, will look at what is clearly the philosophical issue: do we want a stand-alone board of CSIRO, as it is at the moment, making its own decisions on the allocation of resources, independent from government and the parliament, or do we want ministerial direction, ministerial guidance and advice given so that the government, which is responsible here day by day, takes responsibility for where the money goes? I say to Senator Ferguson that this is an important philosophical issue that ought to be debated. But those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say one day, `Leave your hands off CSIRO; don't touch it,' and then say, `Now we want you to intervene and fix up some money for areas that we think personally are very important.'

Those opposite cannot have their cake and eat it too.

In this inquiry those issues may come out, and they ought to be debated.

Senator Schacht—when he spoke a moment ago said, `I support the decision of Senator Cook.' That poses the question put at the start of the debate: has Senator Cook issued a directive or not? According to Senator Cook, the answer is no; according to what Senator Schacht said, yes.

         I want to get back to some more fundamental matters.

         I want to go back to the answer given the other day connecting with the answer given today. Last week it was the coalition that walked into the CSIRO, and that has been identified through what has been said, but it was a parliamentarian who rang up the CSIRO. That poses the question: is that parliamentarian a member of the government, is it a Green, a member of the Democrats, a member of the National Party or a member of the Liberal Party? It goes to the heart of the matter as to where this direction has been put in place. I speak as somebody who has had contact with the CSIRO for some 20 years. I have had access to it and I have met with individuals, including scientists and others, in that organisation. We now have this direction in place, and no doubt as time goes on we will discover more and more things. Senator Schacht may say more on the matter and raise more issues.

         I also wish to mention the inquiry. The point raised by Senator Ferguson today is very relevant. In the process of this inquiry and restructuring that is taking place—and one is not opposed to restructuring carried out in a proper manner—what additional restrictions are being placed by the minister? What intervention is there in terms of the CSIRO? What direction is occurring as to which way it can move? It is all very well to stand up and talk about the philosophical position of the CSIRO, but there is no doubt, as Senator Cook made clear the other day, that political pressure is being put on the CSIRO and its future direction.

         It is the government itself which has placed restrictions on CSIRO by cutting its funding. It is the government itself which has placed certain impediments in the way of CSIRO by the processes of restructuring. It is the government itself which has placed certain impediments in the way by requiring that 30 per cent of the funds come from private sources. It is the government itself which has also placed emphasis on research for small and medium size businesses. Therefore, the government itself is having a heavy hand in the direction of CSIRO. That is the first point I want to make. Inevitably we have a situation where government must have an input and must be responsible for it.

In displaying the poster of former Senator Bishop, now Ms Bishop, in my window, nothing could be further from the truth. If Mr Warden had looked closely enough, he would have noticed that I have two posters of Ms Bishop in my window.

          Specifically, this response document ignores the commercial potential of Indonesia—a developing and technologically starved neighbour with over 180 million people. It also fails to acknowledge the leading role of the Northern Territory and other states in forging closer government and business links with Indonesia. Those links have been developing profoundly in the last few years and at a compounding rate of involvement and development.

          Certainly, as the shadow minister for northern development, I am disappointed to note the federal government's disregard for northern Australia in this response document. The original report which was tabled in November 1993 was the culmination of the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade over a considerable period of time. It was a very comprehensive report—over 300 pages. It went into a lot of detail, it addressed a lot of issues and certainly demanded more than the scant comments that have now been made in this 26-page government response, which just seems, as I said, to pick up a grab bag of issues and does not really come to grips with the issue. I think it is very insulting to the relationship, to the many people of goodwill both in Indonesia and in Australia who have been working hard in this particular area.

           Little or no mention is made of the north's strategic location in the bilateral relationship, nor of the potential to develop industry or create employment.

There is no indication from this response that the Wran committee even exists, let alone that it is doing a comprehensive amount of work.

          However, judging from this 26-page document, northern Australia is merely a good place to hold a conference—so much for the rhetoric of this federal Labor government.

          I am surprised this afternoon that, on an agenda completely different from my own, neither Senator Chamarette nor Senator Margetts is here to comment on the government's response to the issues of power and power generation and the very necessary debate on nuclear issues and the involvement of Indonesia in developing its own energy resources. The response to these issues on pages 22 and 23 of the report is only about two paragraphs long—about 20 words longer than the committee's recommendation regarding nuclear accidents in the region. It is important that we have dialogue with our nearest neighbour on such an important issue.

          It is to the credit of the Northern Territory government that it has now earned very considerable respect in Indonesia and in that region generally. The Northern Territory government has initiated a number of trade fairs, important trade missions and dialogues with specific areas and regions within Indonesia. There is no acknowledgment in this response of that sort of activity being undertaken by the Northern Territory government, the Western Australian government and the Queensland government. There are a few nice adjectives and a few crowing words about future dialogue, a couple of conferences and visits by ministers proposed over the next few months of the winter recess but the government is not building on work that has already been put in place.

There is one country in this world that has had about 53 governments in 47 years at the last count, and there is no prize for guessing—

         I wish to address what has been left out of the appropriation bill rather than what is in it. The rural and remote regions of Australia are the ones that are not very well included in this bill. The highest order of scale of neglect in this appropriation bill is in road funding. If we listen to the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, and look at his press release, we would not think that there were any omissions. I will get back to him later.

         It goes without saying that for the sake of safety it is important that we have safe and better roads. The black spot program has been removed. I know it is a sunset clause. If it was a good program it should have been kept going. In this appropriation bill the federal government has allocated $820 million in 1994-95 to `improve' Australia's national highways. That is half of the amount that was spent in 1992-93, and it is less than the $850 that was allocated in the budget of the last Fraser government. That $850 million has not even been converted to real terms.

         In the last year of the Fraser government 62.38 per cent of fuel excise went into roads. Out of the current appropriation only 8.54 per cent of fuel excise is going back into roads. Looking at the situation in Western Australia, I have a chart here from the budget papers. In 1980-81 the excise was $925 million, and 67.89 per cent went into roads. In 1982-93, the year of the last Fraser budget, it was still 62.38. In 1994-95 the projection shows that it goes down.

         —Where is the $9.7 billion that is being raised in fuel excise at the present moment? In 1997 the projection is that it will rise to $11.54 million. Where is it going? A lot of it is going into misdirected government programs. I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, it is not going on roads. In his press release of 3 June Mr Brereton said that the federal government will provide $822 million in 1994 to improve Australia's 18,500 kilometres ofighway. On top of that, Mr Brereton said that the government will provide $676 million of untied funding to assist the states.

         And so he goes on. There then follows a breakdown of the funding allocations. Out of that $820 million, $444 million will be spent on construction works, with an emphasis on extra funding for a number of major projects already started. So at least half of the allocation will be spent on existing projects rather than new ones. Therefore, those sections of highways that are in a very bad condition—quite a few of which I know about—will not receive immediate attention.

         Also out of that $820 million, $332 million will be spent on the maintenance of national highways. The press release notes that Australia has 18,500 kilometres of highways, which means that the allocation of $820 million works out at $17,945 per kilometre. To most people who are not experienced in the cost of road repair, that would seem a high figure. However, it must be remembered that the average Australian `black top' has an age slightly above 25 years, which means that Australia's highways are quickly approaching the end of their lives.

         Once a new bitumen road is laid at a cost of $80,000 per kilometre, for 15 years one can expect an almost maintenance-free life, with the exception of edge maintenance; between 10 and 25 years one can expect that a reasonable level of maintenance would be needed; between 25 and 35 years a reasonably high level of maintenance, and after 35 years the road should be ripped up and replaced with a new one. So, if Australia's highways are around 25 years old, they are rapidly approaching the stage where they will need more money spent on them. In other words, new highways will have to be laid at a cost in excess of $80,000 per kilometre. So, an allocation of $17,945 per kilometre is nowhere near enough. Further, out of that $820 million, $44 million will be spent on administrative expenses et cetera.

         I will just list the allocations for national highways. The back of the press release lists the allocation of this road money to the states and territories. It shows that New South Wales, represented by Senator Neal, will receive $328 million for its section of national highways, and untied funds of $97.63 million to local government—the greatest allocation of road funding in Australia. Next comes Victoria, with an allocation of $135 million. Yet only $58.13 million is allocated for Western Australia and $43.4 million in untied funds.

         I repeat that Western Australia's untied funds are $43.4 million, yet the Western Australian Minister for Transport, the Hon. Eric Charlton, of the National Party, who comes from Tammin, said that the minimum need for Western Australia is $53 million. I have often spoken in this place about the Northam bypass. From my observation of the traffic around that area, Northam has needed such a bypass for more than 10 years. The minimum cost of that bypass is $30 million. So where would that $43 million go in a vast state like Western Australia which, it should be remembered, produces 25 per cent of Australia's export income. The state has been badly treated.

         Western Australia is such a vast state that the $58 million that Mr Brereton has announced will have to be spent in areas remote from Perth. I am referring to projects such as development roads, road widening, bridge widening et cetera. Minimal funding is available for the wheat belt and the goldfields located 600 to 800 kilometres from Perth, which I would describe as being reasonably close to Perth. However, the money for those areas is most welcome. Recently, I drove from Kununurra to Halls Creek and back, and my colleague Senator Ellison drove from Broome to Halls Creek on the same day so that we could compare notes. But there is very little allocation for road funding in the areas of high population.

         Mr Brereton went to inspect the Greenmount accident site. Two persons were killed and 21 cars wrecked in that horrific accident—and it could have been a lot worse. Mr Brereton said he would do something about the condition of that road. He has done something about it—he has said, `Take it out of this allocation.' He did the same with the Northam bypass. So this government has certainly neglected Australia's roads.

         Earlier, I referred to the black spots program, initiated by Mr Bob Brown when he was Minister for Land Transport. This program targeted high accident areas and concentrated road spending on those areas. I admit that at the time I criticised the program because I thought it was a political stunt. I thought these black spots were located in marginal seats that the Labor government was trying to win. But I admit my mistake—it has turned out to be a top program, and I thought that the government would also have realised this and kept it going. However, for reasons best known to himself, Mr Keating terminated the program in 1993.

         A black spot near Wooroloo in Western Australia has been fixed but, unfortunately, it claimed the life of a good friend. However, for every $500,000 spent on a black spot, a life is saved. Each road fatality costs Australia $631,000. It is estimated that the black spot program has saved 540 lives and $340,740,000. During its life, the black spot program cost only $270 million. With those figures in mind, I would like to know why the Keating government terminated the program. For every $1 million spent on roads, 61 person-years of employment are created, together with 25 jobs directly related to roads and 36 jobs in related industries such as manufacturing and transport.

         The benefit of road construction is spread throughout the community in job creation. While that is obvious, when this spending was initially allocated I said that it would only go to recognised present-day contractors. But many times when such contractors go to an area to do a job, they tend to pick up local employment, which is good.

I know I said before, and the minister at the table interjected, that it had a sunset clause, but why did not the government look at it and keep it going?

         As I mentioned earlier, fuel tax has a great effect on road transport, including long distance road transport, as well as rail. In its last budget, the Keating government put into action rises in fuel taxes which were to increase every six months. In August 1993 there was a rise of 3c per litre, which added $3,600 per rig per year. In February 1994, the price rose by a further 1c per litre, which added a further $1,200 per rig per year. In August 1994 there will be a further increase of 1c per litre, making $1,200 per rig per year. That total increase of 5c per litre will raise costs by $6,000 per rig per year. That is why people in the rural and remote areas suffer from this government's increases. The government has not done enough for rail or for the CSIRO in these appropriation bills.

This measure is going to amount to $2.8 billion by the year 1997-98, so we are dealing with a very significant appropriation in relation to this new area.

         The parenting allowance is, in principle, welcomed by us, but there are some factors which need to be pointed out before the government gets the opportunity to make unwarranted political mileage out of this particular measure. The most important thing to draw to people's attention is the fact that this measure does not apply until 1 July 1995. We must ask the question: why? It was announced with enormous gusto and bravado, it was an historic new payment which was going to change the world, but people will not get it until 14 months after its announcement. It does not take an undue degree of cynicism to think that the timing is very convenient for the government in relation to what is expected to be a mid- to late 1995 federal election.

         Morgan Gallup poll of attitudes to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) among females, I am not surprised at the timing. He is probably the most unpopular Prime Minister among female voters that we have ever had; some 60 per cent disapprove of him. So the government has a major problem among women with its Prime Minister, many of whom would probably like him removed before the next election. So this is a measure which will satisfy the electoral timetable as well.

         The parenting allowance, to the extent that it is paid over and above the home child-care allowance, only applies to the poorest five per cent of Australian families with children. It is only going to go, on the government's best estimates, to 120,000 families with children out of a total of two million families with children. We need to remind ourselves of these great limitations on this payment before we all get carried away with it. It will apply in full up to a family income of $230 a week and cut out when the family income reaches $378 a week, which is well below average weekly earnings. So we are talking about a benefit which applies to the very poorest members of our community. While we welcome it, we have to remember that it is very limited in its scope and it is not something for which the government can be allowed to claim enormous electoral credit.

         The other thing to remember when talking about this measure is that it is in part a switch of the unemployment benefit to the parenting allowance. Again, without being too cynical about it, the fact is the government is doing its utmost to switch as many people as possible from unemployment benefits to other forms of benefits so that they do not show up on the unemployment figures—`If you don't like the figures, change the way they are measured and you achieve your end.' There is a lot of fiddling going on with this particular benefit.

         Most mothers who are sacrificing an income to care for their children at home are simply not going to get any additional benefit at all out of this parenting allowance. Their situation is not changed by this benefit. Most women who are at home caring for their children and who have sacrificed income to do so, will be left with what they have always had, and that is the dependent spouse rebate. The government has now changed its name, called it a home child-care allowance, and thrown in the equivalent of one hamburger per week to round it off to $30 a week. That is all most mothers will be left with, which is what they have always had.

         As far as most women at home caring for children are concerned, this new dependent spouse rebate, renamed the home child-care allowance, is really nothing more than a bone thrown to those mothers as a consequence of the introduction of the child-care rebate. This raised with the government the enormous problem it had of equity in relation to mothers who were not in the paid work force but who were caring for their children at home. The white paper and the budget do absolutely nothing to end this government's discrimination against those mothers who are sacrificing an income to care for their children at home. The tragedy of this budget, the government's plans, the white paper and everything else, is that it is a huge, lost opportunity to address this very significant problem. There is a big problem of inequitable treatment of mothers in relation to whether they are at home or whether they are in the paid work force.

         I noted recently that the responsible—or irresponsible—Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, seemed to have changed her language in relation to this matter. All of a sudden she has very noticeably started talking in terms that we have used for some time. She is now talking about fairness, equity and choice in relation to payments made by the government to families with young children. While we welcome her change of language, unfortunately it is not reflected in substance, and there is no change whatsoever in policy, and no indication that there is going to be any change in policy or recognition of the inequitable treatment of mothers at home caring for their children. Government policy is still very much biased against the choice of home care.

While we welcome Senator Crowley's change of rhetoric, we wish she would follow through in substance, change the policy, and get it right. The tragedy is that, under Labor, it is no longer politically correct to choose home care. Don Edgar, the well-known former director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies for many years, and one who would know, made the point publicly that policy in Canberra is driven by an outmoded feminist dogma which treats mothers who choose home care as poor, misguided fools.

         That was confirmed in a report that I saw yesterday from AAP. It was about a study, completed by a couple of Queensland professors and commissioned by the federal and state governments, of the contribution to the economy of mothers who sacrifice an income to remain at home. The report makes the point that their role `is largely unrecognised by the income support and taxation systems'. This report—as I said, commissioned by the federal and state governments—recommends that the federal government's new home child care rebate be renamed the home and dependent care rebate and be extended to anyone who is staying at home and caring for a person who needs ongoing care.

         There is great controversy about the government's particular policy approach in this area, a lot of disagreement with the direction and a lot of recognition of the inequity of the scheme. The government has to face the fact that mothers at home caring for their children will not continue to be treated as second-class sisters. They have every right to demand equal treatment from this government. If this government takes money from people in the form of taxes, it has a responsibility to distribute it to citizens equitably and fairly and not use it to pursue particular political dogma, as it has been doing in this area.

         The child-care rebate, which was introduced with such fanfare but, of course, roundly criticised by former Labor Minister for Finance, Peter Walsh, is often justified by the government as some kind of legitimate tax deduction for working women—a tax rebate for the cost of caring for their children.

The logic of the argument in relation to child care must, by definition, apply right across the board. But we see no attempt on the part of the government to do that, which suggests that there is a political motive in mind.

         That problem is not solved by changing the name of the dependent spouse rebate to a home child-care allowance, nor is it solved by introducing a parenting allowance. As I have said, the parenting allowance is welcome in principle, but the problem is—I pointed this out in a question to Senator Crowley recently—that we now have the most unbelievable smorgasbord of benefits which ordinary Australians have no hope of understanding. With the introduction of a parenting allowance we have that benefit on top of the child-care rebate, child-care assistance, home child-care allowance, basic family payment, additional family payment, and we look like having a maternity allowance added to all of them. It is the most unbelievable, complex system of benefits—a system, we believe, that the bureaucrats have deliberately designed as a make work scheme for them because it will take an army to work out who gets what and how. I pity the recipients, the supposed beneficiaries, of these schemes as they try to wade their way through it.

I make the point that the announced maternity allowance is just adding to the complexity of all of these schemes. I earnestly hope that if the government brings in a maternity allowance it treats all mothers equally.

         In highlighting the incredible range of benefits washing around in the system, the point I want to make is that, as Peter McDonald of the Institute of Family Studies said today, the situation can be addressed only by the government facing up to the need for a single, simple, universal benefit. If we as a society honestly believe that mothers with young children need assistance, based on society's obligation to young children to have them brought up in a civilised and caring way, the only way to do that is to have a simple, universal benefit which everybody can understand and, most importantly, is fair. This will give mothers the choice they deserve as to whether they care for their children at home or whether they put their children into some form of child care, be it with grandparents, professional carers or whatever. That is a choice for mothers to make, not this government pursuing its political dogma.

         While I welcome the fact that Senator Crowley is getting the rhetoric of choice right, I wish she would face up to this issue and look seriously at amalgamating this incredible range of complex benefits into a scheme that ordinary Australians will understand. I have advocated a universal benefit which should be based on certain criteria. It should be child based—that is, based on the number of children. It must be simple if Australians are to be able to work their way through it and get the maximum benefit out of it and if people are not to miss out. There must be equitable treatment of people and it must be universal. Without universality, people will miss out, it will be inequitable and there will be enormous wastage in bureaucrats administering the schemes.

         I have put forward one way of doing that—a child tax credit or benefit which would be a flat amount paid to the primary carer, in most cases the mother, on the basis of the number of children and paid as either a tax credit or a benefit. As I have said before, if we look at the 1995-96 expenditure on assistance to families with children, we are talking about nearly $13,000 million in this area alone—that is ignoring unemployment benefits and all sorts of other benefits which some families receive.

I am sure Labor members' offices are receiving plenty of complaints from constituents who have no idea what they are entitled to or how they get it, and, of course, the government is now having to spend millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars to try to explain all these benefits to ordinary Australians.

         Obviously it would be critical to ensure that in introducing such a scheme no-one was actually worse off. The poorest members of the community can be assisted through various other schemes. For example, unemployment benefits, rent assistance, and other things that are currently paid over and above the government's appropriation for assistance to families with children, can still be available based on poverty. We are talking about a scheme based on having young children, and the community has an obligation to assist carers of children to bring up their children.

I want to take the opportunity to comment on the government's budget and its running of the economy. This latest budget is a budget of missed opportunity. Who is likely to miss out? The people who are likely to miss out are the underclass in Australia. What do I mean by the underclass? Essentially, they are the about one million—or a little less now—unemployed and almost one million underemployed. So it is a very large proportion of the Australian community which is the underclass—and has been for the last two or three years.

         The government attempted to address the problems of that underclass with its green and white papers on unemployment. But the programs that have come out of that white paper do very little for real jobs. What those programs are all about is trying to make unemployment palatable for the rest of the community. They are really bandaids, trying to cover over the real problems. They have done very little to encourage long-term sustained growth in the economy.

         Even the government acknowledges that it is really only through strong economic growth that we will get sustained growth in jobs in Australia. The government does not even believe its own rhetoric that it has put out in the green and white papers. I will illustrate. In the green paper, which is the first paper it put out, it stressed the idea of economic growth encouraging growth in employment and, hence, reductions in unemployment. It canvassed two options for economic growth. The first option was at a growth rate between now and the rest of this decade of 3 1/2 per cent per annum. That would lead to a seven per cent rate of unemployment by the year 2000. That was the low growth option. The high growth option was at 4 3/4per cent per annum. If that was sustained right through to the year 2000, we would end up with an unemployment rate of about five per cent.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I might add that since this government has been in power, there have been only two years where there have been high growth rates of over five per cent; in 1983 with 5.3 per cent and in 1984 with 5.6 per cent. In spite of what the government said in the green paper and in spite of its rhetoric of adopting an objective of trying to achieve a five per cent target by the year 2000, what do we find in the budget papers? When we look at the budget papers, we find that the growth rate the government is assuming in this budget is 4 1/2 per cent for this coming financial year, 1994-95; 4 1/4 per cent for the following year; then four per cent for the next two years beyond that.

         So already, in the space of just a few months, the government has shot itself in the foot with regard to unemployment and the underclass, basically by saying in its budget papers, `We do not believe the growth projections we optimistically put before the community a little earlier.' It would appear that there is very little chance of achieving its target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. Why has the government gone along this route? We have had the evidence from the Secretary to the Treasury that the high unemployment rate was basically a matter of choice. There is no doubt that this government took that low growth-high unemployment path as a matter of deliberate political choice.

       <para>
        leading to long-term sustained jobs. Let us start with the budget deficits. The facts are that this government, by the end of this financial year—in other words, in a few weeks time—will have accumulated deficits at Commonwealth level of $38 billion since 1991-92. The projections in the budget papers indicate that by the end of the year 1996-97, that budget deficit will have grown to $64 billion. I remind the Senate and the community that, to put that into context, the GDP of Australia is somewhat over $400 billion. So we are talking about a very large slice of a year's activity that has been accumulated as debt by the federal government.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It would not be so bad if these deficits were spent on capital goods. Everyone who has run a household knows that we cannot go on spending more than we earn. But it is still sensible for a household to borrow to invest in capital goods, for instance to buy a house. As long as the interest and repayments are within the cash flow, people can cope with that. But here we have a government which has borrowed nearly $40 billion to date, and intends to borrow up to $64 billion over the next few years in accumulation over this period from 1991-92 through to 1996-97. Most of it will be spent on consumption; only a very small proportion is intended to be invested by the government.

         Let us contrast that with what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in the One Nation statement a little over two years ago, in February 1992, when he bragged that the government would have its budget in surplus by 1994-95. How come there has been a change of objectives from that surplus? I remind honourable senators that that was said at the time the FitzGerald report, commissioned by the government, made a plea for additional savings in Australia, to stop us borrowing more from overseas, and to save more.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The biggest culprit against savings was the spending—in other words, the deficits—by the federal government. All employer groups, most economic commentators and the coalition this year have been pushing the government to adopt a much faster rate of budget deficit reduction than it has done this year. The coalition suggested to the government that it ought to aim for a budget deficit of below $10 billion. Others were suggesting that it ought to be substantially less than that, given that there was a growth dividend coming out of the economy. The economy has been growing faster than was anticipated.

         More importantly, it was suggested that we aim for surplus within a couple of years. But the government decided to spend up and to marginally reduce the deficit. In fact, the reduction in deficit is sort of hidden by asset sales. So again we are spending what was invested. In household terms, we are spending part of the house rather than reducing our expenditure. The net result of this will be a big impact on interest rates. Those interest rates will affect all Australians. Already the bond rate has gone up substantially—over two per cent. International bond rates have gone up, particularly as the American authorities took action to try to kill off any expectation of inflation.

         In Australia the commentators are accusing the government of deliberately holding down short-term rates against the judgment of the market. Last week and this week we have had Syntec, Westpac and National Mutual making predictions that interest rates will go up between three and five per cent over the next year or so, which will impact on everybody.

         So we have a government which has taken a deliberate route which will again encourage boom and bust. While the economy is running on quite smoothly now, the government has deliberately avoided the hard decisions of cutting expenditure and cutting the deficit, and hence taken the very substantial risk that we will head into boom-bust cycles once again. Who will miss out on this? Again, the underclass, because with each boom-bust cycle we ratchet up the base level of unemployment. The obvious message is that the government should have cut its expenditure and should have had a lower deficit. To illustrate what could have been done, it is important for the community to understand that real government expenditure by the federal government has increased by over 16 per cent—after allowing for inflation—over the last four years, including this current year, and is predicted to increase further by at least 3.1 per cent next financial year, even taking into account the sale of assets.

       <para first-indent="16">

         So we have had a real increase in expenditure by the federal government of over 20 per cent over a five-year period when the rest of Australians, be they state governments, government businesses or, more importantly, the 70 per cent of the community working in the private sector, have had to tighten their belts. What have we had here? We have had increased expenditure. So there is room for manoeuvring. Again, I stress that the message is that the deficit should have been lower, hence there would have been less risk of higher interest rates and less risk of a boom-bust cycle with the inevitable consequence for the underclass—the unemployed and the underemployed in Australia.

         I move on to the second major topic with regard to the management of the economy, and that is capital efficiency and investment in Australia. I have said in this chamber many times that the investment in Australia of recent times is at its lowest level since World War II. Part of that investment, which is plant and equipment, has been running at around six per cent of GDP for nearly three years now. I stress that that is the lowest level since World War II.

         We are all concerned as to why investment has not taken off here in Australia. Even with the economy growing quite well, how come there is no investment? One major reason why investment is not taking off yet has been put forward by Professor Helen Hughes. It is a very important point. Her  point is that capital in Australia is being used only about 25 per cent of the time. In other words, on average, a lot of the equipment—the factories, the offices, the computers, the trucks, the rail cars, the ships—is being used only about 25 per cent of the time. Only a minority of businesses and activities in this country work full time—that is, 24 hours a day, seven days a week—largely characterised by the mining industry and some manufacturing industry, including the paper industry from which I came. As a general rule, there is very little double time and triple time working right around the clock in Australia.

         Why is this the case? The largest problem is penalty rates. Penalty rates in awards stop businesses from using existing capital efficiently. In the past, the tariff protection made it worthwhile still investing. But now with international competition, as we have wound down protection and continue to wind down protection, which is the right thing to do, people can invest anywhere. Hence, investors are looking to invest not here in Australia where it is difficult to make a dollar because of this problem, but offshore.

         We must free up the labour market. It is the critical decision that needs to be made. That can happen. In current circumstances large firms with sophisticated management understand the need to go through the complications of enterprise bargaining, as put up by the Brereton act. It is the small firms which characterise most of Australia that are in difficulty and do not want to go into those complications. They are the ones who are being penalised. They are the ones who foresee these penalty rates as stopping them expanding their businesses. That great amount of underutilised capital is a principal reason why we have not seen a boom in new investment, which we should have expected if this lift out of the recession had been typical of other recessions.

In doing so, I am conscious of my colleague Senator Gibson's statements about this being a budget of missed opportunities. I think many people in Australia, particularly those in rural Australia that I know, would also say that it is a budget that offers them very little hope—very little more hope than they had in the past, anyway.

         It seems to be saying that if people are temporarily poor through circumstances beyond their control, or if they are struggling, the option is to sell up and get out and move to the city or to some other major centre where they will probably have to be looked after by the government anyway. It seems pretty obvious to me that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and this government do not seem to care about those Australians, particularly in rural areas, who are struggling to battle their way out of a very tough recession and very tough economic circumstances which have hit them hard. The evidence is fairly crystal clear because Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, in his introduction to Working Nation said:

        I could not agree more with the Prime Minister. I find it very sad that the talents and energies of so many Australians, who in many cases are deprived of resources, are wasted.

         The regions are certainly declining. Judging by the measures in this budget and previous budgets, the explanation is obvious: many farmers are leaving the land.

They feel, in many cases, that this federal government has turned its back on them.

         Let us have a look in detail at the encouragement the government has given people to stay in those areas that are in a state of decline at present. This budget has seen drastic cuts to government spending on urban and regional development programs. Spending has been slashed from $332 million to $95 million, and next year it will be cut back to $71.5 million. But, no, the government did not stop there—that was not enough. It went on to cut back funding to the states, which in many ways probably play the most significant role in regional development. Such a flagrant disregard for people in rural areas is appalling.

         Because of the isolation of many rural communities, taxes such as the fuel excise—we have been through this debate before—fall disproportionately on people who live long distances from major metropolitan areas. This government will raise the fuel tax on unleaded and diesel fuel by 1c per litre this August. This represents an overall increase of 5c per litre since last year. The cost to people living outside metropolitan areas is absolutely staggering, particularly through added freight costs.

         What are the rural and regional communities getting out of these fuel tax hikes? Unfortunately, the answer is: not very much. In fact, in relation to those communities, the government has abolished funding for state arterial roads. This follows the termination of funding for local roads in 1991-92. Certainly I and the constituents whom I know best in country South Australia find this quite disgraceful. There are roads in country areas that are in urgent need of repair and, in some cases, poor road maintenance is not only costing delays in transport but is also costing lives.

It has also been estimated that, for every $500,000 spent on black spot funding, a life was saved. People do not have to be students of economics to realise that the termination of the black spot program in taxpayer terms is actually costing money. It is not saving money; it is costing money. On top of that, the black spot program was also an important tool in job creation because each program put at least 25 people in jobs on the road and provided another estimated 36 jobs in the related manufacturing and transport industries.

Many families, including parents and young children at times, have to work longer hours on the farm and cannot afford to employ outside help.

It has chosen instead to spend millions of dollars to provide trainee positions for what may or may not ever evolve into real jobs. It is too bad about keeping those in jobs that already have them but much of the spending on traineeships may never mean jobs.

         —I rise to speak on the appropriations debate, with real concern as to what this Labor government is doing to my state of Tasmania and my country Australia, and indeed what it has been doing since 1983.

         The 1994-95 budget tax implications have caused me a great deal of concern. I am concerned because this labor government has not been able to keep promises pledged to the Australian electorate. Even those taxation promises which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said were legislated—in other words, L-A-W, law—have now been broken. How does this Labor government explain the estimated tax revenue increase of $9.154 billion from 1993-94 to this financial year? That is the increase in just a year. How does this Labor government explain the 1994-95 tax revenue of $103.3 billion? The last budget delivered by the Fraser government on 17 August 1982 provided for that year estimated tax revenue of $41.8 billion. The estimated tax revenue for 1994-95 is $103.3 billion. This represents almost 2 1/2 times as much. The saying is true—`Labor equals high taxes', thus reducing individual choice. How does the Labor government explain the real tax revenue increase of 7.4 per cent between 1993-94 and 1994-95?

         Paul Keating told our fellow Australians that the tax decreases were already law: l-a-w. The deceit and dishonesty of this government appears to know no bounds. Labor taxes ordinary Australians and businesses to the hilt to cover up its mismanagement and incompetent handling of the Australian economy.

         Despite the increase in taxation under this government, we have not seen the gap between rich and poor diminish. Indeed, the gap between rich and poor is widening. The unemployment problem facing this country has not been addressed. Unemployment queues did not decrease with the One Nation package and I seriously doubt whether the current white paper will make a dent in these queues. Sure, we will see a fluctuation from time to time, but to hear Senator Schacht tell us during question time today that an unemployment rate of 9 per cent plus is good news is appalling. It is like saying to the Australian people, `You ought to be thankful that it is not 10 or 20 per cent; that 10 or 20 per cent of you aren't unemployed.' The so-called reduction, in fact, is only a reduction from the Labor-created, all-time high.

         I now seek to deal with the role of states and territories vis-a-vis the Commonwealth and service delivery. Traditionally, the states and territories have played a major role in the provision of public services in Australia. In fact, the states own purpose outlays represent about 45 per cent of total public sector outlays. The present allocation of tax powers in the Australian Federation means that the states and territories cannot efficiently and equitably fund these expenditures from their own revenues. State expenditure responsibilities substantially exceed their revenues. The reverse applies for the Commonwealth government.

         The trend over recent years not to reduce the impact of the so-called vertical fiscal imbalance by increasing state funding through general purpose grants has worsened the impact on the states. For people like me who cannot grasp the economic jargon `vertical fiscal imbalance', it means the people who raise most of the money do not spend it, namely, the federal government, and the people who do most of the spending do not raise it, namely, the state and territory governments. State government outlays are concentrated in areas of direct and real service provision, such as education, hospitals, police, and public transport. Commonwealth outlays are dominated by transfer payments such as pensions.

         The different role of Commonwealth and state outlays has important implications for financial relations between the Commonwealth and the states and, therefore, our Federation. While it can be argued that productivity savings are possible in state outlays, the same can also be said for Commonwealth outlays. We must also recognise that demand for state services rises with inflation, population growth and community expectations associated with any rise in living standards. The Commonwealth tax base reflects the changes in economic activity, including inflation and changes in population. State tax bases are less responsive to these trends and are more responsive to asset price fluctuations.

         As a senator with the honour of representing Tasmania, I am fully aware of the impact that Commonwealth-state financial relations have had on my state. Some of the concerns which need to be raised include: the extent of cutbacks in Commonwealth payments; the continual changes to funding arrangements since the termination of the revenue sharing arrangement in 1984-85—naturally, this extends to the on-going uncertainty regarding Commonwealth funding to the states from 1994-95 onwards; and the increasing intrusiveness of the Commonwealth government through the use of tied grants in expenditure areas which should be undertaken at the state level.

         When the Commonwealth government took over responsibility for income tax powers during World War II, the Commonwealth agreed to provide general purpose grants to the states as compensation.

         Since that time, these grants have been calculated on a number of bases ranging from ad hoc percentage increases to a fixed proportion of a subset of Commonwealth revenues. From 1984-85, under this Labor government Commonwealth payments to the states have generally been determined on an even more ad hoc basis. The exception has been that the Commonwealth guaranteed to maintain the total level of financial assistance grants in real terms over the period 1991-92 and 1993-94.

         The current level of financial assistance grants to the six states as a proportion tax revenues has substantially declined over the past 20 years. Financial assistance grants are moneys paid in general revenue and can be spent at the discretion of the state or territory government concerned. For example, 1976-77 to 1984-85 financial assistance grants as a percentage of Commonwealth tax revenue stood at 18.9 per cent based on revenue sharing arrangements. Comparable figures adjusted on a compatible basis with the earlier period show that for 1993-94 this has fallen to 14.6 per cent—a substantial decrease and part of Labor's campaign of destroying our federal system and bleeding the states white.

         While the level of financial assistance grants has fallen significantly, the reverse is true for the level of tied grants. Tied grants are federal moneys given to the states and territories to be used only for specific programs. They are generally known as specific purpose payments. Tied grants go to programs such as housing initiatives under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and disability programs under the Commonwealth-state disability agreement.

         Compared with the period 1976-77 to 1984-85, the proportion of funds in the form of tied grants has increased significantly from 32.4 per cent to 43 per cent in 1993-94. In dollar terms, the increase in specific purpose payments between 1976-77 and 1984-85 was in the order of $235 million. Over the period from 1976-77 to 1993-94, tied grants initially decreased as a share of total Commonwealth tax outlays. However, from 1982-83 they have increased rapidly under Labor. When the Fraser government came to power in 1976 we saw a decrease in the number of tied grants. The Liberal government upheld the spirit of cooperative federalism between the Commonwealth and state governments. From 1983, when Labor came to office, the situation reverted and has got progressively worse. It says a lot about the spending priorities of this Labor government. Instead of concentrating on federal funding issues, the Labor government spends its time and energy pulling state and territory government purse strings. So much for the so-called `no charge of interference with normal state functions' which Ben Chifley, the Labor Prime Minister, advocated in 1942. So much for Paul Keating and the Australian Labor Party seeking to eulogise Ben Chifley. It is just further proof that Labor's rhetoric is not matched by its actions.

         At the end of the day, these budget figures, as figures, are not very exciting but their implication for our unique federal system of government is horrific. Funding for specific grants, as opposed to general purpose grants, does not mean very much to the average Australian by way of terminology. However, what is relevant is the impact this type of funding has had on the states and territories.

         States like Tasmania have suffered under the impact of the growth in tied grants. Tied grants give the federal government leverage to get the priorities on service delivery that it wants implemented in the states, irrespective of the priorities set by the democratically elected state government. In typical Labor centralist style it believes that, out of its glass house in recession-proof Canberra, it is able to determine Tasmania's needs and accordingly dictate Tasmania's priorities.

         The employment programs that will assist families, such as programs including the job compact which is the centrepiece of the government's re-employment strategy, will be of great assistance to Australian families where one or more of the parents are looking for work. There is nothing more devastating for an individual or the family of which they are a member than suffering from long-term unemployment. Unfortunately, in Australia there are some families in which neither parent is employed. Parents in these families risk being robbed of self-esteem, the opportunity to utilise their skills and the ability to support their children.

For under 18-year-olds who are not eligible for the job compact the government has set in place a youth training initiative, or YTI. The YTI will serve to make sure that young unemployed people will be actively assisted in finding worthwhile employment or education opportunities while being paid a youth training allowance. They will receive intensive case management assistance to help them in their place in the work force or with educational training, taking advantage of the Working Nation labour market initiatives in job placement and training. Programs such as this will be of particular benefit to women and sole parents. It is interesting to note that, after three years, 80 per cent of people who have been in receipt of the sole parent benefit have returned to work, and this indicates the success of the sole parent and other government initiatives to return them to the work force.

         The second initiative in the budget is increased access to child care. ILO convention No. 156 aims to ensure that workers with family responsibilities can work without discrimination and without undue conflict between their employment and their family responsibilities and obligations.

The government is committed to taking this step; a commitment which is shown by its funding of so many new child-care places. The government has promised to meet the demand for work based child care by the 2000-2001 financial year with 25,000 new places being created in this financial year.

This allowance will come into effect from 1 July next year, and it is perhaps this budget's most important initiative for the family.

         The government will provide $1.2 billion over the next four years to make the allowance available to an estimated 118,000 families across all states and territories. The allowance will be available to partners of the unemployed and low income earners whose main activity is caring for dependent children under the age of 16 years. It is estimated that this will be worth an additional $59 a week to the average family, and up to $133 to low income working parents. The allowance will be paid directly to the carer and will permit greater flexibility in the working arrangements of parents, especially those with very young children.

         Senator Minchin made a few comments earlier about the home care allowance, claiming that it was merely a new name for the dependent spouse rebate. I note in particular that it is not an initiative of this budget but oflast year's budget. I felt drawn to make some response in relation to Senator Minchin's comments. Senator Minchin does not seem to understand the real difference between the government's programs—that is the difference between the home care allowance and what used to be the dependent spouse rebate.

         Firstly, the home care allowance is paid directly to the carer—usually the mother—rather than to the household through the tax system. This ensures that the carer and the cared for benefit directly from the payment and it is not syphoned through the person who is employed in the family—normally the husband or the male spouse. Secondly, tax rebates are by definition regressive. Those who earn more attain a greater benefit from the tax rebate than those who do not earn sufficient to even pay tax and therefore are returned nothing from a tax rebate.

         The government, within its budget, has also looked at education for families within the schools. An education program for children and their parents has been instituted. The government has introduced a new schools curriculum unit entitled Family Studies. This unit is designed to investigate the historical development of family patterns, the gender distribution in family roles, and the various issues and problems associated with family life. It has also been resolved that in cooperation with state and territory governments a further $12 million will be allocated to fund the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect.

         This is the goal that should have the support of all Australians, and it will certainly fill a major gap in the present protection of children within states where there is a dire need for funding. The government also relies on continuing past initiatives. Those that have been set in place in earlier years are just now coming into effect. One of them is the new Commonwealth child-care cash rebate, which will cut the cost of child care for many Australian families.

His criticism amounted to a carping that the family support that the government has provided is too complex and that it would be simpler to make one all-up payment based on the number of children in the family. He is right: it would certainly be simpler, but it would not be fair and equitable. Unfortunately, this is a complex world and families' needs are complex.

         —This year's budget is notable for its maintenance of the government's continued commitment to its deficit reduction strategy, despite community concerns about the need to fund meaningful programs to address the problems of the unemployed. The government has patently failed to address the very real and growing social and environmental debt that this nation is accruing. The government continues to misrepresent its primary goals and the assured passage of its program has been achieved by avoiding the need for parliamentary scrutiny of many of its initiatives. The Greens (WA) recently highlighted underspending and ongoing program cuts in a number of areas, such as urban and regional development, rural programs, land and water care, foreign aid, conservation, environmental protection, and so on.

         What is not addressed is the impact on Australian society of this unendorsed and covert program. We have seen a fair bit of evidence in the last weeks of the growing inequality of Australian society. The erosion of government services to communities and the erosion of any programs that might be able to effectively deal with the structures which could control or prevent such growing inequality is one of our major concerns. The conditions in Australia's workplaces and the government's push to ensure that there is no effective social or environmental regulation of trade is crucial to the future of this nation as we enter the next millennium.

         Unfortunately, however, the so-called deregulation under the Multilateral Trade Organisation—formerly GATT—actually amounts to an emasculation of the ability of any nation to regulate trade, because any attempt by any nation to regulate its industry, labour conditions or environmental impacts will inevitably result in an additional cost and therefore impact on the competitiveness of the industry on the international market. Where any other nation fails to regulate on issues such as this, it will find itself in a more competitive position, even if these benefits are only short term.

         The Greens (WA) believe that putting all our economic eggs in the basket of international competitiveness is naive in the extreme. It is necessary to take a regional and community-based approach to economic policy which values rather than wastes our valuable human and natural resources. Having embraced the path of financial, trade and labour market deregulation, the very least the government must do now is regain some ability to make its own decisions to protect the environment and basic human rights. There needs to be international recognition that discrimination in trade is legitimate where there is clear evidence of the exploitation of people or environmental degradation involved in the process of production. This is basically a signal to corporations that, in spite of the international scope of their operations, they still have some responsibility to the rest of society and to the planet.

         Yesterday, I asked Senator McMullan what the Australian government would do to ensure that deregulation does not result in forcing us to accept exploitation and environmental degradation as a normal part of trade. He answered that the Australian government supports the International Labor Organisation, so we do not need to do anything to make sure that the Multilateral Trade Organisation addresses these questions. He conveniently ignores the fact that the MTO does not ignore the question—it opposes any attempt to prevent human exploitation. It does so by threatening any nation that discriminates against products of exploitation with trade sanctions. It has gone beyond GATT, which could only threaten sectoral sanctions, and now can impose cross-sectoral sanctions. That means that a `trade barrier', such as the Australian regulation relating to minimum Australian content on TV, which used to be subject to other sanctions in only the communication-entertainment area, can now have sanctions imposed by the MTO against our wheat, or iron, or anything and everything else we export.

         Senator McMullan also stated that the ILO was the proper organisation to address issues such as forced labour. Yet, on 7 June the ILO called for regulation of trade. The ILO clearly called for integration of social issues, specifically issues of child labour and forced labour into the MTO. A Reuters article quoted Michel Hansenne, the ILO Director-General as saying:

        One cannot get a lot clearer than that.

         This government has prided itself on its own work reforms. It has taken recent OECD comments as a strong endorsement of approval. In fact, the OECD suggested New Zealand as a more proper model and that Australian reforms had not gone far enough. It suggested that employment protection, minimum wages, long-term benefits, and social support are all bad practices that should be wound back. It was reported in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         This is not an issue separate from trade. The push for lower wages, reduced social support and reduced conditions from within the OECD is directly related to its member states' ability to compete internationally with production in nations whose competitive advantage consists largely of the ability of international corporations to exploit people and nature freely without the need to contribute anything to that nation, save the offer of jobs and the promise that starvation is the alternative. It is not an accident that the OECD was congratulating New Zealand at virtually the same time as the ILO was condemning it. Comments from both were in relation to exactly the same policies. The OECD obviously thinks that practices to break union power and to limit the ability of workers to bargain effectively is a good idea because it reduces labour costs. The ILO, on the other hand, condemns these practices for exactly the same reason.

It is exactly the same contradiction that leads Senator McMullan to state support for the ILO at the same time as he states that social justice issues should be excluded from the international trade debate. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot support social justice while pursuing policies that will see social justice decline. There is a word for crying about the growing gap between rich and poor while setting up structures to increase it, and that word is hypocrisy.

The need for international competitiveness with Vietnam is the reason the Thai government gives for not raising its basic wage.

I wonder where our own diplomats and ministers stand on Mr Kidd's comments, given the support Senator McMullan gave to the ILO yesterday.

         Ultimately, using sanctions to prevent national regulation of trade, and opposing international regulation of the social and environmental aspects of trade, simply means we will see more workers everywhere working for less. We will see more child labour, more bonded labour, more exploitative migrant labour, more sweatshops, more industrial accidents, more appalling conditions, more women going blind working in electronics factories, and more workers living in shanties amidst industrial effluent. We will see more pressure everywhere for nations to lower their wages and conditions to compete and the more competitive they get, the lower the standards will become. This will affect low and middle income earners everywhere. The rich everywhere will be the beneficiaries. This is the agenda of deregulation. This is why we see a growing gulf between rich and poor in Australia and most OECD nations.

         There is one reason why the labour market programs recently proposed by the government will largely be ineffective at improving the lot of workers. They are a means of creating a well-trained pool of job hungry unemployed rather than ways of generating employment by restructuring the economy. This will not improve the bargaining position of those already employed. The refusal of government to address the issue of exploitation of labour internationally will ensure that any weakness in the bargaining position of working people will be exploited. The OECD simply adds fuel to the fire with suggesting that wage levels and awards be dropped.

         The government gambles on overly optimistic and heroic estimates of growth. For example, it predicts that business investment will grow by 14.5 per cent next year. The government's estimates of investment are almost double those of the private sector economists such as Access Economics. The government, however, fails to see the obvious. Business needs incentives to invest in the form of taxation incentives. The government is not actually applying its asset sale proceeds towards debt reduction.

Small businesses unfortunately are slugged with the requirement to prepay at least 25 per cent of income tax in the coming year.

This is long overdue but will in no way even touch upon the more pressing issues—the fundamental structural problems of the fringe benefits tax itself. Instead of going straight to the core of the problem, this government continues to address important but peripheral issues.

         Business has already rejected the review as far too narrow. The relief on budget night created by the announcement of the review was very short-lived. Subsequent statements that there will be no reduction in FBT collections accompanied by the compliance review strangle the prospect of any meaningful change or relief. It is completely illogical to announce a review of the FBT compliance costs but, in the same breath, to extend FBT to cover employee share plans.

         I do not really think the government fully appreciates the impact on revenue arising from the new share plans and its substitution with the new ones and the demise and extinction of the old. Unfortunately, these new plans will affect only a very small proportion of the economy. The government is yet to appreciate the full ramifications of this change in terms of its FBT strategy in relation to share plan schemes. I believe that business could well be wasting its time consulting with the government unless there is meaningful review of the compliance measures. Inevitably, that must mean that there would be some reduction in revenue because the government is after the last cent in every dollar.

         The government has been so quick to discover that the FBT is a great cash cow, seemingly with an insatiable appetite. On the other hand, business sees it as an opportunistic grab for cash or a pseudo company tax. It is a massive burden for companies which are suffering under the deadly weight of many other imposts including sales tax, superannuation guarantee costs and capital gains costs.

         Fringe benefits tax in its current form is a nonsense and its scope has exceeded reasonable grounds. The government has lost sight of its original policy for FBT ensuring that all forms of remuneration are taxed on a consistent basis. The clearest illustration of this is the fact that the office Christmas party is now subject to FBT. I point out that this really defies logic. It is not remuneration; it is purely a celebration at the end of a long year of hard work. The government is acting like Scrooge in taking away the joy of Christmas in order to collect the very last cent of taxation revenue. The FBT measures are making the workplace a mundane and routine place. I predict that it will not be very long before even the humble office chair will be regarded as a fringe benefit for employers to conduct their work.

         As I mentioned earlier, there is no real expenditure constraint. The government will spend $2.5 billion in new expenditure over the next year but save only $700 million. This means that there is a three per cent real increase in government outlays. The provisional uplift factor remains at eight per cent. That implies that the non-salary income of provisional taxpayers will increase by eight per cent from the amount last year, and that applies to people with fixed incomes, such as self-funded retirees on fixed incomes. It also applies to incomes deriving from debentures and fixed interest securities.

         The budget deficit of $11.7 billion should be in the region of $18 billion on a pure accounting basis, because the government is selling the silver—selling its assets—to refinance current expenditure. This is a spendthrift way of dealing with these assets. If a business sold off assets to pay for its current expenditure, it would be criticised for bad management policies; but the government is resorting to this measure year after year. The recent problems with the Moomba pipeline should illustrate clearly to the government that it should not be so complacent about using asset sales to reduce the size of the budget deficit. At a bare minimum, the government should be directing part of its money towards infrastructure as an alternative to debt reduction.

In fact, the government has cut spending on regional development for 1994-95. In 1992-93, the relevant line item in the budget was $332 million. This year, the figure will come in at $95 million. After the so-called increase announced in the white paper, the line item for each of the next four years is projected at $71 million, $68 million, $62 million, and then $48 million for 1997-98.

         The main message of the Australian Democrats is that governments have a role to play—in regional development, in fostering small business, in supporting industry, in building our infrastructure and in generating a culture of innovation. The government should stop playing games with window dressing and half measures. It should stop using the economic recovery as a substitute for policies to address Australia's fundamental structural problems. In short, it should invest in our future.

         —The parliament is debating the appropriation bills and, as is normal on occasions such as this, there has been a long list of speakers. We have heard today from many on the other side of the chamber and from some on this side of the chamber about the appropriations the government proposes to make to the various parliamentary departments and other departments of the government.

         It has been a wide ranging debate. It has been typified as usual by a degree of criticism, by some positive suggestions, by the focus on particular interests that senators in this place have and by a degree of the flourish, rhetoric and argument that always attends this debate. In essence, it has been an opportunity for honourable senators to put their views about the budget and the state of the economy, and they have done so. While not yielding one whit to the criticism that has been levelled at the government, nonetheless I thank honourable senators for the way in which they have conducted themselves in this debate and for the way in which they have put their views forward.

         In closing the debate for the government, I am required to say that, while I do not intend to address each particularity of argument, we feel strongly that the 1994-95 budget put down by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the House of Representatives on 10 May is a good budget. This budget balances the need for continuing fiscal responsibility by the government with the need to reduce the deficit and meet the objectives of our medium-term deficit reduction program, the need to have regard to the social issue of unemployment and—as outlined in the white paper on jobs, industry and regional development—the need to commit ourselves to dealing with social equity by creating circumstances in which the unemployed can more easily find work and find the skills to fit them to the work that will increasingly become available.

         This budget has come down at a time when the Australian economy has emerged from recession and is in strong growth. In the quarterly accounts for March we have seen growth of the order of five per cent. The underlying trend figure is 4.3 per cent and, as the Treasurer has indicated, it is that figure on  which he would like to focus. He also wants to achieve improvements in other areas of the economy.

         There has been some criticism about the investment growth in the economy forecast in this budget being achievable—we forecast investment at 14 1/2 per cent. One of the main criticisms has been the reasonableness of that forecast and people have sought to discount it or express their views about it.

         The figures we saw in the quarterly accounts are for the 1993-94 year, when the forecast for business investment growth was at one per cent. It is not surprising to see that the results in the March accounts were on track for that level of investment. We believe the settings in the economy are right. The accounts show that there is a higher and increasing profit share for business and that the underlying rate of inflation remains low while growth remains high. The recent survey of the Business Council of Australia on investment expectations by their members buoys us, as do the comments of most of the key commentators that the investment figures we have put in this budget are realisable and achievable. The circumstances for that to flow are there and that will be demonstrated by the returns in further quarterly accounts.

         This budget has tried to balance the aims of managing the economy and meeting the major issues of social equity. Some commentators have criticised us for not applying more funds to the reduction of the deficit. We have applied a considerable amount of funds to dealing with unemployment and we certainly acknowledge that everyone will have a different opinion of how quickly we can move on the deficit, what is reasonable in the circumstances and what is the subjective value of a social equity program of the sort that we have undertaken.

         The government regards unemployment as the major problem in the economy and a problem demonstrably that no Western country has been able to solve as far as the long-term unemployed are concerned. Australia, in terms of the white paper initiative, is leading the charge in this area. I think that is the right balance in this budget. The prudent and responsible mid-term deficit reduction program is also appropriate. With those words, I commend the bills to the chamber.

        AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY GOVERNMENT SERVICE (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1994
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill contains the amendments that are required to Commonwealth legislation as a result of the arrangements being put in place by the Government of the Australian Capital Territory for a separate public service. The A.C.T. Government has announced its intention to have arrangements for the new Service in place by 1 July 1994. The Commonwealth Government has undertaken to have appropriate legislation in place to facilitate the commencement of the Service on that date.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The 1988 A.C.T. self-government legislation provided, on an interim basis, for the "core" A.C.T. public service to be constituted by a branch of the Australian Public Service called the A.C.T. Administration. The Head of the A.C.T. Administration has the powers of a Secretary of a Department under the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1992. These were intended to be transitional arrangements pending the establishment of a separate public service for the Territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1992 the Prime Minister initiated moves to establish a separate public service for the A.C.T. on the basis that it had always been the Commonwealth's intention that the A.C.T. should move, over time, to such an agreement. Funding for an Establishment Task Force was made available to the Territory by the Commonwealth to assist in progressing the matter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consultations between the A.C.T. and the Commonwealth and the ACTU have taken place in accordance with subsection 21(7) of the A.C.T. Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new A.C.T. public service will be established by A.C.T. legislation to be passed by the A.C.T. Assembly—currently there are two pieces of legislation before the A.C.T. Assembly which deal with the general structure of, and detail associated with, the proposed service. This bill completes the arrangements from the Commonwealth's point of view.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, I now turn more specifically to the provisions of the bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because of Canberra's unique position as the seat of two Australian Governments, the issue of continuing mobility between the two public services is of particular importance to the thousands of Commonwealth employees who have worked to implement self-government and who will be transferred to the new A.C.T. Government Service. The bill therefore provides for an arrangement where officers of the Territory Service are able to apply for and compete on merit for non-Senior Executive Service positions in the Australian Public Service which are advertised in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All Senior Executive Service positions are already open to applicants outside the Australian Public Service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These mobility arrangements will be reciprocated by the A.C.T. The arrangements will ensure that permanent staff movements between the Services will be through the merit processes of the gaining Service. Appointments from the losing Service to the gaining Service will be subject to the usual rights of appeal or review available in relation to promotions within the Australian Public Service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The mobility arrangements in the bill also provide for the recognition of periods of probation served in either Service. The package of measures will also provide for the recognition of prior service for the purpose of calculating most entitlements. In the case of superannuation, service will be recognised in accordance with the provisions of the relevant superannuation scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the bill also makes provision in relation to the rights of staff under the officers' mobility scheme provided for in Part IV of the Public Service Act 1992. This scheme currently provides for rights of re-entry to the Australian Public Service where staff have left the APS to take up employment in other areas of the Commonwealth. Where staff, before participating in the scheme, held an office which was associated with a function that is now the responsibility of the A.C.T. Government, the A.C.T. Government will make provision for re-entry or re-appointment to the A.C.T. Government Service. The bill extinguishes the rights of these people under Part IV of the Public Service Act 1992 to return to the Australian Public Service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A.C.T. Government employment will remain within the Federal industrial relations system as public sector employment under the Industrial Relations Act 1988.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the spirit of cooperation the Commonwealth will continue to make many of its services available to the A.C.T. Government. The A.C.T. Government will have access, on a user pays basis, to, for example: recruitment programs; training and development programs; arrangements for workers' compensation; the Merit Protection and Review Agency, Remuneration Tribunal and the Australian Government Health Service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will make provision in relation to the application of the Privacy Act 1988 in the A.C.T. public sector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will amend and modify the Privacy Act in two parts. First, it will make amendments to the Act so that the Information Privacy Principles will not have long term application to the A.C.T. public sector. In acknowledgment of the self-governing status of the A.C.T., the Government recognises that the privacy laws that are to apply in the Territory public sector are a matter for the Territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, the bill will extend, on an interim basis until an A.C.T. enactment provides otherwise, the application of the Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act to A.C.T. public sector agencies. This is being done at the request of the A.C.T. Government and will ensure that there is no erosion of existing rights A.C.T. residents enjoy under the Privacy Act. The Government expresses the hope that the A.C.T. will, when it provides that the interim measures are no longer to apply, consider the enactment of privacy legislation for the A.C.T. of at least an equivalent standard to that currently applying under the Commonwealth Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As further legislative amendments may be identified as the arrangements for the separate Service are put in place, a regulation making power has been included to enable the modification of an Act in its application to matters arising from, connected with or consequential on the establishment of the new Service. This regulation making power mirrors a provision in the earlier legislation providing for self-government for the Territory and a sunset period of 2 years has been provided for.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The regulation making power will be used to enable amendments that fall within the scope of the legislative scheme agreed by the Governments to be made expeditiously. The power will not be used to make any significant alteration to the agreed scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill is just one element in the arrangements that need to be put in place to facilitate the establishment of the new Service. Ongoing consultations between the Commonwealth, the A.C.T. Government and the unions will continue in relation to these remaining matters.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The establishment of a separate public service by the A.C.T. Government is an important milestone for the A.C.T. and is a logical step following on from he implementation of self-government in the Territory. The Commonwealth Government notes the A.C.T. Government's commitment to the establishment of a cohesive and professional public service for the Territory and looks forward to the continuation of the cooperative working arrangements between the two Governments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In concluding, I note that while the process of negotiation with both the A.C.T. Government and unions has secured substantial agreement on a wide range of issues related to the establishment of a separate ACT government service, some final matters are currently the subject of proceedings before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I am hopeful that these matters will be resolved shortly. On this basis I foreshadow that the Government may need to introduce amendments to take account of the outcomes of these processes.

        SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1994
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill amends the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 (the PCS Act);  the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1981 and the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1983.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The main purpose of the amendments is to allow the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and associated Acts and regulations, referred to as the SIS legislation, in relation to the vesting and preservation of members' benefits, and disclosure of information to members of the Scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The opportunity is also being taken to correct a number of inequities in aspects of the Scheme. Amendments are being made to the arrangements covering the reduction of former members' pensions when they hold offices of profit, invalidity retirements, service in State and Territory Parliaments as well as in the Commonwealth Parliament, and a minor amendment is being made to spouse benefits.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, honourable senators will recall that the SIS legislation provides for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds, particularly with regard to the security of members' monies, and for certain minimum standards. The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme is an unfunded scheme, that is, there is no separately invested fund and members' contributions of eleven and one-half percent of their salary are paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Consequently, many of the SIS provisions are not relevant to the Scheme. However, the Government has decided that all Commonwealth schemes that are completely unfunded will comply with the main operative provisions of the SIS legislation, that is, vesting, preservation and disclosure of information to fund members.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Turning to the vesting aspect first, the SIS legislation and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 taken together require that all employees receive a minimum level of employer sponsored superannuation support. While the pension benefits provided by the Scheme will meet this minimum requirement in all cases, the lump sum benefits provided where persons do not qualify for pensions may not, in some cases, meet that minimum requirement. Accordingly, the bill proposes `topping up' lump sums where necessary so that recipients receive at least the legislated superannuation guarantee minimum available to most other workers in the community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With regard to the preservation arrangements, there are no provisions in the PCS Act which require the preservation of lump sum benefits. The bill amends that Act to ensure the preservation of lump sum benefits in line with the SIS legislation. I should mention that, in common with the arrangements that apply to all other superannuation schemes, the preservation arrangements do not affect pension entitlements as the pensions are payable for life.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally in the SIS context, there are currently no provisions in the PCS Act requiring disclosure of information to members. Honourable senators will be aware that the Department of Finance has provided members with annual statements for the last 3 years. Relevant information has also been provided to new members and to retiring members. The bill formalises these administrative arrangements by amendments to the PCS Act to apply the SIS legislation disclosure arrangements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The PCS Act currently provides for the reduction of a pension where a beneficiary is the holder of an office of profit. Offices of profit are defined to include positions such as ambassadors, judges and positions that have judicial status. Many less well paid positions, such as part-time board members of Commonwealth and State authorities, are also included in the definition of an office of profit. Currently, most people who hold part-time positions lose the entire remuneration paid from the office of profit. This is a result of the current pension reduction of one dollar for each dollar earned from the office of profit until 50 per cent of the initial pension entitlement has been removed. The bill amends the PCS Act to decrease the amount of pension reduction to 50 cents for each dollar earned from an office of profit, and to provide a threshold below which earnings from an office of profit cause no reduction in pension. For persons who receive substantial remuneration from an office of profit, the current 50 per cent maximum pension reduction will continue to apply.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The PCS Act currently provides for the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust to grant a Member of the Scheme an invalidity retirement benefit if it is of the opinion that the member's resignation from the Parliament is made bona fide on grounds of ill-health. The PCS Act provides little guidance to the Trust in making a decision.  The current arrangements make no provision for the special demands of parliamentary service, as the invalidity arrangements in the defence force superannuation schemes do in respect of the demands of military service. Accordingly, the bill introduces procedures to be followed where there is an application for invalidity retirement, provides for three degrees of invalidity with differing benefit levels, and provides for a mechanism to review invalidity assessments once made.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The parliamentary superannuation scheme currently provides for the recognition of periods of service in a State or Territory Parliament in some circumstances, and for the reduction of benefits payable from the Scheme where the beneficiary is a member of a State or Territory Parliament or is receiving a pension as a result of such a membership. Under the current arrangements, the interaction of Commonwealth and State/Territory legislation usually results in the Commonwealth funding all of a benefit that is based on both Commonwealth and State or Territory Service. The bill amends the PCS Act so that periods of State or Territory Service will be recognised in the Scheme only to the extent that the service is purchased through payment of a transfer value from the State or Territory scheme to the Commonwealth scheme. If a transfer value is paid, the State or Territory service would be recognised on the same basis as service in other employment is recognised on the payment of a transfer value. It is proposed that benefits paid under the PCS Act would continue to be reduced where the beneficiary is a member of a State or Territory Parliament, but would not be reduced where a beneficiary of the Scheme is also in receipt of a State or Territory parliamentary pension. Importantly, transitional arrangements are included in the bill to protect the benefits available to current members with prior State or Territory parliamentary service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not possible to quantify the precise financial impact of the changes in the bill because of the limited application of the amendments in the relatively small parliamentary superannuation scheme. Having said that, however, the restoration or partial restoration of pensions to persons who currently hold an office of profit is estimated to cost $80,000 in a full year. It is expected that, in the longer term, these additional costs will be more than offset by savings made by the Commonwealth no longer recognising prior State or Territory parliamentary service at no cost to the State or Territory. In summary, therefore, the changes in budgetary outlays and change in long-term costs from the measures in the bill are expected to be relatively insignificant.

        VETERANS' AFFAIRS (1994-95 BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This bill presents amendments necessary to implement part of the Budget package for the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. A second bill for the remaining Budget initiatives that require legislation will be introduced at a later date. In addition to the changes to be included in the two bills, many of the important initiatives in this year's Budget do not require legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Budget package for Veterans' Affairs this year has been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-servicemen and women, war widows and widowers and their dependants. The package responds to issues raised by the ex-service community and the Report on Compensation for Veterans' and War Widows by the Veterans' Compensation Review Committee chaired by the Hon Professor Peter Baume, in respect of the ageing of veterans of the World Wars, and the different set of problems facing the younger veterans.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Baume Committee review was undertaken in consultation with  national representatives of the ex-service community to enable the Government to address issues which had emerged concerning disability pension determinations, especially following recent High Court interpretations of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the fundamental issues raised in the independent report of the Auditor-General in December 1992 on veterans' compensation. As well as the manner in which age related diseases should be dealt with, these issues included the relaxed interpretation of the meaning of the `reasonable hypothesis' test in that Act as it related to the relevant medical connection between injury, disease and death and war service and the lack of consistency in decision making and the inappropriateness of laymen determining complex questions of medical causation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some of the recommendations of the Auditor-General would have resulted in a cessation of grants for smoking related  illnesses and a return to the civil standard of proof for determining claims, thereby leading to an overall drastic reduction in the rate of successful claims.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As is obvious from the package, not all of the recommendations have been adopted but, Mr President, the Government was bound to address the fundamental issues raised by the Auditor-General and to introduce sufficient changes to ensure that the integrity and fairness of the repatriation system is maintained.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While these issues have been the principal focus, it has also been possible to tackle some long-standing issues such as bringing Australian merchant mariners under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, providing a better service pension deal for widows, widowers and separated partners, and enabling war widows to receive both their compensatory and income support pensions from Veterans' Affairs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In developing this package extensive, constructive and valuable consultations were held with the ex-service community. These consultations are welcomed by both the Government and the ex-service community and it is hoped that we may continue to work together in the future to provide the best possible care and recognition for our veterans and their dependants. This Budget package has received wide spread support from the ex-service community and this is in part due to the involvement that group has had in developing these initiatives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Budget initiatives have from the outset been a package. Indeed, senior representatives of national ex-service organisations agreed to the total package in full knowledge of the importance of each of the changes, believing that the final result would benefit the veteran community at large.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Before I go on to talk about the specific initiatives in the bill before us, I would just briefly like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the very important Budget initiatives for veterans and their dependants which do not require legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Budget includes an $8.9 million boost to aged care over the next four years with the thrust being to help veterans and war widows to remain healthy and self-sufficient in their own homes and within their local communities for as long as possible. For example, emphasis will be placed on carer education to provide training for carers of veterans and war widows who have come out of hospital and who are at high risk of injury or further hospitalisation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of particular significance in the Budget package is the $20.6 million which will be provided over the next four years to assist in the serious concerns faced by many younger veterans. These younger veterans, as well as  their families and carers, will benefit from initiatives such as funding for a more comprehensive program for treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service and money for research into the health, social and vocational needs of younger veterans.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additionally, $13.2 million has been allocated for funding for the Australian War Memorial, for a Memorial project at Kokoda in Papua and New Guinea and for commemorative activities in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I will now turn to the specific measures included in this bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Two of the initiatives in this bill are designed to ensure a more equitable and consistent system of determining claims for disability pensions for veterans and their dependants. The changes will involve the establishment of a Repatriation Medical Authority and amendment of the eligibility criteria for special and intermediate rate pensions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the first of these two measures, namely the establishment of a Repatriation Medical Authority with power to issue binding Statements of Principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence, is intended to overcome these problems.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These Statements of Principles will be legislative instruments and will be subject to disallowance. This means that when these Statements of Principles are laid before the Parliament they are subject to public scrutiny and normal democratic processes operate to allow veterans, or veterans organisations, to raise objections with all political parties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The bill will in effect define, by reference to such Statements of Principles, the concept of `reasonable hypothesis', as it appears in subsection 120(3) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The result will be that a medical hypothesis linking particular kinds of injury, disease or death with war service that does not have a sound medical-scientific base, will no longer be sufficient to constitute a `reasonable hypothesis'. This will be a matter solely for the expert Medical Authority to determine. I stress that the opinion of a single medical expert may still be sufficient to constitute a `reasonable hypothesis', provided that such opinion has a sound medical-scientific base, as determined by the Authority.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These changes are consistent with the ruling of the High Court that the validity of the reasoning of all medical and scientific material must be examined.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        They are also consistent with the regret expressed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and others, that such  complex matters are left to be determined by laymen. In this regard it has become apparent that lay tribunals do not deal with medical-scientific issues consistently, and while nominally inquisitorial, appear to adopt an approach that is inappropriate for determining medical-scientific issues that call for detailed technical knowledge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Repatriation Medical Authority will provide the appropriate forum for the resolution of technical medical-scientific issues. This will ensure that there will be consistency on medical-scientific issues at all levels of the determining system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be appointing the members of the Authority after consultation with the ex-service community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Authority will prepare generic Statements of Principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence that will state what factors must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and war service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Decisions will then be made in respect of individual claims to determine whether those factors exist in the circumstances of each particular case.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, it must be made clear that decisions on the facts of a case will not be a matter for the Medical Authority but will remain, as at present, with the Repatriation Commission. Importantly, they will continue to be subject to review by the Veterans' Review Board and the AAT.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Statements of Principles themselves, which will provide the template within which individual claims will be determined, will be binding on the Repatriation Commission and review and appeal bodies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Once again, I stress that these Statements of Principles will be subject to testing by the Parliament, giving all sections of the ex-service community ample opportunity to raise any concerns that they may have.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, I stress that the bill establishes a comprehensive system of review of the contents of Statements of Principles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Veterans, their dependants and organisations representing veterans or their dependants will be able to make submissions to the Authority which will be considered in the process of formulating the Statements of Principles. They will also be able to request the Authority to carry out investigations into the cause of any injury, disease or death, for the purpose of making a Statement of Principles, and to request a review of any of the Statements of Principles. Comprehensive provisions exist in the bill in relation to such matters, including provisions requiring the Authority to give notice of any request for investigation and enabling access to information and documents considered by the Authority in arriving at its determinations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, it has been agreed that a special mechanism should exist for dealing with particular classes of veterans, such as those that have been given special consideration in the past, in particular, prisoners of war and Vietnam veterans. Accordingly, provision exists for the Repatriation Commission, at its discretion, to issue overriding determinations having the same effect as Statements of Principle, granting entitlements to certain classes of veterans when it considers that an entitlement should exist for such classes in respect of certain types of injuries, disease or death. Careful consideration will need to be given to the use of this power, which is not, of course, intended to be used as a general means of usurping the function of the Repatriation Medical Authority. Of course, this power can only be used to override Statements of Principles by making determinations which are more generous than the existing Statements of Principles. The power cannot be used to restrict, in any way, a Statement of Principles made by the Authority.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President these changes maintain a beneficial repatriation system, including a `reasonable hypothesis' standard, as modified as I have already outlined, for deciding compensation claims for death or disease relating to eligible war service. There has not been a return to a civil standard of proof, as recommended by the Baume Committee, which would have had the potential to reduce the success rate of claims, which currently stands at above 70%, to the pre-1977 rate of approximately 30%.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the Government acknowledges the special status of veterans. It is hoped that these changes will be effective in overcoming the maverick and fringe claims that have interfered with the integrity of an extremely generous repatriation system, without having to return to a civil standard of proof for the determination of claims.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The changes are intended to ensure that the credibility of the repatriation system is maintained and that medical opinions supported by little or no medical-scientific evidence do not prevail over the carefully developed mass of medical-scientific opinion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It will not mean that only mainstream medical opinion would be regarded as reasonable, but it will require any alternative opinions to have a sound medical or scientific basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I want to assure all veterans that current entitlements will not be affected.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has also given a personal commitment that, if after 12 months the ex-service community can demonstrate that the new scheme for the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the issue of Statements of Principles has not achieved the objectives I have outlined, the scheme will be reviewed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second initiative relates to changes to the eligibility criteria for special and intermediate rate pensions, the former being known in the past as the T&amp;PI or totally and permanently incapacitated pension.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the criteria for these higher rates of disability pension were changed in 1985 when it became clear that the outmoded terminology of the old Repatriation Act was enabling these pensions to be paid to veterans who had completed a full working life, after retiring on superannuation and other retirement benefits. This was never intended. The original intention of these higher levels of pension was to compensate those severely disabled veterans who could not work to support their families on their return from service. It was to be in only very rare cases that any veteran beyond the normal retirement age would be eligible for such rates of pension.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, subject to certain exceptions and to protection of existing special and intermediate pensions, the changes being made by this bill reinforce that intention. They will mean that these pensions will not normally be granted to veterans who are over 65. An exception to this rule will apply if the veteran was engaged in remunerative work after the age of 65 and that work was in the same business or employment in which the veteran had been working for ten continuous years. This would include, for example, many in the farming community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Let me assure honourable members that this measure applies  only to veterans who, after 1 June 1994, claim special or intermediate rate pension and, I stress, after they have turned 65. Existing special and intermediate rate pensions, whether granted before or after the age of 65, will not be affected by the change. Furthermore, such pensions granted to veterans before the age of 65 will continue to be paid after turning 65.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Let me now move to another measure in this bill which I am sure will be welcomed and supported by all honourable members. Australian World War 2 merchant mariners are to be given the same rights and benefits as those available to Australian World War 2 veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Currently the criteria relating to the provision of compensation benefits for Australian mariners are more stringent than under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, particularly with regard to the connection required between employment and injury and also, in most cases the standard of proof. For veterans who have rendered operational service, there need only be a reasonable hypothesis linking injury, disease or death to the veterans' war service, whereas an Australian mariner's injury or death must, as a general rule, be directly related, on the balance of probabilities, to enemy action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With this initiative, mariners and their dependants will now receive benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A further initiative in this bill will mean that existing service pensioners, as well as claimants for service pension, may be asked to take reasonable action to claim any overseas pension entitlements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While it is clear that a successful claim for overseas pension may result in a decreased rate of service pension being paid, or indeed no service pension being paid at all, it should be remembered that if a person does receive the foreign pension then they will be better off financially than they are at present—even if service pension ceases  to be paid. This is the case because the application of the service pension income test to the amount of the foreign pension received only reduces the rate of the service pension by 50c for every $1 of the overseas pension but only after the application of the generous free area of $152 per fortnight for a couple and $88 per fortnight for a single pensioner.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The two remaining initiatives in this bill are of  particular significance to war widows and widowers and to widows, widowers and separated spouses of service pensioners.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first of these changes will affect those war widows and widowers who, in addition to their war widow or war widower pension, are currently also receiving an income support payment from the Department of Social Security. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will now pay a new payment, an Income Support Supplement, to these widows and widowers in lieu of their current social security payment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Income Support Supplement will be paid at the same rate at which their social security payment would be paid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This change will enable war widows and war widowers to receive their income support payments as well as their compensation payments from the one department. Of course, if a war widow or widower currently getting income support payments from the Department of Social Security wishes to continue to do so, they may elect to do this.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second of these changes relates to the payment of partner service pension. The change will allow for the payment of partner service pension to a person who is the widow, widower or separated spouse of an age or invalidity veteran service pensioner to be made at the higher `single' rate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Currently, such a person is only able to receive payment at the lower rate of service pension which normally applies to a person who is a member of a couple and, as a result, most choose to transfer to the Department of Social Security to receive an income support payment at the higher rate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Importantly, former recipients of partner service pension who relinquished that pension in order to take up a social security pension at the higher rate, will now have the  opportunity to resume their partner service pension.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In summary, I believe that the measures presented in this bill represent major initiatives which will help to ensure the fair and equitable delivery of repatriation benefits to veterans and their dependants.

        —by leave—I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate tonight an anomaly in the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992 regarding rental agreements for pay TV. This anomaly fails to provide any consumer protection whatsoever for the future subscribers of satellite pay TV services.

        As honourable senators would be aware, pay TV will be introduced to Australia later this year, probably in August or September, and will present millions of Australians with the opportunity to take advantage of this new technology to expand their choice of television stations. Transmission of pay TV services will be undertaken by a number of suppliers transmitting through various mediums, including cable, MDS, microwave and satellite. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 regulates these suppliers through applying certain requirements and restrictions on pay TV services.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        A serious anomaly has been uncovered in the Broadcasting Services Act showing that the act fails to provide consumer protection to purchasers of satellite pay TV subscriptions in the manner in which cable subscribers are protected. Section 100(6) of the Broadcasting Services Act states that the Australian Broadcasting Authority must impose a condition on all non-satellite subscription television broadcasting licences requiring that, if a licensee rents domestic reception equipment to a consumer, the rental agreement must allow the consumer to terminate the agreement on giving one month's written notice to the licensee.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The anomaly that I am referring to relates to the fact that this rental agreement condition does not apply to satellite pay TV services, which are expected to be major suppliers of pay TV services in Australia. In effect, what this means is that under the current arrangements consumers who subscribe to satellite pay TV services would have no possibility of being allowed to cancel the agreement.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I am concerned at the prospect of consumers making a hasty decision regarding expensive satellite TV equipment and then having no recourse to terminate the agreement. It is important that the oversight is corrected as soon as possible, bearing in mind that pay TV will be up and running within the next couple of months. I have drawn this to the attention of the representative of the Minister for Consumer Affairs in the Senate, Senator McMullan. I hoped that he would be down here at an appropriate time to give me a response to this anomaly in the act.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I am going to ask the government to remedy this anomaly forthwith and amend section 100(6) of the Broadcasting Services Act. Alternatively, I put it to Senator McMullan that he give an unequivocal guarantee that protection will be extended to cover satellite subscribers through consulting with the state consumer ministers on how to best apply state legislation to overcome this glaring loophole in consumer protection. Surely if consumers can be protected from buying encyclopedias or vacuum cleaners, for example, and have safeguards such as 30 day get-out provisions, they can be protected from satellite pay TV licences when a large amount of money is going to be at stake.

        One pay TV operator, Australian Media Ltd, planned to lease its receiving equipment and decoders through the means of a $500 signing-up fee and then monthly subscription fees of about $40 to $50. This will represent a major financial burden and undertaking for many consumers. Therefore, it is essential that there be no opportunity for it to become a major financial burden. Consumers must always be given an opportunity to opt out of agreements, as many can be the unwitting victims of impetuous decisions. They may fall for the hard sell and, as a result, make a hasty financial undertaking which they cannot meet.

The issue is whether we proceed to set up such an inquiry when we come back in a week's time or whether we give the committee secretariat a week to do the organisation. This seemed to be the better of those two options. I would have thought, on any objective assessment, that would have been seen to be so. This will mean there is, in effect, a fortnight to enable this inquiry to be set up. It is a short inquiry and, as I understand it, the witnesses are obvious. They are the specialist organisations within the field, probably very much on top of the material and very willing to cooperate in helping the parliament in its task in this regard. So it seemed to be a very sensible, appropriate way in which the parliament might act.

Evidently, he was his nominee on the board of Euphron Pty Ltd and he appears to be acting on behalf of the Danes on other group boards. Moonbi Estates purchased from the Brown and Hatton group part of its $1.3 million Tamworth piggery for $220,000, which it has developed and sold off in subdivided lots, but which shows in its latest annual return for 1993 no assets and no profits.

Why did Mr Keating at no stage advise his Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, of the size and nature of his investment in the piggery which he made while Treasurer immediately it was made, as required by the ministerial declaration rules?

Did he know, or was he recklessly indifferent to whether or not improper actions were undertaken—which happened to be to his advantage—involving misleading foreign investors into believing that a near-bankrupt piggery-refrigeration group was `financially strong' as it was wrongly described to Danish institutions and cooperatives, when it had never made a profit and its liabilities exceeded its assets; filing false returns with the Australian Securities Commission wrongly claiming member companies of the group were profitable and had positive shareholders' funds when the opposite was the case; money laundering $230,000 from the Danish investors to his half-owned company through the purchase of a property at Scone for $120,000 and its resale three months later to the Danes for $350,000?

The charge was laid by five executive members of New South Wales Young Labor, who also charged party members Gino Mandarino, who has been suspended, and several others over the same issue. In other words, he was clearly involved in this matter, which is all I had said, and he denied that by using the privileges arrangements.

I want to put on the record that I had never seen that document before it was tabled. It certainly was not addressed to me or current to the issue of this inquiry.

I subsequently queried his advice by phoning him, and I am very grateful for his assistance in relation to that matter. At the time the leases over Shoalwater Bay were granted—the relevant date is 19 October 1992—Senator Faulkner was not a minister in this government. The leases were approved by cabinet on 15 October 1990 and subsequently granted on 19 October 1992—two years later. The reason for that delay appears to have been that it was not until 13 May 1992 that the federal government managed to enter into an agreement with the Queensland government relating to the issuance of those leases.

         The interesting thing is that, on 21 December 1992—that is, two months after the government issued the leases for sandmining at Shoalwater Bay—an environmental statement made by the government as part of an early election campaign said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has decided to conduct a full and open assessment of the environmental and economic values of all Commonwealth lands in the Shoalwater Bay area. This course of action accords with the position adopted in the One Nation Statement for economic and environmental evaluation of areas being considered for protection.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This decision also takes into account the recent announcement by the one mining lease-holder in the area, Pivot Mining NL, to defer mining, widespread community concern about the future of the Shoalwater Bay area and the cumulative impact of multiple mining rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        One has to ask: what sort of government takes two years to issue a mining lease and then two months to decide to hold an inquiry into the issuance of that lease? Two months is all it took for the government to go from signing and issuing the leases to deciding to hold an inquiry as to whether they should be revoked. That, as you know, Mr President, is an extraordinary—if not unprecedented—situation and certainly one which needs to be queried. That is why I rang the minister for the environment, Senator Faulkner, and asked him to confirm the date, which he was kind enough to do.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Unfortunately, the minister has provided no explanation as to why the inquiry was announced just two months after the leases were granted. Given that the matter would have had to go to cabinet before the Prime Minister made this statement, it may have been that even less time elapsed between the issuance of the lease and the decision to set up the inquiry. I am also disappointed, but not surprised, that the minister has refused to table the advice provided to the then minister for the environment in February 1990 when it was recommended that the leases be granted. That is because the government really wishes this issue was not here.

         It is very clear that there is something most peculiar about Shoalwater Bay. The decision to announce an inquiry into leases that were issued just two months beforehand beggars belief. The amazing thing is that, even if one wants to be charitable and say that the government was locked into the issuance of the leases on 13 May 1992 when it executed the agreement with Queensland and the two mining companies, it is still only seven months between the agreement to issue the leases and the announcement of the inquiry into those leases. It is beyond me exactly what was in the government's mind.

         I believe that the minister did not answer the question today because he is under riding instructions to be very careful in what he says, because this government is in cover-up mode every time Shoalwater Bay, Graham Richardson or Peter Laurance are mentioned.

This matter was first raised in the House of Representatives by Dr Kemp who tabled a minute from a first assistant secretary of DEET, Mr Peter Grant, to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean.

         It turns out that the ACTU, in particular, was unhappy with the report of the OECD on the accord. The OECD was critical of the rigidities in our labour market. For some time the government has gone on about labour market reform, enterprise bargaining and agreements. Mr Brereton has created an absolute shemozzle, as a result of which he has had to do massive back-flips on his arrangements. Apart from that, the arrangements in place after 11 years of Labor government are something about which the OECD has been especially critical.

         An example of how much the government is a puppet of the ACTU, is the fact that the ACTU actually approached DEET and the minister in an attempt to get the OECD to do a more favourable review through another division. The ACTU wanted the Labour Market Directorate to have a look at it and come up with a better review. The DEET official whom I mentioned earlier spoke to Mr Tom Alexander of the OECD's Labour Market Directorate and asked whether a review would be possible and what the likely outcome would be. It gives us a lot of confidence in the independence of the OECD and its reports, especially those on Australia, to note that, to his great credit, Mr Alexander replied that there would be no change in the stance of the OECD.

         Interestingly, he suggested that a comparative analysis should be done between labour market rigidities and their effects on economies between New Zealand, the UK, the US and Australia. We all know that would show the absolute failure of this country's labour market policies and the way in which other countries have leapt well ahead of us. Certainly the ethos in industrial relations in the United States is way ahead of us and the flexibility and outcomes are far better than they are in Australia.

         Countries that have started later than the US, in particular, the United Kingdom and our brothers and sisters across in New Zealand who, we thought, were going down at first a similar track in economic policy in the early 1980s, have outcomes that are now showing that they are leaving us behind. One of the most critical reasons why these countries are leaving Australia behind is that they have bitten the bullet, reformed the labour market and not been the toadies of bodies like the ACTU and implemented the policies of such bodies.

         If we want to get our economy back on track we need to firstly bring in industrial relations policies that will lead to greater flexibility to give businesses a chance to perform and compete in the international labour market. That certainly has not been happening. It was best summed up in what we found when we uncovered these documents and the DEET official said that Australia could be greatly criticised because of our speed—if that is the right word for it—towards true enterprise bargaining and:

        Fortunately, the government has started to see the light on some things, such as the training guarantee levy, but it still has a long way to go. The main thing this report has highlighted is that this government in this area is on the wrong track. It has not really bitten the bullet on proper labour market reform. It has had a number of initiatives in the budget and in the white paper which have had the effect of just churning the dole queue; they really have not solved the fundamental, underlying problems to which I have alluded previously.

         The Senate should be outraged that the government, given its poor record in this area, has tried to influence an international body and, by changing the departments of the OECD to report on Australia, has hoped to get a more favourable report.

         —I rise to speak on the adjournment this evening, as I rarely do, on a matter raised by Senator Tambling earlier this week in this chamber during debate on the Northern Territory election. In his attempt to weave a few myths around the Northern Territory election result, Senator Tambling claimed that I had committed `a major blunder' by publicly stating my opposition to the ill-fated Cannonball Run. The day that I consider speaking out for greater road safety in the Northern Territory to be a political blunder, I will resign from parliament and book into the nearest psychiatric hospital.

         The Northern Territory government has thumbed its nose for years at attempts to introduce a safer driving culture in the Northern Territory. It is an issue that I have raised constantly in both the press and this chamber, as the

          Hansard

         record will show. There is a good reason for this: the Northern Territory has the worst road trauma statistics in Australia by a long way. As everyone in the Northern Territory knows—except, apparently, Senator Tambling—both major parties made a point of publicly stating during the election campaign that they did not intend to make an election issue out of the ill-starred Cannonball Run. As a result, it did not become an election issue. Therefore, the election result cannot be seen as a referendum on the future of the event.

         I made my public comments on this event during the campaign when the media approached me at the Labor Party campaign launch—and they approached me at that time because that was the very day that four people lost their lives in this race. I said then that debate over the event should be separate to the election. This view, as I said earlier, was supported by all parties. But the reason I raise this matter is that the only person who has raised the issue, drawn that conclusion and described the public concern that I expressed about this event as a political blunder is Senator Tambling who, until he stood here in the Senate the other day—and we have checked the record—had said nothing about it.

         He said that the tragic deaths could just as easily have included innocent road users with no connection with the race, which was the nightmare that I feared when I sought briefings on this event from race organisers last year and raised it again with the Northern Territory's Deputy Chief Minister at a meeting I had with him here in Parliament House on 8 February this year. It is more by good luck than by judgment that innocent road users were not claimed by the Cannonball Run—the kind of people, I might add, who have written to me since, including an ex-member of the Queensland police force, who had been a member of that force for 30 years, who had visited the territory with his wife as a tourist. He expressed his horror at the prospect of such a race ever being held again.

         Dr Boffa said that the hero status conferred on the event reinforced a culture where high speed driving was acceptable. As I said in an interview—before the event, I stress—it does not make a lot of sense when governments around Australia, including the federal government, talk about speed killing, and spend millions of dollars through the federal office of road safety and elsewhere, and then run an event where amateur drivers are allowed to drive high powered cars in excess of 200 kilometres per hour on a public road in potential conflict with innocent road users. It sounds absurd as I am standing here saying it, but that is what the Northern Territory's Chief Minister organised. Those views have also been echoed by the Automobile Association of the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory Road Safety Council and road safety authorities around Australia.

         The Northern Territory has the highest road fatality rate in Australia. In fact, the road toll is twice that of the national average. The Northern Territory government's sole justification for holding this event is summed up by Mr Perron's constant claim that `it would bring millions of dollars in publicity for the Northern Territory around the world'. It is interesting in the context of this claim to look at the published remarks of Phil Scott, the editor of one of Australia's leading motoring publications,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         magazine. Mr Scott said his magazine had decided not to cover the event because `our initial call on the event was that it was all a bit mickey mouse'. Mr Scott said that it was a dynamite combination to turn amateur drivers loose in high powered cars on open roads. These views have been echoed in editorials around the country.

        All sensible people will say, `Hear, hear!' Mr President, I am not being wise after the event. As I said, I had a briefing from race organisers last year because of my concern. I was informed that competitors in this race would not reach the speeds on the open road that they subsequently did. I was told that this would occur only during the measured mile parts of the race where other road users—that is, the three-dog road trains and tourist buses that constantly travel on the Stuart Highway in the Northern Territory—would not be in potential conflict with these high speed cars.

         As I said, I also raised my concerns about the event with the Deputy Chief Minister in February. I was given those assurances. In so doing, I was clearly misled. Judging from the public statements made in television interviews by officials of Northern Territory road bodies—which I saw—which expressed similar concerns and got similar briefings to me, so was everyone else misled. But no-one should be surprised. The last time I raised concerns about the Northern Territory government's continuing failure to lower its blood alcohol content from .08 to .05, the relevant minister, Darryl Manzie, claimed that the equipment to do this in the territory was not available.

         This was absolute rubbish. I advised the Darwin media that I had been informed by the federal office of road safety precisely what equipment was available. Within hours they interviewed a spokesman for the Northern Territory police force who confirmed on the ABC that the equipment was available, thus disagreeing completely with a statement his own minister had made just a few hours before. How can territorians trust a government which would lie about such a serious public health issue to run another Cannonball Run?

         Two of the major contributors to the Northern Territory's appalling road safety record are alcohol and excessive speed. The Northern Territory government's response has been to parade itself as the only jurisdiction in Australia not to impose a 0.05 limit and attempt to deceive territorians on the reasons it will not do so and to stage a Cannonball Run with amateur drivers in high powered cars let loose on public roads at speeds of over 200 kilometres per hour. It is about time the Northern Territory's Chief Minister admitted to himself, if no-one else, that he allowed his personal enthusiasms to override his public responsibilities. I state again: this first Cannonball Run in the Northern Territory should be the last.

        (1) There was no significant change in the overall human rights situation in Pakistan in 1993 and problems remain in several areas. Instances of arbitrary detention, arrest, torture and abuse of prisoners and detainees continued to be a serious problem despite widespread expressions of concern both local and international. There have been no significant efforts made to reform the police or judicial systems or to prosecute and punish those responsible for abuses. Members of the Ahmadi community in Pakistan continue to be inhibited in the practice of their religion and there is evidence that people are still being charged for contravention of the Pakistani law, particularly on blasphemy. This law, as interpreted by the full bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, prohibits the Ahmadis from using Islamic terminology in respect of the observance of their religious practises. Since the inception of the law in 1986, 107 Ahmadis have been charged with blasphemy, however, none of these have been convicted. Advice from Pakistan supports the view that recently there has been a slight decline in the number of violations committed against members of the Ahmadi community.

        (3) The High Commission has made a number of representations to the Government of Pakistan on Australia's concerns about reported human rights violations in Pakistan. The most recent discussion of Australia's human rights concerns in Pakistan took place when the High Commissioner called on the Minister of Interior on 1 March 1994. During discussions with Ministers and senior officials, the High Commissioner and his staff have frequently expressed Australia's concerns about the human rights situation in Pakistan and our wish to see that internationally accepted standards of human rights are observed. These discussions have included references to the rights of religious minorities in Pakistan, both in terms of their rights to the free exercise of their religion and in terms of their entitlements as citizens. In this context, specific mention of the situation of Ahmadis as well as of Christians and Hindus has been made.

        (4) Pakistan's Interim (Qureshi) Government established the National Commission on Minorities in late 1993. The Commission's progress has been slow to review legislation and practices that discriminate against minorities in Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan recently announced the setting up of a Cabinet Committee on Minorities. The Committee has been given a broad agenda that includes a review of legislation which allegedly discriminates against minorities and is required to prepare a report on the treatment of minorities within a month.

        (5) The issue of discrimination against women in Pakistan does not fall under the purview of the National Commission on Minorities. Social convention and several legal constraints continue to place women in a subordinate position in Pakistani society. The issue has, however, attracted the personal attention of Prime Minister Bhutto. The Prime Minister has established a Committee on the Status of Women and has given it a mandate to study discriminatory laws against women and make recommendations to the Government.
