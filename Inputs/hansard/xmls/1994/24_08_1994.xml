        This bill provides for an increase in the funds appropriated under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1988 to support tertiary education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. The funds concerned are to be transferred from the Higher Education Funding Act 1988.
       </para>

        The funds concerned will be made available under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program. This program was introduced in 1990 and underpins the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP). Funding for this program is presently appropriated on a triennial basis with the second triennium covering the years 1993 to 1995.

        During 1993 the Commonwealth government, with the agreement of all State and Territory governments, commenced a National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People. The National Review has been asked to examine whether or not the strategies developed over the first three years of the AEP have been effective and to suggest some new strategic directions where these might be required.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A National Reference Group to oversee the Review was appointed in October 1993. The ten members of the Reference Group, chaired by Mandawuy Yunupingu, issued a Discussion Paper in February 1994. The second stage of the Review, which will take account of the views put forward in submissions and in the responses to the Discussion Paper, will culminate in a final report and recommendations to be presented in September 1994.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition to this National Review, the April 1994 meeting  of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, considered a discussion paper presented by the Commonwealth in relation to developing a national strategy for the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Council agreed to establish a group to provide advice to Ministers within three months on the terms of reference, membership, term and financial arrangements for the development of a national strategy. Following acceptance of the terms of reference by Ministers, a national strategy working party, chaired by the Commonwealth, will be established. The working party will provide a progress report for consideration by the Ministerial Council at its October/November 1994 meeting.

        The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for a small increase in Commonwealth funding of the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program for 1995 and 1996 to support tertiary education provision in remote areas.

        This bill provides for the appropriation of $84.131 million in 1995 and $256,000 in 1996. The 1995 funding level represents an increase of $212,000 on the amount currently specified in the Principal Act. The amount appropriated for 1996 reflects the amount of funds to be transferred from the Higher Education Funding Act. Legislation will be introduced at a later stage to increase that amount to reflect the appropriate base level of funding which should apply in 1986 and later years.

         I say at the outset that these are proposals of the Procedure Committee. There is no government ownership in any of this, but just for the procedural convenience of the chamber it is usually the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) who presides. But, as he is watching Australia win gold medals, it has fallen to me to move these matters.

          I suppose these reforms arose out of the view of the oppositionâ€”I think shared by the minority parties in the Senateâ€”that it would like to see a change in the Senate committee system, especially that the chairs of committees would more accurately represent the numbers in the chamber. I am not sure of the reason for thisâ€”whether it is philosophically based or otherwise. If it is philosophically based, it is purely quarantined to the national parliament. Where the Liberal Party has a majority anywhere else in Australia this sort of bonhomie has not emerged. Nevertheless, it has to be said that often the federal parliament leads and the states follow.

          Perhaps I might make some general comments. Even if I may be somewhat dubious about all the motives involved here, one of the good things about bringing in some reforms in the Senate is that more often than not a lot of good things emerge out of it. I hope that the combination of reference and legislation committees, and the concentration of resources there, will very much enhance the Senate committee system. Even if we carry this today, we have some remaining problems to resolve, but certainly we would be seeking that the remuneration tribunal establish a regime that is fair. One would hope that this parliament's select committees would be somewhat restricted. The difficulty of government numbers bottling up a reference in a standing committee is one of the reasons why select committees have emerged. That need no longer occur.

          I want to say one other thing. This probably is not the perfect system because it involves compromise; it involves some sort of compact between the opposition and the government where we say, `Is there enough turkey on each other's plate to make this place work?' Hence, some of the changes are really based on that compromise. I have no doubt that some amendments will emerge today. I am hopeful that those amendments will not amount to a substantive or dramatic change from what was thrashed out and agreed at the Procedure Committee.

          The first of the proposals in standing order 25 lists the eight committees. It basically says that there will be a government chair and majority on the legislation side to deal with legislation, estimates and annual reports. On the reference committees there will be a non-government majority and a non-government chair, with the sharing of chairs between the opposition and the Democrats. There are procedures in place basically saying that the opposition will take six and the Democrats or minor parties will take two. If it cannot be sorted out, it will come back to this chamber to be sorted out. In one instance I guess the government is fairly empowered with its numbers to make a decision. I do not think I need say much more; the matter has been fairly well canvassed. I think we will see some very interesting changes come out of this particular proposal.

          â€”Perhaps I could make a few general comments in response to the minister's motion which, of course, arises out of the recommendations of the Procedure Committee, which is a committee comprising representatives of all major parties in this place. The committee system of the Senate is vitally important to its effective operation. In many ways the committee system is what distinguishes the legislative function of this place from that of the House of Representatives. There is no doubt that the community expects of a house of review, and in particular the Australian Senate, an extra responsibility in relation to both the scrutiny of the government's legislative program and the scrutiny of the government's appropriations.

          Generally speaking, one can say that those responsibilities have been well accepted by this chamber. In fact, in some areas of scrutiny the Australian Senate is regarded by academics as having led the world. I think this is so particularly in relation to the scrutiny of subordinate legislation through the setting up of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and then later, in relation to certain aspects of the legislative process to protect civil rights, in particular, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

          In relation to the appropriations, I think it is also generally accepted that the Senate estimates committee system has fulfilled a useful function. It is really the parliament's only opportunity to examine, in effect line by line, the government's appropriations through each of the departments. Senators have the opportunity not only to question the minister responsible for that department or, in some instances, the minister representing the minister responsible for that department in this place, but also to question the relevant departmental officers. That is an important function, and the mechanism is in place whereby it can be done.

There will always be some who believe that the concentration has been on the wrong issues of the day. Nevertheless, what is important is that the facility is there. We can all point to many instances where it has worked most effectively, as a result of which the accountability of the government in financial matters has been effected.

          The effectiveness of the legislative scrutiny, however, is more open to debate. The functions of the Senate in that regard, one might say, have really been divided into two roles: on the one hand, to scrutinise legislation through the committee system as a more in-depth examination than simply a debate at the committee stage in this place; and also to take references, I guess, from a more policy oriented, public interest stance, on issues that are important to the community and to explore, with the opportunity of community input, whether or not this Senate should, in effect, advise that certain policy responses should follow from government.

That extension of democracy, I think, is vitally important.

          As to the scrutiny of the government's legislative program, however, I think there is reason for debate as to whether that has been most effectively done through this committee system. As you will be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, the Senate amended the mechanisms to enable that scrutiny of legislation to provide for short term inquiries, what we referred to as `the Friday inquiries', to provide a greater level of scrutiny than would occur in this chamber but to do it in a way that is reasonably restrained, both financially and from a time point of view, and, therefore, not unduly disruptive to the government's program.

          I strongly supported that reform, because I do not think in many ways the committee stage debate in this place works well. It is a strained debate, with ministers more often than not needing to seek advice from officials as the debate progresses. There is no direct opportunity to question those officials. There is no opportunity for any outside input into the debate, for any specialist input or input from interest groups. It always struck me that some mechanismâ€”albeit in a reasonably efficient way that could overcome those shortcomings of the committee stage debate in this placeâ€”would be a reform that was in the national interest.

          For a short time that Friday committee mechanism, I thought, worked reasonably well. Certainly there were difficulties, particularly in relation to often the very short time available for advising potential witnesses of inquiriesâ€”in other words, bringing them to public attention. There were arguments about who the appropriate witnesses to call were in an inquiry that was clearly going to be very limited in time. Nevertheless, I think it improved the legislative processâ€”I can point to examples if I have toâ€”and therefore the Senate was doing its job better.

          When that reform was introduced, a normal sitting day of the Senate was set aside for the Senate to break into those legislative and general purpose committees to examine bills in that way. That in effect became for a short time the way in with the Senate functioned on that day. In a normal sitting week of four days, the Senate sat in the chamber on three days and on one day in the various legislative committees, which sat elsewhere in this building and carried out their business in that distinctive way.

          However, with the change in sitting times of this place, which was basically against our position, at least one week in every two sitting weeks was extended to four days. Not surprisingly, there was resistance from senators, who, as we all know, have pressures back in their electorates and so need to spend at least one day a week serving their constituents rather than being here. The capacity to serve those committees in the way that was originally envisaged started to be lost. It is my observation that that Friday committee system has now very much broken down. That is disappointing because, as I have just argued, I think it was a very useful reform in the legislative process of this nation and that capacity has been lost.

          The reforms that have been put before the chamber today will not totally resolve that. Nevertheless, drawing together what was the estimates committee system with what I have described as the Friday examination of bills system may well lead to committees that are stronger, that have more of a continuity, and that perhaps will encourage senators towards having greater specialisation, which is something that I have also always argued for. Although it is difficult to specialise because everyone in this place wants to be an expert on everything, I have always thought the Senate as a whole would be strengthened if senators specialised more.

That is a part of this restructuring that is worth a try.

          The other part will involve what is left; that is, the function of the committees to examine longer term references in the public interest.

          I know that it has been a practice for some time that government senators should control these committees. Senator Ray mused as to why we would want to see change in that regard. These committees, particularly in this area, are not committees of the government; they are committees of the Senate. There is no logical reason why they should not reflect the numbers in the Senate, rather than who might hold the numbers in the other place. It is not an unusual practice. I hesitate to go back as far as Westminster, but I understand that there are not the same constraints of practice there that there have been in this place. I suspect that the practice in this place arose at a time when the government of the day controlled the numbers in this place.

Under such a proposal, any senator would be able to go to any committee for the duration of any reference. Senators would be able to go to the hearings on that reference and question witnesses. They would be able to go to the private meetings on that reference, and would then be able to have a lot of input into the report of that committee. So we would be able either to be a part of the majority report or, if we felt it incumbent upon us, write our own minority reports and have them considered when the Senate considers the report.

We must not let us do that. We must not let anyone do that. So it is a very good systemâ€”with the government having the chairs of the legislative committees, the opposition and the Democrats having the chairs of the reference committees, and all of us being able to participate in any committee for any single reference that we want.

          There is one thing that is not in the standing orders because, I guess, it could not be put in conveniently. It is something I brought up in the Procedure Committee that I would like to see as part of the system: any participating member would have to go to a certain number of the hearings and the private meetings to be included in the final stage. I do not think this would happen, but there is the possibility under this system for somebody to turn up to the last meeting and to be included in the writing of the report, not having heard witnesses, not having questioned witnesses and not having the same background as everybody else. I do not think that is particularly fair. I hope we all keep in mind that, if we include ourselves in a reference, we do it seriously. We have to, I would say, turn up to about 50 per cent of the meetings.

In six or 12 months, when it comes to a review of this system, if that has happened, then we will have to look at changing it. I hope that it does not happen and that it does not have to be put into standing orders. I commend all these changes to the Senate. This is a very coordinated new committee system. When I put in our first proposals, one senator said to me, `This is a very radical change and therefore we are not sure if we like it very much.' It is a bit of a radical change, but it is not terribly different to what we do now. It will improve and streamline the committee system as we have it. I am looking forward to that. I am looking forward to being a participating member in some inquiries and being on one of the committees. I am confident that this system will work better than the one we have now.

          â€”Some of the concepts in this structure are a little similar to some of the ideas in the 1989 report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I am referring particularly to having the responsibility for the performance of departments and agencies over the longer term linked to an examination of the estimates process. I have thought for a long time that that biannual blockbuster operation of all-night sittings and the pressure, both on the committees and on the Public Service, was not the best way of operating. Some parts of the performance accountability area need not be squashed into those couple of nights twice a year.

          What we have got out of this Procedure Committee reference is not so much a collapsing of the estimates and performance examination processes with the general committee structure but a double stream system whereby we have references committees to deal with issuesâ€”I would suspect that most of these would be over a longer term; they would not usually be very rapid referencesâ€”and, on the other hand, the stream of legislation committees. These would look at bills, including the appropriation bills, that is, the estimates process, and would have the continuous responsibility, as clause 2(b) of the proposed standing orders says, of `Annual reports in accordance with the reference of such reports to them and the performance of departments and agencies allocated to them.'

          It is because of that extra function beyond bills and estimates that I kept wanting to come up with a better name than just legislation committees for this stream of committees because it is a narrower title than is the reality of the functions of these committees. However, I have to accept that the various suggestions that I came up with, such as performance and legislation committees, were not accepted by other people on the Procedure Committee who wanted, above all, a one-word name for these committees. So I have to accept that we have references committees on the one hand and legislation committees on the other; but all I would ask is that senators remember that the function of the legislation committees is not only bills and estimates.

          â€”I suggested performance and legislation committees; but I do not want to start moving amendments and upsetting the agreement. All I want to do is emphasise that, even though they have this name, they have the broader function. The Senate will recall that several years ago the responsibility for annual reports was beefed up in relation to the responsibilities of committees. This again arose out of a recommendation of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration but it was taken up by former Senator Hamer in moving a motion to ensure a regularised method of referring annual reports to committees. This set of proposals incorporates that system into the responsibility of the legislation committees and suitably simplifies it.

          The reference of annual reports has had a mixed response from committees. I suspect most committees and their staffs have seen it as a bit of a choreâ€”something that has to be done twice a year when there are so many other things to be considered. I hope that the specific responsibility for annual reports being given to the legislation committees will see that task given a little more importance, especially with the way in which under the new budget system the annual reports will effectively be the agenda for the additional estimates meetings of legislation committees in, I think, November. So I suspect that with departments and budget dependent agencies the examination of annual reports will be done in relation to the estimates.

          There is always the opportunity at other times of the year for committees to review annual reports of departments and agencies in a calm and considered way and not have to do it only at the time of estimates hearings. One of the negatives in the past about the estimates process has been the pressure on government members not to participate any more than they feel they have to in the questioning of departments and budget dependent agencies at estimates hearings because of the pressure of time.

          I support Senator Bourne in her drawing attention to the possibility of having participating members of both streams of committees. The concept for this came out of the knots that the opposition tended to get itself tied in by substituting people for particular departments at estimates because there were a lot more opposition members available to serve on committees than there were positions. The introduction of the term `participating member' allows for all senators, but particularly opposition senators and those from the minority parties, to almost self-nominate to be a participant in a committee because they are interested in that subject and not just because they are needed to be one of their party's numbers in the prescribed full membership of the various committees. There is no reason why government senators might not occasionally take advantage of this opportunity as well, but I do recognise that it is more likely to occur in relation to non-government senators.

          â€”If Senator Panizza had listened to me a moment ago, he would have heard me explaining one of the reasons why the pressure is on government senators to get the process over with and not to participate as much as they might like to on some occasions. I suggest that this is a benefit to most people in the chamber. It might reduce the pressure to be elected a member of a committee if there is the opportunity, for a particular inquiry or a particular part of a legislation committee's function, to have participating membership, which can be listed with the formal listing of a committee. For those who want recognition back in their states that they have a relevance to a particular inquiry, it can be recorded that they are a participating member and not just a visitor to a particular inquiry.

          I draw attention to clause 8 of this proposed standing order about the appointment of subcommittees, which once again has not been used as much in the past as it might have been. What this allows is also relevant to the participating member concept; that is, there might be a subcommittee of a committee of the bare three members as prescribed here but on which there might be two, three or four participating members as well because that is their particular interest. There is no need to change the membership of the committee in order to allow for their involvement. The formal subcommittee is there for the formal process but there can be quite a large number of participating members if that is what senators want.

          The other important thing about emphasising this subcommittee operation and the relevance of participating members is that that should reduce the need for so many select committees to be appointed. We have had ideas for select committees partly because of those proposing them wanting to have the chair of them and to have the main carriage of the process. Now that it is proposed that the chairing be shared and that there be emphasis on subcommittees and participating members, the need for there to be a separate select committee should be reduced. I think every time there is a suggestion that a particular issue be referred to a select committee, the proposer should think carefully. If there is a specific committee of the Senate already in existence with the responsibility for that portfolio, and if there is someone with a particular interest in it who can be added to that committee as a participating member, that process should be followed, rather than clogging up the system with yet another select committee.

          One final matter is the question of the secretariats. The proposal is that the secretariats, as they currently stand, jointly service both the references and legislation streams of committees so that the expertise that exists in those committees can be fully used. Some members of those secretariats are particularly keen on, and expert in, administration, in making sure that things work smoothly and liaising with departments, such as in the estimates process. If it is their wish to specialise in that area, they can do so and be of more service to the legislation stream than to the references stream.

          Others are more suited to research and writing. They would tend to specialise more in the references committee of that area. As well, it allows for a variety of work for those who should be given experience in both areas. I hope that the proposed system is welcomed by the various committee secretariats. I suspect that it should be easier for the Senate administration overall in not having so much to re-shuffle resources amongst committees as workloads vary because the workload of the combined references and legislation committee of each set of portfolios should be of a similar order.

Indeed, it is an enhancement of the effectiveness of the Senate and the parliament of Australia. Certainly, this will not mean any diminution, any taking away of powers, of the estimates committees, the legislation committeesâ€”sometimes referred to as Friday committeesâ€”or references committees, the national inquiries that have been so effective over the last 25 years, carried out by seven, sometimes eight, standing committees.

          This measure will not diminish the review by committees of annual reports. It will not diminish the scrutiny committees or, indeed, the house committees of the Senate. The motion that is before us provides a strengthening and maturing of the Senate committee system in all of these respects that we have come to know over the last 25 years. Not all parliaments in the world have a committee system. Some parliaments operate in such a way that all of their business is transacted by the chamber as a whole. But it is a more sophisticated and much more effective way for a parliament to operate when even up to half of its business is conducted by small sections of the members of the chamber as a whole. We call those small sections committees. So the development of a committee system whereby many activities can be undertaken at the same time, where the committees are given their work by the chamber as a whole and where the committees report back to the chamber as a whole is a sophisticated way for a parliament to operate.

          The Australian parliament has, I believe, an unsurpassed committee system. In terms of the two chambers, the Senate has the most developed committee system of all. What we are doing by proposing this motion today, which I hope will be passed todayâ€”and I will curtail my general remarks to that endâ€”is to make it very clear that this Senate is in the business of being at the front edge of effective parliaments in the world and of ensuring that we are refining a very, very good instrument that has been developed in the last 25 years. In referring to the last 25 years, let me quote from the authoritative book
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         What we are moving on from is an endorsement of the legislative and general purpose standing committees and estimates committees that were established 25 years ago and modifying that provision which stated that each committee was to be chaired by a government member. At the time when this was introduced my party happened to be in the majority in the Senate. It was during the Menzies era and its successors, when the Liberal and National parties were in the majority for most of that time, not only in the House of Representatives but in the Senate.

          The argument for specialisation, for enhancing the work of parliament through committees, was proposed from all sidesâ€”by the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party and the independent party at that time, the Democratic Labor Party. But when they came to set up a powerful committee system, it was obviously understood by government membersâ€”my colleagues in the Liberal and National partyâ€”that whereas in the chamber there was a majority of government members at any time, these committees might do critical work that would provide a block or cause some damage or delay to government legislation and government decisions. Therefore, the Liberal and National party majority only agreed to the creation of this committee system if it were controlled at every point by a government member. Whatever the numbers were in the Senate in the future, there was an undertaking that the government of the day would have control. Therefore, all committees were to be chaired by government members and the government member chairman would have a casting vote in any decision. So in any crunch situation the government would always have a majority and would therefore have control.

          What we are moving to now is the kind of maturity which Australia is ready for, whereby the control of the Senate committee system is by the Senate itself, but where the chairmanship of particular committees is in the hands of senators in a manner which is directly proportional to the composition of the Senate as elected by the Australian people. No longer will there be a predominance of government members. Accordingly, out of the 40 committees that have existed to this time, there will be a distribution of chairmanships as nearly as possible proportional to the numbers of government, opposition, independent and minority party senators. That is one of the major steps forward in sophistication and maturity that we are now putting in place through the motion moved by Senator Ray.

I do not want to divert for a moment from the intention of this motion to change the structure of the committees, but I simply wish to comment on the naming of the committees. I understand how this has come about. The economics committee, which will deal with references, will cover the industry, science and technology portfolio. Currently, the standing committee on industry, science and technology has before it a reference on CSIRO. I am a little concerned as to how witnesses from CSIRO or the science departments of universities will be encouraged to come forward to a committee that is now called an `economics committee'. They will need some encouragement because they will look at this committee and say, `This has really nothing to do with what I am concerned about.'

          I wonder whether in the deliberations which will go on over the next few months we could give some consideration to a subtitle to the economics committee which would pick up the title of the existing committeeâ€”namely, the industry, science and technology committee. Communications was recently added to that committee too, but I notice that communications has now gone into a committee on environment, recreation, communications and arts.

          I think there should be some reference to both technology and science in these committees. In recent years, we have had a number of very important references before that committee. I think it would be a pity if those terms were lost from the titles of the committees. I simply make that point in passing. I do not seek to move any amendments, but I hope that it is something that will be taken on board in further deliberations as this new committee structure evolves.

          It is important to note the changes particularly to the legislation committees. The functions of those committees are really functions of the Senate as a wholeâ€”for example, on estimates committees. The debate in the committee of the whole is now assisted by the work of the estimates committees. Those estimates committees examine the estimates which are proposed by the various government departments for the purposes of the legislation currently before us. That aspect of the legislation committee, of course, assists the functions of the Senate committee of the whole. Again, the function of the consideration of any bills, including draft bills, to be referred to the legislation committees is also a function of the Senate as such.

The way that this motion is drawn up, however, says that participating members may be appointed to the committees. At the present moment, so far as the work of these committees is concerned with the consideration of estimates and draft billsâ€”like the Friday committeesâ€”I can notify the chairman, go along to the committee hearings as an individual senator and ask questionsâ€”as I would have been able to do if the functions were being performed by the committee of the whole.

The general intention of the changes, as I understand itâ€”and I believe it has been well fulfilledâ€”is to make it easier for senators to take part. As a result, we have the changing nature of quorums and the ability of the committees to sit while the Senate is sitting. A number of changes make it easier for senators to take part in the hearings of the committees.

It would be a matter of great concern if that happened. A fair reading of the changes shows that it will be easier for senators to take part.

          This is a fundamental reform of the Senate committee system. I suspect that it is arguably the most far-reaching reform that has taken place since the system was originally established some quarter of a century ago. There is a need for further changes in the system. For a variety of reasonsâ€”some of which were touched on by my colleague Senator Hillâ€”aspects of the committee system are not working particularly well at the moment and there is a need to look at arrangements to reinvigorate the system. At the same time, the Senate has shown a willingness to have a close look at its procedures to see how they can be improved.

I do not think they have gone quite as far as I would have wanted, but nonetheless there has been a willingness to try to put pressure on the government to take question time more seriously and give more answers.

          There has been a greater use of select committees. These changes have been important. One of the things that has an influence on meâ€”and maybe on othersâ€”is that the executive dominance of the House of Representatives has become greater and greater. An important change that has occurred in this parliament is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) no longer sees it necessary to attend every question time. That is an important change which I do not think has applied to any other parliament in the history of this nation. There is a mood among the public that parliament has to function more effectively. While the other place is reeling under the ruthless use of numbers by the executive it is not surprising that the system changes elsewhere to try to encourage a greater accountability by the government.

          Why is this a radical change? With the changes in the chairs of committees, the balance of incentives has been altered. We do not want to think ill of our opponents, but if one is a government chair of a committee it is not in the interests of the government or the Senate to pursue with great vigour a contentious issue which may cause embarrassment to ones colleagues and the government. I do not say that that has happened, but on the incentives basis there is not that need or desire to get out and investigate issues which may well cause some difficulty to the government.

          On the other hand, as non-government senators will now be chairing committees there is more incentive for those people to show their spurs and to show what an effective committee system can do. This will cause a reinvigoration of the Senate committee system and a reassertion of what most people would understand to be the role of the parliament. We will act more effectively as a parliament. When we look back on this after a decade I will be surprised if we do not see this as radical reformâ€”reform which will have major effects. It will cause problems to this government and to subsequent governments. Any change in the parliamentary system which requires governments to be more accountable has that effect.

Senator Coulter spoke earlier about the composition and allocation of portfolios to the various committees and the naming of the committees. In reading through the report, I can see that the allocation of portfolios and departments particularly suits estimates committees and legislation references because, to a certain degree, they are virtually categorised under the various ministers as they represent those various portfolios. I can understand the reasoning behind that.

He and I both happen to be on that committee whilst it deals with a particular reference. That committee, particularly, receives many references. It is to be subsumed with an economics committee which deals with treasury matters and industrial relations, which I do not believe are necessarily closely related matters.

In relation to reference committees, where there is generally by the end of the day a good deal of agreement and a report is printed which is generally agreed to by all members taking part in that committee, I think it would be a pity if a number of participating members or any one particular senator should choose to use participating membership of the committee to do a bit of kite flying which is in direct contradiction to the views of the participating nominated members of that committee who have been able to produce a unanimous report.

I am sure there will be no disagreement amongst those opposite in the power sharing with the division of these particular references! But if they cannot agree, we will use our numbers and sort it out for them.

          At this stage, before I depart and before I get ruled out of order, I would like to give a procedural highlight. We have another eight items to consider. When we conclude this item and I leave the chamber, Senator Schacht will move them in toto. I understand that there are two amendments which have been circulated.

          The government has listened to Senator Harradine's amendment; this is the one to delete the reference. We are not signed up for it. Senator Bourne may move it on Senator Harradine's behalf or he himself may move it. We do not see the necessity for it, but we certainly would not divide over it. We can see some merit in it, some against.

          The second is an opposition amendment about, really, the government responding to minority reports and/or all others. We have never been keen about this. We again will not divide on it. However, I want to put down for the record that, if this is carried, we will try to abide by it. But if it is totally abused, if 15 participating members all turn up and put in their own individual dissenting reports, we will only respond to each of those with no comment and we then would have formally met the request. Obviously, we will not do it in terms of genuine minority reports because, let us face it, I suspect that on a lot of these reference committees the minority reports will be by my good colleagues over here. We would want to also perhaps commend them for the hard work they have done. For the record, the government will attempt to abide by this particular item, unless it is abusedâ€”and then we will give it lip service. In terms of the rest of the matters, I have not detected another amendment around the chamber.

          â€”The Australian Democrats have occasionally in the past dropped into committees and claimed great credit for all sorts of matters arising therefrom. I am concerned that someone can simply turn up to a committee, participate in a very minor way and then have the right to attach to the relevant report conclusions and recommendations of that member. I really think that is overdoing it.

          If somebody who is not a member of the committee nevertheless turns up and participates, and if that senator has a different view that he or she wants to put to that of either the majority or the minority of the members, then I think he or she has the opportunity to do it in the chamber rather than having a separate addendum under his or her name added to the committee's report. I really think that is unnecessary and takes it one step too far. I am going to suggest that those few words be removed from the proposed amendment to standing order 38.

         I want to draw attention to only one matter, and that is the starting date of 10 October 1994. The Procedure Committee, with its great concentration on all the other issues, did not actually agree on a date. I think this date is based on the work done by the Clerk of the Senate on when he can get the staffing, the standing orders reprinted, et cetera. This is not a date that has been intruded by the government. The fact is that we have not given it a lot of thought, so we will accept this one. There is no devious motive in the starting date being 10 October 1994.

          Proposed standing order 26, paragraph (2), omit the paragraph.The reason for this amendment was brought to my attention by Senator Harradine, and I believe he is right. As far as looking at estimates goes, we see no reason why committees should not be able to call for persons and documents, because it can be done in any of their other functionsâ€”it can be done in reference committees and legislation committees. We see no reason why it cannot be done in estimates committees.

          The point has been made to me by Senator Robert Ray that the primary responsibility for answering questions in estimates committees is with ministers, and that all questions should first be addressed to them because of that. If a minister then wishes to get advice from one of his or her officersâ€”it is mostly `his', unfortunatelyâ€”he or she will do that. I agree with that. I think that is a reasonable thing that happens at the moment and I expect and hope that that will continue to happen. But I still see no reason why legislation committees, in all their forms, should not be able to call for persons and documents to be examined.

          â€”I support Senator Bourne's amendment and wish to add one point. Clearly, in these committees the government will have the chair and the numbers. Obviously, the government will not be calling for persons if those personsâ€”for example, members of a departmentâ€”are to be called before a committee to have a spotlight put on them. I do not think that that is what estimates committees are for in any event. But if that thought had occurred to anybody, the fact that the government has the majority on those committees will obviously ensure that that will not take place. Indeed, I do not think it would take place anyhow because of the responsible attitude that other members of those committees have. I agree with the point made that ultimately it is the minister who has the responsibility. The ministerâ€”not the public servantâ€”is the person with ministerial responsibility, answerable to the parliament, and should act appropriately. So I see no reason why these committees should not have the same power as any other committee under standing order 25.

As I understand it, going way back to when the estimates committees were first established, it was clear that, firstly, the government would have a majority on estimates committees and, secondly, ministers were there to answer the questions. That is the way it should be. If we take Senator Hill's view that officers can answer questions of their own volition and they get it wrong, who is responsible? In the end, the responsibility has to stop somewhere. As Harry Truman said, the buck stops ultimately with the minister for good, better or indifferent reasons.

This was discussed and considered at Procedure Committee meetings. I believe that Senator Hill was present at those meetings. I think he is a little confused by what I said previously. I said that I did not want to see the occasion ariseâ€”and the possibility is thereâ€”of a participating or indeed a full member of any committee turning up with a dissenting or minority report, not having participated in the hearings by questioning witnesses, not having attended public and private committee meetings or perhaps having attended only one meeting.

Senator Coates, as chairman, did this for me when we had the finance and public administration inquiry into the then Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

If there is a unanimous report from members of the committee, it would be clear that one participating member attaching a minority comment would be in the minority.

          If there is a minority report and a majority report and one of the participating members says, `I happen to agree with the minority report,' that again is an indication to those looking at the report of relative interests. Senators may recall that I suggested we actually do away with the terms `majority' and `minority' reports and just call them reports of the committeeâ€”report A, report B or whateverâ€”and let people judge their weight by the numbers of people signing them. I did not get my way on that, so I accept the agreement that there be the ability to have majority and dissenting reports and the ability for participating members, whether they be from the minor or major parties, to be associated with the majority or minority reports or to put in their own particular comments.

What she is saying is: rather than make a change to that now, let us see how it works out and if there is abuse by people putting themselves in as participating members but not really participating, maybe in the future we will change it to overcome that abuse. If there is an abuse by participating members who are there very nominally and just want to attach their own comments for the record, then that will be regarded appropriately in that light.

As I have just lost in the last debate, I continue with the original wording of the circulated copy of this amendmentâ€”which I guess demonstrates that I did not have a lot of confidence in the numbers in the last debateâ€”that the government also respond to a matter added to the report by a participating member of the committee.

          Senator Robert Ray has responded that, although he would have preferred this amendment not to be there, nevertheless, if it is carried, the government will respect the substance of it and look to respond to the minority report. That is not an unreasonable obligation to expect of the government, particularly as the committees will still have a government majority. There is the possibility that that government majority may well not cover matters that demand answers from the government; therefore, in many ways, the minority report might be the part that requires answers rather than the majority report. It is a sensible reform to the changes we are making today. I trust that the Senate as a whole will recognise it as such.

          â€”The Australian Democrats agree with Senator Hill's amendment. It is a very sensible reform. Senator Robert Ray made the point earlier in this debate that in some casesâ€”on reference committee reports in particularâ€”the minority and dissenting reports may well be government reports, and he is sure that they would be very interesting. I am sure all of them would be very interesting. It has been a pity that in the past this has not happened. I do not believe it would be abused; I certainly hope not. We certainly undertake not to abuse it. It is important that the government responds to all points of view in this chamber. I hope it will do that in the other chamber, too. But, yet again, the Senate will lead the way on something and the House of Representatives may follow.

          â€”I want to mention two other matters that flow from the changes that are about to be made and this is the only opportunity to do so. The first concerns the transition and how existing references will be dealt with. I want to put on the record how I think they should be dealt with. Obviously there are some major inquiries that are part heard. We will now have new committees in some instances covering a different mix of portfolios. No doubt, there will be changes in the composition of the committees.

          The changes we are about to make will require a new committee to continue with a reference that had been given to what is described as a predecessor committee. It becomes obvious that, if there are inquiries that are not concluded after 10 October, the new committees will take on where the old committees left off. However, it would obviously be unwise if it were the new members that took on that responsibility because they would not have heard the evidence that had been put. I presume, therefore, that as a matter of practice we will adopt the facility that will be provided to appoint substitutes for any particular matter before a committee. The substitutes in this instance would be those who constituted the committee that had been taking evidence under the old system. That is certainly how I envisage we would adapt to the transition.

          Some of these inquiries are obviously very important. There is the inquiry into the CSIRO which particularly interests me. It is taking a lot of complex evidence and it would be a nonsense if a new committee composed of new people had to try to pick up where the old committee had left off. I am not sure whether that was intended by the draughtsman of these changes, but certainly that is the way I interpret that they should be implemented.

          The second matter is that the number of chairs has been approximately determined on a basis to better reflect the number of parties and independents within this chamber. Reference to the `Leader of the Government' determining those numbers refers to the government of the dayâ€”that is, the ALP. In the event of what we anticipate will happen at the next electionâ€”that the government changesâ€”we are likely not only to be in government but also to have a significantly larger number of senators than the ALP opposition at that time.

          It has to be accepted that the formula is weighted in favour of the government, even though the government does not have the majority in this place. We have recognised that. Nevertheless, we have said that this document is a step in the right direction because there is an attempt to reflect the fact that the government does not control this chamber and that the chamber has a right to choose the chair of its committees. It is important to put the rationale for these numbers on the record at this stage because a reapplication of that rationale will be necessary after the next and following elections.

It is quite unequivocal that the Procedure Committee sought a distribution of chairs that was reflective of the composition of this Senate and that that would be a principle we would expect to see happen, whoever was in government.

          With regard to the numbers in the two main kinds of committees in each of the eight areasâ€”that is, eight members for the references committees and six members for the estimates and legislation committeesâ€”there is a composition whereby the government provides three members out of the eight members for a reference committee, the opposition provides four members out of the eight, and the minority parties and others provide one member. With regard to the six members of an estimates or legislation committee, the government provides three members, the opposition provides two members, and the others provide one member.

          If we wanted to be pedantic, one way to refine that to be more exact would be to allow in five of the eight committees four members and in three of the eight committees three members and such other complicated proportions that would have more directly reflected the exact mathematics of the distribution in the chamber. But, of course, we did not become pedantic; we did not go to that degree of detail in the matter that is just about to be resolved by the Senate. Rather, we took the broad principle that we were seeking a committee structure which would, overall, reflect the composition of the Senate through the distribution of chairs of committees. That principle must be acknowledged. In the future we will seek to uphold that principle, whatever the outcome of subsequent elections to the Senate and whatever the composition of the Senate. I say that in good faith, believing that to be the understanding of the Procedure Committee.

There are about 40 per cent of Liberals and eight per cent of Nationals and it will be interesting to see how many Nationals get chairs of those committees.

Although the basic proposal of sharing the chairs was not initially supported by the government, we recognised that as the package was pulled together we could get agreement on it.

I assume that there would be a getting together of the existing chairs, deputy chairs, the Democrat whip and whoever else, to identify the particular problems and arrange appropriate transitions. Some references which have barely begun on some committees can be taken over by new ones. There will have to be some sensible arrangements to ensure an appropriate distribution of the existing references and that members who have participated continue to participate appropriately.

         â€”The government does not support the amendments. Although Senator Spindler has an objective in mind, what he is proposing may have a number of unintended consequences. My advice is that the Service and Execution of Process Act does provide for interstate service of process issued by state and territory courts and tribunals but that it constitutes a very small proportion of process served in Australia. It does not, for instance, include process issued by federal courts or state or territory process that is served within the jurisdiction.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Putting that aside, there are many drafting problems with the amendments about which I have been informed. For instance, the words in the amendment `process to which this act applies' are not defined under SEPA. As a consequence, it could mean any process issued by a state or territory court or tribunal, since SEPA allows such process to be served. I am not sure that Senator Spindler wants to go that far. Even if he does, the reference to SEPA may have been used in this way to provide a constitutional nexus, and I am not so sure that that is something we should be going into without a broader consideration of all the issues involved. There are those sorts of unintended consequences.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Also, those words cannot refer to a process which has been served under SEPA because the amendment purports to prescribe alternative services, and so on. The other definitional problem relates to the words `process in relation to debt'. Those words are very broad and in fact would include subpoenas. However, from the related amendment it seems that the amendment is probably not intended to apply to cases where the protected person is sought as a witness. We have that confusion about the role of subpoenas. If the amendment is intended to apply to subpoenas, it is difficult to see why the words of this amendment are limited to a narrow range of proceedings. There are all sorts of unintended consequences which flow from amendment No. 6 in combination with amendments Nos 10 and 11. Because of that, the government does not support these three amendments.

        These amendments relate to the area of the commissioner obtaining identity papers and other documentation to protect the person placed under the witness protection program. The bill is silent at this stage on how that request is formally made and documented. In that processâ€”and I am sure that a certain custom has developed as well hereâ€”the commissioner is asking other departments, whether they be passport people or people in Social Security, to issue documents which on their face are not proper documents. They are not true documents. They are being issued to cover a false identity.

         These are the powers, as Senator Spindler is probably aware, that enable the commissioner to decide the circumstances under which he will make known to a court and to defence counsel information on the record of a protected witness giving evidence in a subsequent and further matter. I will not rehash the debate completely, but this matter has very serious consequences for an innocent citizen, if we are talking only about criminal matters, and for all citizens if we are talking about civil matters where the reliability of the witness concerned might be crucial to the conviction of a party or crucial to the success or loss of a civil claim with a financial consequence.

         The reliability of the witness might be crucial. It is all very well for us to sit here and say, `That would not happen very often, so that would be fine.' All I am suggesting is that the commissioner would have to report to the minister. Senator Spindler's proposed new subclause 28A(2) would mean that, in consultation with the commissioner, the minister would have to give some indication to parliament as to what had happened.

         I suspect that we will all find that the reports would indicate that nothing much happened, for quite a few years.

         It is short shrift to say to someone involved in those later proceedings, `Bad luck, you didn't get to test the veracity of a witness; that has cost you something because years ago we decided to have this witness protection program.' I do not think it will happen very often. Therefore, the reporting would hardly be onerous. It would probably be once every five or six years that the commissioner will have to make this decision. But I, for one, think the parliament ought to be interested when he or she does make that decision in later days and have an opportunity to see whether that power has been appropriately exercised.

        This amendment relates to the disclosure of the nature of the memorandum. We note with concern that as the legislation stands it will not be possible in a courtroom context for the nature of the protection given to the witness to be disclosed. That, to us, would appear to prejudice parties to that particular case before the court. We believe this problem needs to be dealt with.

         We are conscious, on the one hand, of the need to preserve confidentiality. On the other hand, we are concerned about the situation of a subsequent court case in which the still protected witness is a party. We feel that other parties to that court case could be disadvantaged unless we have some possibility of true evidence being provided, perhaps confidentially to the judge. I would appreciate hearing the minister's comments.

         That memorandum stated that there could well be incriminating material which could be used unfairly against the witness; the theme in that regard being that if people were to assist the court in giving evidence there would be no need for people to put their necks on the line and disclose a lot of other incriminating information. There is, of course, the age-old rule against self-incrimination.

         When one is dealing with people who have this shield behind which they can hide, Senator Spindler's concerns have some relevance, but if we let the memorandum of understanding or a summary of it be available for production it could be that there is some information which might be incriminating in another matter for the witness. So, by producing the information, all the dirty washing of the witness is laid bareâ€”dirty washing which might not be relevant to the case in point. I just flag that as a concern which might be considered in relation to Senator Spindler's proposed amendment.

They are the two conflicting issues that I see in this matter, and perhaps the government needs to tread a fine line between those two aspects.

A national program for the protection of witnesses has been long overdue, especially with the escalation of organised crime that we have seen in recent years. Whilst the majority of protected witnesses might involve organised crime, there are the odd occasions where a witness might need protection. There might be a witness who happened upon the scene and an accused person who is perhaps dangerous or has some connections who are of a shadier complexion in the community, we might say.

I raised the question earlier about a proposed witness being accepted and having to fill in a memorandum of understanding and, thereby, disclose incriminating information before that person is accepted onto the program. Furthermore, there may be a case where a person wants protection but is not taken onto the program. Whilst not having a public avenue of appeal, I think perhaps the government could keep an eye on how that is done and how that aspect of refusal is looked at. I appreciate the need for security there but, nonetheless, I think that is an important point.

         Clause 26A, which has now been inserted, goes some way to allaying the fears that I and others who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had, and that was that a participant in this program could subsequently appear in another proceeding and have shielded from the court his or her criminal record. I think the amendment proposed by Senator Vanstone in relation to the Democrats' amendment was a sensible one that provides some sort of ongoing review of how this discretion is exercised.

         Nonetheless, I put this warning to the Senate that if the commissioner decides that a record should not be released or made available then, of course, the exercise of that discretion will subsequently be made known to the ombudsman and the commissioner would report to the minister. That could be closing the gate after the horse has bolted and that could well be perhaps too late for a party to the previous proceedings who could well have used that record in a quite useful manner. I dare say if that did come to light that could be a ground of appeal for a retrial and I trust that is how it would be looked at. They are my concerns in relation to this bill.

Therefore, I add another caveat to my address on this bill.

         â€”In discussing the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill 1994, it is probably pertinent to go back to sometime earlier this year, or perhaps even late last year, when amendments were made by the minister to the burden of proof in police complaints and disciplinary matters. We were very concerned that that was an inappropriate change to make at that time. The burden of proof was lowered; that is, someone who wanted to be successful against a police officer had to show less in order to be successful.

         The Australian Federal Police felt somewhat at risk by that change, and they particularly felt at risk when they did not have a number of protections that they felt they needed: for example, protection from people making false complaints or giving false information. It is one of the easiest tricks in the book for people of criminal mind to make false complaints and unsettle a police officer and have him or her taken off an investigation. Apart from the cost, time and effort involved, it has an enormous impact on the officer and the investigation that he or she is undertaking at the time. I understand that the minister at the time indicated that appropriate changes would be made and that those protections would be put in place. Finally, we are very pleased to see a bill that does that.

         The bill extends its coverage to include non-sworn AFP staff, who are therefore no longer excluded from the complaints regime. The bill creates new offences of making a false complaint or giving false information, and victimisation of a complainant or a person assisting in the investigation of a complaint. The bill provides for investigations by the ombudsman's own motion, which is a good thing. The bill also provides that evidence obtained by the ombudsman in the course of an investigation is admissible in disciplinary hearings. The bill also abolishes the requirement that hearings of complaint based disciplinary charges be held before the disciplinary tribunal where the appointee charged pleads guilty. There is an option of a tribunal hearing if it happens to be in the public interest. There are other minor amendments.

         We are supportive of the bill, but we have some concerns and, for that reason, we would like the bill to be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The concerns were raised with us by the Law Council of Australia, and they are basically four in number.

         The second concern is that the complaint and any statement made by the complainant should be privileged from production in proceedings relating to separate criminal charges against the complainant, except, of course, if they are clause 6 charges, namely, making a false complaint.

         The rationale there is that police are entitled to do only what the legislation entitles them to do, and they are not entitled to go beyond that; and citizens should be not only entitled but encouraged to complain when those boundaries are overstepped. However, if in order to make that complaint people had to put themselves at risk by some activity they had undertaken, that would be a disincentive for them. We are not sure of the arguments on both sides. Therefore, we believe that it should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs so that the whole chamber can hear both sides of the argument.

         The Law Council also raises the interesting point that, with this new offence of making a false complaint or giving false information, it might be appropriate to say that before such a conviction can be sustained some of the material should be corroborated. The Law Council puts the view that, in a sense, this is very similar to a charge of perjury, which requires corroboration, and the policy considerations justifying independent confirmation of the allegations are the same. We have not made a decision on that, but it is an interesting point with respect to which we would like to hear the arguments on both sides.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, there is a little concern about the ability of the AFP to launch prosecutions under clause 6, that is, false complaint. We understand that there is a requirement to consult the ombudsman with respect to such prosecutions, but there is absolutely no obligation to take the ombudsman's advice. It may be that we should be saying that a prosecution of false complaint cannot be launched by the AFP unless the ombudsman has positively agreed that such a prosecution should be launched.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This works both ways. Just as someone with a poor motive can make a false complaint against a genuinely decent police officer, so a police officer who has in one way or another overstepped the mark and who simply believes that it cannot be proved might for reasons of malice or vindictivenessâ€”perhaps sending a message to people who want to make complaints against the policeâ€”launch a prosecution against that person. There is an interest on both sides to do the wrong thing, if you like, where there are people of bad faith. We do not think it is fair to assume necessarily that people of bad faith are only those who make the complaint; nor to assume that the people of good faith are only ever found in the AFP. Unfortunately, people of bad faith are found everywhere.

         Therefore, I think the arguments in favour of requiring the consent of the ombudsman before a prosecution should be launched are quite attractive, but I would like to hear the opposing arguments as well.

         For those reasons, we indicate that we are supportive of this bill and the changes it is making. We think the Law Council has raised some sensible concerns and we want the matter referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee for report on these matters. If, prior to the legal and constitutional affairs committee having a hearing on these matters, the government responds to these concerns in such a way that it satisfies ourselves and other parties interested in these concerns, we would be happy to cancel such a hearing and accept the changes. That might require a private meeting of the committee prior to public hearings to listen to what the government is prepared to offerâ€”if the government is interested in approaching it on that basis.

         The amendments in the bill arise out of an interdepartmental working group established in 1991. The working group produced a series of amendments that do not so much alter the policy principles of the act as eliminate certain anomalies and meet practical concerns arising out of the operation of the act since its commencement.

         The first of the major amendments is to extend the act's coverage to include non-sworn AFP staff.

         The third amendment gives the ombudsman the capacity to investigate on his or her own motion action by a member or staff member of the AFP. Currently, under the Ombudsman's Act 1976, the ombudsman can initiate investigations of administrative actions on his or her own motion. However, the principal act does not make the equivalent provision for the investigation of complaints against AFP members. This amendment will rectify this anomaly and is particularly welcomed by the Australian Democrats.

I place on record my appreciation for the constructive process of consultation that has been carried out since then between the AFP and the ombudsman's office with the result that these amendments are now in place.

         The fourth of the major amendments makes evidence obtained by the ombudsman in the course of an investigation admissible in disciplinary hearings.

         The final of the major amendments abolishes the requirement that hearings of complaint based disciplinary charges be held before the disciplinary tribunal where the appointee charged pleads guilty. In the working group process the AFP proposed that section 67(1) of the principal act should be amended to allow the AFP commissioner to determine cases arising from complaints where an AFP member pleads guilty. The AFP argued that the present procedures, which require that disciplinary proceedings arising from complaints be referred to the tribunal for rehearing, even where the accused pleads guilty, involve unnecessary delays and waste the time of the tribunal.

         The Attorney-General's Department, while accepting that there were problems with delay, argued that the present procedures had been consciously adopted in the legislation to ensure that the results of complaints investigations were sufficiently publicised and that the `concept of police judging police in complaints matters has been criticised by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody so that any attempt to expand the police role would be politically inopportune at present'. The working group therefore recommended that the principal act not be amended as proposed by the AFP.

         However, I note that in clause 16 the government has chosen to accept the AFP's arguments to the extent that it is a matter to be determined by the AFP commissioner as to whether the commissioner may deal with the matter or refer the undisputed charge to the tribunal. Significantly, however, in this situation, if the ombudsman does not consent in writing to the commissioner's decision the Attorney-General is required to direct how the proceeding will be dealt with. While we do not intend to oppose this provision, we note for the record the need to monitor its practical effectiveness and that it should be reviewed at some point in the future, if necessary.

It is more to do with our federalist system of government and states rights and Australia's sovereignty as opposed to what two people may or may not want to do in the privacy of their own bedroom. In particular, I refer to Margo Kingston's commentary in today's

         The second paragraph of her commentary makes the bold assertion that the Tasmanian laws allegedly deal with oral sex. Clearly they do not; there is a decided case in the Tasmanian Supreme Courtâ€”a decision of Mr Justice Underwoodâ€”which clearly says they do not. Yet for some reason best known to herself she makes that assertion. I know that assertion has been pedalled by certain other elements but clearly it is incorrect.

In case colleagues do not realise, what she did was quote my media release in full and for that I thank her. After quoting my release, she continues her commentary. With her assertive heading asking me to reconsider, I read with interest that there was no basis for me to reconsider and simply confirmed that the opposition to the views expressed was bereft of principle or logic.

         She attempts slight sarcasm by referring to me as a man `skilled in legal reasoning' who may be willing to reconsider some errors in his release. Let us consider them. She says the law of incest is completely untouched by the reform. I simply ask: how does she draw that conclusion? The Attorney-General's media release states:

         Where I have got one over Ms Kingston is in the capacity to think laterally and to interpret and consider the consequences flowing from changes to law or annunciations of a so-called unfettered right. It is interesting to note by implication that Margo Kingston would also continue to outlaw incest. On that, she and I are in agreement. The question arises, and I pose it: if there is this inalienable right to privacy, surely incest and drug taking in private ought to be decriminalised as well? There needs to be a consistency in the reasoning. What we need to comprehend is that the law is based on moral codes and principles. Because of that, there are obviously going to be disagreements.

There are no polls that show such a support for change other than polls commissioned by the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group. Its latest poll has shown a five per cent decrease.

         â€”The Green senator interjects and says, `How awful.' Let us talk about a truly independent and authoritative poll. The ABC and the University of Tasmania commissioned a poll recently. We could hardly call either of those bodies hotbeds of homophobics or states rightists. Those bodies commissioned the poll on a professional basis. It was a very illuminating poll. The questions asked included:

        Do you believe the current Tasmanian laws relating to homosexual acts are fair or unfair?

        The poll shows that 49.2 per cent believed they were fair, 46.1 per cent argued they were unfair and 4.7 per cent were unable to comment. The next question was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Do you think these laws should be changed?
       </para>
       <para>
        The poll shows that 50.7 per cent said no. Those who said that the laws ought to be changed were then asked:

        How should they be changed? Toughened or liberalised?

        Some of those who sought support for a change to the law were arguing that the laws ought to be toughened up. When that percentage is taken into account, 54 per cent of Tasmanians want the law to remain as it is.

        Do you believe the Commonwealth government should enforce the UN resolution on gay law reform if the Tasmanian government does not act?

       <para>
        The answer here was overwhelmingly against the federal government becoming involved at a ratio of more than two to oneâ€”that is, two-thirds of Tasmanians oppose federal intervention. I have quoted my source. I challenge Ms Kingston to quote her source. She of course conveniently does not do that in her article; she simply makes the bold assertion.

         Ms Kingston then deals with the question of Tasmanian democracy. She says that twice in the 1990s the Tasmanian lower house introduced and passed a repeal law that was then knocked back by the Tasmanian upper house. That is what happens with a bicameral system of parliament: that is the process of democracy. However, she failed to tell her readers that the government that introduced that legislation in Tasmania was swept from office by a landslide victory to the Liberal government which went to the people on a policy of retaining the current law. At the end of the day, that is democracy; is it not?

         I happen to believe that the people of Australia made a huge mistake at the last election by re-electing the Labor government, but I accept that. I did not run off and squeal to some international court saying, `I don't like the democratic process in Australia. I don't happen to agree with the result and I want you to overturn it.' This is a very real threat to our democracy. When the will of the people is overturned by an unelected group not responsible or accountable to the people, it provides fuel to the fire for those radical elements within our community who would like to see the overthrow of democracy, and who can point to issues such as this and say that they voted for a government that supports this type of legislation. Be it right, wrong or indifferent, they have elected this government but the democratic process has been subverted and therefore democracy has been undermined.

         There are some fundamental tenets of democracy. First, when the people make their decision collectively in an election, they are allowed to make the wrong decision. As I pointed out, the people of Australia made the wrong decision by re-electing the Labor government federally but we are stuck with it until the next election. The second fundamental tenet of democracy is that the people can change their parliament, their government. They can elect a new government to change the laws.

         In Tasmania, by February 1996 they will have had the opportunity to elect a new government on a policy of repealing these laws if that is what the people of Tasmania want. The third fundamental point of a democracy is that if a judiciary makes a ruling with which people disagree, then it can be overturned by legislation or referendum; but now, with the United Nations and its rulings, we in Australia can have 1,000 elections, we can have 2,000 referenda, and still not overturn the United Nations decision. According to international lawyers we cannot change the UN ruling and covenant without the consent of the world body. That is why I said it is an affront to an Australian democracy.

I ask the senators opposite, the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party: what is the difference between the United Nations and foreign countries in being unelected and unresponsive to the people of Australia? There is absolutely no difference. We would hardly call Gough Whitlam a homophobe or a states rightist, would we?

         â€”Today I will be talking about the issue of oil supply. The whole issue of energy conservation has been on government and international agendas for many years now. It has certainly been in an active form since the oil price shock of 1974 and the energy crisis when OPEC raised prices. Suddenly the industrial world had to come to terms with just how dependent we are on energy, and specifically on oil. Today we are more dependent than ever, and with far fewer options for new supply since the minor oilfields discovered after OPEC, including Bass Strait, have nearly all gone into decline. For many reasons, oil is priced at levels similar to those before OPEC was formed.

         Petroleum product use accounts for roughly 30 per cent of world energy use. In Australia it accounts for 37 per cent of total energy use and 49 per cent of energy end use. We are petroleum dependent. Our transportâ€”land, sea and airâ€”is virtually completely dependent on petroleum and uses over 30 per cent of end use energy. Our agriculture is highly mechanised and virtually totally dependent on petroleum products. Mining is almost entirely petroleum dependent. One reason that so much energy is used in transport is that production is heavily centralised and almost all our goods are transported over long distances. Our imports and exports are dependent, in terms of cost and competitiveness, on both energy content and transport costs. Petroleum also forms an important input in the production of fertilisers and plastics.

         Brian Fleay, an engineer and member of the Greens (WA) economic policy working group, and an associate of the Institute for Science and Technology Policy at Murdoch University, has just published a paper, `Liquid Petroleum is Peaking', which is of paramount concern to Australian society. In it he outlines the fact that the major issue of sustainability of oil supply is not whether it will run out, but whether supply factors will make it far more expensive. It is ultimately not the absolute supply of oil but the cost of oil which will determine our use, the cost of many of our products and the shape of global production.

         Oil is cheap at the moment. In fact, it is at one of the cheapest points in real terms since the oil crisis of 1973. This is mainly because of strong demand for currency in the Middle East in connection with the Gulf War, and the continued seller push on oil from the ex-Comecon nations. But many of the oilfields found since the energy crisis, such as the North Sea and Indonesian fields, are now running out. In addition, the low price of oil has meant that many oilfields have not had the investment which would allow the technical extension of their lifespan and production capabilities. This is likely to result in a situation where demand exceeds supply in the near future, and where any attempt to increase supply is likely to have a relatively high cost. As a consequence, the cost of oil itself is virtually certain to rise substantially over the next decade, due to market forces and the need for higher levels of investment in capital intensive technologies to extend the life of existing fields and develop more difficult fields such as those offshore.

         Brian Fleay's paper outlines the situation and notes the technical, economic and political factors that will lead to an inevitable, substantial and sustained rise in average oil prices. Such a situation would be devastating to the Australian economy unless we act with urgency to change the structural use of oil. While there are alternatives to oil, such alternatives for uses are few and are technologically undeveloped. The liquefaction of coal is not near being an economically viable alternative. The frequently promoted use of ethanol runs into major problems in trying to extend it to actual replacement of petroleum. It is great as an additive to substitute for lead, or even as an extender of petroleum, but the more ethanol that is needed, the more plant biomass is required. Attempts at large scale production run into problems with the use of arable landâ€”the use of mechanised farming and the long transport chainsâ€”and ultimately leads to soil depletion as nutrients leave the farm with plant resources.

         Basically, if people are going to grow fuel they have all the problems that exist in relation to agriculture. They would be less able to grow other crops. The long transport lines and dispersal of goods, as in agriculture and forestry, mean nutrients are transferred from the area of growing to the area of consumption, and are generally not returned. Australia continues to structure its cities, its transport systems and its economy on the basis of cheap transport, often privately owned. We are already experiencing problems with the high cost of infrastructure per capita due to the consequent urban sprawl. This is a micro-economic issue which consistently drives up rates and taxes, while making many alternatives such as recycling or public transport difficult. The high cost of roads and parking facilities to cope with private transport is another issue. This includes not only the cost of construction but the cost of maintenance year after year, and replacement and upgrading within 20 years.

         Brian Fleay's grim report outlines the problem in physical and engineering terms. It notes the economic consequences, but it does not attempt to present any solutions or link the situation strongly to patterns of use. Patterns of use are the other side of the equation. Australia is an extremely high user of oil per capita and per dollar produced. It has done almost nothing to improve efficiency at a time when most developed nations have made major efforts in this regard. We are constantly among the highest per capita producers of greenhouse emissions in the world; but it was economics, not greenhouse, that motivated other nations to take energy efficiency on board.

         The first oil shock, and subsequent ones, stimulated a move to increase energy efficiency and reduce oil dependency that has carried through until today. Concerns on price and balance of trade have been extended to concerns on pollution from various energy sources, especially cars. Cars have become far more efficient, but urban sprawl and industry have meant that they now go further than ever on a daily basis and need more roads. Massive centralisation of industry and agriculture has meant that agriculture is more dependent than ever on fuel. We have had the ridiculous situation where vegies grown on the Ord Basin are shipped by road to Perth and individually wrapped in plastic on styrofoam traysâ€”all of which are petroleum productsâ€”and then sent back on trucks to the stores in Broome and Derby. We have a situation where bricks are carted from Perth and Geraldton to Darwin, because the Northern Territory brickworks was closed down.

         With lead in petrol, we have now seen how long it takes to make even simple changes to the structures in place. Nearly 10 years after leaded petrol engines were banned in new cars, over half of the car fleet still uses leaded petrol. This is a simple technological change. To change to an entirely different fuel, especially if this requires the development of an entirely different technology, will take much longer. There is lag time in any response. On the other hand, we have seen how quickly oil prices can change. They can double overnight.

The fires have had an appalling effect on the area. I must say they have called into question the merit of the large volume of pine plantations that the Turkish government, for very sound reasons, had put in that area. Nonetheless, I want to say that my visit to Gallipoli was arranged by the Turkish authorities and I am very grateful to them for having done that. That visit took place in January and the hospitality was astounding. I am assured that all Australians who visit the area receive outstanding hospitality from the Turks. They regard the area as very important to their own history because it was as a result of Kemal Ataturk's successes there against the Allied forces that he was able to get the status to become the most outstanding Turkish leader of modern times, and to revolutionise that nation and bring it forward so dramatically into the 20th century.

It employs 10,000 territorians, generates nearly $600 million for the economy, and attracts almost one million visitors per year.

The masterplan, which was launched by the Northern Territory Minister for Tourism, Mr Barry Coulter, in May of this year, establishes a framework for government and industry decision making through to the year 1999. It sets directions for the development of facilities and services and lays the foundation for a more vigorous and diverse industry that will extend its benefits throughout the territory.

        The masterplan calls on the territory to capitalise on its natural resources and, not surprisingly, it highlights the importance of parks and reserves to territory tourism.

They are to encourage Aboriginal people to become involved with tourism in the Northern Territory by sharing their vibrant culture with interested visitors; to ensure that Aboriginal people enter the tourism market at their own pace and survive in the market; to ensure high quality experiences for people interested in Aboriginal cultural tourism; and to capitalise on the growing global interest in indigenous cultures.

The tyranny of distance, for example, means a greater role for government in transport development. The

         Communications are going to change vastly from now on. The world, which up to this point has been wired by copper, is rapidly being wired by optic fibre.

         The potential of the roll-out in Australia of the optic fibre network is enormous. Currently we have our two major communication companies, Telecom and Optus, rolling this out at a very rapid rate. We will have much more information in this country available as a result. We will have better computer links within the country and with countries overseas, particularly into the system known as Internet. This is the interconnection in America of 30,000 different computer networks. Australia is now linked into that and is the fourth largest user in the world of that system. So we are well placed, not only for computers, but for more faxes, TV signals, radio signals and interactive television.

         Just think of the implications if, all of a sudden, people can stay at home in the suburbs and do their work. If they are in rural and regional Australia, they would not have to move to the cities to work, they could work by telecommuting from home. This has enormous implications for the structure of society, for the way we develop our cities and the way we develop our roads and expressways. Just think of the implications also for things like less pollution and less congestion and the improvement in the efficiency of the economy overall. With telecommuting, the location of businesses is no longer as important. It is a chance for Australia to get rid of what was coined by Geoffrey Blainey and called `the tyranny of distance'. It gives regions the chance to attract new business without the old disadvantage of distance being such a great problem.

         Probably the most revolutionary change this coming new information age will bring to Australia is what can happen in the home. At the moment, we have got a copper wire going into our homes and this will bring in computing services and telephones. We can actually do some low level television with copper wire, particularly with the new ABSL technology. With the new system which combines optic fibre and coaxial cable, one can have a situation where the husband is watching football on cable television, his wife might be working on an office related task, the son could be a participant in an interactive video game and the daughter might be downloading research material from a major library to do an assignment. Another family member could be calling up a video on demand. This gets rid of going to the local video store; people can actually call up the particular video they want at the time they want with this technology. This is all on one cable. This is not very far away in Australia. What I am talking about will be here in the next five to 10 years.

         The great opportunity of going to America to look at what they were doing was really an opportunity to look at the way they are structuring it and, indeed, to learn some of the lessons. One of the things that struck me about America in the information age is the way in which the issues that come out of the information superhighway are a matters of very high level debate. They discuss matters such as privacy; they discuss the intellectual property rights of people. A whole series of issues about the creation of new businesses, and the proper regulatory framework to bring that about, are not yet being discussed at any great length in this country.

In America, they are changing the regulatory structure to take into account the converging technologies in this area. What we now know as radio, as television, as a computing industry will all start to merge into one industry. What we know as a telephone, a television and a computer screen will all merge into flat screen technology.

They are wiring up whole towns and cities just to see how people are going to use this technology. I was in Silicon Valley and one section of Silicon Valley, called Smart Valley, is being wired up. Over the other side of the country in Florida they are wiring up the whole city of Tampa. Are people going to shop from home? Are they going to demand video to the level that we think?

         Looking at Australia's position in relation to this, we are very well placed. We are not debating the issues that we should be at this point, and I hope what I am saying today is one small contribution to the kick-off and continuation of that debate. But we do have a position in this country that places us well in terms of the development of the structure of this industry. The Americans are very tied up in a regulatory web that covers not only the federal level but also all states which have a say in the communication industries. We do not have the problem. We have one set of federal laws so it makes it simple. They have an enormously complex industrial structure for rolling out this information superhighway.

If that is the case, they will make a lot of money out of it and we will not. That has all sorts of implications for our economic growth, for our jobs and for our foreign exchange. The potential is there for Australia to create a whole range of new industries to put on the information superhighway. I can give you one example: home publishing. If you have ever published a book, you will find 90 per cent of the profit goes to the publishing company. The information superhighway provides the opportunities for you to set up and publish books from home, put it on the information superhighway. For someone ordering your book, it can be actually downloaded in the store, printed in the store. To give you an example,

That piece of information has been available not only to me but to every other senator in this chamber. It is a fact as evidenced by the losses that have been accurately published in the press.

         I do not suppose that Senator Gibson reads the trade papers but, as well as that public information in the company's accounts disclosing those losses, there has been widespread publicity in the maritime trade papers over a period of years now about the difficult performance of ANL. What should be pointed out to Senator Gibson and what he should be aware of is that when the government inherited this company in 1982 and Mr Morris became the ministerâ€”this is also a matter on the public recordâ€”the company was then in a hopeless financial position. It was hundreds of millions of dollars on the wrong side of the ledger. In addition, it had a fleet of 33 decrepit ships.

         Over a period of a decade the government installed a new board, which drastically restructured the company, and downsized and re-equipped its fleet from the 33 ships that existed in 1982. In 1982 the company was hopelessly bankrupt. As I advised the Senate, not just yesterday but on many previous occasions, in shipping terms there was not a recession internationally but a depression in the 1990s in world shipping. Because of the downturn in trade, shipping, as I advised the Senate at the time, was one of the industries that copped the downturn first. In the core trades in which ANL has been operatingâ€”that is, the European trade and the North East Asian and South East Asian tradesâ€”the competition has been fierce. The margins have not just simply been low but there have been no margins in terms of the freight rates that are being offered because of the significant surplus of shipping internationally.

This government embarked simultaneously on not simply a total restructuring of the company and a drastic downsizing and re-equipping of the fleet from the decrepit condition in which Senator Alston's predecessors left it, but a very ambitious and, I might add, successful program of both shipping and waterfront reform in which ANL played a key role.

         Regrettablyâ€”and this is a matter of public record in the Senate and everywhere elseâ€”because of what was an international depression in terms of the downturn in trade, one of the industries that copped it hardest, for obvious reasons, was the shipping industry. As I told the Senate yesterday, and as I have previously advised the Senate, ANL was far from being alone in this. The international liner trade provides 70 per cent of the core business of ANL. Almost every shipping company in the world far larger than ANL was copping significant losses over the same period. But those companies were in a better position to sustain those losses than was a small company like ANL.

Government announcements from 1991 until now have indicated the progressive changes that have been made to ANL by this government in the hope that the international shipping situation would have improved sufficiently for the company, restructured as it has been, to take advantage of that.

On what basis did the government repeatedly promise in budgets from 1991-92 onwards to sell it? What figures did the minister include in the budget by way of proceeds for asset sales or, really, has it not been worth anything for 10 years back?

They have been reviewed consistently, and consistently been found to be efficient and effective. Each time they are reviewed there are suggestions about how the administration might be tidied up in minor ways and those things are done, as they will be again as a result of this review, but overall they continue to say that the schemes are worthy of continuation and support.

         The most recent evaluation was an independent evaluation conducted by, amongst others, Price Waterhouse with the assistance of Professor Bulley, econometrician and head of the Department of Economics at the University of New South Wales. They concluded that the schemes are effective in assisting Australian businessesâ€”and, in the case of EMDG, as I said, particularly small to medium businessesâ€”to export. That is important for those businesses. It is important for jobs that are created in those businesses and for the flow-on effect to our balance of payments and to other employment.

         In the case of EMDG, over 70 per cent of the 3,000-plus claimants in 1993-94 were small to medium businesses. The report assessed that, of those claimants, those who are mature exporters generate 15 to 25 times the grants paid in export income as a result of the grant. That is certainly good news in terms of the balance of payments and, most importantly, jobs. In relation to those claimants, on the basis of this assessment it can be established that exporting activity accounts for 50 per cent of their jobs and 50 per cent of their investment. It seems on that basis to be a niche that needs to be filled and a role that deserves to be played.

Therefore, on the basis of those reports, the government decided in the white paper to extend both EMDG and ITES because of their export significance and, therefore, because of their employment significanceâ€”the core of the government's white paper intention and initiative.

         When the cabinet visited Perth, I went to see members of a company of interest to Senator Evansâ€”Bates Saddlery in Newcastle Street, Perth. They spoke of the tremendous benefits they have received over the years from EMDG and, most recently, from ITES, funding them to launch a new range of saddles which is expected to generate about $19 million in additional sales over the next five years, allowing them to increase their employment by 25 per cent over the same period. Already over the past year export success on the basis of their assistance has led to 20 new jobs, plus all the indirect employment that their success creates.

         The government recognises that the PNGDF has a legitimate and useful role to play on Bougainville, a point that was acknowledged in the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation which, under Senator Loosley's chairmanship, visited Bougainville in April this year.

         There is no reason to believe that it will stall that process. Prime Minister Wingti, with whom I discussed the matter at the South Pacific Forum in Brisbane a couple of weeks ago, said that he remained firmly committed to pursuing a process of dialogue with Bougainvilleans. In a recent press statement following the Panguna operation, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Chan reiterated this position by stating that the Bougainville crisis could not be solved by military means alone. He said that the government was still fully committed to ending the suffering and destruction on Bougainville through the concerted process which began in June for a peace settlement between all concerned Bougainvillean groups and the national government.

Each one of those operations, while it has to be judged on its merits, is judged by us in an international context rather than by reference to immediate Australian defence needs. We certainly do not apply any kind of regional check list of relevance or considerations of that kind.

         The whole situation in Somalia is obviously under very close review at the moment. It is distressingly the case that there has not been any significant progress and, in fact, some deterioration in the political situation on the ground since about March this year. Up until then, there was quite a high level of optimism prevailingâ€”which I certainly shared as a result of a visit I made a few weeks earlierâ€”that Ali Mahdi, General Aydid and the rest of the people involved could find a way through the political impasse and create a government or some form of political process that could manage a peaceful transition.

         It is against that background that the continued Australian involvement will be measured. In the sense of being operationally crucial for the UN presence, only one significant component of the Australian force is thereâ€”the air traffic controllers. It may be, however, that even that element is capable of replacement with locals now, as a result of training that has been taking place over recent months. The decision that we make when it is made will be against that total background. I do not think I can add anything further.

That is an operational criterion more in the familiar traditional peacekeeping context than the humanitarian intervention context which was, of course, that which motivated us and took us and the rest of the international community into Somalia. A traditional peacekeeping operation is when you have a political agreement which is capable of implementation over some finite time and you are there to monitor, supervise and see its implementation.

         Beyond that, the other answer is that, having made the commitment for a particular finite duration, it needs pretty extreme circumstances to make any country renege on that. Our name would not be worth much in the international community if we turned tail just because we made a different assessment as to the course of events that have unfolded since we made the original commitment. The Australian commitment was not open ended in character; it was time limited. In the context of that time limitation, we will be making an appropriate decision.

As Senator Reynolds points out, it offers an unparalleled opportunity for the world to focus on and find solutions to a range of critical issues facing humanity. Australia will be one of 180 countries taking part. Our delegation will be working closely with the other countries to achieve international consensus. Our first objective in Cairo will be to work vigorously for international consensus on a program which is forward looking, action oriented and achievable.

In this context it is also worth noting that one of our objectives is to promote access to the widest possible range of safe, effective and acceptable family planning services to enable both women and men, as a right and a responsibility, to choose the number and spacing of their children; and to reduce the maternal and infant mortality associated with high risk pregnancy.

        Throughout the past 10 years ANL has been a disaster. Despite the fact that there has been a significant board shake-up in earlier years and a capital injection by the taxpayer of $160 million, it has failed to be competitive. ANL has never been internationally competitive, and it has accumulated enormous losses.

         I have looked at the accounts of ANL which show that in 1991-92 there were losses of $9 million; in 1992-93 there were losses of $8 million, and paper reports indicate that the indicative losses for this last year will be $24 million. We believe that ANL management has forecast losses of more than $50 million for the next three years. We can compare that with the Salomon Brothers-Price Waterhouse report which indicates that losses could be as high as $85 million for the next three years.

         â€”Thank you; I will be pleased to receive it. But let me point out to the Senate that on 30 June last year, just over 12 months ago, the balance sheet indicated the value of ANL was $158 million. Yet, according to the Salomon Brothers-Price Waterhouse report ANL has a current net worth of minus $75 million to minus $118 million. So in just over 12 months we have had a deterioration in the net value of up to $276 million. That is an enormous changeâ€”an absolutely enormous, disgraceful changeâ€”in just over 12 months, and this parliament deserves a detailed explanation as to how this could possibly have taken place.

         I think the reason for this enormous decline in value is obviously sheeted home to the government. It was reported in April this year that ANL management had written to the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) outlining a number of concerns it had about the way in which the government's asset sales task force was handling the sale conditions. One of the  concerns was that the board was forced to scrap the business rationalisation plans and that the government's interference was having a detrimental impact on ANL's relationship with its financiers. It is obvious that the minister did nothing to allay the fears of the previous board. Parliament deserves a full explanation of this appalling fiasco.

         This really points out that ANL has not been internationally competitive. The government should go on to explain not only how this mess came about but also what it is going to do about the shipping industry. The starting point for that is the recommendations recently given to the minister by the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. The virtual destruction of ANL, which we have had demonstrated to us this week, proves that governments cannot and should not get involved in businesses. It also proves that the Labor government cannot be trusted with taxpayers' money.

         Turnbull and Partners' recent involvementâ€”I referred to this earlierâ€”with another transport company, Australia Air, suggests that its advice might not be so valuable.

There seems to be a fundamental discrepancy between the maximum figure of $120 million on the one hand and $352 million on the other, and I would like an explanation for that.

         The report goes on to say that these accounting based measures bear no resemblance to Price Waterhouse's indicative market valuation of ANL, which is in fact negative $74 million to $117 million. That is saying that it can have gross assets, but negative net worth. That was the belief of Senator Collins in May, but he gave no indication of that in the budget papers. He simply purported to be selling a substantial part of ANL as though it was an asset of value when, in fact, he was selling something worthless. Was the government going to simply pay off the debt independently and then give itself an asset of value and sell that? That is a classic accounting exercise in legerdemainâ€”the government pretending that the company had made a profit while the government paid out a very substantial debt. I would like an explanation of the true position.

         With respect to the points that Senator Alston raised, the facts are that the 1993 accountsâ€”and perhaps he should avail himself of this documentâ€”received a completely unqualified audit report from the Australian National Audit Office. I think the audit was conducted in September or October last year and the government received a letter from the Auditor-General clearing the accounts of ANLâ€”an unqualified clearance of the accountsâ€”as being a true and accurate record of the financial position of the company. Those accounts disclose, as Senator Alston correctly said, a net asset value of $157.6 million. This is an accounting book value and has been noted in the due diligence evaluation by Price Waterhouse. These accounting based values bear no resemblance at all to an estimate of the market sale value assessed by the due diligence process.

         It is also worth noting in this respectâ€”and Senator Alston raised this figure today in question time as wellâ€”that the claim made yesterday in the House of Representatives by Mr Moore on which Senator Alston based his claim today, that ANL had a value in 1992 of $290 million, is absolutely wrong. Even the book value of ANL in June 1992 was only $167 million, not the $290 million that Mr Moore and Senator Alston both mentioned today. So I would certainly like to know where that figure came from.

         That is the reason for the difference. The value indicated in those accounts was a quite proper figure based on an operating company. Those figures were audited by the Australian National Audit Office, and the Auditor-General provided the government with a completely unqualified audit clearance in December last year. So that is the reason for that difference in the figures.

         That scoping study commissioned in 1992, which was part of the progressive movement that the government made on ANL over the last three years because of the deteriorating position of the company, did have a very wide ambit of values from both positive to significantly negative. The reason, quite simply, was that it was based on a whole range of different assumptions that could be made on a potential sale. The ANL company, like most other shipping companies, has a complex arrangement of joint ventures on particular trades, and stevedoring as well. The assumptions made on sale are based on the possible permutations of variations of that sale or sell-off, whichever is decided upon in the end, or a combination of both. And Senator Alston is quite correct when he says that the scoping study provided a very wide range of positive to negative values in 1992; but his claim that the company lost $290 million is just absolutely wrong.

         That figure takes the high value of the 1992 scoping study valuation range and compares it with the low value of the much more precise 1994 due diligence process. It is simply an absolutely flawed way of comparing the figures. The more precise 1994 due diligence valuation falls within the range of the 1992 scoping study. It is in large measure, as I have already advised the Senate, the result of the dramatic deterioration in ANL shipping trade since January 1994, which in the consultant's opinionâ€”and the minister has made this clearâ€”made any sale of ANL at that time unrealistic and necessitated a valuation based on a market value sale of the assets, which the government has determined it will at this time not do.

He told us today that nothing was wrong with his ministry; he was perfect and wonderfully looking after this; and under him this disaster just happened to take place because of international pressures and all sorts of other things that were quite outside his control. Yet at the same time, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has sacked the board responsible. Why? Was it because something was wrong? Did it take the minister four years to work out something was wrong? Or was it due to totally outside factors such as an investigation by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers that eventually brought it to the attention of this dynamic, alert, intelligent minister, who has his finger on every button but is pressing `off' instead of `on'? This enormously energetic minister did not know the problems. He thought everything was wonderful. It was only when he found out, because he was told, that under his administration this had gone bad as bad as bad can be, that he had to find a scapegoat; and the scapegoat was the board.

         If that is the case, I defy the government to go to the High Court of this country and assert that it does not have an international obligation to implement that decision because it is only advisory. Let the government say that to the High Court of Australia. Under the external affairs power that the government is seeking to rely on, it should really be asserting that it has an international obligation.

        The Leader of the Government in the Senate asserted that this was somehow different, that this was not real litigation. It was not real litigation in respect of the way that the United Nations conducted the hearing because every fundamental of natural justice was absolutely and utterly denied. There were hearings in private, with no right to cross-examination, and the Tasmanian point of view was not able to be put. The important point in this debate is summarised by another ex-Labor minister, Peter Walsh, who said:

        I am not and never have been a monarchist, but I find it ironic that so many contemporary Australians, determined to protect us from the non-existent threat of English tyranny, fall over each other in a scramble to surrender Australian sovereignty to a ragtag and bobtail of unrepresentative United Nations committees accountable to nobody.

       <para>
        In relation to the Tasmanian laws, the question is not whether the laws are right, wrong or indifferent, the question is: who ought to make that decision? What we are in fact debating is a question of morality. It is just as much a question of morality to impose a law as it is to repeal a law because we have got to make a moral judgment. When we have got to make a moral judgmentâ€”and the Democrats seem to be having difficulty in dealing with the question of moral judgmentâ€”there will always be a conflicting point of view presented within the community. There will be those in favour of repeal and those against.

         The next question has to be asked: who is to make the final decision in relation to that moral judgment? I make no apology for saying that it is the people of each individual state who ought to make that determination through the ballot box, through the democratic processes. The Australian Democrats are chirping away, as they always do. The simple fact is they cannot come to grips with a fundamental issueâ€”that is, whether or not they believe in democracy as to whether or not the people of Australia are going to be the final determiners of their laws and the rules that apply.

          Indeed, if we were to have asked the question when the first state repealed certain laws, that state was out of step with much of the rest of the world and with every other state in Australia. We should not have had federal intervention then. If it is perceived that Tasmania is out of step, I say: so what? Let the people of Tasmania determine that through their democratic processes. Whilst the Labor government continues to apologise to the United Nations and people like Gough Whitlam and Peter Walsh can be quoted against it, I am sure the people of Australia more and more will support the principled stand taken by the Liberal and National parties.

I think Senator Abetz would applaud the fact that Mr Downer comes acrossâ€”I do not know Senator Abetz's family particularly well but I know Alexander fairly wellâ€”as a fairly typical family man in terms of his views on this subject. I want to applaud and associate myself with the remarks made by Alexander Downer in the article by Margo Kingston. He said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . his party was "pretty relaxed about people's sexual preference".
       </para>
       <para>
        In response to a specific question about whether one of his children may at some point turn out to be gay, Alexander Downer said, and this happens to be my view also:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would be his or her choice. They're too young for me to have any idea what their sexuality might be. Statistically they're more likely to be heterosexual . . . If one or all of them became homosexual, that's their business.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree with that. I also agree with Margo Kingston's conclusion in this article. She states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Yesterday in the joint party meeting, Mr Downer congratulated Senator Abetz on the birth two weeks ago of his third child, a son. Cross your fingers he doesn't turn out to be gay or to enjoy sex in anything but the missionary position.

        I have a great concern about the reason why we still have Australian troops in Somalia, and that concern was heightened by the answer we got today from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. Why do we have Australian troops in Somalia? It is not correct to say, as the minister did, that we only commit troops under a political plan when we are involved in peacekeeping. The use of military forces on all occasions should have a realistic political objective.

        I do not want any person listening to this debate to be misled into thinking that the Australian Democrats support uranium mining or any part of the nuclear fuel or nuclear weapons cycles. We do not support any of these things. However, we have in Australia a three-mine policy relating to specific mines. That is government policy as well as being the policy of the governing party. This motion is urgent because pressure is building in some quarters to change that policy to allow more mines or to have a totally open slather on uranium mining. Clearly, if one supports a no mines policy as we do, one would prefer a three mines policy to a six or 10 mines policy.

         The reasons why the Democrats have always opposed all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle are as valid or more valid today as they were when our policy on uranium mining was first adopted in 1977. There remain unresolved problems in the handling of nuclear waste and related problems in decommissioning nuclear power stations. Both Britain and France have shut nuclear power stations, and the general thinking is that these decommissioned stations will remain untouched for between 50 and 100 years before the process of dismantling begins. This is to allow the short half-life and very intense radioactivity to decay to a point at which the dismantling can begin.

         Around the world some 60 nuclear power stations will achieve the end of their 30-year life by or before the year 2000. The costs of this dismantling have been put at between 50 and 100 per cent of the initial construction costs. This was probably one of the reasons why, when the CEGB in Great Britain attempted to sell power stations in that country, there was no interest in the privatisation of nuclear power plants and they remain in government ownership. It may also explain why in the US, the home of free and market driven economics, there is little interest from the electricity utilities in building more nuclear power stations.

         Despite all the claims of nuclear safeguards, it is clear that diversion into weapons and to criminal elements cannot be prevented. We have seen examples in Iraq and North Korea where both countries were able to successfully thumb their noses at the international safeguard mechanisms. Indeed, the Middle East war would almost certainly have been nuclear if Iran had not fallen to Islamic fundamentalism some years earlier and, in doing so, cut itself off from French and German help in building nuclear reactors and reprocessors in that country. We have avoided some nuclear wars as much by good luck as by good safeguard management.

         Then there is the threat of nuclear accidents. I have referred previously in this chamber to the article by the Deputy Director of Nuclear Safety with the International Atomic Energy Agency in which, several months before the Chernobyl accident, he praised the inherent safety of the RBMK 1000 reactor saying that it was impossible that such an accident as that meltdown could occur. Reputable estimates of the number of extra cancers which will eventuate throughout Europe as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident puts that number at one million.

         For all these reasons of global and individual safety, the Democrats hold a strong position of opposition to the nuclear fuel and nuclear weapons industries. But there are other powerful economic arguments as to why we should not expand the mining of uranium; namely, that it would not be profitable to Australia to expand its uranium mines. The opposition will almost certainly argue that that decision should be left to market forces. But these decisions involve the investment of billions of dollars, dollars which will come by some route or other from ordinary Australian people.

         A failed mine therefore represents a diversion of large amounts of capital that could have been used for other purposes. For example, Western Mining is contemplating the expansion of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia at a cost of $1 billion; 300 extra jobs will be created, it is claimed. These jobs will cost $3 million each. That is no solution to the problem of one million unemployed in Australia. Governments do have a responsibility in these matters but, as I will show in a moment, the sale price of uranium at present and in the foreseeable future is lower than the cost of production in Australia, and uranium mines around the world, almost without exception, are working at partial capacity.

         It is not possibleâ€”and this is a very important pointâ€”to insist on stringent safeguards in a strong buyers market.

         The coal industry in Australia, in which producers have competed in limited markets, has seen lower and lower effective unit prices.

         The nuclear industry has been consistently over-optimistic in its prediction of nuclear power expansion and the opportunities for the sale of more Australian uranium at a higher price. These predictions have been shown repeatedly to be wrong. At the start of mining in Australia, we set a floor price of $30 per pound. After a number of years that floor price had to be scrapped. The government had to scrap that floor price. In June 1994 the spot price was $9.20 to $9.30 per pound for non-communist uranium and $7 to $7.20 for material from CIS countries. According to Industry Commission report No. 7, production costs from Ranger are $15 per pound; $15 to $20 per pound from Roxby Downs; $20 to $25 from Koongarra; and $25 to $30 from Jabiluka. It is for these reasons that Ranger is working at only part capacity and is filling about 30 per cent of its sales with uranium bought under a five-year contract with Kazakhstan, which is in one of the CIS countries.

         The long-term demand for uranium will be and is already being heavily influenced by the sale of highly enriched uranium from CIS and US stockpiles under disarmament treaties. According to Nuexco, the international uranium marketing body, this material will begin to enter the market this year and continue for the next 20 years. If all the material under the US-Russian arms reduction treaty is released, all reactor consumption up to the year 2010 will be met without any uranium being mined anywhere in the world. This is at current rates of consumption which, it can be shown, are unlikely to rise and may well fall.

         The number of new reactors coming on line has slowed. Much has been made by nuclear enthusiasts of projections which include plans rather than firm orders. For example, while 54 new reactors may reach completion or be completed by the year 2000, 60 reactors will have reached the end of their useful life and will be decommissioned. I think there are compelling reasons why this motion should be accepted by the Senate.

To my total astonishment, Senator Coulter has now done the most gigantic backflip of all time for a Democrat and has moved a motion in the Senate calling on us to maintain the three-mine policy, when three months ago he moved a motion calling on us to abandon it. Senator Coulter is wasted in this chamber. He is needed in Victoria, Canada. He should be in Victoria winning gold for Australia in the diving pool by doing a quadruple backflip with pike and double twist.

So, in complete contradiction to the motion Senator Coulter moved just three months ago, his motion today is calling on the governmentâ€”and we will support itâ€”to maintain uranium mining for export from his home state of South Australia for the next 200 years. I can assure Senator Coulter that I will be supporting that this afternoon.

         Senator Coulter knows, as everyone does, that this matter is one for the national conference of the Labor Party which is to be held later this year. The conference will make a decision, one way or the other, on the existing policy. My views on it are profoundly well known. I have grown old with this debate. Those views have been put on the public record many times. But I would like to take the opportunity to distance myself again as far as I possibly can from the idiot statements that were made by Senator Coulter's namesake, the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Barry Coulter, in a debate in the Northern Territory parliament.

I hope that Senator Tambling is in that category. I would hate to hear Senator Tambling say this afternoon that he supports those comments and believes nuclear weapons are `a good thing'. Nuclear weapons caused the most appalling historical tragedy that has ever been visited on the human race.

         I do not know how we can, with a straight face, debate such an extraordinary motion from Senator Coulter, knowing as I do his violent opposition to the uranium industry. Perhaps Senator Coulter, in his reply to this motion, will advise the Senate why he could not just as effectively have made the points he made in the debate this afternoon by bringing on again for debate a motion calling on the governmentâ€”as he did three months agoâ€”to abandon the policy and adopt a no-mines policy. Instead, he is now on the public record moving a motion calling for the government to maintain its existing policy of providing for the mining and export of uranium from his home state of South Australia for the next 200 years. I assure Senator Coulter that I will support that proposition this afternoon. I thank him for the opportunity to do so.

         Clearly, debate on the three-mine policy has intensified over recent months in the lead-up to the Labor Party's biennial national conference in Hobart in September. Along with the Northern Territory government, some senior federal Labor ministersâ€”including Senator Collins, Senator Robert Ray and Mr Bilneyâ€”the mining industry and the Northern Land Council have condemned the policy. So Senator Collins has done a half-flip today. In the Northern Territory, Labor's three-mine policy is blocking the development of two major developments on Aboriginal land, namely, Koongarra and Jabiluka, now known as Ranger North. The tragedy is that the Koongarra people want to mine and have asked the Northern Land Council to lobby against the three mines policy on their behalf. I seek leave to have incorporated in

This would ensure that stringent monitoring of the environment is maintained by a neutral body.

        Aboriginal interest groups are maintaining pressure on key Labor figures and their factions. On a recent visit to the Northern Territory, the federal environment minister, Senator Faulkner, who is not here to participate in today's debate, met with the Gagudju Association at Cooinda to receive its pro-development message. It would be very interesting to know what was said at that meeting. It would have been very interesting for Senator Faulkner, from the Left, to have reported to us, rather than having to rely on the messages that come from the flies on the wall. There will be visits here by Aboriginal people in the next few weeks. I hope the Labor Party and the Democrats take note of that.

         The Gagudju Association, set up in 1979 on behalf of the traditional owners of the Ranger project areas, is without doubt one of the Aboriginal success stories in the Northern Territory. Charged with administering agreements and royalty moneys from mining at Ranger, one of the present mines, Gagudju investments include tourist ventures, mechanical and civil engineering workshops, a construction business and a trust to safeguard children's payments. They are on about jobs and the involvement of Aborigines and territorians in this important industry.

         Yet under Labor's three-mine uranium policy, these and many other benefits of mining are being denied to the Aboriginal communities that want them. In the words of the Northern Land Council, Labor is living a lie. Let us remember that the wishes of Aboriginal people were considered paramount by Labor, and by Senator Collins in particular, in the Coronation Hill debate; but they are conveniently not so paramount now in this Aboriginal debate. This is very similar to Aboriginal affairs minister Tickner and the Prime Minister ignoring the recommendations of the Industry Commission report and the conference of representative groups in Yulara in 1992, and a cabinet submission of January 1993 that has never seen the light of day on legislation needed to correct anomalies in the Northern Territory land rights act.

         The core of the hypocrisy in this issue was highlighted by the left-wing Northern Territory federal member, Warren Snowdon, who told ABC radio that Aboriginal views were only one factor in the uranium debate. He added:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It's not a question just of saying the traditional owners have the right to make a determination, they certainly have that right. But the nation has a responsibility where the national interest is concerned to say whether it wants, that is the nation, wants further uranium mined.
       </para>
       <para>
        That might be the view of Mr Snowdon and of Senator Coulter, but it is not the view of these Aboriginal people or of the majority of Australians. The question is: does the Labor Party really respect the views of Aboriginal people, or does it respect Aboriginal views only when they happen to agree with party platform? Certainly, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, has taken a prominent role in the uranium debate so far and frequently refers to his record of the past 16 years. Apart from the fact that he has achieved nothing in those 16 years, it is interesting to note his dramatic turnabout from staunchly anti-uranium in 1982 to staunchly pro-uranium in 1994. Back in 1982, at the ALP national conference, he told delegates:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . my credentials in respect of an anti-uranium position are impeccable, because I have led the fight against uranium in the Northern Territory now for five years. That is a fact. I have no qualms about that position.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the transcript, he also said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have got no doubts that I can go back to the Northern Territory which has got an 82% vote in favour of uranium miningâ€”but I am happy to work with that, my position is well known up there as an anti-uranium person.
       </para>
       <para>
        Still on hypocrisy, I remind the Senate of Australia's decision to lift sanctions on the uranium-rich South Africa, thereby allowing South Africa, along with Canada, to compete against us in world markets. Is it not absurd to lift restrictions on another country, yet retain restrictions on our own? Why do we want to hand over export dollars to the rest of the world? Is our uranium industry not good enough, or is it a case of Labor mates doing deals behind cabinet doors?

         If the ALP can be accused of hypocrisy, I issue the same warning to the Australian Democrats, in particular to Senator Kernot. If this motion of Senator Coulter's proceeds, Senator Kernot will have no option but to resign from her position on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The motion before the Senate effectively denies Aboriginal people the right to develop their land and gain economic independence. That makes a mockery of Democrat calls for Aboriginal self-determination. The importance of mining to all Australians cannot be underestimated.

         On the national level, mining contributes to government revenue and GDP; on the local level, benefits flow through to a range of industries; and on a personal level, it creates job opportunities and enhances superannuation investments. I say to Senator Margetts that yes, it is about jobs, jobs, jobsâ€”and that is fundamental to all Australians. Just about every Australian family has a financial stake in this matter. Through their superannuation, all Australian families have investments in mining, and in uranium in particular, and they should be able to exploit that for their future retirement potential.

         Let me give an example. In today's money terms, just one mineâ€”Ranger in the Northern Territoryâ€”has contributed the equivalent of $5.3 billion to the national economy; it has paid $86 million in royalties to the Northern Territory government; and it has accounted for seven per cent of the Northern Territory's economic activity. With demand for uranium ore strengthening, Australia cannot afford to waste even more export income and job opportunities. It is estimated that the development of three additional minesâ€”Ranger North and Koongarra in the Northern Territory, and Kintyre in Western Australiaâ€”will provide export income of around $235 million a year, 1,270 jobs during construction and 520 long-term jobs.

I, like Senator Collins, share the amazement at the fact that today the Democrats have obviously shifted from a no-uranium position and policy to a three-mine policy. I question what deal they have done behind the dunny door to get a third one up and running. Is this another deal with Labor behind some deal that will give a reward, and will there be some payola?

         When one listens to the contributions from Senator Coulter and Senator Tambling, one would think that people have been playing with mirrors. Senator Coulter stood up and said, `I move this motion, but I just want to tell you at the outset that I don't really agree with what I am moving because I don't agree with uranium mining at all. That is our policy, but I will move as a matter of urgency that there is a need for the government to maintain the named three-mine policy with respect to uranium mining.' So we have moved rather quickly, as Senator Collins said, from a position where the Australian Democrats wanted to abandon the three-mine policy, as Senator Coulter calls it, to a position where there is now a need for the government to maintain it.

         Then Senator Tambling got up and said, `I can't support this motion and the opposition can't support this motion because, whilst your party supports uranium mining, you can't support a motion which will actually maintain that situation at the existing mines.' So at this stage we have had people from the Democrats and the opposition standing up and supporting propositions which they do not support. One thing is clear: the Australian Labor Party and the government have a detailed policy on uranium mining.

         â€”It is not 10 years old. It runs to at least four pages and deals with a range of matters besides just the three named mines. I will enlighten Senator Ian Macdonald as to what the policy deals with. It refers particularly to the health and safety issues associated with the nuclear industry and with uranium mining. It is a policy that deals comprehensively with the fact that the nuclear industry has a peaceful and beneficial side as well as a potentially destructive side. The policy deals with the fact that Australia has existing contracts to fulfil regarding the delivery of uranium to overseas purchasers.

         The policy highlights the leading role that Australia has and will continue to play in ensuring the safe and peaceful use of uranium throughout the world. The policy deals with the way in which the responsible mining and export of uranium can contribute towards improved nuclear non-proliferation policies and practices internationally, and towards resolving the problems of high level nuclear waste management. So this is not simply a one-line three-mine policy, which seems to be what people continue to focus on when they debate this issue. As Senator Collins said, if the motion before us involved debating the issue of uranium mining in detail, then we probably could have had a far more interesting debate.

Every party represented here today has its own internal processes to determine its own party policies. The fact that there are differing opinions within the Labor Party and within the wider community regarding uranium policy is clear.

But the difference is that we in the Labor Party do not try to hide behind our occasional differences of opinion. We know how to debate them so as to resolve them in the proper forums. We will be having a public conference where delegates with a broad cross-section of views will thrash out the issues.

         â€”The word `hypocrisy' has been synonymous with the ALP for some time now. One has to think back to only the last federal election to understand the absolute hypocrisy of a party that went out and criticised most of our policies and immediately following the election adopted them. We have the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who has one set of rules for his staff at the Lodge and Kirribilli House and another set of rules for every small businessman in Australia.

         We have the hypocrisy of a uranium policy which says, `You can get good uranium out of three mines, but if it happens to come out of another mine then it is bad uranium.' So the Labor Party qualifies uranium as good and bad. If it is out of the named mines, it is beaut; if it does not come from them, it is no good at all. What absolute hypocrisy!

         I think it is important to look at some of the descriptions of the ALP's three mines policy. Let us see what some very notable Australians have said about it. One said, `The three mines policy is something that should not be taken as the Holy Grail.' Another important person described it as `illogical'. Yet another says, `I am an advocate for change.' Another one says, `My position is that we should either be in the uranium business or we should not be in itâ€”not halfway.' Another of these prominent Australians calls the policy `absurd'. Another says, `It is an irrational policy.' Another says, `It is illogical and nonsense.' Another one calls it `a joke'. Another one calls it `bullshit'. Another one says, `It is out of step with the opinion of international socialists.' Another one says, `It is a nonsense of a policy.' Another prominent Australian says, `It is illogical and hypocritical.' Another one calls it `an absurdity'. And another one says, `What we are talking about is not a logical decision.'

         Who said those things? They were not members of the opposition political parties. They were not some of the mining lobby. They were not some of the nation's editorialists, although they do say the same thing in more refined words. It was not the Aboriginals who have been locked out of jobs, although, again, they criticise it in more refined words. It was not the public opinion polls. Let me tell the Senate who said those things.

         So that is what we have from this government. What have these people who have all criticised this policy done about it? Three of them, no doubt, will come here and vote directly against their opinions and views of it. They do not even have the guts, the intestinal fortitude, to put it up at the national conference. This is the sort of government we have: a government where three senior peopleâ€”Senators Loosley, Collins and Rayâ€”run around saying that it is a stupid policy, yet not one of them even has the intestinal fortitude to put it up at the ALP conference in September.

Now he says that he wants it changed, but he was the one who proposed it. As Senator Tambling pointed out, Senator Collins originally opposed all sorts of uranium mining and then he seconded the motion for the three mines policy. Such consistency! What a great government we have in Canberra! Now he wants a change, but he is not prepared to do anything about it. That is the sort of gutlessness we get from the current government.

         These people have given the Canadian economy an $8 billion boost in export earnings over the last 10 years. They have given the Canadian economy hundreds of thousands of jobs that should have gone to some of the Australians whom they put out of work. The million Australians who cannot get a job could have got a job if those opposite had been more interested in their own country than in their factional deals or looking after the Canadian economy. According to Access Economics, the government has stopped the prospect of $600 million a year in future earnings because of this policy. Senator Collins, for all his pious mouthings about Aborigines, has stopped them in their bid for economic independence. He has absolutely stopped them. He is pretty good at going around and throwing money at them. But when they want real self-respect, when they want the thing that they desperately need for self-respectâ€”that is, real jobsâ€”he opposes them. He is going to vote against it. He has no interest in Aborigines. Those opposite make me sick. They mouth the platitudes, but when it comes to the things that Aborigines desperately needâ€”real jobs and self-respectâ€”this lot will stop them because of a grubby factional deal to prop up some of their mates.

The absolute hypocrisy of the Labor Party is mirrored with their left-wing allies in the Democrats and, I regret to see, the Greens. Joining the word `hypocrisy' as being synonymous with the ALP is the description `stupidity'. For Australia's sake, we need to get rid of this hypocritical and stupid policy.

I am pleased that Senator Coulter has raised this matter of urgency for debate today because it is indeed a critical issue for this nation. Unfortunately, the decision on whether this nation eliminates the current restrictions on uranium mining and export, that is, it goes from a bad policy to a worse policy, will be made by the menâ€”and I use that word deliberatelyâ€”who pull the  strings in the ALP factional disputes. I am sure that yet again some cynical deal will be done that takes no cognisance of the concerns of the majority of the Australian population, who are extremely worried about the safety, health and security implications of mining and exporting this mineral.

         This is not just another mining development issue. Uranium is a dangerous mineral which can be used for horribly destructive purposes and which also has enormous and yet insoluble problems associated with waste storage and disposal. The debate on this issue should examine all aspects of the nuclear cycleâ€”from mining, to its use in nuclear reactors, to reprocessing and/or storage, and ultimately to its use in nuclear weapons. There are enormous problems associated with all aspects of the nuclear cycleâ€”including economic, environmental, security, public health and occupational health concerns. In my brief time I will concentrate largely on the defence and security implicationsâ€”although, as an economist, I cannot resist the opportunity to make some comments in passing on the economic stupidity of pursuing a nuclear option.

         Amory Lovins from the Rocky Mountains Institute in Colorado sums up the economic arguments succinctly. On ABC radio in 1991, he stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Round the world, nuclear power has been dying of an incurable attack of market forces and at most, by the year 2000, it will have just a few percent of the global capacity that it was then officially predicted to have. The basic reasons for this are rather clearâ€”the first, that it is a terribly expensive technology. In the United States, for example, nuclear power is producing only a fourth as much electricity as you could save, at only a seventh the cost of running a nuclear plant, even if building it cost nothing. And after something like half a trillion dollars of investment, our civilian nuclear sector is now producing a good deal less delivered energy than wood. I can't think of any case in history where so much has been spent by so many, for so little.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Australian context, this economic madness is also evident. Since the early 1950s, when the Australian Atomic Energy Commission commenced operations under ANSTO until recently, the Australian taxpayer has committed in excess of $2.5 billion, in 1991 dollars, on nuclear technology. That figure does not include any allowance for the decommissioning costs at Lucas Heights. The total return on that investment has been approximately $110 million. If we are talking about jobs, here are the real figures. If the renewable energy technology sector, which received less than $50 million from the Australian government over the same period, had achieved similar appalling returns on the investment, the programs would undoubtedly have been scrapped. Why are we not doing the same for the nuclear industry in this country?

         From a defence perspective, there is no denying that there is a direct connection between the civilian use of nuclear power and technology and the potential for nuclear weapons. Elizabeth Clegg, from the Centre of Defence Studies of the University of Aberdeen, in an article in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        In conclusion, then, it can be seen that the infrastructure required for the development of a nuclear weapons potential is best created under cover of a well established civilian nuclear industry; in all of the above cases the military option was made possible by the existence of a civilian programme.

        While some naive analysts may claim that the post-Cold War period has provided renewed stability in international relations, this is patently not the case, as even a cursory examination of any newspaper will confirm. In the current unstable political climate in many regions of the world, the added threat of an expanding number of nations with nuclear weapons capability is horrendous. As Elizabeth Clegg indicates, if we continue to support and supply so-called civilian nuclear operations, we are potentially adding to international nuclear weapons capacity. For the record, the Greens (WA) do not support the current three mines policy. We support a real no mines policy for uranium mining.

        The Reserve Bank annual report is once again an interesting document. It is one of the key economic documents to be released each year by the official organs of government. The Reserve Bank is the key financial institution in Australia and is the central bank.

         The report contains a number of interesting matters that I wish to touch on briefly today. It runs through the normal matters including its view of the economy and economic policy, and developments in the recent past; it looks at the future economy; it also deals with normal financial markets, financial intermediation and financial system surveillance as well as its own operating results.

         It is interesting to note that the first page of the document contains a list of the 15 interest rate cuts that were required by the government in an attempt to stimulate the Australian economy out of its prolonged recession that the government's own economic mismanagement engineered in the late 1980s and which the government and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, acknowledged as the recession we had to have, which was absolute nonsense. The only reason we had to have the long, deep, prolonged recession that we had was the fact that the government had displayed monumental incompetence in its fiscal and monetary policy management and its economic management as a whole.

         Since this report was signed off by the Chairman of the Reserve Bank Board, the Governor of the bank, Mr Fraser, in his signing off letter to the Treasurer on 5 August, we have had a reversal of that interest rate reduction trend. We saw a three-quarters of a per cent increase in the official rate last week. I wonder whether next year's report will open by listing the rises that will occur over that period as well as having taken the credit for the reductions that have occurred in recent years. It is some time now since there was an interest rate reduction, the last one being on 30 July 1993.

         The trend has now started to reverse. The government has acknowledged that there is no doubt that interest rates are on the way up. We have seen the start of it with the Reserve Bank decision of the three-quarters of one per cent rate increase last week. There is no doubt at all that so long as the government continues on its path of fiscal policy ineptitude and excesses it is inevitable that we will see a continuing spiral in interest rates. The timing of the release of the report is ironic in the context of last week's first interest rate rise in four years, no doubt the first of many in the tightening of monetary policy under this Labor government. As my colleague Senator O'Chee has pointed out, it was a pretty hefty rise at that. Three-quarters of one per cent is a hefty rise in anyone's language.

         The report contains a dissertation on the domestic and international economy. It toes the government's line very closely on those matters. Which organisation is leading which is another matterâ€”whether the government is following the Reserve Bank line or the Reserve Bank is following the government lineâ€”but there is no doubt that the two are running very closely together in their comments and analysis of the economy.

         The report contains what I would regard as some fanciful hopes in the present climate of a major pick-up in investment expenditure. It admits that investment has failed to improve under this government's policies and that investment now is at disastrously low levels without any clear indication at all that we will see any pick-up let alone any sustained pick-up in the investment expenditure in this country. The bank says in its report that it hopes there will be a pick-up, but hope is a fairly weak reed to fly with in an economic situation such as we have today, particularly in a rising interest rate climate.

         The report devotes a section to housing in an attempt to justify what must have been known when this report was producedâ€”that there was soon going to be an increase in interest rates. Again it runs the government line on housing borrowing that, despite there being no boom in housing prices, there is too much housing activity. It seems to have ignored the most recent figures for residential housing activity which has shown a fall.

         I draw the Senate's attention to a very interesting graph on page 8 of the report which shows housing affordability over the 20 years since 1975-76. Despite the government's current propaganda that housing affordability is now at its best for 20 years or more, the Reserve Bank graph shows quite clearly that that is not the case. Even though the affordability ratio has improved in the last

         Housing affordability is currently only just above the level it was when Labor came to office in 1983. In other words, housing affordability is now slightly less good than it was in 1993 and, as I have said, less so than throughout the entire period of the Fraser government.

         The report makes considerable note, understandably, of the commendable fall in inflation in Australia. The question of whether we have broken the inflation stick permanently, that inflation legacy that Australia inherited from the Whitlam period, is a much more open question.

         What is particularly telling about the achievement of low inflation in Australia in the last few years is the immense cost that we have borne to attain this. It is interesting that the report does reveal the rarely admitted real GDP per capita figures for Australia's economic growth. Normally, we just see figures for GDP growth in a period without relating them to the movements in population. Of course, the GDP per capita figures much more accurately reflect living standards than the government's preferred real GDP figure which, as I say, takes no account of Australia's relatively high population growth.

         When one does take account of that population growth, the Reserve Bank statistics show that the gross domestic product in Australia did not rise on a per capita basis from the late 1980s right through until 1992. Over that same period, allowing for lags, unemployment rose from just under seven per cent to a record figure of more than 11 per cent. Of course, we all know the tragedyâ€”the fact that more than one million Australians were unemployed at a number of times during this period. Indeed, today, we still have the tragedy of almost 900,000 Australians unable to find work and at least an equal number unable to find the type or hours of work that they want.

         The final point I want to raise is the question of fiscal policy and the budget deficit. The Reserve Bank, of course, is more concerned with monetary policy; that is its responsibility. But we cannot look at monetary policy without linking it with consideration of fiscal policy. The two go hand in hand. The bank report makes only a brief mention of the budgetary situation and, in particular, the ongoing excessive budget deficit problem. On page 17 of the report it says:

       </para>
       <para>
        That is an understatement, to say the least. The simple fact is that this government has been quite unable to develop a budgetary policy, a fiscal policy, which has permitted a sufficiently rapid run-down in the huge budget deficits that it has accumulated over many years. For the government to say that the best it can do is hopefully to get the budget into balance by about 1996-97 or 1997-98 is absolutely unsatisfactory and is far too lax a fiscal policy. That has huge implications for monetary policy, interest rate policy; therefore, for the level of investment and economic activity. The whole thing flows through together.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Reducing the budget deficit much more rapidly than this government is budgeting for and forecasting must be a major priority. It should also be something which the Reserve Bank, if it is really serious about sustained low inflation growth, ought to be bringing forward and speaking loudly about day in and day out until action is taken. Until this does happen, recovery will always be tenuous at best. The sustainability of economic growth that is so essential for the future of this country will be out of our reach and desperately needed investment will simply not eventuate.

         In my view, the comments of the bank on this matter and the prospects for growth are shallow at the least because I believe they ignore some of the fundamental problems that the budget policy of this government leads to. It leads to increased pressure on interest rates. The government has a financing requirement this year in excess of $20 billion, a higher figure than last year. The prospects for the financing requirement over the next few years are also horrendously high. When we have a financing requirement of that nature, we are obviously putting pressure on interest rates in a way that the proper activities of a well-managed economy would not.

         We also have a continuing huge problem with our balance of payments situation. We have a current account deficit which year in, year out seems incapable of shrinking considerably on any sustainable basis. The current account deficit is now blowing out again and is forecast, even by the government itself, to blow out further. We all know that that is the cause of the enormous foreign debt problem that we have today. We have a foreign debt to the rest of the world that virtually exceeds that of any other country. For a country with our resources and potential, that is nothing short of disgraceful.

         But the more significant factor, rather than just the disgrace of it, is the enormous impact it has on economic activity in Australia and the enormous impact it has on reducing our sovereign independence. We have a government and a Prime Minister who run around saying, `We're not really independent because we're a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic; we're not independent because of the flag that we've got.' We hear all of this sort of nonsense. The real damage, the real danger and the real blow to the independence of this nation has been the economic policy of this government over many years, which has seen more than a seven-fold increase in our net foreign debt to the rest of the world in the 10 or 11 years that this government has been in power. When this government came to power in March 1983, Australia's total net foreign debt to the rest of the world was $23 billion. Today, it is well in excess of $170 billionâ€”more than a seven-fold increase. Indebtedness of that nature and of that extent automatically and inevitably reduces our independence as a nation.

         It is regrettable that the Reserve Bank report did not pick up any of these issues and make some of these points, because they are the most important points that we need to consider in any future consideration of economic policy, economic policy development and the economic management of this country. If we do not get those things right, if we do not recognise and address those fundamental problems, we are going to continue to lose our sovereign independence. We are going to continue to hobble ourselves in terms of our capacity to provide jobs, because we can only get increased jobs if we have a policy which enables the nation to save, to invest and to produce.

It has not even started to scratch the surface of the micro-economic reform agenda that is required in this country.

         It is a great pity and an indictment, I believe, of the bank that its report does not pick up sufficiently on these matters. Indeed, many of them are not mentioned at all. I trust that it will do so next year because unless it does, it is not living up to its responsibility to inform the Australian public and the government on the real issues that have to be addressed if we are going to see, into the 21st century, the type of vibrant economic nation that we obviously so desperately need.

         â€”In discussing the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 at the second reading stage, there are basically three mattersâ€”two in particularâ€”that I want to raise. We have asked for this bill to go to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. There are two matters that we want looked at, and they are the ones that I primarily want to talk about. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee rightly identified another problem that the government may care to take up with respect to some amendments to the ASIO Act.

         Basically, this bill is an omnibus bill. I am not sure why it is not called the `Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill', since that is the title often attached to these sorts of omnibus bills. In any event, this bill amends 17 acts, mostly in minor, technical or consequential ways.

Nonetheless, we are changing the law in different ways and people have to chase those changes. No doubt, this bill will be purchased by people who want it for one reason, and 17 different groups will purchase the whole bill because they want it for one reason.

         I will deal firstly with the one amendment to the ASIO Act that I wanted to raise as a consequence of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee having spotted this. Having served on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, I should have found it myself. There is an amendment which would allow the Director-General of Security to give a standing authorisation to an officer of ASIO to approve persons to exercise the authority of warrants issued by the Attorney-General.

         We have had consultations with the Director-General. We think it is quite sensible and not a controversial amendment. Simply, there will be occasions when the Director-General is not available to approve persons who are able to exercise authority of warrants. If he is not available it causes difficulty, and there is no reason not to fix that. Except, this is a power that up until now has laid only with the Director-General of Security. All of a sudden, we are prepared to sayâ€”simply by not thinking, I suggestâ€”`He can give it to an officer of ASIO, any officer of ASIO.'

         For years, we have had the view that it could only be the Director-General. The intention is that he gives it to a person of a particular category or level but, as a result of what I think is a drafting oversight, it means that he can give it to any officer of ASIO. I am sure that the government did not intend that, and I feel quite confident that it will address that matter. It is just another example, of course, of the Senate scrutiny committee doing its job, picking up faults in legislation on a completely nonpartisan basis, and trying to improve legislation as it goes through them.

         The more substantive area that I wanted to raise relates to the amendment to require a court to take cultural background into account when sentencing federal offenders, and to include cultural background as a consideration when discharging offenders without proceeding to conviction. The amendment will add cultural background to the previous list of character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person.

My understanding is that by doing thisâ€”and the point was raised in the reportâ€”one would hope that cultural background is not used, for example, as a justification for violence against women. The Law Reform Commission concluded that we could have confidence in the courts and the manner in which they would take that into account. They do take it into account now through the common law in a number of states, at the very least.

         If I understand the concern correctly, it is not that cultural background will be taken into account when it is a relevant part of the offence. How could we be concerned at that? Some people want it taken into account in mitigation when the cultural background itself has had nothing at all to do with the offence. The degree to which that would happen might cause some concern. We need a few more informed, knowledgeable minds informing the Senate of how that would operate before we make that change.

       <para>
        As I understand it, there are two opportunities: one is to have a non-custodial sentence, and the other is to have a custodial sentence that is suspended. This ensures that if an order is made and someone gets out of going to gaolâ€”if that is the appropriate way to phrase itâ€”and they then breach that order, they will not go to gaol for breaching that order but will be able to be dealt with in the same way as they could have been dealt with under the original offence. We are concerned about that.

         If people get the benefit of some kind of positive discretion by the courts in their favour and they have this non-custodial sentence or a custodial sentence that is suspended by the making of an orderâ€”and perhaps this only relates to the first partâ€”that then means that they do not go to gaol. In that case why are we saying, `If you breach the order, it doesn't matter; we'll just go back to treating you as though you have started once again at the beginning'â€”almost start de novo. If people get the benefit of some goodwill from the courts, they have an obligation to comply and ought to be dealt with severely when they do not. Goodwill only goes so far and, if people want to throw it back in someone's face, I think they are inviting the goodwill to end. There is a particular concern, too, about the victims of crime. It does not seem appropriate that, where a person is not imprisoned but has an order made to pay an amount by way of reparation or restitution, they should be able to not pay for whatever reason and, tough luck, just sort of start again. If we misunderstand that, we will be happy to be told we misunderstand it, but I suspect that we do not. We would like that matter looked at by the committee as well. Other than those two mattersâ€”which is not to say that we are pre-determined against them but just that we want them looked atâ€”we are supportive of the bill.

         This is a new provision which allows the director-general to appoint an authorising officer at an appropriately senior level to approve persons who can exercise the authority of all warrants issued by the Attorney-General. However, the concerns expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee are shared by the Australian Democrats. I express the hope that the government will attend to this so that the authority that is being given is limited to an appropriate senior level and is carefully defined. It only increases the number of people who can exercise the authority of warrants; it does not confer the power to issue new warrants.

         Other amendments in part 2 provide for officers of ASIO to be able to apply for vacancies in the Australian Public Service even though the positions have not been advertised as being open to the public. This brings ASIO officers in line with the rest of the Public Service. However, I was informed that originally the omission of this right was seen almost as a trade-off for other privileges that ASIO officers have and which are not common in the Public Service. I would appreciate the minister dealing with that question either in response to the second reading or in the committee stage of the bill. The view was expressed, `Well, what happens to the other privileges which are beneficial to ASIO officers: are they going to be taken away or are they going to stay?'

         Part 3 of the bill makes a number of amendments to the Crimes Act. The first of these is to enable courts to take cultural background into account when sentencing federal offenders. I understand that this particular area is of concern to the opposition. Senator Vanstone has indicated that this matter is one of the two matters that have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I would be interested to explore that question. But I note that on the current wording of the bill it appears to be limited to the sentencing part, not to the question of whether or not a person is guilty of a particular offence. Part 3 also makes some amendments to the provisions concerning action to be taken in the event of breach of certain court orders.

The proposed amendments will enable the court to impose a monetary penalty not exceeding $1,000, extend the period of good behaviour, revoke the order, or impose an alternative to imprisonment, such as a community service order.

         The federal coalition has always been a strong supporter of decentralisation and localised control. Therefore, we have some concerns that the National Environment Protection Council might lead to more centralised control in Canberra of the environment and particular issues in various states. We were at one stage concerned that it might force the state governments to forfeit their powers to disallow regulations and that it may reduce the international competitiveness and the efficiency of its administration by adding yet another layer of bureaucracy.

         When dealing with environmental issues on the scale of those listed in clause 14 of this billâ€”such as air quality, and marine, estuarine and fresh water qualityâ€”the coalition believes that there must be a concerted national approach. Those environmental issues are matters that affect Australia as a whole. They do not stop at the state boundaries. In many cases the states would not have the financial capacity to deal with those issues. For example, the problems with the salination of the Murray-Darling River are something that no individual state would have the financial capacity to deal with.

         The introduction of a national environment strategy was a state initiative which arose from the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in 1990. The federal Labor government has been dragging its feet on this issue, I regret to say, for the four years since that decision was made. It has managed to toss the sensitive environment portfolio around like a hot potato to three ministers this year alone, which is a typical example of the little genuine regard the Labor Party has for the environment.

        We have worded the amendment along the lines of some words that the then minister used when she was talking about this proposal. We certainly hope that, having used the words the then minister used when speaking about it, the government will adopt that amendment as one it is in favour of. Mrs Kelly, who was then the environment minister, promised this. If that amendment is adopted, it will stop any hint of centralisation of rules in Canberra. The council must have the right to make individual decisions on environmental issues affecting local communities.

The state Labor government had given that development the green light and had subjected it to a number of environmental conditions.

We would certainly not accept that sort of variation for the reasons I have outlined earlier, that an ideal national environment protection council would be a national council which would promulgate national standards that would be applicable throughout the whole of Australia and would allow for the input of industry groups, public interest groups, environment groups, state governments and a whole range of people into the formulation of these standards; but would not give to the states and others the right of veto over those standards.

It is very difficult for us to modify by way of amendment. I believe that all the amendments that various parties to this debate will put forward will be rejected by the government, partly on the grounds that there has been an agreement between the several states and the Commonwealth in relation to this legislation and not one comma and not one full stop of that legislation will be changed because it requires complimentary legislation in the other states.

         â€”Certainly, Madam Acting Deputy President. Quite frankly, Western Australians are the best people to decide who can look after their environmental protection measures. I think it is absolutely outrageous for this federal government to believe that it knows best. How can it set national standards of environmental protection to apply in Sydney and in Melbourne, with their populations, in the same way as they will apply in Townsville, Kununurra, Broome, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Bunbury, Albany, Esperance and all points in between? It is absolute and utter nonsense to believe that that can be so.

         I am quite happy for Western Australia to be a recalcitrant, if that is what Senator Coulter wants to call it, if it means that, first of all, we disagree with him but, most importantly, that we consistently resist any form of federal intervention in areas of total and utter state responsibility.

         Senator Coulter cited the Tasmanian dams case as a perfect example of where the federal government should intervene in state issues. I am glad he mentioned that because the Tasmanian dams case remains the classic example of the federal government overriding the wishes of people in the states. The Tasmanian people actually voted in a government that promoted the development and the building of that dam, yet the federal government overrode their wishes. This is what is happening again, because this is purely and simply another attempt by this government to rob the states of their constitutional powers. How many times is this government going to be allowed to do it before everyone in Australia realises that this is the underhanded way in which the Labor Party is going about trying to diminish the roles of the states?

Senator Coulter can quite happily stand in this place and say that the selective use of the external affairs powers is quite desirable whenever this government disagrees with an action that has been taken by a state government. The federal government now, of course, wants to rob the people in the states and territories of the right to have meaningful input into the environmental and resource management issues of particular concern to them.

         The inclusion of these areas goes above and beyond the original agreement on the need for a consistent approach to air and water pollution made at the first special premiers conference in 1990. This federal bill now has far greater scope and authority than was ever agreed to by those heads of government present in 1990. Why has it been changed? There has not been any further consultation in real terms. The intrusion of federal laws into what are essentially local environmental issues will inevitably lead to inefficiency, duplication and higher costs as a result of the entanglement of federal and state laws.

There has been no vote which has caused them to lose that right. There has been no change in the constitution whereby they lose that right. Yet we get clowns like Senator Coulter coming in here and saying that it is quite desirable that that happens. It is simply, totally and utterly undesirable from the point of view of Western Australia and every other state and territory that wants to govern in its right and proper form. This is of particular concern to Western Australia because not only will it disempower Western Australia, but it will disenfranchise the local communities from their rightful place in the discussion process which should accompany the implementation of any environmental protection strategy.

They do not believe that a group of bureaucrats in Canberra, or politicians who do not get out into these country areas, can really decide what is in their best interest. We have a classic example of that today. This bill is doing exactly that. This bill will be intrusive and its intervention will be very confusing. It will breed uncertainty about the safety of local environments.

         The national uniformity of measures would threaten to set back the many achievements made in the area of environmental protection. One of the main concerns of the Western Australian government is the lack of safeguards against further Commonwealth intrusion. I agree with that concern.

The Greens (WA) would welcome a positive, nationally coordinated move to set enforceable standards for water, air and soil quality. We would welcome strong standards for permissible noise pollution, the disposal of hazardous waste, vehicle emissions and the re-use and recycling of materials.

These national environment protection measures cover such areas as ambient air and water quality, site contamination, environmental impacts of hazardous wastes and motor vehicle emissions. However, this bill does not set those standards. Instead it creates a process of consultationâ€”something which the Greens (WA) usually support.

Just to refresh our memories, one of the biggest concerns about the intergovernmental agreements on the environment was that the Commonwealth gave away its overriding power to the states, and this legislation makes similar arrangements. There is no compulsion on the states to enact legislation or put in place arrangements to implement measures. The bill does not even contain any sanction for states which refuse to participate. Therefore, it will be marred by obfuscation from any state which does not want to agree to a national measure.

When important environmental considerations are to be weighed up against short-term social and economic impacts, then those environmental considerations will inevitably lose out.

The legislation prevents the federal government and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) from taking a direct role in setting clear standards on the environment and helping with the enforcement and implementation of those standards through legislative and funding support. This bill basically represents a washing of the hands of the federal minister for the environment and giving up his job to the states which have already demonstrated a very inferior capacity to look after those particular areas of concern.

Its target is to give consistency, not uniformity. I endorse the comments of my colleague Senator Knowles.

I want to know what function the council can carry out for the coordination between the states in addressing particular problems, and dealing with New Zealand at the same time and developing a regional approach. My view is that there is nothing it can do that is not already being done. I also want to point out the role that the conservation and land management department has in Western Australia in dealing with certain environmental aspects, and also the division of resource management which is dealing with the landcare situation in Western Australia.

         I was fortunate last weekâ€”once again, I might add, but this time with the shadow minister for the environment, Ian McLachlanâ€”to do a tour of Western Australia. It was very encouraging, particularly when we saw from the air some of the reclamation work that was being done in some of the catchment areas. I am the first to admit and acknowledge that there is a long way to go. However, we saw that problems have been identified and are being addressedâ€”and successfully addressed. We also spent some time in the south-west looking at the development of plantation forests on both private and degraded public land.

         I recommend to anybody who happens to be lucky enough to come to Western Australia to take the time to look at some of the work, and they will see that these problems are being addressed. There is only one reason why they are being addressed in a successful manner, and that is that the work is being done by local people on the ground who live there. As soon as we start putting in place such things as what is here beyond the ANZECC position, increasing that bureaucracy, we are going to create another level of suspicion around this whole process.

         I have great reservations about this legislation. I do not believe that it will achieve what we are being told it will achieve. I also want to place on the public record some information I received from the Western Australian state minister, Kevin Minson. It seems that since 1990 there has been a change of position by the federal government, moving away from uniformity and towards consistency. While that, in itself, is a good thing, it does not mean there is still a necessity for this measure. We need to know what the government's long-term intention is. I will quote from the press statement put out yesterday by Mr Minson:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am delighted that in a recent letter to me which he circulated, Senator Faulkner now says that it would not be sensible or practical to require identical environmental protection measures in all parts of the country.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator Faulkner must now also admit that there is no need to create his new El Supremo of pollution control, the proposed National Environment Protection Council (NEPC). It would be unnecessary, costly, inefficient and a whole new layer of government bureaucracy.
       </para>

        He wants harmonious measures instead of uniform ones. I agree with such an aim, achieved through existing federal processes such as the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council.

        I have already mentioned the council. The press statement continues:

        ANZECC, without NEPC, is already far advanced on a National Water Quality Management Strategy.

        The original justification of NEPC given by the Commonwealth Government was that it was the only way to achieve uniform national standards and override State and Territory pollution control agencies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Expertise and responsibility rest with the States. Senator Faulkner now also agrees that measures may vary across a State. It makes no practical sense to try to centralise control and make each State Environmental Protection Authority an agent of the EPA in Canberra or NEPC.

        I think it is important that these concerns that have been expressed by a number of people on this side of the chamber are put on the record. It is also important that we get a commitment from the government in terms of this legislation that the bureaucratic process is not going to interfere with a lot of good work that is already being done across Australiaâ€”whether it has to do with protection of the environment, identifying some areas as pristine and to be left alone, or whether it has to do with sustainable development. My concern is that every time we put a costly level of bureaucracy into the process, we end up with a result that is not the right result and which impacts in the wrong way.

         Having raised those particular issues and concerns, I also note the amendment that Senator Ian Macdonald will move in due course. I particularly support this amendment because it will make this legislation much more sensible and it also emphasises the points that need to be made with regard to the amendments to be moved by the government. I suggest that those amendments have resulted from Senator Faulkner's somewhat changed position to that of the government's back in 1990 when the agreement was signed.

We are prevented in this chamber from amending it and that, of course, bypasses the proper political process.

         In this caseâ€”as I suspect, although the minister has not stated as suchâ€”one of the prime reasons that the government will not accept amendments is that we are dealing with this need for complementary legislation. I put this back to the opposition to consider the fact that it is wanting this complementary legislation. One downside of that is that that complementarity necessarily bypasses the proper political process: we cannot amend this legislation. We have been in that position before. Members of the opposition are picking this up quite frequently in relation to international agreements and saying that that is imposing requirements on Australia which are unacceptable and which bypass the proper political process and consideration, and, to a degree, we agree with them. I simply ask them to reflect on the fact that we are dealing with legislation which they want in this form because they want state involvement and yet the same principle is involved.

         This preamble seeks to anticipate amendments in three areas. Firstly, it seeks to remove the references to take into account regional, environmental differences in Australia. We are taking a position here that is very different from that of the opposition. The intergovernmental agreement, which is published as a schedule to this bill, mentions for instance that among other things the parties agree that a national approach should be taken to rare, vulnerable and endangered species. This is given the fact that the distribution of these species and their habitats is not confined or determined by state or Commonwealth borders and that a national approach is desirable to avoid duplication of effortâ€”the very thing that Senator Knowles was concerned aboutâ€”to ensure appropriate outcomes and to maximise the effectiveness of available resources.

         The various states and the Commonwealth recognised in this intergovernmental agreement the uniform nature of the problems in relation to terrestrial and aquatic species, degradation of land, salinisation and all those sorts of things, and the states have agreed to this need for uniform standards and legislation. So the provision in this bill for the recognition of regional environmental differences, we believeâ€”and the opposition's amendment that it would seek to move later on goes even furtherâ€”is simply a cop out, a way in which the environmental standards can be distorted to allow damaging processes to occur in one area or state and to give a state a temporary industrial, environmental advantage with lower costs to attract industry to that area, rather than to go into another area where higher standards obtain.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Incidentally, Senator Knowles cannot maintain that the states are doing a perfect job of looking after the environment when we have incredible land degradation and salinisation and the worst loss of species of any country in the world. We have feral animals that are raging across this country, across state borders. We have water quality which is deteriorating in every area. We have air quality in cities which is atrocious. We have greenhouse gas emissions, which are among the highest in the world. For Senator Knowles to somehow imply that the states are perfectly looking after the environment and there is no need for Commonwealth intervention just flies in the face of so much evidence. This first section of the preamble, which anticipates a later amendment to allow these regional differences, is simply to allow some parts of the country to get away with lower environmental standards and to continue to degrade their environment.

         Secondly, we seek to provide for non-government environmental organisations to have observer status on the National Environment Protection Council. This goes part of the way to meeting that input by concerned, ordinary people that the opposition referred to so enthusiastically a few moments ago to allow their participation by way of having observer status on the National Environment Protection Council.

         Indeed, contrary again to what Senator Knowles said and as I mentioned in my speech on the second reading debate, in the ANOP survey of 1991 when people right across Australia were asked whether they wanted and supported national environmental standards, 68 per cent said that yes, they supported national environmental standards. So they want the national standards but, of course, it is appropriate and there are mechanisms within this legislation by which they should have access to them.

        is interesting. It is a substantive work in terms of volume and has quite a lot of detail. Obviously, it has not been possible for me to read the 370-odd pages in the time that the document has been available to us. I focus, however, on some comments made in the document in relation to Vietnam. Whilst the document is generally fairly accurate, from what I can see, particularly in relation to its comment on Singapore and Brunei, I think it is appropriate to look at the comments that have been made about Vietnam, especially in view of the current interest in this country about liberalisation in Vietnam and some of the hype that has been going around.

         On page 179 there is a prediction that the government will be unlikely to increase the scope of sugar production. I think the exact phrase is that the scope of further expansion of sugar cane production would appear limited and mainly focused on domestic demand. This comment is inaccurate. It is true that in previous years production of sugar has never exceeded 475,000 tonnes of raw sugar equivalent; last year it was about 420,000 tonnes.

         But it is also very clear that the government has set as one of its priorities an increase in the production of raw sugar to one million tonnes per annum by the year 2000. It is not correct to say that there is limited scope for expansion of the sugar industry. In fact, the government is setting aside areas and is expected in the next year or two to open up an entirely new area for the production of sugar cane. The problems which have existed to date have been problems in relation to the processing of cane.

         It is entirely possible that they could get substantially greater volumes of cane in Vietnam than are currently being grown at the moment. Remember that in Vietnam every single tonne of cane is cut by hand; most cane is grown on farms that do not exceed 1 1/2 hectares; and the cane is cut by the people who grow it. There is no effort at the moment to put mechanisation into the harvesting of cane and the varieties of cane that are grown are old and inefficient and the yields that are being achieved are very low.

         As a consequence, there is substantial scope for improving the tonnage of cane which is cut, particularly with substantial investment from Taiwan. I know there is a proposal for the Taiwanese to build a sugar mill as well as plant between what I understand to be several hundred thousand tonnes of cane. There is very good scope for improvement in the tonnage of cane that will come off, and that will be driven very heavily by foreign investment. So I think it is a little dubious for us to assume that there will not be some growth in cane production.

         I also note that the document overlooks one of the areas of growth for the Vietnamese agricultural industry, which is palm oil production, again driven on the back of investment from principally Malaysia this time. That is in reaction to a slow but noticeable increase in the cost of farm labour in Malaysia. Of course, palm oil production being reasonably labour intensive, the Malaysians have sought to move outside Malaysia and there has been very heavy investment in Vietnam.

         I conclude my comments tonight by focusing on the comments about cattle production. It is true that cattle numbers have doubled to around 3.3 million head over the last decade. But that does not equate to good quality cattle or beef production. The average weight of an animal going to market, I understand from the national veterinary company, is only 200 on to 250 kilos live weight. The reason why the animals are so small at the age of three years is that they have been worked in the field pulling a plough for two or three years before finally being knocked on the head. As a consequence, they are animals of low carcass quality.

         If we add to that the fact that there is rampant foot and mouth disease and tuberculosis, that there are no disease control mechanisms to prevent animals moving from infected areas to non-infected areas and that the farmers do not have the money to invest in looking after those animals, I think it is fair to say that the Vietnamese cattle industry does not offer a substantial threat to Australia.

         In 1993-94 this government spent $114 billion, up nearly $5 billion or 4.3 per cent. The government took in revenue of over $100 billion; for the first time in this nation's history, this government has taken from the Australian people in revenue over $100 billion. That was an increase of $5.6 billion, up 5.9 per cent, at a time when the recession was only just coming to an end. As a result, we have a deficit of $13.6 billion.

As a result, the government has had to borrow in the last financial year $13.6 billion, which has obvious consequences for real interest rates. We now have the highest real interest rates in the world. They have, of course, just gone up and they are going to keep on going up as a result of the deficit program of this government.

If we look at the crunch issue, total income tax on individuals, as revealed by this document, has gone up 4.7 per cent in real terms.

This is the first financial year after the government's campaign against the GST, and it has increased sales tax by 10.8 per cent in real terms. Excise duty is up 10 per cent in real terms under a government that campaigned against the goods and services tax. Total tax revenue has almost doubled in 10 years of Labor. It has gone from $53 billion in 1984-85 to nearly $94 billion in 1993-94. Of course, when we add other revenue we get over $100 billion.

Despite taking so much money out of the hands of ordinary Australians, the government still continues to run big deficits. We have to pay tax money to pay the interest on the debt, and the debt keeps accumulating every year.

        I agree with Steve Biddulph that this is a question of national importance. It is a question which should concern this parliament. Our leaders would do well to consider his thesis because Australia needs a humanising of their leaders. We need elders rather than street fighters.

        (1) Austrade as a whole has not been the subject of an efficiency audit by the ANAO. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme, however, which is administered by Austrade under the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, was the subject of an efficiency audit by the Australian National Audit Office during 1993/94.

        (2) The Australian National Audit Office tabled Report No 33 "The Export Market Development Grants Schemeâ€”Its Efficiency and Effectiveness" in Parliament on 5 May 1994. The ANAO Report noted some very positive points about the EMDG Scheme and Austrade's administration of it. It also identified areas where improvements can be made. Austrade worked closely with the Australian National Audit Office in its examination of the EMDG Scheme. With minor reservations, Austrade fully supports and accepts all the ANAO recommendations. The resource implications and timing of implementing the recommendations are now being finalised.

He stated that the financial reporting systems of the corporation are of a very high standard, and further stated that criticism of the corporation citing alleged favouritism in housing allocation cannot be supported by a breach of any identified requirement.

        There are at present no Federal controls on replica plastic pistols, incapacitating spray packs, hand-cuffs or police truncheons. The Trade Practices Act 1974 and equivalent State/Territory consumer protection laws, however, have in the past been used to prohibit the supply of goods which are dangerous to consumers. In relation to State and Territory provisions, legislation differs between jurisdictions and the honourable senator should pursue this matter with individual jurisdictions.

        The Commonwealth is, however, strongly committed to curbing the availability of dangerous goods in the community and has played a leading role in having this issue addressed by the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. In May 1994, Ministers agreed to the expansion of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to include pistol crossbows, nunchukus, blowpipes, blowpipe darts and ballistic knives. Ministers also agreed to work towards the development of national standards on the prohibition of dangerous goods to ensure greater uniformity and cooperation between jurisdictions.

        (1) I am informed that the eagle series rugged high resolution colour monitors have a number of special characteristics which distinguish them from a standard PC monitor. Standard PC monitors are not generally regarded as suitable for the rigours of many defence and mining type applications. During their manufacture eagle monitors are "ruggedised". That is, they are specifically designed to withstand severe shocks, vibration, moisture and they are also magnetically shielded for security purposes. Typically these monitors are installed in tanks, trucks, patrol boats and military aircraft.

        (2) Yes. As a result of the agreement Australia's export potential of defence industry products is significantly enhanced. I believe that under the exclusive rights agreement, which BAeA has secured, all Codar eagle series monitors sold by Codar or BAeA into any Pacific Rim country will be manufactured in Australia by BAeA. Sales of eagle monitors may also enhance the sales of more sophisticated and related BAeA products such as operating consols.

        (4) The information technologies sector is one of the fastest growing and most dynamic sectors of the Australian economy, valued at $A11.2 billion in 1993 (2.1% of GDP) and forecast to grow to $A17.7 billion by 1998. Currently, Australian information technology exports are round $A1.4 billion annually, and growing strongly. These exports represent around 2.1% of total exports of goods and services for the financial year to date April 1993/94. The Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) reports that its members' imports of information technology goods and services have increased by some 8 per cent over 1992/93 figures, in line with market growth, to around $A2.3 billion. These imports represent around 3.35 percent of total imports of goods and services for the financial year to date April 1993/94.

        (5) For the financial year 1993/94 twelve international and four Australian information technology and telecommunications companies joined the Partnerships for Development (PfD) and Fixed Term Arrangements (FTA) Programs. Manufacturing formed an integral part of some companies' agreements. A number of international and Australian information technology and telecommunication companies have expressed an interest in joining the program in 1994-95 and it is expected that manufacturing activities will form part of their industry development undertakings. The Department of Industry, Science and Technology manages these programs which encourage international companies in the information and telecommunications industries to invest in commercially sound activities in Australia. Indigenous Australian companies which wish to have their growth potential recognised and which view a closer working arrangement with the Government as strategically important can also enter a Fixed Term Arrangement.

        (6) Exact figures relating to the number of people employed as a result of these activities are not available but the agreements are expected to substantially increase employment in the sector. The anticipated value of activities proposed by these companies for 1994 will amount to $A104 million of export income and $A33 million of direct investment and technology transfer. In 1993/94 Partnership companies reported exports of approximately $1.2 billion and research and development invested in Australia of $300 million. This is a sixfold increase on the 1988 levels when the first agreements were signed.

        (1) Fortunately, Israeli air attacks on Hizbollah bases in southern Lebanon do not appear to have affected negotiations between Israel and the PLO on the question of Palestinian self-rule. The signing on 4 May 1994 of the agreement on the transfer of Gaza and Jericho to Palestinian self-rule, the return of the PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat, to the self rule area, and the commencement of talks on the extension of self-rule in the West Bank all occurred against a backdrop of intermittent Israeli military action against Hizbollah in Lebanon. (As of 11 July, there had been 22 Israeli air raids against Lebanon in 1994.) Earlier, the Israeli ground and air assault against Lebanese territory in July 1993 failed to prevent the negotiating breakthrough that resulted, two months later, in the historic Declaration of Principles. The Israel-PLO talks have indeed proved remarkably resilient.

        Australia, nevertheless, deplores the continuing Israeli violations of Lebanon's sovereigntyâ€”especially Israel's self-declared `security zone' in southern Lebanon, which flouts UN Security Council Resolution 425â€”just as it deplores Hizbollah's attacks on targets in Israel. It is the Government's firm belief that the long-term stability of Lebanon, and an end to the violence in southern Lebanon, are dependent upon the conclusion of a comprehensive peace settlement in the region, including peace treaties between Israel and Syria, and Israel and Lebanon.

        (2) The Government receives regular advice from Israel and the PLO on their respective expectations of the peace process. Naturally, they frequently hold differing views of the same event or situation, since they are, after all, locked in a complex negotiating processâ€”one in which each side must also deal with its own internal disagreements over strategies and goals. In a sense, it is unrealistic to expect the two parties to have fully-developed, and publicly-aired views of the ultimate outcome of the peace process. We are still at the beginning of the interim phase, which is scheduled to end no later than May 1996. When this phase ends, talks on difficult issues affecting the permanent status of Gaza and the West Bank are scheduled to begin. For the time being, both sides are moving ahead warily, and the experience of the self-rule experiment will obviously shape their expectations of the future.

        It can, however, be said that the views of Israel and the PLO on some issues have of late grown a little closer. The leaders on both sides are aware of the obstacles in the path of the successful implementation (and extension) of Palestinian self-rule; and they are both doing all they can to maintain the negotiating momentum. For Israel, the most important test of the Palestinians' credibility as a negotiating partner is their ability to maintain public security, and to adhere to the spirit of their agreements with Israel. For the PLO, Israel's willingness to allow the extension of Palestinian self-rule, and not to stifle the new Authority's powers (or further erode its credibility), is critical. At the moment, both sides are guardedly optimisticâ€”even if they disagree over the desirability or inevitability of a Palestinian state, for example. We can only hope further progress fuels their optimism. But it would be foolish to ignore the potential for differences as it would be to assume that such differences are unbridgeable.

        Progress has also been made in several of the other tracks. The joint declaration between Israel and Jordan, signed in Washington on 25 July, effectively ended the state of belligerence between the two countries. Israel and Jordan have committed themselves to negotiate the early conclusion of a peace agreement and to take a series of practical steps to normalise their relations and embark on a new era of cooperation. The Australian Government certainly hopes that the breakthrough in the Israel/Jordanian track will breathe new life in the other negotiating tracks of the peace process. In fact, the Israel/Syrian track is now showing signs of renewed progress following US Secretary of State Christopher's recent visit to the region. The United States is playing a role as an active intermediary between the two parties who have begun to outline to each other their views on issues of substance.

        (3) In the course of regular contacts with the PLO, Australia has indeed received requests that we do more to channel our official assistance to the occupied territories directly through the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), the PLO's own development arm. As you know, there is an urgent need for financial assistance to, and reconstruction in, the self-rule areas. Last October, Australia agreed to contribute $15 million over three years towards economic development in the occupied territories. But in view of the critical importance of start-up funding for the new Authority, we have decided to provide over $1 million in immediate cash assistance through a World Bank trust fund.

        (4) The Australian Government will, of course, maintain contact with the Palestinian Authority (and with the Palestinian Council, once that is elected) but it cannot conduct a diplomatic relationship with any Palestinian governing authority until such time as that authority represents a state. That is because Australia recognises states, not governments, and there is at present no Palestinian state or `State of Palestine' in existence. The establishment of such a state may well be the outcome of the current peace process, but it would be premature to anticipate that outcome at this stage.

        Our current policy towards the PLO is based on the same logic.

        (1)&amp;(3) Training and Development Branch, Human Resources and Management Division, has purchased eight sets of `People Skills' videos from Seven Dimensions Pty Ltd. `People Skills' is a set of 20 modules designed to develop all aspects of communication skills, covering personal effectiveness, team skills, core communication skills, leadership and handling difficult situations. One set was purchased in October 1993 at a cost of $8 000 for use by participants on the Department's Graduate Development Program. Seven more sets were purchased in May 1994, at a cost of $45 270, for use by the training areas in each of the regions. (The entry of $44 800 in the Purchasing and Disposals Gazette No. 21 of 1 June 1994 was an incorrect entry and should have been deleted before publication. The correct entry is the one, also in Gazette No. 21, for $45 270; that is, the total cost of the seven sets of videos was $45 270.)

        (5) The videos purchased in October 1993 have been used as part of relevant courses held in Canberra and were borrowed for regional training purposes. Due to the positive feedback from trainers and course participants about the videos, sets were provided to the regional training areas in May 1994 and have been used to date for relevant courses by five regions. The remaining two regions (Perth and Darwin) have courses scheduled during which the videos will be used. Trainers and trainees have found the videos make a valuable contribution to courses covering communication and people skills.

In instances where the preparation of such work as described previously is under $ 2,000, only one quote will usually be sought. In all other instances, ATSIC will seek the best value for money in an open and effective marketplace by seeking multiple quotes, not only from large printing houses, but also from small to medium sized enterprises. This process provides for the best value for money criterion under the Government's Better Buying Principles to be met.

Australia has signed and ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and under the Convention is committed to aim for stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. The Government has adopted the National Greenhouse Response Strategy as a first step towards meeting its obligations under the Convention. By adopting the NGRS Australia has undertaken to act on energy consumption and greenhouse emissions. The Government has repeatedly stated that climate change is a global problem which needs a global response in an equitable manner. While developed countries have recognised the need to take the first steps in addressing climate change, the problem can only be solved if all countries eventually take actions consistent with the objective of the convention. The Government recognises that the convention will benefit Australia. Our environment and economy, especially the agricultural sector, are potentially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

        (6) Australia is not abandoning, and will not abandon, the Framework Convention on Climate Change. It has gained substantial credibility on environmental issues. This credibility has allowed Australia to play an influential role in international environmental negotiations including the negotiations under the climate change convention. Part of Australia's credibility is that it has been frank and open about its own economic circumstances and the difficulties it faces in reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to the dependence on fossil fuels both for energy generation and in earning export income. Australia will play its part in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, but it will not take action which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries.

        (1) Part of the Government's reason for seeking to have the airlines collect the charge is that international comparisons have shown that the administrative costs of collection of the existing departure tax are high by world standards, at 4â€”5% of revenue collected, compared with about 2% in other countries with similar charges. The Government expects that it should be possible for collection costs for the new Passenger Movement Charge (PMC) to be of the same order. In deciding to implement the PMC, the Government also decided that it would meet the airlines' establishment and running costs of the necessary systems. The airlines are presently determining what those costs might be. On the assumption that the ongoing costs are comparable with international experience, there will be no costs to airlines for collecting the PMC. I might point out that the British government is imposing an Air Passenger Duty from 1 November 1994, to be collected by law by airlines, but will not be meeting  collection costs. This Government's decision to meet reasonable collection costs reflects our recognition of the importance of the travel and tourism industry to Australia, and the Government's desire to work with industry.

        (3) As reported by a Departmental official at Estimates Committee D on 26 May 1994 (page D49), the National Passenger Processing Committee (NPPC) Working Party on Cost Recovery Options for Passenger Processing considered the effect of cost recovery on passenger numbers. Drawing upon previous studies of demand elasticities for international travel, the NPPC Working Party calculated the possible hypothetical reduction in passenger numbers. Using the same methodology, an increase of $2 in the level of charges might lead to a reduction of between 2000â€”5000 travellers. However, the Working Party did not take into account the positive impact that increases in charges might have in inducing Australians to take domestic, rather than international, holidays and it therefore qualified its calculation by saying that `. . . the net impact on the tourist industry from a CIQ charge is unknown, but it will certainly be less than the figures above suggest, considering only foreign tourists. We cannot even be sure the overall impact will be negative.'  The other factor that the Working Party did not take into account is the effect that collection of the PMC by airlines will have on streamlining passenger movement at airports, contributing to a positive image of Australia as a destination because of the ease of movement into and out of the country. Overall, it is clear that the effect of the $2 increase will be negligible.

        Most private colleges and public institutions retain their own requirement that applicants pre-pay part or all course fees. Recognising the need to safeguard such pre-paid tuition fees and the integrity of Australia's international reputation following the collapse of the Australian Business College in Perth in January 1993, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training held an inquiry into the efficacy of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 (the ESOS Act). The Committee's report recommended that the ESOS Act be amended to require that pre-paid international students' funds be placed in formal trust accounts. Similarly, the Committee recommended that providers be members of tuition assurance schemes which would guarantee the protection of students' funds and/or the delivery of courses equivalent to those that had been paid for. The requirements relating to trust accounts and tuition assurance schemes apply only to non-exempt providers.

        (5) "Face to Face" provides guidance in the conduct of performance appraisals from the perspective of both the appraiser and appraisee. Both videos present two appraisal scenarios (in a neutral work environment, using professional actors). The first is an employee and her supervisor who both dread appraisal because both approach it in the wrong way. The second scenario shows performance appraisal conducted well. The scenarios are structured such that the good manager advises the poor  manager as to how to get more out of appraisal (Video 1 and Booklet 1), and the well-managed employee helps the poorly managed employee get the most out of her appraisal (Video 2 and Booklet 2). The booklet and accompanying overhead projections clearly indicate appraisal do's and don'ts.

        "Side by Side", on the other hand, is structured as a meeting of managers (using the same neutral work environment and the same actors), discussing the merits of striking performance agreements. As such, it is far more didactic in tone than "Face to Face", but is nevertheless extremely interesting as a training tool, run by the officer him- or herself together with supervisor, which actually results in a complete performance agreement at the end of the process.

        (1)-(8) This information is not readily available. For an organisation as large as Defence, it would take a disproportionate effort across all Defence Programs throughout Australia to retrieve this information manually. The diversion of Defence resources for such a purpose cannot be justified. Arising from the Government's purchasing initiatives announced on 4 May 1994, more detailed purchasing information will become available in the future as electronic commerce is gradually introduced and the new National Procurement Board directs its attention to developing and disseminating purchasing statistics for all Commonwealth agencies.
