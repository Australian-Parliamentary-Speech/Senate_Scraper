I ask: did any Government Minister or any of its officials have any discussions, formal or informal, by phone or otherwise, with the Victorian Labor Government or its officials before 17 June; and, if so, when? Did Treasurer Dawkins or any other Minister or any official receive a draft letter from the then Victorian Treasurer, Tony Sheehan, before 17 June; and, if so, when? Will the Government now release all minutes, notes and correspondence on this issue?

I have not discussed that matter with Mr Cole but, as I recall, he said that the Treasury officials were handed a copy of a draft letter, undated, from Victoria on 17 June. As I recall the press reports, that is what Mr Cole said, and he dealt with one or two other matters which are the subject of Senator Short's question.

For the first time now, multiple designation has been agreed for the carriers of both countries. As well, airlines of both countries will have the opportunity to introduce an additional 26 services per week by 1995, which represents almost a 50 per cent increase in the capacity on this route.

         The increase in capacity negotiated will provide significant capacity for allocation by the International Air Services Commission to meet the requirements of new entrants and the future growth on this route. Australian carriers will also be able to operate through Jakarta, with enhanced traffic rights, and to serve Kuala Lumpur en route. Traffic right connections to Vietnam and Cambodia have also been secured.

         Singapore Airlines has also been given permanent authority to operate a second weekly freighter service into Australia effective immediately, and a third service from 1994. This is welcome news indeed for Australian export and import industries. With the finalisation of this agreement, Australia now has multiple designation rights under all of its existing air service agreements in South East Asia.

         The importance of these new arrangements with Singapore for the tourism industry cannot be underestimated. For example, for the year ended 31 December 1991, Singapore figured in three of the top 10 city pair routes to Australia. Singapore's role as a major transit point in Asia is well known. With the finalisation of this new air services agreement, Australia is well placed to take advantage of the expected large growth in passengers and freight in the Asia-Pacific region.

         Australia adopted the ILO convention concerning freedom of association 19 years ago, and has adhered to it ever since. The supervising committee of the ILO—the committee of experts; a body of jurists of international repute—last year asked Australia to re-examine its domestic industrial relations law. It held that the existence in this country of tort law on industrial relations and of sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act were in breach of the ILO convention I have referred to.

         In order to cut off any interjections or points of order, may I say that the Australian Government is the affiliate of, and has the responsibility of answering to, the ILO on these matters. Given the ILO's expression of view on sections 45D and E, it is interesting to note that in the Jobsback—properly called `Jobsack'—policy announced by the Opposition on 22 October, Mr Howard indicated quite clearly that he would continue the existence of sections 45D and E even though those provisions are found to be in contravention of the international labour law. He has also expressed the view that common law liability would obtain in Australia which, again, is in contravention of international labour law as declared by the ILO, and which Australia is bound to observe, given its adoption of those conventions.

         The other area where one needs to look is the essential services area. I have already indicated what the finding of the jurists, the committee of experts, has been with respect to the New South Wales legislation in that area. It is clear that the Kennett Vital Industries Bill is in flagrant breach of most of the provisions of that convention, and Australia would get a black mark if that legislation were carried. If one looks at the `Jobsack' proposal, there is an imitation of the Vital Industries Bill in that being proposed by the Opposition for the national government. If that were carried, that would be in breach as well.

         After the election of 1975 I recall that members of the Democrats in this place, led by Don Chipp, had to sign a pledge not to oppose a principal financial measure or Supply in the Senate.

We are talking about the Opposition's $40 billion package, including $27 billion worth of new taxes to be imposed on the Australian people. That is clearly a centrepiece of any Opposition proposal.

The Minister illustrates an appalling lack of history: the Democrats were not formed until 1977, so how we took that action in 1975 I am not too sure. The Minister has not answered the first part of the question, relating to the constitutional basis. Further, will the Government be issuing a comprehensive guide on how it will vote on the coalition's promised legislation so that Australians are fully informed of the extent to which Labor will wimp out on its principles when and if it is elected to opposition?

During those interviews it became apparent that these boat people had been the victims of a very unscrupulous racket: they had been tempted and duped into believing that if they made their way to Australia they would achieve a better life for themselves by securing employment, perhaps being able to bring their families out and so on.

The way in which these people were dealt with so speedily probably came as something of a surprise to the Australian people, but it happens constantly at airports. When people arrive at airports without proper documentation—with no legal basis for their entry to Australia—they are turned around very quickly through the international terminals, as the Minister for Transport and Communications would know. Where people have no legal basis on which to remain here, they will be turned around as quickly and as practicably as possible.

         It is very important that the integrity of our immigration laws be maintained and that people cannot arrive here on an expectation that, simply by making our shores, even to Christmas Island, they will automatically secure some sort of entry to Australia. Departmental officials assessed that they were not asylum seekers. The Government cannot condone attempts to enter Australia through queue jumping, and the message to be taken back to those who might be duped into entering or tempted to enter into similar schemes is that they should not undertake such a perilous voyage without the very firm prospect of being turned around as soon as possible.

Both governments believed that these people had been exploited by others for the unscrupulous profiteering motives which set these people on that perilous journey.

         There is some confusion about the Opposition's aviation policy because of a speech Senator Short delivered to an aviation seminar in Sydney, which I have referred to in the Senate before. Senator Short had the Opposition's policy stated as going from open skies at the one extreme, and I have a copy of his speech here in front of me. In the first paragraph of his speech on page 7 he states:

        This is at the one extreme, but three paragraphs later he makes a most extraordinary statement. I would like clarification as to whether or not this is the Opposition's policy. Senator Short says that it is. He stated that the Opposition would give Qantas the first right of refusal before any other carrier gets a crack at an international route.

         It is a fair question for members of the Opposition as to how they advocate an open skies policy, which in itself is iniquitous, which would allow untrammelled rights for international carriers in Australia without negotiating reciprocal rights for Australian carriers and without the nonsense of then saying that they will allow only Australian carriers other than Qantas access to international routes if Qantas does not want them. It is an absolute nonsense of an aviation policy and it is about time the coalition straightened it out.

In so far as industrial relations legislation is concerned, I would not fall into the Opposition trap of suggesting, as Senator Bell does by implication, that any industrial relations legislation from the Opposition will be of crucial importance.

         This is by far the biggest workplace agreement negotiated in Australia. It will cover 150,000 Australians. It is a two-year closed agreement. It will represent savings to the Budget. There are three areas of gain sharing. There is an up-front payment of 2 per cent paid for by across the Service productivity gains. There is gain sharing at agency level as the negotiations move to that level. And there is a provision called foldback which aims to restore the pay classification structure at the end of the two-year period.

Now Senator Boswell has lost the plot because, as he knows full well, Mr Crean and the Danish Minister met and they talked about issues which were totally unrelated to this particular business project. Senator Boswell knows that to be true. But he is trying to delve, as he has done in the past, into a hopeless barrel of rubbish, which is not getting him anywhere.

         —A resolution, which was co-sponsored by Australia and Canada, on restricting smoking on international air services was agreed at the ICAO assembly held last month in Montreal. The resolution urges all ICAO countries to take necessary measures as soon as possible to restrict smoking progressively on all international passenger flights, with the objective of implementing complete smoking bans on these flights by 1 July 1996. This initiative is a forward looking and responsible approach to protect all operating crews and passengers travelling on international services from the hazards of tobacco smoke.

Is the Minister aware that searchers for two Tasmanians tragically lost in a recent light plane crash in northern Tasmania claimed that their lack of knowledge regarding the plane's intended flight path seriously hampered the search? Does the Government recognise that the lack of vital flight path information in the form of a flight plan may mean the difference between life and death during times of aviation emergency and that this position cannot be allowed to continue?

Not only is the Opposition proposing that Australians fund the health scheme through ordinary taxation contributions and the Medicare levy, but also it wishes to add to the tax and Medicare levy contributions the payment of private health insurance premiums as a compulsory feature of the funding of health and hospital care throughout Australia. So there will be three elements which the ordinary person and household in Australia would have to face if Fightback were ever implemented.

         In order to ameliorate the effect on those in the community earning very low incomes, it is proposed by the Opposition that some sort of subsidy be offered. However, the hundreds of millions of dollars to fund that subsidy will come direct from the cutback in expenditure on the public hospital system which, unfortunately, will also be part of the Fightback policy. If 5 per cent of funds are taken away from the States, the States will find it very difficult to allocate sufficient funds to the public hospital system. The hundreds of millions of dollars that will be saved by the Opposition in that regard may be used to mask the real pain of the compulsory private health insurance premium that the Opposition would require to be paid by every Australian and every Australian household.

         We know full well, as does everybody else who reads the Budget Papers, that the Medicare levy pays for only 20 per cent of the total cost of health. Therefore, anyone who pays the levy, which is virtually every single solitary taxpayer—there is a proportion who do not have to pay it, but that is a very low base—also has to pay increased taxation to pay for the remaining 80 per cent of health costs. If they are privately insured, they have to take out private health insurance. That is the third cost. The fourth cost is the gap insurance, because this Government will not allow the private hospital people to insure for whatever they want.

        The Federal Government has admitted for the first time that it has a Medicare problem. . . The major problem with Medicare from the public hospital sector's perspective has been the increased numbers of `free' public patients and the decline in `paying' private patients. . . There are limits to how much efficiency can be forced without affecting patient access and quality of care. . . A fully public funded system controls costs effectively through an explicit cap on hospital budgets. However, the limits on raising taxpayer funds inevitably leads to more service rationing, longer waiting lists and stifles innovation in technology and management.

        On the one hand, we get that statement, and, on the other hand, we get the answer that Senator Tate gave today. It defies belief that Senator Tate can get up and give that sort of an answer, totally ignoring what is occurring out there at the workplace in the hospital system. He is condemned by his own public hospital system spokesman, yet he comes along here and gives an answer to a dorothy dixer which totally contravenes what is occurring in the rest of Australia.

         I do not know where Senator Tate gets that answer from. He is obviously caught up in whatever other portfolios he looks after, but he has no knowledge whatsoever of what is occurring. It is a purely political answer to bolster what is a failed system. The system is broke; it has failed. Fightback has an answer on how to refurbish the system. We will continue with the public hospital system as it exists today and put more money into it. There is no magic pudding. Senator Tate disregards the whole basis of the system, which was invented long before Medicare came into existence and which really brought out the high standard of hospital care that has been afforded to this country, both in public and in private. By continuing the line of garbage that he is giving us now and pretending that there is no problem there at all is a disservice to this Senate.

The speech was about the GST and its application to aviation, not about aviation policy as such. Senator Collins's answer shows not only how ignorant he is of the coalition's policies but also how misleading he can be and how ignorant he is of some of the basic terms that are used in aviation policy. Senator Collins claimed that I had said that the coalition's policy on aviation was an open skies policy. Senator Collins pointed to the part of the speech which said:

        While Qantas will remain our designated flag carrier and initially have the right to reject operating under any new agreements, the Coalition will be prepared to license additional Australian carriers for these overseas routes should Qantas not wish to operate such services.

        He left out the other words in the paragraph, which were:

       <para>
        Where Senator Collins made his fatal mistake in trying to draw a distinction between the paragraphs in the speech to which I have referred was that he wrongly quoted the first of my comments. He claimed that I was talking about an open skies policy. I was not talking about an open skies policy, because that is not the coalition's aviation policy. The coalition's aviation policy in this respect is to `open up the skies of Australia with the 100 per cent privatisation of Qantas; we will allow a very liberal approach to the granting of international air rights'.

         There is a vast difference between opening up the skies and having an open skies policy. I do not know what the Government's policy is on that matter, but I repeat that the coalition's policy is to open up the skies of Australia. I find it absolutely incredible that a person who comes in here and parades as knowing so much about his own policies and purports to know so much about the coalition's policy and gets it wrong should, first, find need to misrepresent the coalition's policy and, secondly, seemingly be so ignorant that he does not know the basic difference between those two key phrases.

         I hope that it was an honest mistake on the part of Senator Collins. After seeing some of his performances over recent times, I have to say that that stretches the credibility a little. I hope that, if it were an honest mistake, Senator Collins will come in here and apologise to me and to the Senate for such a deliberately misleading statement. More particularly, he owes it to himself to come and tell the Senate that he really is not quite as ignorant on some of things as he appears to be.

         The Senate may at times be uncomfortable, and at times it may not be easy for governments to get their legislation through. At times it requires skill. That skill is demanded of every person who sits in this place and in the other place. Unfortunately, in recent times we have seen a reduction in those skills. What we see in the other House, which we will not tolerate and should not tolerate in this place, is the slanging matches, the gutter politics and the guillotine.

          I would like to point out to Senator Hill that I did not liaise with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in a political matter. I spoke to a senior member of his staff and said that I wished to speak to the Prime Minister. Naturally, I was asked what the issue was. The issue was the fact that Senator Hill and Senator Short had just been to see me and raised an issue with me. I said at that stage that I was contemplating writing a letter in response to the approach they had made, but that I was thinking it over and was seeking advice from the Clerk of the Senate. That is as far as that conversation went. Later that evening—and I have pointed out the functions that I had to attend that night—when I was able to speak to the Prime Minister, I advised him of my statement, and that is all.

         I refer to Federal Airports Corporation Regulations (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 255) and Federal Airports (Amendment) By-laws No. 1 1992, which the Committee considered at its meeting of 17 September 1992.
        </para>

         In respect of the regulations, the Committee draws the following matters to your attention:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         First, it appears that there are several possible errors in the regulations:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (a)Regulation 9(4) refers to certain actions mentioned in `subparagraphs (2)(iv) to (ix) (inclusive)'. The Committee assumes that the reference should probably be to `subparagraphs (2)(a)(iv) to (ix) (inclusive)'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (b)
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Regulation 10(5) refers to
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         `the area identified as "G" in the dredging area'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         `Dredging area' is not defined in the regulations, but as there is a specific definition of `dredging site' in regulation 3(1), the Committee concludes that regulation 10(5) should refer to `dredging site'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (c)There appears to be a small typographical error in the last line of clause 8 of the Schedule 1, where `addresses' should probably be `addressed'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Secondly, regulation 13 gives to the Chief Executive Officer power to delegate his or her powers `in writing to an employee'. The Committee notes that the definition of `employee' in section 3(1) of the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 refers to a person employed under s. 61(1) which provides that the
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         `Corporation may employ such persons as it thinks necessary for the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As the power of delegation seems to be a very wide one, the Committee would appreciate advice as to its breadth in the present context.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In respect of the by-laws, the Committee notes that by-law 15G.9 enables an airport officer to serve a smoking infringement fine, to be paid immediately, for certain offences. In contrast to the smoking infringement notice system also established by these by-laws, the fines system does not set out the level of the fines or, for example, the currency in which such fines might be paid. The Committee has in mind here transit passengers who may be unable to pay a fine in Australian currency. It would also be interested to establish what steps would be taken if a person were unable or unwilling to pay the fine.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee would appreciate your advice on these matters and also as to whether the system of penalties under the by-laws have been established under other instruments of delegated legislation.

         Dear Senator Loosley
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I refer to your letter of 17 September 1992 in which you drew my attention to a number of matters arising from the Committee's consideration of the Federal Airports Corporation Regulations (Statutory Rules 1992 No. 255) (the Regulations) and the Federal Airports (Amendment) By-laws No. 1 1992 (the By-laws).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I confirm that the matters raised in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of your letter are indeed typographical errors within the Regulations and thank the Committee for drawing them to my attention. Although these matters affect neither the clear intention nor the validity of the Regulations, I would propose that they be corrected when the Regulations are next amended.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As to the second matter you raised in relation to the Regulations, namely the apparent width of the power of delegation, I am advised that the only delegates to date are the General Manager, Sydney Airport and the Manager, Technical Services at Sydney Airport. Both of these people have detailed knowledge of the project, the environmental impact statement and the recommendations of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (as she then was). Due to the environmental sensitivity of this project, the Corporation does not intend to delegate powers under the Regulations to any persons other than senior managers who have direct personal knowledge of the project requirements and environmental processes.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In relation to the By-laws, I advise that the smoking infringement fine and notice systems work in tandem. The various offences and penalties are spelt out in by-laws 15G.2, 15G.4 and 15G.8. Where a person breaches by-law 15G.2 (smoking in a terminal building) the airport officer may proceed by way of a smoking infringement notice only. However, where a person breaches by-law 15G.4 (failure to answer questions relating to identity) or 15G.8 (failure to comply with a direction to extinguish smoking materials) the airport officer may proceed by way of a smoking infringement fine, payable immediately. In each case, the penalties are spelt out in the relevant offence provisions, namely, by-laws 15G.2, 15G.4 and 15G.8. The system of penalties under the By-laws has not been established under any other instrument of delegated legislation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         As with all Australian statutes, the penalties are payable in Australian currency. As you would be aware, all Australian international airports have facilities for the exchange of foreign currency. In any event, the fact that penalties are payable in Australian currency would not preclude an airport officer accepting payment in foreign currency to an equivalent value.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Finally, you have sought my advice as to what steps would be taken if a person were unable or unwilling to pay the fine. This would clearly depend upon the particular circumstances of the breach. However, in the case of a recalcitrant smoker the FAC's ultimate sanction would be to refer the matter to the Federal Police as it would any other criminal act.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I hope that the above information is of assistance to your Committee.

We have had to call a party meeting this morning to deal with legislation that has only just been received by us but has yet to be debated in the House of Representatives this week. Legislation is being shoved through this parliamentary process with no proper consideration at all. The Government might not worry so much about that in the House of Representatives but we do worry about it in this place because it is an important part of our function.

        Mr President, the practice has been for the program to get worse with each sitting session during the period of the Hawke Government and then the Keating Government. But it has never got as bad as it has got today. This is a government in shambles; it has not got its program properly together because it is preoccupied with electoral matters and defending the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), abusing the Senate and other matters that the Prime Minister obviously considers to be of higher priority. But unless we put on the record at the moment our protest at the state of this program, we are going to be told in a few weeks' time that we have not been handling it properly. The point is that if we had been handling it properly, we could have got on to the Appropriations debate last Thursday; the Government was not ready and now we are presented with this mass of legislation that it says should be processed properly before the end of this session, in three weeks.

        This will be another test for the Australian Democrats. When are they going to join with the Government in passing the guillotine motion this session as they have in all previous sessions after swearing they would never do it? When are we going to come in here one morning and find that the conspiracy has happened? Senator McMullan will get up and say, `With the support of the Australian Democrats, I wish to apply the guillotine motion' which will ensure that legislation in the Senate is not dealt with properly before the Christmas recess. It is not good enough. The Senate should protest about this abuse of the program and it is about time it got its program in order.

        This urgency debate today will give Labor senators the opportunity to stand behind the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the decision he made the other day that the Labor Party in opposition would support the key parts of the Opposition's Fightback program, specifically including the goods and services tax. It is important that the matter be debated today in order to give Labor senators that opportunity, as we read that some of them are already suggesting otherwise outside  the chamber. I noticed that one senator is quoted by Bruce Jones in last weekend's

        That comment is said to have come from one senior ALP senator at the end of last week. We know that the ALP Caucus members were taken by surprise in this announcement by the Prime Minister, but this will give them the opportunity to stand up today and say, `We agree with the Prime Minister that a coalition government should be supported in its Fightback program because the people would have given it the mandate to implement that program'.

It is urgent because we are about to have a Federal election and the Australian people are entitled to know whether this is just the view of the Prime Minister or whether the Caucus is going to support him. Why is that important? It is important because tax reform will, as this motion indicates, give the opportunity for personal income tax to be reduced by 30 per cent. Fightback provides for personal income tax in this country to be reduced by 30 per cent—the largest income tax reduction in Australia's history. It will enable wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and the tax on fuel to be abolished. The wholesale sales tax, much recognised for its inefficient structure, payroll tax, which is a tax on jobs, and the tax on fuel, which particularly hurts those in rural Australia and small businesses, will all be abolished. That is included in the Fightback program and it is part of the benefit of the restructuring of tax. This tax reform will enable family allowances to be doubled for lower income families and it will require that tax cheats bear a fairer share of the tax burden.

         It was not really surprising for us to hear that the Prime Minister, in some ways, did not hold such a strong objection to a goods and services tax or to consumption taxes generally because he has previously supported those taxes. I am going to spend a little time today, Mr Acting Deputy President, reminding you of the occasions on which the Prime Minister has supported a goods and services tax in this country because it demonstrates the hypocrisy of this man and it demonstrates really where he does stand on the economic issue of whether this tax reform is in the best interests of Australia.

We never can be absolutely sure where his genuine belief lies; whatever is most politically opportune at the moment is what we get from Mr Keating.

         We can go back in history to the time when he was formulating the tax policy and look at what he said about the need for Australia to have a goods and services tax. In 1985 he was taking the running on the issue; he got rolled in the end by the trade union movement in concert with some of the social security lobby groups. Nevertheless, he made it absolutely unambiguously clear that it was in Australia's best interests to have a consumption tax, to have a goods and services tax, to have a VAT, in other words, to broaden the tax base in this way—

        That is Mr Keating; that is not Dr Hewson. While I am on that subject, it reminds me of the mischief that this Government is talking about our tax proposals as additional taxes. I think we heard it from Senator Button today in Question Time. Fightback is a program that reduces the tax take in this country by about $6 billion. It restructures the taxation system from within, but it substantially reduces taxation. Fightback is a low tax program and it is important that the Australian people know that. They should not believe what Senator Button says, or members of the Government who, for purposes of political opportunism, simply suggest something else.

         I come back to what the now Prime Minister Keating was saying in 1985. I remind honourable senators of his speech to the National Press Club on 5 June of that year. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is now well recognised that the Australian tax system is unfair. It is also widely appreciated that it encourages inefficiency and is extraordinarily complex.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has changed? Nothing has changed. He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Clearly, there is a need for action: for reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        He said that we must commit ourselves to a number of different propositions, the first of which is that the tax base must be broadened. Here he is again, endorsing the principle of broadening the tax base through some form of value added tax, as practically every other industrialised country in the world has done. It is not surprising that he was standing with all of the rest of the industrialised world. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        the ideals of tax reform require us to commit ourselves to lower marginal tax rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the Fightback program. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        we should attempt to use the tax system to solve every problem that looks too difficult to solve in some other way.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to state something which I particularly want to remind the Senate about. He put down what he saw as the third main advantage of Australia's adopting a consumption tax. I remind the Senate that this is Mr Keating, the now Prime Minister of Australia, who was putting down these reasons which he said made out the case for a consumption tax for Australia. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        He is the one who is now saying the wholesale sales tax is perfect. He was saying in 1985, as we do now, and as every reasonable, objective person says, that it is full of anomalies. He went on to say that it could replace the anomalous wholesale sales tax system which had allowed multiple rates and numerous exemptions and which failed to tax the services sector. He is now going to condemn us for taxing services and in 1985 he was saying it was necessary for Australia to tax services if it was to catch up with the rest of the world in having an equitable and efficient taxation system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         He then went on to his second reason for a consumption tax in this country. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        This, I remind honourable senators again, is Fightback. If you broaden the tax base, you can get income tax marginal rates down. That is why we can reduce income tax across the board by about 30 per cent—as I said a minute ago, the largest income tax reductions in Australia's history. We are going to broaden the base of taxation and in 1985 Mr Keating endorsed that as the only way to go in the best interests of Australia. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.

        He was right again.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third reason he gave for supporting a consumption tax was that it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. What have we said? Catch the tax cheats. We have said that in a motion today, and what was Mr Keating saying in 1985? Implement a consumption tax because it will catch the tax cheats. He said:

        Mr Keating was saying then that our politicians had not had the strength of purpose, and yet he condemns Dr Hewson for having that strength of purpose. Of all things, after accusing Dr Hewson of being rigid in wanting to stick to the program, he then tries to justify his statement of last week by saying that members of the coalition are going around secretly saying to Australian voters, `Don't worry, because it won't get through the Senate'. We want to be elected to government in this country because we want to implement Fightback in full. It will give this country a chance again; it will give hope to Australians; and it includes the restructuring of the tax system in a more equitable and efficient way.

         I remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that practically every industrialised country in the world has implemented the reform that we seek to implement. Why have they done it? Because they recognise the need to get taxes off productivity. If we take them off productivity, we obviously have to provide revenue in some other form and consumption has all sorts of other benefits. It encourages saving and so forth. I suggest that Senator Button, who has an interest in these matters, look at the most recent IMF document that I have—I will give him the references if he likes—that talks about the value of this form of indirect tax both to the revenue because of its neutrality and, in particular, because of its efficiency.

That is the legacy of Labor. That is its record after 10 years of Government. That is what it is going to take to the Australian people. What do we do? We have the courage to put down a comprehensive program that gives Australia the chance to recover and gives young people the chance to get jobs in the future. It gives businesses the chance to expand and employ and, generally speaking, gives Australians hope. That is what Fightback is all about. It has been implemented by a leader who has the courage to stand up and support it, not in the way that the Prime Minister has. As soon as the heat is put on, opportunism drives him down another track. The Leader of the Opposition is someone who will take this program to the Australian people and implement it.

Since 1985 this Government has engaged in a whole range of taxation base broadening measures to which I want to refer the Senate. For example, we introduced the prescribed payments system to reduce the potential for fraud in the building industry and other subcontract industries. We introduced a capital gains tax—opposed by the Opposition—designed to underpin the integrity of the taxation system. We introduced a fringe benefits tax, opposed at the time by the Opposition. We introduced overseas tax haven legislation, opposed at the time by the Opposition. We introduced a tax file number, opposed at the time by the Opposition. We introduced an assets test to more fairly administer the pension system, opposed at the time by the Opposition, except Mr John Elliott, the President of the Liberal Party at the time, who was concerned with bigger numbers rather than those which involved pensioners and was able to see his way clear to support the base broadening of the tax.

There is a pretence put in all of this that somehow it will be dealing with tax cheats. Mr Reith, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, frequently refers to how the GST will deal with tax cheats. I remind Mr Reith and all Opposition senators here that the countries with the smallest black economy in the world per capita are the United States of America and Switzerland. Neither of those countries has a goods and services tax of this kind.

         Of course, it is an inequitable tax. Let me deal with the question of equity. The Opposition claims that personal income tax cuts will be made. Those tax cuts do not compensate people with incomes under $40,000 for bracket creep and the price effects of the GST. The Treasury analysis of the distributional impact of the GST and the associated changes is that 70 per cent of households of full time wage and salary earners and about 60 per cent of self-employed people will be worse off under a GST. However, the Treasury analysis—and, indeed,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         . The Treasury analysis shows that very high income households are better off—and too right they are. Not only will they get huge personal tax benefits of the sort I have read out; a goods and services tax on clothing and footwear and food does not bear nearly as much on high income earners as it does on low income earners. Low income earners spend more of their budgets on food, clothing and things of that sort than do higher income earners. So the poor and middle classes are made worse off. A household with children and one full time wage earner with an income of up to $57,000 a year would be $400 a year worse off. Similar situations apply with self-employed and farm households with incomes of up to $61,000 a year.

         When we look at the impact of this proposed goods and services tax on business we see the same message. The switch from personal tax to a GST raises the compliance costs of the whole tax system. Costs paid by government and taxpayers in administration of the GST are higher per dollar of tax paid than for income taxes. A New Zealand study shows that compliance costs were much higher there, but the Opposition's GST will impose a massive burden particularly on small business. The GST will reduce the competitiveness of small business relative to larger business. This is a point which some Opposition senators have made here in the past.

         There are 700,000 businesses in Australia which will become tax collectors for the Government under a GST. Small businesses which have exemptions from payroll tax will be forced to pay the GST. This means that their costs will be increased relative to large businesses. The fact is that there are 600,000 small businesses in Australia which do not pay payroll tax. What benefit is the Opposition offering them? The benefit it is offering them is a GST with all the paperwork associated with it and no payroll tax exemption.

That is particularly true in respect of the payroll tax set-off to which I referred a minute or two ago.  The GST is more expensive to collect than PAYE tax and, therefore, it is an inefficient tax.

Senator Hill spent all his time addressing that sort of irrelevant stuff. But I am concentrating on this motion, and the fact is that, if we look at the claims relating to family allowances being doubled, families will be made worse off by the GST. The Opposition does not compensate families for the taxes that it will impose on them. The Opposition, for example, will impose a tax on child-care. A conservative estimate is an extra $300 a year for each child.

The overall $6 billion hole means that one would have to raise the GST, or abandon the promised tax cuts, as the Opposition did in 1977 when its previous Government went to the people of Australia promising tax cuts and never delivering them—fistfuls of dollars. Those opposite would have to abandon the promised tax cuts, reduce government services or drop the already hopelessly inadequate compensation packages. The whole question of compensation in this alleged package and new tax is a very vexed one indeed.

         —Let us be quite clear about what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did in the House of Representatives last week. What he has done, as was further amplified by Senator Button a few moments ago, is to identify this absolutely horrible tax on food, clothing, perambulators, baby clothing, baby food and a number of other things which Senator Button has just identified—this GST on these necessities of life—as one of the worst things that could befall the Australian economy and one of the most disastrous things for the life and welfare of ordinary Australians.

         But then Mr Keating petulantly said, `If you don't vote for me at the next election, even though I have the power after the election to block this iniquitous tax, I will simply not lift a finger to attempt to assist the Australian people and the Australian economy. I will simply stand aside and let this terrible tax be imposed on my fellow Australians'. That is what Mr Keating has done. In my view, anyone who will act in such a fit of pique to further his or her own power ambitions—and let us make no bones about it, that is what is involved here—does not deserve to be a representative of the people of Australia, much less the Prime Minister.

         Two words stand out in my mind quite clearly as identifying the coming program for the next election—integrity and compassion. One thing I will certainly give to the Opposition is that at least throughout this lead-up to the election it has behaved with integrity. It has announced its Fightback package and stuck by its guns. However, I do not believe that it has acted with compassion because, as Senator Button said a moment ago, the GST and other parts of the package will impose difficulty upon the Australian public. I do not believe that the Government, particularly the Government as led by Mr Keating, has acted with either integrity or compassion because, having identified this terrible tax, the Government has said that in opposition it would support it.

         It is now very clear that Mr Keating's interest is not in issues which vitally affect the Australian people. His interest is merely in using the Australian public as a pawn on the chessboard of Australian politics to advance his own personal ambition. Mr Keating says that he will support the GST in the Senate if Dr Hewson wins the next election because Dr Hewson would have, as he says, a mandate. We have tried to identify through questioning exactly how far that mandate extends, but so far without success.

         This logic should also be applied to the rest of the Fightback package. The Opposition has clearly stated where it intends to take this package after the election, should it win government. The present Government's support for the GST portion of Fightback should also, by logic, be extended to the Opposition's industrial relations policy and to its attack on workers and unions, the health and social welfare system and this country's education system.

         Mr Keating appears to reserve the right to vote against these other issues in the Senate.

I invite members of the Labor Party—not many are present—to take membership forms for the Liberal Party of Australia and join the Liberal Party, because I believe that that is where they should honestly reside.

        It may be that the editors of some of our newspapers are literate, but they are quite innumerate. It is a matter of record that, at the 1990 election, the Labor Party obtained 39.4 per cent of the vote in the House of Representatives. When, I ask those editors, is over 60 per cent of voters voting against a particular party not a majority? A majority of people in Australia voted against Labor at the last election. I believe that at the next election a majority of voters will vote against the coalition parties; they will not get over 50 per cent of the vote. Therefore, simply getting a majority of the seats in the House of Representatives does not constitute a mandate for Labor to carry out either some or all of its program.

With only a few exceptions, the powers of those two Houses are identical.

         The Constitution limits the power of the Senate in two ways only: by prescribing that certain legislation must originate in the House of Representatives—which surely does not impact in any way on the power of the Senate to modify that legislation—and by limiting the power of the Senate to amend some forms of legislation.

         The two types of Bills which must originate in the House of Representatives are the Appropriation Bills and the Bills imposing taxation. With respect to taxation, I point to section 55 of the Constitution, in case there are some journalists listening, which says that taxation Bills cannot be linked to other pieces of legislation. It would be impossible to obscure the GST by linking it to some other piece of legislation. Section 55 says that that would make those other sections invalid.

         Appropriation and taxation Bills which must originate in the House of Representatives simply reflect the right of the Government to frame its Budget and impose new taxes. This does not in any sense limit the power of the Senate to modify those things. It simply refers to the piece of legislation which creates the liability, not the huge number of Bills that we deal with in every session which are collection and other machinery Bills. A very recent example was the abolition of sales tax on recycled paper products. This was a taxation measure which the coalition initially was minded to oppose, but in the end supported. Clearly, the Opposition recognised that it could modify, amend and change that legislation.

         There is one further qualification on the powers of the Senate. The Senate may not amend any Bill to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. This provision under subsection 53(3) of the Constitution in effect reinforces the rule that laws imposing taxation should originate in the House of Representatives, but its scope has never been tested. However, although the Senate does not have the power to amend these limited categories of Bills, it specifically does have the right to reject them or to request the House of Representatives to amend them so that they can then be passed.

That is not a mandate. In any event, even if it were, that mandate was for a Hawke-led government and not a Keating-led government.

         Last Thursday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a quite extraordinary statement in the House of Representatives in response to a question asked of him. The goods and services tax that the coalition is proposing after the next election will enable it to fund a 30 per cent cut in income tax. It will double family allowances for lower income families who have been so battered by the policies of this Government over the past 10 years; and it will completely abolish some of those major taxes on the cost of doing business in Australia, that is, those taxes which make us high cost, less productive and less competitive than we otherwise would be, could be and should be.

He went on to say in the very next breath that although it is such a terrible tax, if the Labor Government is defeated and is therefore in opposition after the next election, the Labor Party Opposition would not obstruct the passage of the goods and services tax legislation in the Senate.

         Let me say a couple of other things by way of response to the quite misleading, and in several aspects totally wrong, comments Senator Button made earlier in this debate. I preface them by pointing out that Australia is one of the very few countries in the whole world that does not have a tax of the nature of the goods and services tax that the coalition is proposing. We are, I think, the only OECD country that does not have such a tax or one very similar to it and most of the fastest growing nations on earth are now adopting such a tax. Most of the South East Asian giants have such a tax and they are leading the world in economic growth. Most countries in the industrialised world have had such a tax for almost 30 years. Some of them have had it for more than 30 years. Anyone from those countries coming to Australia and listening to the debate that is going on in this country about a GST must find it quite amazing.

        So Prime Minister Keating, then Treasurer Keating, was a very articulate and correct exponent of the need for major tax reform in this country in 1985. The basis for his reform proposals was the introduction of a broadly-based goods and services tax, or consumption tax. He spelt out very clearly in an address to the National Press Club on 5 June 1985 what the main advantages of such a tax were. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, it will allow a more rational indirect tax system than the current anomaly-ridden wholesale tax, which has multiple rates, numerous exemptions, and fails to tax the services sector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, it will enable us to generate tax revenues to provide for a major reduction in the marginal rates of income tax. No other tax has the same potential for this purpose.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Third, it generates tax from those who will continue to evade or avoid income tax. That provides a useful `net dividend' for distribution to the rest of the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, he was saying quite rightly that a goods and services tax gets at the tax cheats in the community. It does not eliminate—no-one has ever suggested it eliminates—the black economy, but it does get at those tax cheats who are not paying their fair share of tax because they will be taxed when they spend. The Prime Minister also said:

        . . . The virtually zero exemption, single rate structure of the tax—

        That is why Senator Button was so totally wrong today when he claimed that small business was going to be disadvantaged by a huge amount of administrative cost and administrative compliance burden with the goods and services tax that the coalition will be introducing on 1 October 1994 in government. It is a very simple, equitable, efficient tax which is very inexpensive to comply with and to administer. The amount of paperwork involved with it for business people is minuscule compared with the amount of very complex, time-consuming and costly paperwork involved for all those businesses that nowadays are involved in the monstrously complex area of the wholesale sales tax.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The wholesale sales tax will be totally abolished by a coalition government because the goods and services tax will enable it to be so abolished. Similarly, this will occur with payroll tax. Payroll tax nowadays rips off something like $6 billion from employers. That is a tax on jobs. At a time when we have one million people officially unemployed in this country and another million who are either underemployed or whose unemployment is hidden from the statistics because they have simply dropped out of the potential work force, because they have lost all hope of ever getting a job, it is just lunacy to continue with a tax in the nature of payroll tax which is a straight tax on jobs. The goods and services tax will enable that tax to be abolished. As I mentioned earlier, the goods and services tax also will enable there to be a total abolition of the tax on petrol in this country—a tax which is now 26c a litre, which is an enormous cost burden not just on business but also on private motorists.

         Bearing in mind that the goods and services tax is only one element of our tax reform and that tax reform, whilst being an essential part of the reform, is only one part of the much wider Fightback package, Senator Button asserted that the Fightback package was designed amongst other things to dismantle Medicare. That is an absolute untruth; that is not true. The Fightback package, very importantly, retains Medicare and improves the health system in many very important ways. Senator Button also said that there would be no bracket creep or price effect compensation in the Fightback package. That too is simply an untruth, and my leader Senator Hill reflected on and answered that in his comments. Senator Button said that the GST would not touch the black economy. That also is simply not correct, and Paul Keating himself was a very substantial and articulate exponent on the reasons why it would tackle the black economy.

         —This is a debate about the goods and services tax. It is clear from the debate so far that there is a very clear distinction between the position of the coalition and that of the Government. The clear distinction to be drawn from the debate is that the Government, the Australian Labor Party, opposes a goods and services tax and does so most implacably; the coalition embraces it and does so enthusiastically. What the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said is this: taking note of the way the Constitution has been written, particularly section 53, if after being fully informed through proper debate the Australian people come to the conclusion that the GST package put forward by the Opposition is the one they want and they vote for it, this Party, if it is in opposition, will not oppose it in the Senate.

It is quite clear from the whole course of debate over many months now, from Question Time, from public statements outside, that this Government, this Party, is absolutely opposed to the goods and services tax. What the Opposition says is, `Well, look, the person who is now Prime Minister of this country supported a goods and service tax in 1985'. But, of course, a lot of history has passed since then.

         President Reagan was in power in 1985; Prime Minister Thatcher was in power in 1985. They pursued an economic course that the Opposition proposes to pursue—and I ask honourable senators to look at where their countries are now. In both countries there is dissent and division, and there are disputes within their respective communities. However, in Australia—while I concede that that it has high unemployment and economic hardship and that the country could be better off, and I take all that into account—the fabric of our society, the ability of our people to get on together, is much better than it is in either of those two countries of which I have spoken. It is the division in those countries, the awful riots that we have seen, for example, in Los Angeles, that must be avoided at all costs—and the program that will be able to achieve that is one of conciliation. That is not the sort of program that is put by honourable senators opposite. The Government has shown over the last few years through its policies, particularly its industrial relations policy, that it is capable of keeping the community together.

As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, given the great service you have given in the union movement in the past, the goods and services tax as proposed by the Opposition requires awful changes—and I use that word advisedly—to the industrial laws of this country. Why do I say `awful'; what sorts of changes would we get? We would get the sorts of changes that the Victorian Government has introduced in Melbourne which have denied people their vested rights—rights that they had—to claim for compensation. The Victorian Government has retrospectively taken those rights away and has introduced industrial laws that tomorrow will have many, many people in the streets of Melbourne. That sort of thing has not happened for a long, long while. If the cost of this goods and services tax as proposed by the coalition is to get back to the awful periods of industrial chaos that we used to have in the late 1970s and early 1980s before the advent of this Government, then it ought to be avoided at all costs.

Nobody would oppose a reduction of tax if it were to be made responsibly. In other words, if we as a community could reduce our taxes without throwing onto the community generally all sorts of pressures that lead to injustice, disputes and dissent, we ought to do it. But we should not reduce taxes, or introduce other taxes, if it would cause those things to happen.

Mr Acting Deputy President, payroll tax is a State tax and, as such, this Parliament does not have the power to abolish such a tax. If the State governments are persuaded to take away payroll tax, they will have to introduce a tax of their own to compensate. The sort of tax that they would have to introduce could well be a tax of the type that has been introduced by the coalition Government in Victoria. That tax is, in effect—and I am sure that Senator Watson does not like this sort of tax—a poll tax. To compensate for a lack of money, the Victorian Government has imposed $100 on each household—

The Opposition, as I understand its argument, says that they will not be made more expensive. It is extraordinary to say that.

The real problem with the program that has been put forward by those opposite, the real problem with the goods and services tax, is that it strikes at the very foundation of what society should be all about. In society there certainly should be differences between people. People who go into different endeavours and work hard should be rewarded for what they do. But we should not allow society to become so uneven that terrible injustices and degradation of certain sections occur. No doubt it was with that in the back of his mind that Archbishop Little said that people who are wrongly used ought to have the ability to protest and, if needs be, to protest in a collective way. We can see by the way in which laws have been undeniably rushed into the legislature in Victoria that workers are going to be strongly denied the ability to do this.

Senator Loosley goes to a wholesale merchant. The price that Senator Cooney has to pay for his goods includes the wholesale sales tax, which is based not only on the wholesale price but on his margin. Senator Cooney goes along to K-Mart, and K-Mart has paid its tax because it buys directly from the manufacturer at a very much lower quantum.

No wonder all those associated with sales tax have problems.

         I remind the Senate that the overriding purpose of the Fightback program of reform is to provide a generational change in policies and attitudes. Our aim is to give individual Australians greater control over their own lives by creating more incentives and opportunities for all Australians to work harder and to be rewarded for it, and thus to be able to save and invest. But these objectives can only be achieved if a national government, such as a Liberal-National Party government, sees its proper role as providing a framework of policy and equal laws within which individuals, families and businesses are allowed to fulfil their potential and to plan with certainty and confidence. We believe that such a program is the essential feature of the Fightback proposal.

         —At the beginning of the debate on this urgency motion, Senator Hill said that this debate would enable Labor senators to come to the defence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I am delighted to do so in these concluding remarks. It is instructive to analyse with some precision the terms of an urgency motion, because it is always of some fascination to try to determine the motivation and the driving forces behind the minds of the people who put these propositions together. It is therefore unusually instructive to look at the terminology that begins this urgency motion this afternoon. The motion reads:

        The fact that the Federal Opposition has been predicting, throughout 1992, that a general election will be called at any time says far more about the instability existing within its ranks than any observation about the current state of electoral play in Australia might suggest. The fact that an urgency motion would begin with those words underlines both the instability and the lack of confidence within the coalition as it approaches a general election.

         It is a pleasure to follow Senator Watson in this debate. As with Senator Cooney, he is a likeable person; he is knowledgeable on matters of tax. But it was significant that he skated over the issue of constitutional impropriety in 1975, of the malice with which the coalition dealt with the Constitution in 1975, of the havoc wreaked upon the system of Australian Government in 1975. Senator Watson in no way conceded that the episode of 11 November 1975, the incidents that led up to it, and the course of action which followed 11 November 1975 still exist as a jagged scar across the cheek of Australian democracy. There is no question about that. I will come to that a little later.

         What makes it particularly germane in this debate is that, because of the impact of the goods and services tax, those opposite will squander the opportunity again. It is impossible to walk away from it now. Why has it become impossible? Because the Prime Minister made it crystal clear in the House of Representatives, just last week, in answer to a question, that in the unlikely and unpalatable event that a coalition forms government after the next poll, the Labor Party would not obstruct the imposition of a goods and services tax. To paraphrase the very generous remarks made by US President George Bush the other day, the majesty of the democratic process can be respected. The people on this side of the chamber have an infinitely better track record, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know, than those opposite on matters of constitutional propriety and respect for the democratic process and respect and acknowledgment for the parliamentary system.

         It is true that a variant of a goods and services tax was supported by the then Treasurer and sections of the Labor movement in 1985. It was a very different proposition from the one that we have now.

         What happened subsequent to the tax summit in 1985 when the goods and services tax was first canvassed? Five major steps within the tax system were taken by the Labor Government  to make the system better, fairer and more equitable. Five deliberate steps were taken. They were taken on a fringe benefits tax; by closing overseas tax havens, which made it much harder for companies and wealthy individuals either to avoid or evade tax; by making certain that an enhanced tax file number tightened income tax and made certain of collections from PAYE sources and went about attacking the black economy—the cash economy; by having a prescribed payments system; and, of course, by moving on the issue of capital gains tax which proceeded systematically to tax windfall profits. That is one explanation.

         The second explanation of equal significance is that if one looks at the coalition's proposal for a GST, which lies at the core of the Fightback package, one will see that it is an absolute certainty that it will increase prices across the board on a range of goods and services; it will make absolutely certain that people on the lower end of the socio-economic scale pay comparatively more than those on the top end of the scale; and it will increase inflation. It will increase inflation at a time when the battle against inordinate increases in the cost of living has largely been won; when Australia has the best record on inflation in the OECD.

International opinion has moved against the coalition decisively and demonstrably, and that will be a useful point to be made by the ALP at the time of the general election.

        I don't believe that it is legitimate for an Opposition and in the Senate to deny the principle element of what is a clearly articulated mandate. I notice George Bush yesterday talked about the `majesty of democracy' in his very eloquent speech where he accepted defeat and said he would cooperate in handing over the mantle to President-elect Clinton. That sort of respect for the democratic process is something my party has always had. We are not the constitutional wreckers of this federation—that we have left to the Liberal Party. They are the people who hold up supply, have Governor Generals appoint Opposition Leaders as Prime Ministers, all that sort of nonsense and risk is taken by them.

         —I rise to speak very briefly in this debate to record my opposition to the matter of urgency, whether or not it is amended by the Government's amendment. In the end, there is no validity at all, in all equity and justice, for any form of goods and services tax as proposed by the Opposition. Should the coalition win government—and I find that an extraordinary concession by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in any case, in the present situation—it is important that the public is assured that such an iniquitous tax will not pass this Parliament.

         There is no way at all that it would be a responsible position for this chamber to endorse what I consider to have been irresponsible remarks by a prime minister. The Prime Minister is quite clearly playing politics as, I suppose, is his right and certainly is his wont, particularly as we come towards a Federal election, however near or far that might be in the future. Nevertheless, he is playing politics with issues of gross injustice and inequity, as are represented by the goods and services tax.

         —in reply—From listening to Labor senators today, it is clear that the major parties—the alternative governments—in this country are poles apart. There is no doubt about that at all. Labor is standing on its record. It is going to the people in this forthcoming election with the economic model that it has had for the last 10 years and which has failed. It is a model which has resulted in one million Australians being out of work and the disastrous situation in which we find this country. It is appalling for a country with so much potential, so much in the way of natural resources and such great opportunity to be brought to its knees by an incompetent government and an incompetent economic management.

         Nevertheless, the Government offers nothing new and no reform of its program. That is what it is taking to the Australian people. We have put down an alternative. It is an alternative that can put incentive back into the economy and give businesses the chance to thrive, grow and employ again. We will do it by taking $6 billion off the total tax bill and by restructuring within the taxation system. That restructuring, like all other industrialised countries in the world, includes a goods and services tax or a form of consumption tax in order to get taxes off production. This Government is not prepared to face up to that necessity as other industrialised countries have done. The result is that it makes our businesses less competitive and therefore they are unable to grow and employ in the way we want.

         This motion is in such a form that it endorses the benefits of the package. It states at least some of the benefits that would come out of that tax restructuring, including the personal income tax cuts of 30 per cent, getting rid of the wholesale sales tax, the payroll tax—a tax on jobs—and the fuel tax, which is also a tax on jobs. We mentioned that we will double family allowances for those who are less well off in this community and that tax cheats will at least have to pay some tax.

         We have set out the benefits of the program—the restructuring of the taxation system—and we have said to the Labor Party, `Come in and in these terms endorse the Prime Minister's statement that it will support our reform package from opposition'. This Government is now about to be put to the test. Will it vote in support of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in support of this motion that we have moved today and in support of the reforms and the benefits of the reforms, or will it wimp it, try to amend the motion, as apparently Senator Button wants, and then vote with the Australian Democrats again? It will further confuse the picture and end up in a muddle again.

         What Senator Button really said is that the Government will endorse the Prime Minister on principle but it will not endorse him on the package. It cannot have it both ways. If it is going to vote for the Fightback package in this chamber, as the Prime Minister was saying, then it will vote for the benefits of the Fightback package—that is, such things as income tax being reduced by 30 per cent. Let us see what the Government does today. Let us see whether it has the courage to stand up to the Prime Minister with all the ramifications of what he has said.

         There have been some interesting developments in the dairy industry in the past 12 months, the period covered by this report. As the Chairman notes in his foreword, the results for the year were better than expected, reflecting improved trading conditions. He notes:

        The industry's performance is closely linked to the international market and in the latter half of 1991/1992 international prices rose significantly, which has caused a renewal of confidence in future prospects, although with a degree of uncertainty engendered by the US Presidential elections, the delayed resolution of the Uruguay Round, and political uncertainties in Eastern Europe.

        The culmination of those developments in the industry was the dairy produce amendment and levy Bills which we debated in this chamber in June this year. That legislation represented tremendous change for the dairy industry. This industry has been determined to restructure, to become more efficient and be able to compete on world markets. This has been very noticeable, because at one stage the dairy industry was really in the doldrums. All the people in the dairy industry wanted to get out of it and get into beef cattle. It is now nearly a complete turnaround, so much so that the dairy industry is one of the really good industries for rural people.

         The industry has had no choice but to become more efficient because, if it had not rationalised and restructured, it would not have been able to compete in the way it was required to. In those Bills, the Government basically followed the recommendations of the Industry Commission report, with a number of exceptions.

         One of the main arguments in that report was that Australian consumers would get cheaper milk if controls in the Australian dairy industry were removed. It is said that `further reductions in assistance must take place if the dairy industry is to maximise its contribution to national welfare', adding that the Australian industry had to prepare for increased competition from New Zealand dairy products.

         In addition, the report recommended that assistance to the industry should be phased out in the next two to 10 years and that the Commonwealth should phase down maximum market support payments from 20 per cent of average export prices to 5 per cent by 1996. Instead, the Government recommended a 12 month delay or holding at the present 20 per cent level, down to 10 per cent by the year 2000.

         So often now the Industry Commission seems to believe that it is acceptable for Australia to become a dumping ground. It is asking Australian farmers and manufacturers to accept, as right and proper, prices which are based on the world market's dumped prices. We have seen this asked of producers in other rural industries. These prices are the result of political decisions in Brussels and Washington. They do not reflect retail prices in the exporting countries where consumers are paying more for their produce than Australia.

         The Australian dairy industry is alive with innovation, technical progress and a driving will to compete. Our dairy foods are as good as, and in many cases better than, any in the world. Dairy food exports earn more than $700m each year. The industry's major investments in research, technology and market development will see these export earnings grow. Dairy farmer productivity is increasing by 5 per cent per year, as it has for the past decade. The industry's willingness to adapt to change means that it will benefit from even minor reforms in the international trading environment.

         —In order to fully appreciate where the dairy industry now is, it is necessary to look back to 1975-76 when I first became politically involved with the industry. In those days, the farmers of our area were being paid something like 40c a pound for butterfat. The herds were small, the production was poor and there was little concerted research. In my area there was a multiplicity of small processors who were quite weak in respect of technology. The States generally, from one to the other, were in total disarray.

In those early days, we dealt with Ken Baxter in the Parliament when he was working for the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Ken Wriedt. Of all the jobs that he has been involved in since then, I am very pleased to see him back in the dairy industry where he did well in those very difficult days.

The mere fact is that we had courteously and respectfully requested this document to be released on a confidential basis so that any material of a sensitive nature would not be put on the public record, and possibly jeopardise prosecutions or anything of that nature.

Fortunately, sanity has now prevailed and Senator Tate has been able to convince Mr Howe—who incidentally is not only Minister for Health, but also the Deputy Prime Minister and a person who should have a bit more respect for the Parliament and the Senate—that the whole idea of getting this report on Medicare fraud was designed to inform us as to what the Department was doing and, if there is anything of a confidential nature, that would be respected and certainly not released.

         The first report I have just tabled relates to facilities for an increased Army presence in the north, stage 1. The proposal relates to the Defence Force structure review announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. One of the findings of the review determined that a regular Army brigade be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the decade. This will be achieved by the staged relocation of southern based units to Darwin. Approximately 2,200 service personnel will be relocated under stages 1 and 2 which will take place between 1994 and 2001.

          This report relates to the need to provide suitable working, training and accommodation facilities for personnel relocating under stage 1. The proposal consists of the construction of new facilities on the Defence property near Palmerston, 20 kilometres east of Darwin; the construction of new facilities and refurbishment of existing facilities at RAAF base Darwin for an aviation squadron; acquisition and development of an additional close training area; and acquisition of a commercial property for logistics functions.

          As regards the new facilities on the Defence property near Palmerston, it is not a Club Med, but the construction, design and architecture of that facility is second to none.

          Related to this proposal is the provision of an additional 350 married quarters by the Defence Housing Authority, for which furniture is to be provided out of this proposal. The estimated total cost of the proposed scope of works in outturn price is $199.74m. This equates to $173.95m at February 1992 prices. It is proposed that the stage 1 works will be contracted in a number of separate contract packages of varied sizes to optimise local industry involvement. Subject to all necessary approvals, current plans envisage the commencement of construction by the end of 1997.

          The second report relates to the redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin. Although there has been a gradual increase in Army strength in the north since the 1970s, there has been little development of facilities within the barracks. There is a shortage of suitable working accommodation and existing facilities are in poor condition. Although maintenance has been carried out, there has never been an upgrade of the type proposed in this referral.

        ANTARCTIC (ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill gives effect to Australia's obligations arising from the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, known as the Madrid Protocol. The Madrid Protocol designates Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science, and puts in place a legally binding and comprehensive regime for protection of its environment. The Government has shown leadership in Antarctic environmental matters and already has made significant progress in implementing the requirements of the Protocol. This Bill will enable Australia to move forward to ratification of the Protocol.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Madrid Protocol stands among the world's most significant environmental agreements. It is unique in setting out to ensure the protection of the environment of an entire continent. It is an outstanding demonstration of countries working together on environmental protection. Australia thus takes great pride in its role in leading its Treaty partners to adoption of the Protocol in October 1991.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Elsewhere in the world in recent years we have seen attention given to the long-standing problems of pollution, insensitive development, and uncontrolled exploitation of resources. We have learned from our mistakes. In Antarctica we had a continent seemingly immune from the environmental problems, but our view of Antarctica changed as we came to understand what is happening in the atmosphere. It was Antarctica that revealed the depletion of ozone. Antarctica is a continent of enormous scientific potential; a continent that may provide invaluable information about the health of the environment in the rest of the world. The Government recognised that Antarctica can only do this if we fully protect it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Antarctica, once far removed from the attention of most of the world, came to prominence in the 1980s. The decade saw dramatic developments in Antarctic environmental policy, reflecting the increased attention given to the environment worldwide.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Antarctica's unique environment provides the setting for a unique approach to international relations. For over thirty years the Antarctic Treaty has set aside the differences between countries and provided the framework for unrivalled cooperation between the 40 countries that are party to it. As an original signatory to the Treaty, Australia is fully committed to supporting the Antarctic Treaty and encouraging the consensus approach to decisions about Antarctica's future. The Government therefore believes that by strong support for, and effective contribution to, the Treaty system we can achieve the best possible measures to protect the Antarctic.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Without doubt, the most significant recent development in the Antarctic Treaty system was the adoption in 1991 of the Madrid Protocol. Adoption of the Protocol represented a dramatic change in attitude by the Treaty countries to what are acceptable activities in Antarctica. Following six years of negotiation of a regime that would allow the possibility of mining in Antarctica, the Treaty parties have agreed to a regime that prohibits mining. The Government's leadership on this issue was instrumental in achieving what is now recognised as one of the world's most outstanding examples of international cooperation in protection of the environment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Negotiation of the Protocol followed the Government's decision in May 1989 that Australia would not sign the Antarctic minerals convention. The Government had concluded that mining could not be undertaken consistent with protection of the environment. Instead, the Government proposed that Treaty parties negotiate a regime which would prohibit mining and provide for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the Government announced its decision it was warmly welcomed by the public. However, overseas Australia's proposals were not received enthusiastically by many of our Treaty partners. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, acknowledged in his announcement that we had set ourselves an ambitious task. However, concerted efforts by the Government culminated in the adoption of the Protocol after some two years. The Government takes this opportunity to place on record its appreciation for the skilful negotiation efforts of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Antarctic Division of the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During these negotiations Australia was supported initially by France. Italy and Belgium also came to support our proposals and following a meeting of Treaty parties in November 1990, further support for the Australian position emerged. In Madrid, less than a year later, the Treaty parties adopted the Protocol signalling achievement of the objective of putting in place comprehensive and legally binding measures to protect the Antarctic environment.

        The prohibition on mining
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Given the context in which the Protocol was negotiated, its most significant feature is Article 7 which prohibits activities relating to mineral resources other than scientific research. This Article represents the commitment of the Treaty parties to set aside a whole continent from what was potentially one of the most environmentally destructive activities. The Government had, of course, recognised the need to provide legal means to prevent such activities in 1990, prior to conclusion of the Protocol, and we had passed legislation prohibiting mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory and prohibiting Australian involvement in mining anywhere in the Antarctic. This legislation, the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Act 1991, will now be incorporated in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 for the sake of completeness.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is, of course, delighted that the Protocol has put in place the mining prohibition that we sought. However, the Protocol is much more than a ban on mining, and there are many other significant environmental protection provisions within the Protocol and its annexes. These provisions will ensure that activities undertaken in Antarctica are done in the most environmentally responsible way.

        Annexes to the Madrid Protocol
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Key features of the Protocol are that it designates Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science; it establishes environmental principles for the conduct of all activities in Antarctica; and subjects all activities to prior assessment of their environmental impacts. Accordingly, the Protocol provides for a whole continent to be recognised as a place worthy of protection, and a place where all activities should be approached with consistent environmental standards.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the time of adoption of the Protocol, on 4 October 1991, four annexes had been agreed. These provide detailed measures relating to environmental impact assessment; conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora; waste disposal and waste management; and prevention of marine pollution. Subsequently, the Treaty parties adopted a fifth annex relating to area protection and management. Most of these provisions will be covered by this Bill, which amends the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act in a number of ways to ensure that our Protocol obligations are met.

        The environmental impact assessment process
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A fundamental part of the Protocol's mechanisms to ensure that activities take account of environmental values is Annex I. The Protocol requires prior assessment of all activities proposed to be conducted in the Antarctic Treaty area to assess likely impacts on the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems. Annex I specifies the procedures that are to be followed to ensure that proposed activities are appropriately assessed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The intention of the environmental impact assessment process is not to prevent activities from proceeding but rather to ensure that they are undertaken in a way that takes into account, and minimises as far as practicable, any environmental impacts. The Bill puts in place an assessment scheme that relies on three levels of impact assessment according to the extent of likely impacts, and provides for conditions to be imposed on activities so that the actual impacts can be assessed and verified.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Over the years the Antarctic Treaty parties have adopted a number of measures in relation to the protection of fauna and flora. These measures have been put into place in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act. Annex II of the Protocol replaces many of the existing measures, strengthening them where necessary. Consequently, as the existing measures have been implemented into Australian law, this Bill proposes to amend that Act by incorporating the additional requirements of the Protocol relating to the protection of fauna and flora.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Annex II includes a provision prohibiting the introduction of non-indigenous species into the Antarctic. One aspect of the requirements is the obligation to remove huskies from Antarctica by 1 April 1994. Within Australia the Government's acceptance of this provision has been difficult. Australia is one of only three Treaty countries that still uses dog teams in Antarctica and during negotiation of the Protocol Australia argued strongly for retention of the dogs. However, our position became untenable in view of Australia's strong push for comprehensive environment protection measures.

        Only one of Australia's Antarctic stations still maintains dogs. Even though the dogs at Mawson are well managed there remains the possibility of dogs breaking free and attacking wildlife, or wildlife straying into the dog lines.

Where an agency makes a decision, between the time the appeal is made to the Tribunal and the time that the Tribunal has finally dealt with the matter, subsection 56(5) gives the Tribunal the power to extend the proceedings by reviewing the decision that has actually been made if the applicant for review wants it to do so and if the agency has not granted the applicant's request in full and in the manner sought.

Section 33 was amended in 1991 to delete references to the public interest. Section 33A was also amended so that a certificate issued under subsection (2) or (4) conclusively establishes both that disclosure would affect relations with a State or Territory and that disclosure would not on balance be in the public interest.

        The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 in the Schedule to the Bill will revise the provisions already made in the Act for the mortgage securitisation industry and expand it to include asset backed securitisation. The amendments will also deal with a number of anomalies in the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act that have been brought to the Government's attention by industry and the Privacy Commissioner in the course of implementing those provisions. The proposed amendments have the support of the Privacy Commissioner and have been prepared after consultations with interested parties.

        Securitisation is a recent development in the credit industry. While provision for it was made in the Privacy Act when it was amended by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1991, the complexity of the industry has required clarification and revision of the current provisions, which as a matter of strict law do not always easily accommodate the particular practices involved in asset and mortgage securitisation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Securitisation, which is also known as the secondary mortgage market, refers to a method of financing often used in housing finance, but is also used in relation to other assets. A mortgage financed ostensibly by a credit union or building society (usually called an `originator'), will under a mortgage securitisation arrangement be ultimately financed by using funds invested by investors in a trust. The form of such arrangements vary significantly, but usually there is a formal legal `trustee' of the trust fund, although the fund is often managed on a day to day basis by a trust manager. The trust manager deals with `credit enhancers' who actually take the financial risk by underwriting the securitisation scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments will define a securitisation arrangement and will deem bodies involved in a securitisation arrangement to be credit providers. They will be placed under the same obligations as other credit providers under the Act while they are performing a task relevant to the securitisation scheme. They will, however, be different from other credit providers in that they will be able to obtain credit information from other members of the scheme without the consent of the borrower. This variation of the Act's normal policy on disclosure of information by credit providers is necessary as a result of the special nature of mortgage securitisation schemes. A consequence of deeming bodies involved in mortgage securitisation arrangements to be credit providers is that credit enhancers will be able to obtain access to credit reports from credit reporting agencies in their own right.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Fundamentally, the amendments do not represent a major change from the policy of the existing provisions. However, they will clarify the circumstances under which bodies involved in securitisation arrangements can have access to consumer credit information.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has been conscious for some time of the difficult situation faced by guarantors or would be guarantors in finding out information about the persons they are guaranteeing. Equally, credit providers lack certainty in deciding what information they are required or permitted by law to disclose to would be guarantors, given that such disclosures are exceptions to their duty of confidentiality to their clients and the information that can be disclosed can vary with the circumstances of the transaction. I am therefore proposing an amendment to the Privacy Act to provide that credit providers may disclose credit information regulated by the Privacy Act (that is, relating to a borrower's consumer credit worthiness) to guarantors or would be guarantors where the borrower has consented to the disclosure.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In framing this amendment the Government has been conscious that further consideration is being given to the disclosure of information to guarantors in relation to the implementation of the Martin Committee Report on banking. Thus, for guarantees entered into after the commencement of the provisions, the Bill does not seek to address what information should be disclosed or when information should be disclosed to guarantors. However, for guarantees in existence at the time of the commencement of these provisions, the amendments would permit disclosure of information to a guarantor where that information is relevant to the guarantor's liability or possible liability under the guarantee and the borrower has been notified that such disclosures to the guarantor may take place in the future.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill will also amend the Privacy Act 1988 to permit credit providers who have mortgages over the same property to share credit information where the borrower is more than 60 days in default.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has received complaints from consumers who have authority to use a partner's account but are not permitted under the Privacy Act to receive information about that account to assist them in making payments and otherwise managing the account. Therefore, to meet these concerns the Bill will permit the disclosure of basic information concerning that account, such as the account balance, the amount of available credit on the account, the minimum payment due, and some information about transactions to the person authorised to operate the account. However, in order to protect the privacy of the account owner, information about the owner's transactions will not be disclosed to that person. Thus, children who are permitted by their parents to use their parent's credit card will not have access to information concerning the parent's credit transactions.

        I move that this Bill be now read a second time.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this Bill is to implement a package of measures to enhance the future of the Australian wheat industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The package provides a framework for the development of a vertically integrated industry to the end of the century. It has the endorsement of the peak wheat grower body, the Grains Council of Australia. The Grains Council agreement on these measures exemplifies the Government's approach to rural industry policy. We have strong views on where our rural industries should be heading and a clear vision for their future. But we do not impose changes on those industries. We consult closely with them on proposed improvements and work together to attain our shared vision for their future. This is the approach the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has recently adopted with the dairy, wool and sugar industries and which he has now applied to the wheat and grains industries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Such an approach gives greater confidence to industry participants in planning their futures.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Wheat is Australia's most valuable crop with an estimated gross value of production in 1992-93 of $2.2 billion. Wheat is also one of Australia's most important exports and this year will be our third largest rural export earner after wool and meat.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This package has regard to the particular circumstances of the industry and the environment in which it operates. It represents a further step in the evolution of wheat marketing arrangements. For many years the Australian Wheat Board held a monopoly over the sales of all Australian wheat on domestic and export markets. Three years ago this Government deregulated the domestic wheat market and thereby introduced competition to the Wheat Board within Australia. Since then, on export markets, the Wheat Board has moved further away from being a supplier of bulk homogenous wheat and instead has also pursued niche markets for specific qualities of wheat based on customers' needs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These changes helped inspire the Grains Council to hold the "Grains 2000 Conference" in September 1991. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy gave the concluding address to the Conference where he set out his views on future directions for the industry. He stressed the long term decline in the terms of trade for Australian agricultural producers and pointed out that, on the other hand, growth in the trade of value added food products was increasing. Moreover, he said Australia was well situated to take advantage of the growth in demand for these products in the populous and increasingly wealthy countries of Asia. He urged the industry to raise its sights and direct more of its resources to take advantage of the growth in demand for value added food products.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At that Conference, industry leaders shared many of the views of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on a future vision for the industry. Grains Council leaders Andrew Inglis and Donald McGauchie and Wheat Board Chairman Clinton Condon also spoke of the need for the industry to move away from being solely a supplier of bulk raw material.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Two other important issues raised at the Conference were the export powers of the Wheat Board and the future capital base for the industry. Both of these issues, as well as value adding, are addressed in the package implemented by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following Grains 2000, an extensive process of consultation was set up by the Grains Council with the involvement of the Wheat Board and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Expert consultants were engaged to advise on the financial and structural aspects of future grains marketing. This process led to the publication in April this year of what became known as the Newco proposal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the months following, the Grains Council organised an extensive series of grower meetings in all mainland States to debate the Newco proposal. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy welcomed these meetings, as a means of ensuring growers were fully consulted on the issues. The Minister had earlier expressed reservations about some aspects of the proposal. Moreover, after the consultative process was complete, it was clear the Newco proposal in its original form did not have the support of the majority of growers. Nor did the alternative proposals which had been put forward over the last year or so, such as those from various State grower bodies and from the Australian Grain Exporters Association.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, there was general support for certain elements of these proposals and this support has been embodied in the package of measures before the Senate. These elements are:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        a continued build up in the industry's capital base through the Wheat Industry Fund Levy;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        a more active role for the Wheat Board in grains based value adding activities; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        a continuation of the Wheat Board's export monopoly in light of the current uncertain outcome in the GATT Round and the highly corrupted state of the world wheat market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We believe the continued build up of a capital base is essential to ensure the industry's future. Such a view is shared by the industry. Currently, the Wheat Board borrows heavily during the season to make advance payments to growers. Those borrowings are guaranteed by the Government under an arrangement which was scheduled to end on 30 June 1994. The financial consultants to the Grains Council and the Wheat Board have estimated that the Wheat Industry Fund would need to build to over $400m to provide sufficient capital for the Wheat Board to make advance payments to growers at around current levels without a Government guarantee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government and the Grains Council have therefore agreed that the Fund will continue for five years past 1994, until June 1999. By that time, it is estimated the Fund will have reached a level sufficient for the Wheat Board to make advance payments without the Government guarantee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During this build up period, the Government has agreed to continue its guarantee on borrowings by the Wheat Board until June 1999 at a level of 85 per cent of the aggregate estimated net pool return. This extension of the guarantee will provide a welcome and necessary breathing space for wheat growers during the build up period and will remove any uncertainty about the future of the Wheat Board's borrowing arrangements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the end of the build up period, the Government's firm intention is that the Government guarantee will cease as it will no longer be necessary for the Wheat Board's operations. It is also the Government's view that the Wheat Board will be able to be corporatised at the end of the build up period.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Turning now to value adding activities, this Bill grants the Wheat Board the power to become directly involved in grains based value adding activities, subject to constitutional limitations. This will enable a broadening of the economic base of the grains industry and the strengthening of linkages between growers and processors. Until now, the Wheat Board's involvement in value adding has been limited to investment only.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill provides this value adding power to the Wheat Board for export and interstate trade. Complementary State legislation will be necessary to cover intrastate trade, as is the case with the Wheat Board's powers under the current legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Furthermore, the Grains Council and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have agreed that the Wheat Board will establish a subsidiary specifically for grains based value adding activities.

        The exact form of the Wheat Board subsidiary has not yet been finalised. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy intends to consult further within Government and with industry on this.

        On the question of the Wheat Board's export monopoly, it is clear the majority of growers favour the continuation of the Wheat Board's single desk export operations. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is aware of calls from some growers, and certainly from other commercial interests such as the Australian Grain Exporters Association, to introduce at least a degree of deregulation in Australian export wheat sales. However, the Government has decided that now is not the appropriate time to change the Wheat Board's export powers. All honourable senators will be aware of the corrupt state of the world wheat market where the subsidy war between the United States and the European Community has been waged for many years now. The intensity of the war has recently increased with President Bush's global Export Enhancement Program announcement.

        Mr President, the package of measures I have outlined today will provide substantial benefits to the Australian wheat industry.

Growers can face the long term future secure in the knowledge that their strong national marketing structure will continue. The establishment of a value adding subsidiary of the Wheat Board will provide a new focus for this important aspect of the vision for the future shared by the Government and the Grains Council.

        This Bill will amend the taxation law to implement personal tax cuts from 1994-95, and for subsequent income years, as outlined by the Prime Minister in the One Nation statement of 26 February 1992. This gives effect to the Government's commitment to deliver on these tax reductions without resort to the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax. It adds to this Government's unparalleled record in introducing progressive reform of the taxation system and confirms Australia's position under this Government as a fair and low tax country. In 1990, taking account of all levels of government, Australia had the third lowest tax burden in the OECD. Only the United States and Turkey have a lower burden of taxation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reductions in the tax rates will be implemented in two stages from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. New scales of personal tax rates for incomes within the range $20,700 to $50,000 will operate from 1 July 1994. Further reductions in those rates will apply from 1 January 1996. The Bill contains the rate scales to apply for 1994-95, 1996-97 and subsequent income years. As the second reduction in personal tax rates has effect from 1 January 1996, the Bill also contains a composite rate scale for the 1995-96 income year. That scale is obtained from an average of the tax rates to apply from 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996 respectively.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reductions will result in the current 38 per cent rate for the income range $20,700 to $36,000 being reduced to 30 per cent over a two-year period. This income range will also be widened. After two years, the new 30 per cent rate will apply to the income range $20,700 to $40,000, some $4,000 wider than the current range.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current 46 per cent rate for the income range $36,000 to $50,000 will be reduced to 40 per cent over the same period with a corresponding reduction of $4,000 in the income range to a range of $40,000 to $50,000. This means that for someone earning $28,000 a year, for example, the tax cuts will increase disposable income by about $11 a week. The tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay as you earn deductions from 1 July 1994. For the forward estimate years, the cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts is estimated at $3.2 billion in 1994-95 and $5.2 billion in 1995-96. The measures are an integral part of the Government's tax reform agenda as detailed in the statement on tax policy.

        In the Budget, the Government indicated its desire to reduce the deficit in 1995-96 to between half and one per cent of GDP after allowing for the cuts to personal income tax. It is possible this outcome could be achieved without resort to any additional revenue measures. The Government did, however, identify three possible measures which could be considered, if necessary, to yield in excess of $2 billion.

        In the statement on tax policy the Government outlines measures which will have the net effect of reducing the deficit by $2 billion in 1995-96. But in order to put this issue beyond doubt, the Government has gone further and by advancing the date of implementation of those measures the deficit will be reduced by $4.5 billion over the two years 1994-95 and 1995-96. In this way the Government will pursue sensible tax reform based on fairness and efficiency but will also bolster the stance of fiscal policy. The consequence of this action is that the Government is confident that the deficit reduction program implicit in the Budget will be exceeded during the course of the forward estimate years.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since 1983, the Government has radically transformed the taxation system into a more effective, more efficient and fairer system. In the 1990s, the Government will maintain the effectiveness of the existing tax system to meet new challenges and to fund the vital activities of government in providing for the security and development of our nation and the well-being of the people. The Government's taxation policies have consistently produced more equitable sharing of the tax burden and lower marginal tax rates. These policies have been pursued both through changes to the design of the income tax and through the continuous improvement of tax administration and compliance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1985, we considered and rejected the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax and opted instead to make taxes on the income base more efficient and equitable. In particular, we introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, which are directed at previously untaxed income received by predominantly high income individuals. Other reforms have been introduced progressively to increase the effectiveness of tax administration and to improve tax compliance. This program has included the introduction of self-assessment of income tax—supported by substantially upgraded audit programs—the introduction of the tax file number system and other information reporting, modernisation of tax compliance through a major new computer acquisition program matched with organisational changes in the Tax Office and the reorientation of the Tax Office towards a revision of information and advisory services to taxpayers to assist them in meeting their tax obligations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's policy approach has resulted in a broader income base and reduced tax evasion and reduced tax avoidance. This approach has enabled the Government to reduce, substantially, marginal tax rates. Since 1983 the top rate has been lowered from 60 per cent to 47 per cent and bottom rate has been cut from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since 1983, the Government has introduced a range of measures particularly to assist low income earners. For example, cuts to personal income tax rates in January 1991 raised the threshold at which tax is payable from $5,100 to $5,400 and reduced the bottom marginal tax rate from 21c to 20c in the dollar. At the same time, the income level up to which the bottom rate applies was extended from $17,650 to $20,700. By contrast, when this Government took office in 1983, the tax free threshold was set just below $5,000 and the bottom marginal rate of 30c in the dollar applied to incomes up to $19,500, and above that level the rate was 46c in the dollar.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Government introduced the family allowance supplement, which provides substantial support for low income families. In the One Nation statement, the Government provided further assistance for low income families by way of increases in FAS of $3 a week per child from the first payday in April 1992. FAS boosts the disposable income of eligible families by up to $60.80 a fortnight for each child aged up to 13 years and the $85.90 for each child aged between 13 to 15 years.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The introduction of the fringe benefits tax significantly improved the equity of the tax system because it provided a means of ensuring that income provided in kind was taxed. The FBT was designed with a variety of administrative considerations in mind. The Government believes that it is now appropriate to improve the effectiveness of the FBT, and considerably enhance the fairness of the tax system, by changing the method of calculating the value base of the tax by making it as near to that of income tax as possible.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other legislation provides, that from April 1994, the fringe benefits tax will be levied on the FBT inclusive value of the fringe benefit and FBT payments will be deductible to the employer for income tax purposes. This is equivalent to the tax treatment of salary, where the employee pays income tax on the gross amount of salary and the employer has a tax deduction equal to the gross amount of that salary. The change to the valuation of the FBT base will raise about $2.5 billion over the two year 1994-95 and 1995-96.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The early introduction of this important legislation will ensure that employers and employees have ample notice of the significant changes to the fringe benefits tax structure. A significant share of the revenue yield of the changes will come from tax exempt government sector employers who have benefited from lower taxes on fringe benefits until now. The Government will discuss this issue with State and Territory governments and local government in the context of the general purpose funding and the next Premiers Conference.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is not considering any other changes to the FBT. In particular, we do not propose to alter the classes of FBT exempt organisations, so that religious institutions and public benevolent institutions will continue to be exempt. Special arrangements will be provided, however, for non-government organisations that are non-taxpaying bodies which are subject to FBT at the moment. The Government does intend changing the various special rules that apply to such benefits as education of children of Australian employed overseas and foreign resident employment in Australia.

We will provide the Australian Taxation Office with the resources necessary to implement that strategy, that is, $114m over the three years from 1993-94 to 1995-96. The strategy involves minimal investment of additional resources to achieve a very significant improvement in revenue and equity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The enhancement strategy will include an extension of the role of information reporting, using the tax file number system.

Such pensioners will not be affected by the extended reporting requirements.

        The strategy builds on the unprecedented action this Government has taken over the past 10 years to close the net on tax evasion and avoidance.

        The vast majority of Australians are honest and pay their fair share of tax. The measures are directed at those few Australians who avoid or evade their tax liabilities.

        SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 gives effect to a number of changes in the social security system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Before I discuss the major aspects of the Bill, let me first say that I am aware of criticism that has been levelled at this sort of Bill in the past where, apart from changes to a number of social security programs, a significant number of minor and technical amendments are also included. In relation to the latter amendments, I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill has a new format in which the Schedules introducing so called "minor and technical amendments" itemise each amendment. Senators may be aware that it has been past practice to insert technical amendments without any numbering; simply grouping them in Schedules.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I understand that the format in this Bill may become an approach adopted by other portfolios where a large number of minor and technical amendments is included in a Bill. Apart from providing the item numbers, the Explanatory Memorandum gives a detailed explanation of items considered to be of particular interest. This is in answer to criticism that too many technical, but important, changes are `buried' in the Schedules. This approach has not added to the size of the Bill but, of course, has resulted in a longer Explanatory Memorandum. However, that is the price I believe we should be prepared to pay to ensure an adequate explanation of the changes is given.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I will now discuss some of the more important items in this Bill.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The compensation provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 will be extended to cover Carer Pension. At the moment, partners of compensation recipients are already covered and it is logical to have the provisions apply to carers who themselves receive compensation payments. The provisions will also be extended to cover Carer Pensioners irrespective of for whom the care is being provided. Carers who receive a lump sum compensation payment will be treated in the same way as other pensioners who are subject to the compensation provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill will clarify the nexus between entitlement to Family Allowance (to be called Family Payment from 1 January 1993) and Child Disability Allowance and Double Orphan Pension. Put simply, a person with a child who attracts Child Disability Allowance or Double Orphan Pension will not attract Family Payment for that child unless the income and assets tests for Family Payment are met. The amendments will, however, make it clear that neither Child Disability Allowance nor Double Orphan Pension is subject to any income or assets test.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are two amendments to the Pharmaceutical Allowance provisions. The first is a technical amendment to include Pharmaceutical Allowance as part of the rate calculators in the Social Security Act. The second is more important in that it will ensure that a social security recipient who is qualified for the allowance will not receive less than the full Pharmaceutical Allowance rate even if the application of the income or assets tests would otherwise reduce the rate to less than the full rate of allowance (but more than nil). This is consistent with the proposition that the allowance was introduced to compensate social security recipients in full following the initiative to remove access to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme items free of charge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The social security system is both complex and sophisticated in that it tries to target assistance to those most in need. Part of the running of a system which helps millions of Australians involves the extensive use of computers. The Bill will ensure that decisions which might look like `automatic' decisions made by force of law (ie where there is no discretion involved) and put into effect by a computer—for example, to cancel a payment—will still be subject to the full review rights embodied in the Social Security Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Act at present provides that Newstart Allowance, Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance are not payable to a person if the person has not given the Secretary of the Department of Social Security his or her tax file number. The Social Security Act is amended in this Bill to enable the Secretary to request a tax file number as a condition of qualification from claimants of those payments I have mentioned. There is nothing untoward  about this amendment. Similar provisions already exist for other payments but I mention this change as I am conscious of the sensitivities involved in tax file number matters.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consistent with my firmly held view that personal information provided to the Department should be protected to the greatest extent possible, this Bill introduces amendments which will make it an offence for any person, including an officer of the Department, to access client records unlawfully, for example to "browse" paper files without authority, and a further offence to disclose or deal with information which has been accessed unlawfully. Browsing of computer records is already an offence under the Crimes Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Special Benefit is a discretionary hardship payment and payment is usually limited only to persons in Australia. This Bill will enable payment overseas where there are exceptional circumstances but only for a period of up to 13 weeks. This discretion will cater for very unusual situations, like having to visit a seriously ill relative, but limit overall the amount of payment available to a person outside Australia. I emphasise that payment overseas is to occur only in a very few exceptional circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am pleased to say that this Bill also includes, by way of a Schedule, the International Social Security Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and Australia. The Agreement is expected to come into force on 1 January 1993. It is another Agreement to add to our growing list of such Agreements with other countries which protect social security payments for persons who have had residence or made contributions in either country.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In recognition of the value of Australian Defence Force reservists, the Social Security Act currently allows reservists in training camps to qualify for Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance if those camps are inside Australia. The Bill will extend this concession to include reservists attending a training camp overseas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A further concession to recipients of Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance who are under 18 year olds will be to exempt child maintenance payments to their parents from the parental income test. This is an acknowledgment that child maintenance is directed at assisting children and only maintenance paid to a recipient's parents which is not for children should be counted under the parental income test.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill provides for limited relaxation of the Sickness Allowance rules. These will include provisions which allow for a discretion to backdate payment for up to four weeks following failure to lodge a medical certificate because of the person's medical condition or where there may have been delay in processing a medical certificate; to allow for payments, in certain circumstances, to 15 year olds undertaking a rehabilitation program and to allow for payment where a person might be in full-time education as part of a rehabilitation program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other areas covered by the Bill include the repeal of certain superfluous offence provisions and to limit to 3 months the period within which to lodge a claim for payment when a person's payment is cancelled overseas, without the need to return to Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.

        SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill introduces the substantial enhancements to the social security system announced in the Budget. It continues this Government's responsible and soundly based social security programs which continue to deliver support where it is most needed, but within Budget parameters.

        Rate increases in pensions and benefits as a result of indexation will be available two months early by advancing the 20 March 1993 indexation to 28 January 1993. This means a maximum rate increase of $6 a fortnight for someone who is single and $5.00 a fortnight for each member of a couple. This will ensure that the Government's commitment to maintain the basic pension rate at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings is sustained.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A series of reforms of Rent Assistance will target those who most need support in the rental market. The flat $25 a week rent threshold which applies at present will be replaced with four different thresholds based on family situation and marital status. These thresholds will be indexed to CPI movements. The rate of Rent Assistance will increase from 50 cents to 75 cents for each dollar of rent paid above the threshold and the maximum rate of Rent Assistance paid to someone with no partner or dependent children will increase by $2 a week. This will mean an increase in Rent Assistance of up to $8.50 per week for a single pensioner without children. Existing Rent Assistance recipients who would be entitled to a lower Rent Assistance payment as a result of these changes will continue to receive their current level of Rent Assistance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A range of measures aimed at Carer Pensioners reflects the Government's commitment to support these people who fulfil such an important role in our community. Carer Pension will now be available to people caring for severely disabled people aged 16 or over who are not pensioners because they cannot meet the full residence requirements. Under current arrangements, payment of Carer Pension continues while the carer temporarily stops providing care for up to 28 days. This respite period is to be increased to 42 days and carers will not need to remain in Australia during the period. Furthermore, carers will be able to participate in employment, education or training for up to 10 hours per week without affecting their payment, the earnings credit provisions will be extended to them and the bereavement provisions which apply on the death of the person being cared for will be applicable where the person was not the carer's partner.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mobility Allowance assists people with disabilities with the costs of transport if they are engaged in employment or vocational training and are unable to use public transport without substantial assistance. This Bill will index Mobility Allowance in line with the CPI from 1 January 1993 and will also increase Mobility Allowance by $10 a fortnight. People who are undertaking job search as part of a Disability Panel activity plan will now have access to Mobility Allowance, as will people working for at least 8 hours a week in a voluntary capacity for charitable, welfare or community organisations.

        To reduce the pressure on our young people who live away from the family home, a young person under 18 falling within the definition of "independent young person" will need to have lived away from home for only 18 weeks (rather than the current 6 months) to attract the higher rate of Job Search Allowance or other payments payable in these circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Full-time voluntary work is a useful vehicle for unemployed clients, especially those who are long-term unemployed or in particular age groups, to gain work experience, update their skills and make useful employer contacts. The system is being relaxed to allow clients to participate more in voluntary work without affecting their payments. Job Search Allowance recipients for 3 months or more and aged under 18 will now be able to undertake voluntary work for up to 30 days in a year, rather than the current 20. Recipients aged between 18 and 49 will have a similar concession extended to them. The modified voluntary work rules currently applying to over 55 year olds which allows up to 65 days of full-time voluntary work in a calendar year without affecting payment, will now apply from age 50.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        People aged 50 and over on either Job Search or Newstart Allowance will benefit from the relaxed reporting  requirements which currently apply to the over 55 year old age group and benefit from the rule for the same age group that the activity test is satisfied if the person earns at least 35% of average weekly earnings from employment entered into on or after 1 January 1990.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill introduces several beneficial changes to Employment and Education Entry Payments from March 1993. The Employment Entry Payment for Disability Support Pensioners is being increased from $200 to $300 and qualification for it will no longer depend on continuous receipt of payment for at least 12 months. An Education Entry Payment of $100 will be introduced for Disability Support Pensioners. Widow B Pensioners and sole parents who are Special Beneficiaries rather than Sole Parent Pensioners because of lack of residence, will now also have an Employment Entry Payment and an Education Entry Payment available to them.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Permanent Australian residents and holders of certain temporary entry permits who arrive in Australia on or after 1 January 1993 will have to serve a 26 week waiting period before Job Search, Newstart or Sickness Allowance is paid. For permanent residents special benefit would be available if they satisfy the hardship test. The new restriction will not apply to people granted permission to enter Australia before the announcement of this measure in the Budget on 18 August 1992 or to people entering Australia as the partners of Australian residents of more than 26 weeks' standing, or for people entering under the Refugees, Humanitarian and Special Assistance Program, or people who are accepted as refugees under a Domestic Protection (temporary) Entry Permit. A Migrant Access Package will improve services for clients of non-English speaking background.

        The existing three-tier social security appeals system of internal review, Social Security Appeals Tribunal and Administrative Appeals Tribunal is to be streamlined. People will no longer have access to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal unless they have first gone through the formal internal review mechanism which involves review by an Authorised Review Officer.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Several amendments taking effect in March 1993 deal with managed investments as they affect the operation of the income test. The rules governing managed investments will be simplified by removing the categorisation of these investments into accruing return investments and market-linked investments. Income for income test purposes will be calculated by multiplying the current value of the investment by its growth rate over the previous 12 months. Any losses assessed on managed investments may be offset against gains during the same period on other managed investments. Offsets will also be available against gains on listed shares and other listed securities from September 1993 when the managed investments rules are extended to listed shares and other listed securities. The income test will take account of growth on the managed investment only for the period during which the investor was a social security client.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Superannuation benefits are also dealt with in this Bill. Money in a complying superannuation or rollover fund  will be disregarded for income test purposes until Age Pension age or until an annuity or pension starts to be paid. Once the person reaches Age Pension age, the investment will be handled under the managed investment rules. If an annuity or pension becomes payable, the rules on annuities or pensions will apply. If a withdrawal is made before Age Pension age, that part of the withdrawal representing growth while the investor was receiving pension, benefit or service pension will be assessed as income for 12 months.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        From Royal Assent, allocated pensions and other pensions and annuities where the payment can be varied at the recipient's discretion, will be subject to the assets test and will be income tested by multiplying the current asset value by the earning rate of the fund.

        As from April 1993, Commonwealth Fringe Benefits currently available to pensioners who satisfy the Fringe Benefit income and assets tests will be available to all pensioners and to long-term beneficiaries or allowees aged 60 or more.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill was initially introduced in November 1990 by my predecessor Senator Jo Vallentine. I am reintroducing it because of the continuing need to address peace and non-violence within the defence agenda and to support defence personnel's right to make decisions according to their consciences.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill is based on the notion that major changes have occurred in all matters pertaining to war. War has changed—the days of face to face combat between huge forces of foot soldiers have gone forever. War has become increasingly dependent on high technology weapons systems, as a result of which we are supposed to become accustomed to such terms as "collateral damage"—meaning civilian deaths, and "surgical bombing"—meaning maximum damage for minimum bombs. With the change in warfare, there have been many effects which make people think of war in a completely different way. We are now in an age in which the scope of military activity inflicts unintended casualties and damage simply because of the nature of warfare.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With these changes to the nature of war, and there are many more, there has come a change in many peoples' attitudes to the possibility of their participation. For some, that would preclude any idea of serving in the armed forces at all, and it is pleasing to note that earlier this year the Parliament passed the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill, which will allow people subject to conscription into the armed forces to declare a position of conscientious objection for particular wars.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, it is also clear from the experience of the Royal Australian Navy, and the American armed forces at the time of the Gulf War, that some serving members of those forces regarded the war as unjustified and that their consciences could not allow them to serve.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill would allow serving members of the Australian Armed Forces to refuse to serve in a particular conflict on the grounds of conscience without incurring a charge of breach of discipline.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As Senator Vallentine said in her Second Reading Speech in November 1990 . . .    "It is not a question of discipline. It is an issue of selective objection. It will not undermine the Australian Defence Force because I doubt if many serving military personnel will feel the need to avail themselves of it, but we should recognise the right of those who choose to do so.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It has been suggested that such a provision would make planning and training difficult, but in fact it should be obvious that to have a situation as confronted the Navy during the Gulf War, the disruption caused by a sailor refusing orders is infinitely worse than being prepared beforehand that some serving personnel will not be available for the particular tour of duty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ability of military authorities to be more certain of the state of readiness of their forces when committing troops to battle will be enhanced if mechanisms exist for dealing with CO status people before embarkation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        War, if we are to tolerate it at all, should be the preserve of those who agree to participate. No person should ever be placed in a position of having to fight against their will and against the dictates of conscience.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is appropriate to reiterate comments made in my May 1992 speech in relation to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government's amendments to the Defence Act of 1903 took a most enlightened step in relation to the right of conscientious objection, namely that people who are conscripted into the ADF should be able to claim objection on grounds of conscience to particular wars or acts of war.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government recognised that the nature of international relations has changed, and that warfare has changed, and that there are people in our society, indeed in all societies, who may not have an overall objection to war, but may believe sincerely that a particular war is morally wrong and that they would not be prepared to be involved. I congratulate the government on this move.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, this enlightened move should also be extended to serving members of the armed forces. How can we say to the people of Australia that they are to take their place in the world fully recognising their responsibilities, and then tell members of the armed forces that they are not adult enough to decide for themselves whether they will fight in particular war operations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Can we, as a society, claim the power to force a person to engage in war? For many years, the overwhelming response to that question has been yes—at least for the vast majority. It has been assumed that when the dominant groups of forces in society have decided to take up arms, offensively or defensively, then all "able bodied men" were required to follow suit to indicate their solidarity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In some ways, it was easier in years gone by. It was easy to divide the world into "good and bad" or "them and us". But the world has changed, societies have changed, and individuals have changed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The disintegration of the superpower polarity in the world has made the world less subject to cataclysmic acts of war but more subject to regional conflicts—precisely the types of conflicts in which peoples' ethnic and religious loyalty is likely to be a factor in determining whether or not they are prepared to fight.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the past 50 years the international community has created numerous covenants and instruments to express a range of rights, privileges and responsibilities which have come to be regarded as essential for the pursuit of normal and fruitful relations within societies and in the international community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These covenants have contributed enormously to peoples' sense of their place in society—people are more aware of their role as shapers of their society. In western societies like Australia, people have come to the realisation that citizenship requires more than following the herd.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        People have come to realise that the onus of decision-making rests with them in so many areas of life. The ballot box is not the only point at which people express their thoughts on national directions and issues. Recent history has shown that Australians do not unquestioningly accept governments' views on a range of issues.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this environment it makes no sense to suggest that people cannot and will not make up their own minds, based on the dictates of conscience, about the rights or wrongs of war and individual acts of war.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Furthermore, if life is a fundamental human right, then we must accord each person the right to choose which circumstances will induce them to place their life on the line for their country or any other cause.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government, having recognised these issues in relation to conscripts, cannot now claim that those who are members of the Australian Defence Forces are endowed with less humanity, less ability to weigh up the morality of certain wars, or that they should be accorded less rights than potential conscripts. It is ultimately beyond the power of any government or military authority to force a person to fight; it is a mark of a civilised and mature society that it will not place an individual or a military authority in a position in which the individual will feel compelled to take unlawful measures to follow the dictates of their conscience.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In passing this legislation, the Parliament would be indicating that Australia is a mature nation, that it takes its place in the international community with a sense of self-assurance and pride in its people. It would be saying that we have shaped, and are shaping our national values on the basis of mature reflection on our place in the world, and not on some jingoistic browbeating of those to whom we would look in time of conflict.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill asserts the fundamental right of members of Australia's armed forces to make their own decisions about those situations in which they are prepared to put their lives at risk.

If there is to be no fringe benefits tax payable in respect of this select few, could Mr President advise the Senate of the basis of their understanding that no fringe benefits tax would be payable?

On page 7 the Committee notes that the President informed the Committee that there would be a wider review of protective security at Parliament House, which had commenced at the time the report was put together.

As I expressed during the Committee hearings, we seem to have a very large number of APS officers costing an awful lot of money who are really responsible only for the security on one side of the building. We have attendants in the rest of the building but they are not armed in the same fashion as are APS officers. Clearly, there are two levels of security within the building. It may be that it is rightfully seen that there are two different levels of risk. But I think the incident in question with the four-wheel drive vehicle and also other incidents would demonstrate the fact that the risk is not perhaps as easily delineated as has previously been the case. Have discussions already addressed the role of the APS and whether a more uniform security arrangement can be applied to the building?

We did not seem to be getting what I would consider to be terribly good value for money from the relevant department in terms of the amount of money that the Senate or the Joint House Department was forking out for this. I think this is one of the areas that we need to look at as well. If the assessment is made that we are going to have APS officers, I think the Committee would have to be satisfied that we are getting value for money out of those officers. During the hearings, it certainly did not seem to be the case that for the enormous amounts of money being expended we were getting the appropriate number of officers on the deck at any one period.

         —As I just said to Senator O'Chee, this is a matter that concerns us. It is a matter which was pointed out in the Auditor-General's report. It is one of the main things that are being dealt with in the report that we have asked to be completed by 26 November. I believe that the people who are going to be directly involved are the Security Controller, the Usher of the Black Rod and the Sergeant-at-Arms.

         If that is to be the final and arbitrary decision on security in this building, that is not good enough. If I understand your answer to me, Mr President, we are still looking at the paperwork which we were doing two months ago. Could you possibly give me a summary of how far we have progressed and when we can expect to see the definitive plan?

         —Again—and I will see whether I can find the exact page reference—I think something like a quarter of an hour or 10 minutes went by before anything was done. There were a whole lot of concerns about the way in which the matter was handled. Also, if I recall, the whole justification for spending additional taxpayers' dollars in having an outside consultant involved in this was that it was considered that the people who are on the payroll, as it were, could not adequately do the job. If my understanding is not correct, would you mind telling me why we then used external consultants if these people were judged to be quite sufficient?

But I am afraid we cannot afford to spend $10m a year and hope that somebody guesses right. The fact of the matter is that there is provision in this building to have it evacuated in a proper and systematic way. If that is not the case, we should hear about that as well.

I do not ask that in any sense other than that my understanding is that some ceiling has been placed on the overtime available in printing and the work is being contracted out because the wages ceiling, I think, has been breached by about 20 per cent. With respect, notwithstanding my views about the contracting out, the only example of outside printing I have seen was deplorable. Having said that, I refer more to the difficulty of containing salaries.

         It was inevitable that, with the increase in postage granted to the House of Representatives and the Senate, there would be an increase in printing; and that with the increase in printing there would be an increase in wages. That is posing some strains on the wages and salaries component. I am trying to get very clear in my own mind whether there is a difficulty. That is what I understand to be the situation, but I have gone to the bother of discovering that for different reasons. While I am not conscious of it in any way impinging on the services of the transport section of the Department of the Senate, does the same thing apply there? I ask that in the context of what was a grave reservation of mine at the time, as the President will remember, when we said that the Committee considered that the Department of the Senate should be able to cope with this decreased level of funding—despite the cuts.

         —Unless some artificial fat has been built in somewhere else and has been transferred to make up for a shortfall of necessary funds for the committee system, clearly the Budget is less than is necessary and clearly the words used—`the Committee considers that the Department of the Senate should be able to cope with this decreased level of funding'—are in error. They are fundamentally wrong. The truth of the matter is that Mr O'Keeffe tells us in his letter to the Committee that it is becoming progressively more difficult to maintain existing committee levels—not that it may become more difficult, not that we have to watch out for it, but that it is becoming increasingly more difficult. That is what Mr O'Keeffe is telling us. That contradicts the view of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee that the Senate should be able to cope. They are the words—`the Committee considers that the Department of the Senate should be able to cope with this decreased level of funding'.

         I turn to a further matter relating to committees—that is, the question of part time staff. I refer to correspondence between me and the Mr President, and specifically to his response, which was stimulated by some deliberate questions I asked of the Clerk at the meeting of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee relating to the circumstances in respect of part time staff. The Clerk informed the Committee, in what I thought was a very logical way, that part time staff would be provided to committees where it was desirable, on the part of the Committee, and where it best served the interests of the Committee. He did not say that we would have imposed on committees some bureaucratic system whereby, because the Public Service had decided it would have part time staff, the committees would have to wear them. I was quite deliberate on that in a number of questions I asked and I was assured that such staff would be provided only where it was compatible with efficiency for the Committee.

If, ultimately, the advice is that the Committee or any other committee does not want part time staff, for the only reason that committees never want part time staff, they will not have part time staff. No nonsense of a suggestion is ever put that there is some subliminal, hidden reason why any committee would in some general way oppose part time staff, any more than we oppose smokers or non-smokers, women or men, those over 40 or those under 40 or those fat or thin.

I would be interested to know which committees used or chose to use consultants—not in a critical sense but just for information. I presume that the remaining consultancies were used for the running of the Department of the Senate per se. I wonder whether I could be told if that is because the Department of the Senate believed that it was understaffed in certain areas or they were one-off specific items and if the Department would expect to spend a similar amount on general running costs in the next financial year.

         —The last remarks were somewhat gratuitous. My understanding, and I do not think it is different from the one we had when we discussed it at the Committee, is that there are important functions for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in coordinating the development of ESD. That involves more than matters that are solely the responsibility of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. A number of agencies are involved. Therefore, there is an important coordinating function.

         There would be some concern if any of the agencies with a particular brief—DASET, Primary Industries and Energy, whichever it were—were to chair the group because it might be felt that it indicated a lack of balance between the competing interests.

         Individual policies and programs within the ESD strategy rest with the portfolio Minister and his or her Department. In this instance, the responsibility for this area rests with the portfolio Minister for DASET and her Department. That is why it is dealt with by it. There is a broader coordinating function, which is the responsibility of PM and C. In this instance, they are individual legislative matters. But other policy matters come up which may be the responsibility of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories or some other Minister. They deal with those. We are not doing it twice, nor is PM and C, but there is an overall framework within which those individual activities are undertaken.

         I remind this Committee that Minister Kelly not only endorsed the schools environment pack but also made sure her photograph was on it. However, when the flak came back about what an outrageous, lopsided and ill-informed document it was, she said she did not even know what was in it and her Department approved it all. These are not rude comments about Minister Kelly. Unfortunately they are very apposite comments.

         What particularly concerns me is the fact that Senator McMullan refuses to say whether the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was advised of any of these consequences of the Bill. If the Commonwealth is going to foot half of the cost of the Wet Tropics Management Authority—and it would not be inappropriate to talk about the enormous cost of that body—then I believe there ought to be some decent restraint and supervision imposed over the body, particularly when there are these extensions of the power of the Wet Tropics Management Authority that one could arguably see as encroaching upon the external affairs powers of the Commonwealth.

         Much of the preparation for the Northern Australia economic development strategy really did concentrate on three main areas that do impact in Northern Australia; firstly, the changes in the volume of economic activity; secondly, the changes in the level of living in the communities; and, thirdly, the changes in productive efficiency. However, the economic development report really only addressed the changes in the volume of economic activity or the growth over time in the area which we generally call Northern Australia.

This document was recently released by the Minister for Northern Australia, Mr Ben Humphreys, and is of some 40-odd pages.

         That is my major criticism of this entire report. All it is is a cobbling together of programs that are, should be and could be very properly performed by all of the various arms of functional government, no matter what political persuasion or no matter where. I find that there is no real emphasis on goals or strategies in the area of social justice. There is no statement even of this Government's philosophic commitment as to what it sees as social justice that we hear so much about in this particular report. The report does not go into any constructive or viable ways in which the Commonwealth will work with the State or Northern Territory Government to achieve what the Labor Government so often prides itself on achieving in the area of social justice.

         I am sure that Senator McMullan will be aware that during the Estimates process I asked a number of questions of all of the functional departments as they operate in Northern Australia for the details of their consultancies. It is very interesting to look at the consultancies that were given in the current financial year by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. Over a quarter of a million dollars worth of consultancies were given and what do they achieve?

         The first one was from the Office of the Status of Women, which was a report on implementing the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, particularly as it applied to the Northern Territory. The cost of that was $2,500. From the Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit to the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association there was a $45,000 consultancy to inform Aboriginal media, and through them the Aboriginal and Torres Strait communities, about the reconciliation process. That is already going on and is well known. That report cost $45,000.

         An amount of $155,510 is allocated to the Centre for Applied Economic Research and Analysis to study the economy of northern Australia and to prepare the economic strategy options for developing policies in the development of northern Australia. As we know, that report came down well before this Budget, yet nothing can be identified as having properly flowed from that economic strategy into this year's Budget. Also, from the Office of Northern Development, $23,524 is paid to the Australian Science and Technology Council for the development of a north Australian research compendium. But then of course one goes into that body itself, the Australian Science and Technology Council, and finds that there is an additional $30,000 for the development of this compendium.

         This Labor Government is good at research. It is good at passing out consultancies to its mates all throughout Australia and keeping academics and various people writing reports. This can be seen in any department—the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the minerals area, the CSIRO, the whole lot of them. During the Estimates, I will be producing a document which sets out every single one of the consultancies produced by every Federal department as it applies to the Northern Territory. It will be a staggering document and it will be an indictment that none of the results of all of those reports—whether they be on national parks and wildlife services or on the environment—end up being commented on in an interim report on social justice.

         I would have thought social justice was about jobs, about employment of people in the community. As I said earlier, in this report on social justice there is no acknowledgment that the underlying principles of social justice depend almost entirely on the provision of employment. Instead, one gets the impression from reading this that northern Australia is an underprivileged or Third World country. That is not the case.

         There is no linkage between the two reports, namely, the social justice strategy and the economic development strategy which was brought down earlier in the year. In the March Estimates I asked a question of the head of the Office of Northern Development, Mr Gray:

        The coordination is in the form of the secretariat having had discussions with those who are conducting the economic strategy at James Cook University. There is clearly going to be reference in the economic strategy to those schemes, if you like, or those processes which will impact upon economic development in the north so far as the various services provided by government agencies impact upon it. There is communication and consultation between the two groups who have the responsibility for putting those two strategies together.

        Fine pious words in March, but where are they now? Why is it not commented on in the interim report? Where is the coordination? There is no drawing together of the two in any way that would properly sustain a community in northern Australia. It makes me mad that this Government is running around throwing out millions of dollars of largesse in consultancies and economic studies, but not on the programs that will assist people living in remote parts of Australia or in the northern part of Australia.

         It is very important also to look at a number of the areas where we would expect the various departments to pull together. I find this interim report of the social justice strategy to be so transparent in that it is obviously written by someone who is used to doing academic reports for universities or someone else. The only new jobs I can see being created through it are going to be in the production of more reports in more areas. Whether it is the Department of Industrial Relations and ATSIC combining to fund a half a million dollar establishment and first year operational costs of a national Aboriginal employer association, why has there not been a cooperation of bringing the Aboriginal people and the general community together in the employment agencies that already exist?

         There is a $36m allocation over the next four years to supplement the phased implementation of award coverage to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations funded wholly or partly by ATSIC. The report goes on and on in these particular areas. I would comment that the consultancy list from DEET is not yet in; the full list from ATSIC is not yet in for these considerations; the consultancy lists from the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council are not yet in. I am wondering why so many of the departments have not yet been able to respond. They are not alluded to in the social justice report, yet I know that the Government has missed hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars.

Fightback also outlines the benefit for workers in northern Australia and the ensuring of full statehood of the Northern Territory as part of constitutional development processes. There is no mention of any of that in any of these reports from this Department. Is it any wonder that people in the north have lost confidence in the Labor Government?

Why in the 1992-93 Budget were there no new initiatives identified for northern Australia, particularly those that had been alluded to and had been very obvious in the media earlier this year, were under the full consideration of the Centre for Applied Economic Research and Analysis, and those that were tabled earlier this year in the report to the Commonwealth Government entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         Secondly, why is the final consideration of the social justice strategy by this Labor Government not proposed until after the next Federal election? I would have thought that, particularly prior to an election, a Labor administration would have wanted to consider and would normally have been considering many of the appropriate goals and strategies of social justice on which I have commented and which I believe are so deficient in this particular report.

         That which was properly an Estimates committee question related to the timetable for the social justice strategy, and I have to say that I played no part in and cannot give the Senate detail about the reason for that particular debate. But quite clearly, with the interim report having come out only recently, if we are going to have any serious consideration of questions of consultation on the scale that I think Senator Tambling would agree would be appropriate with a document like that—and as the normal process of consultation takes quite a long time, and as we have a very geographically dispersed population whose responses are significant in such considerations—it is only appropriate that a few months be given.

         I think the date is mid-1993 with 30 June being the last day that we expect it might be given, but hopefully it will be earlier. It does not seem to me to be an unreasonable time.

         —I am concerned at Senator McMullan's answers because these issues were all raised here in the Senate in the Estimates committees. I refer in particular to the consideration that took place on 27 March 1992. I would have thought that in the preparation of this interim report the issues and the timetabling would have been well and truly flagged, and therefore the various issues should have been addressed in the Budget context. Certainly by now, 9 November, quite some considerable time has passed in which many of the discussions should have taken place.

         I note that towards the end of the interim report there is basically a regurgitation of all of the programs of other departments and agencies, such as Telecom, Australia Post and various broadcasting areas. They are put forward as if they were major initiatives of the Government. But, of course, each and every one of the programs identified in that report had been flagged to Government in previous years' Budget considerations. There is nothing new in anything that is stated in this social justice strategy. It is merely a cobbling together of programs that the Government has been considering, has been funding, and has been carrying out for a number of years. There are no new orders of priority, there are no goals, there are no strategies, there are no reassessments that are so necessary in these particular areas if in fact social justice is to be addressed as having a priority in the community.

         Similarly, the considerations of the economic development strategy were well known back before March. In fact, I believe that I raised these in the Estimates late last year and, therefore, I was looking in the context of the August Budget for some deliberate statement. Senator Collins had previously been appointed the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, a position which has now been inherited, as part of the necessary government changes, by Mr Humphreys. But I would have thought that the fact that Senator Collins is also from northern Australia would have put more priority on and initiated more concern in this particular area.

         But, very obviously, the Government has looked at the marginal seat strategy and I think has presumed that, because the seats of Kalgoorlie, Grey, the Northern Territory and Kennedy are all currently held by Labor, it really did not have to address any major new initiatives in those four or five principal northern seats. Let me tell you, Madam Temporary Chairman, I think those seats will be well worth watching at the Federal election.

         As you, Madam Temporary Chairman, very well know, one of the greatest problems facing people in rural areas is getting decent education for their children. We are not talking about whether they can get to the library. We are not talking about whether they can do science experiments. We are talking about basic education that people in city areas take for granted. An example of this is being taught to read and write by a competent teacher. You know, as I know, Madam Temporary Chairman, that in many rural areas of Queensland, in many areas of northern Queensland—for example, the peninsula and areas in the direction of Mount Isa and Camooweal and further south—there are massive educational problems. With all the best will in the world, unless parents are adequately backed up they can never give a standard of education remotely approaching the standard of education that these children could get if they had a proper teacher. The necessity, therefore, is to ensure that those parents get adequate support and that the educational programs that are in place are educational programs that give equity.

         I suppose the real root of the existence of the Office of Multicultural Affairs lies in the fact that it was very political. Our previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, came from a seat that had a very high, shall we say, ethnic component.

We must not forget that this year this Government will spend $13,400m that it does not have. We feel it is appropriate that the Government constrain its spending wherever possible so as to reduce that. When one looks at some of the spending that has been going on and some of the grants that have been made by this Department and other departments on so-called ethnic issues, one really does get very perturbed at how the Commonwealth is spending money.

         We found something in excess of $30,000 given to trade union groups in Western Australia to run multicultural talkback radio programs about the benefits of union membership; $18,000 was given to another group of people to put together multicultural audio tapes on award restructuring and the benefits of belonging to a union. I actually took the time to listen to the audio tape, and every 20 or 30 seconds there was another plug for members of the Vietnamese community to join the union and to participate in the activities of the union and get politically involved.

         As a member of what some people describe as the ethnic community, I can say that many people in the ethnic community do not agree with the way this money is being spent and that many people in the ethnic community can see far better ways of allocating the Government's largess, if largess must be allocated at all. I would hope, speaking for myself, that very rapidly this Department will be truly superfluous. I think some 18 months or two years ago I asked officers of the Department what their prime objective was, and they said it was to have a more harmonious community where ethnic differences did not matter. I said to them, `When are you going to make yourselves redundant?'. It is interesting to note that they have not made themselves redundant yet. They are still spending the money. But, if the goals of the Office of Multicultural Affairs are truly to create a more harmonious Australian society, then one of the steps to that must be to make themselves redundant.

         Whilst it gives people a nice, warm inner glow, we could do a lot to cut back spending and waste. Ultimately, I believe that it does make a more harmonious community, because I know there are many people who are resentful at money that they see to be thrown at this ethnic group or that ethnic group. In a time of recession this creates ethnic tension and differences. That is something that I do not want to see in this country. I do not want to see a return to some of the racist attitudes of the Cold War years. But, if the Government continues to throw money around like this, and is being seen to throw money around like this, of course that will be the only consequence.

         It is important that we recognise not just that we live in a multicultural society but that we live in a constantly changing one. It is not a fixed body in which, once we have established harmonious relations between those people, we can then fold our tent and go, because there is a continuing inflow into Australia of people from diverse backgrounds with diverse needs and seeking from the Australian community, through their governments and community groups, a diverse range of assistance. It is appropriate that government should seek to provide to those people access to the same sort of information—as far as we can—and the same level of information, assistance and support that the rest of Australia takes for granted with regard to information and support that will facilitate them participating in society on the same basis and with the same capacity to be as effective as other elements in our society, including those from the more mainstream culture.

         It is important that we are not afraid to say that we recognise and make special assistance to people who have special needs. It is not an act of equity to treat everybody equally when their requirements and demands from the society are different. But I accept the bona fides of Senator O'Chee's contribution. We do not share our views about the appropriate role of government in achieving the outcome. I do not think we are talking about large amounts of money that will impact upon the macro-economic policy of the nation, but he is entitled to articulate his view and this is the forum for doing so.

         —Many of the issues that Senator McMullan has raised are correct. There is always going to be a flux in the ethnic mix, but we are saying that there is no point in having two departments to do what could be done by one department. Whilst Senator McMullan, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, may feel that it does not matter whether this or that amount seems to be particularly large, it does matter at the end of day. It may not seem to Senator McMullan that it will damage the macro-economic settings, but I only need to remind him—and I hope he will bear this in mind as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer—that if one minds the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves.

         Whilst we are on this program, I take the opportunity to address the issue of the Office of the Status of Women as well. One of the things that concerned me was the large amount of money that was given to the Manungka Women's Association—$19,700, in fact—that was intended to help establish a textile industry in the Kimberley desert. When I discussed this with a number of people, since the hearing, most of them were shocked that we would try to establish a textile industry in the Kimberley desert when the textile industry in places much closer to our population centres is dying at a great rate of knots. We are informed that approximately 50 women are expected to be trained—25 in each community.

         One of the interesting things is that the money was allocated for the 1991-92 financial year but is not due to be acquitted until March 1993. If one reads the answer very closely, given that this answer was written some time in September-October, one will find it a little disturbing. The answer says that preparatory work on the project has been done and training will begin shortly. This money was allocated in the previous financial year. I am concerned that the money that has not been spent in that year will be spent in this year, or maybe the possibility is that further moneys are being allocated to this project. Perhaps Senator McMullan would be kind enough to provide us with advice on that concern.

         —During the Estimates hearings with regard to the Australian Manufacturing Council, it came to our attention for the first time that Mr Mountford, who heads up—for want of a better word—the Australian Manufacturing Council has been employed as a consultant. The real problem with that is that for the preceding years, the Parliament has been misled because we were led to believe that Mr Mountford was a regular paid employee under the normal terms and condition of a Commonwealth employee. The curious statement was made that it was thought he was not somehow a consultant. Then suddenly there was a change of mind and it was discovered this year that he was a consultant. This really shows that the Senate Committee was misled. No good reason has been provided as to why the report was made in the way it was for a number of years and then was suddenly changed. I wonder whether we could have some more information that could perhaps lead us to understand why the Senate was misled for a number of years?

         I make the point that the AMC is not required to seek approval from the Department for its consultancy proposals. However, in processing the latest contract to re-engage Mr Mountford, the Department, as part of its new procedures, considered it was arguable whether it should be deemed a consultancy. It was then decided to err, as I said, on the side of caution and that was why the Mountford consultancy was included in the 1991-92 annual report. While the AMC is not required to seek approval from the Department for its consultancy proposals, the Department does in a technical sense process these contracts.

There is no good reason why Mr Mountford is a consultant. There is no good reason why Mr Mountford ought not be simply a regular employee like anybody else within the Minister's Department.

         —I do not think that is so much the difficulty. It was just that when Mr Mountford was first engaged for a period of two years in June 1988, there was no requirement to list consultants engaged in the departmental annual report. Mr Mountford was re-engaged in 1989 and 1991. Each of those contracts was for a period of one year and, as I have said, by implication, should have been listed in the Department's annual report. Mr Mountford was again re-engaged in 1992 for a period of one year. That contract was signed on 28 February 1992 and this contract was listed in the Department's draft annual report for 1991-92.

          When people shop at locally owned businesses, they are not only creating employment, they are also saving that business from going to the wall. Buying locally also helps to protect against higher prices in the future. We all remember that 20 years ago every town had one or two bakers, several butchers, a soft drink factory and several greengrocers, but now there are few, if any, left. People used to be able to buy their flour, meat, sugar and produce from several suppliers, but now the supply is limited to one or two companies and this has obviously affected the buying price.

          The big supermarket chains have used a lot of imported goods and this has, in turn, closed the small shops and small manufacturers who employed a lot of people. Regrettably, those people are now on the dole. However, I must say that just recently there has been talk about how the supermarkets are trying to ensure that so many more of their goods are Australian-made and not imported. The supermarket chains control the manufacturers and the farmers, and if they do not sell at their price, they just import the goods. At the moment, four in every five sales are made in a chain-store. When five out of five are made in chain-stores, what will people be paying then?

          The local bacon factory in Kingaroy is having to compete with imports, especially from Canada. Everything processed in the area is 100 per cent Australian—90 per cent of its meat would come from a 40 to 50 kilometre radius of Kingaroy and the rest would come from Dalby, Chinchilla, Jandowae or Monto. The company, which is currently employing 75 local people in jobs, has an annual payroll of $2.3m. This sort of enterprise certainly boosts the local economy. The bacon factory also handles about $13m worth of livestock a year.

         Finally, I would like to make mention of the decision by Coles and Woolworths to make it easier to identify Australian made products on store shelves. However, for the strategy to work there would need to be an urgent overhaul of Australia's food labelling laws to allow imported products to be clearly recognisable. The Queensland Grain Growers Association has led the truth in labelling debate for almost three years, with the association's stated policy being that imported food stuffs should carry large, visually dominant labels indicating that fact.

          In many cases, consumers simply cannot determine whether they are really buying Australian product or not, as enough flexibility exists in current food labelling laws to allow importers to imply that their product was made in Australia. The laws are obviously inadequate when one can read on the front of food packets that the product contained within is Australian, yet when one turns it over, one finds it is actually made or grown overseas and merely packed or processed here. Surveys by Coles and Woolworths have clearly shown that shoppers are willing to purchase a genuinely Australian made product, even if it is more expensive.

          As well as tightening up labelling laws, there is an urgent need for industry to take commercial action to protect itself from dumped and cheap imports. In the midst of the crisis currently hitting our rural community, Australia is importing more than $2 billion worth of food products every year. That is a tremendous amount.

          One industry which is still suffering from dumped goods is the peanut industry. That is an industry that I know very well because many growers in my home district are centred on Kingaroy. This Federal Government has failed in its duty to protect Australia's peanut producers by rejecting a peanut industry application seeking the imposition of anti-dumping duties.

          The peanut industry has been suffering from an influx of dumped overseas peanuts over the past three years, but the peanut industry has not been able to convince the Anti-Dumping Authority of its plight. In February this year I moved a motion condemning the Government for its refusal to implement anti-dumping and countervailing measures against the dumping of Chinese peanuts on the Australian market. Unfortunately, the Chinese peanuts have residue in them. That is one of the sad things that happened.

          The Australian Customs inquiry into the importation of the Chinese peanuts established that these imports have increased 300 per cent in the past three years. It admitted that the cheaper imports were being dumped and that Australian producers were suffering as a result. It also admitted that these actions were having a serious impact on Queensland's $30m a year peanut industry. If it does not rain soon in the Kingaroy district, no peanuts will be planted so that we can have a really good year with our peanuts.

Furthermore, tests on the Chinese peanuts have identified high levels of chemical residues which are illegal in the Australian industry. The thing that annoys me very much is that some of these imported Chinese peanuts are being mixed with good Australian peanuts by some firms which then try to promote them as being totally Australian peanuts, which is very wrong. The Minister who looks after Customs and the Government should take immediate action to halt the importation of these peanuts and thus provide a fair go for Australian peanut farmers instead of supporting those who live in China.

          As I said earlier, a whole smorgasbord of imported food is entering our market as subsidised products. At the same time very often our farmers have to plough their products back into the soil. This problem is not just one for farmers. I can understand housewives who, under current economic circumstances, try to buy the cheapest products when shopping. And who can blame them when we have seen our household income seriously eroded since this Government came to power? Many of those households now face life on the dole as unemployment rises steadily.

          Of course, any sensible shopper tries to cut costs by buying cheaper brands but with many of these dumped brands the products are not as tasty nor as nutritious as Australian grown fruit and vegetables. Many housewives would know that Australian grown and processed products guarantee the best quality in the world. When I go home at the weekend between the sittings of the Senate and do my shopping I certainly like to buy Australian products. I also like to buy them a bit cheaper if I can but it does not always work, of course. Our goods are grown under strict guidelines and processed under high standards of hygiene using the best and most advanced technology available.

There is an entire support network servicing these farmers and their products which is also affected.

I share with her a concern that Australian consumers do get imports of genuine quality and are not put at risk by imports. I also share her concern that we not be dumped on. I ask her to note that all she says is really meaningless when one looks at the approach that her coalition leader, Dr Hewson, has embodied in his Fightback package. I ask Senator Bjelke-Petersen to look at one specific part of that package. If she does have the interests of Queenslanders at heart, I ask her to take that independent approach of which we are well versed as coming from her.
