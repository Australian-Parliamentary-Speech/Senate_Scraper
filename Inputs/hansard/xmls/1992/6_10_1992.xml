         Mr Deputy President, as you will recall, the Senate found it necessary when we were last sitting to restrict Ministers in their answering of questions. That was not a procedure that we entered into without due consideration. The Senate had suffered constant abuse by Ministers of Question Time in that they had completely avoided their responsibility of answering questions and accounting for the administration of their portfolios. Rather they saw Question Time simply as an opportunity to get up and abuse the Opposition and the Opposition's program under the protection of the Chair for as long as they liked.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It was necessary in those circumstances to take some action to restrict them to try to bring this abuse to an end.

          We were aware, of course, that they had taken their instructions in this matter from the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the way that he and his people behaved in the other place, where they see the whole of Question Time simply as an opportunity to bucket the Opposition rather than to accept any responsibility to account whatsoever. This place did not have that tradition. In this place Ministers traditionally made an attempt to answer questions and to account for their performance. We wanted to get that tradition back on deck and to overcome the abuses that had been occurring.

          The experiment was put in place for one week. Of course, that is not really long enough for it to be properly evaluated. The purpose of this motion is to allow a longer period, that is, three weeks in all. I think in the meantime the matter should perhaps go to the Procedure Committee and other such bodies for consideration also. But three weeks should be a period in which the Senate can make a proper appreciation of the effects of this reform.

          Mr Deputy President, I thought I would give you a couple of examples of the public's reaction to this. The reaction from the public has been incredibly supportive. They are sick and tired of the abuse of Question Time, the abuse of the processes of this place and the abuse of Parliament itself. I will read just two letters to you. The first one was from the ACT, from a woman who said to me:

         I regularly watch the televising of Question Time and listen to the Parliament on radio. It was refreshing to be able to watch and listen to the Senate Question Time this week and find that questions were not only being answered succinctly but that a reasonable number of questions were also being asked. Question Time is at last being used correctly. Congratulations to those who thought of and instigated the new time requirements. I sincerely hope that it will continue to be kept in force and become mandatory for the House of Representatives also.

In doing so, I invite those Ministers who represent Ministers in the other place to take questions seriously, because there is little point in asking a question if we do not get an answer to those questions, and that is exactly what happened during the last week of sitting.

Nevertheless, we on this side of the House can do fairly rudimentary arithmetic and work out that more than half the Senate is going to vote for some sort of limit.

It is a matter which they may wish to act upon from tomorrow onwards if they so choose.

          —I must confess my profound disappointment at the way in which the Democrats have approached this issue. One would have thought that their track record would suggest that they were particularly interested in getting as many answers as possible, in particular, answers of substance. Not one thing has been said to demonstrate that the two-week exercise that we had during the last sitting was in any way defective other than in respect of a matter which the Democrats raised, that is, a clear breach of the undertakings given by Ministers. They are well paid to answer questions not only directly but also in a representative capacity. They chose not to do that, in a childish tit for tat response, and I thought the Democrats could have recognised that.

          But in every other respect what we achieved in that last fortnight was a dramatic reduction in the sort of nonsense that people go on with, such as filibustering or simply not answering the question, or `doing a Button', which involves stuttering and stammering and looking around for an interjection which one can then hang a 10-minute answer on. I would have thought, therefore, that what the Democrats ought to have done is to have given that experiment a fair chance, and indeed it has worked to about 90 per cent of expectations. There is only that one area where there has been a lack of bona fides on the part of those opposite and where I would have thought, with a little bit more flushing out, they could have been forced to accept responsibility for answering questions for which they do not have direct responsibility.

          Yet the Democrats have now reduced significantly the number of questions that will be answered in this chamber. Once again they have given those opposite the opportunity to go on with all the nonsense. There is nothing to suggest that two minutes is in any way inadequate to give an answer to a question. As the Democrats know, one can take as long as one wants; and if one gets a supplementary, one can do so twice. In every respect that procedure was capable of being made to work perfectly. Yet the Democrats, without giving us any warning—which I think is an indication of how serious they are about the whole exercise—have now provided a forum for the Government to fall back into the bad old ways. The Democrats ought to accept responsibility for that. Clearly, those on the Government benches will grab that opportunity with both hands because it gives them every chance to reduce the number of questions. The Democrats are responsible for that and I hope they will wear it.

          The motion that was moved in the last sitting week was an attempt to try to get the Government back to a reasonable standard of behaviour in relation to Question Time and to provide more questions and more time for those questions to be answered. The Australian Democrats today, in widening the ambit and length of time for answers, not only have taken us back to the position in which we were before this motion was moved but have created a climate for Question Time which is now worse.

          In my view, it is no wonder that Senator Hill received these letters. This was a major reform. It was a major improvement to Question Time and because—as Senator Alston said—a number of Ministers spat the dummy and said they would not answer their questions the Australian Democrats have totally buckled. They have undermined the most important reform to improve Question Time. Whatever private assurances, winks or nods that the Democrats have received from Government Ministers about them agreeing to this reform, they will find that in a fairly short period of time Question Time in this chamber will not only revert to the bad old days but will get worse.

We have often heard from the Australian Democrats that they are of an independent mind and do not vote the party way. Senator Sowada, Senator Kernot and Senator Bourne will all now be tested as to whether they are prepared to undermine Question Time and follow their leader, Senator Coulter.

It is remarkable that after we changed the system 34 questions were asked on 14 September and 34 questions were asked on 15 September. Then the Government got its act together and started to run phoney supplementaries and so on and we ended up with 28 questions being asked. But at least 28 questions were asked in the last two days of this system. Under the proposal the Democrats are putting up, the number of questions asked in Question Time could be cut to eight major questions and eight supplementaries. This is just ludicrous.

          On the contrary, they may feel they have been perhaps put down a little because the amount of time taken by Government Ministers to respond to Democrat questions has fallen from 2.33 minutes per question to 1.27 minutes per question. Perhaps the Democrats are concerned that they are not being taken seriously enough by the Government. I have always thought Government Ministers were taking them far too seriously. If we in this chamber would recognise more the benefits to the Parliament of this change rather than focus on the very narrow, selfish, self-interest of the Australian Democrats, this chamber would proceed far more satisfactorily.

Some time ago, I think about seven years ago, former Senator Reg Withers said that the period of time in the day we call `Questions Without Notice' should be referred to as `Questions Without Answers'. From the time former Senator Withers first said that up until the last couple of weeks, the Government has taken that to an absolute art form. The Government used the time to avoid giving a proper answer to a simple question and to either advertise their own policies, which they could do in a ministerial statement, or simply try to do a bucket job on the Opposition.

          In the last fortnight we saw a change for the better. Ministers had to answer questions in an articulate fashion within two minutes and could have another two minutes to answer supplementary questions if their first answers were not adequate. Ministers with any real capacity, which divides some of those opposite anyway, and a reasonable ego can easily give an articulate answer in two minutes. Those two requirements—having a reasonable capacity and a limited ego—cut out a significant portion of those on the other side. Nonetheless, it is the case that someone with a decent capacity and a limit on his or her ego can answer articulately within the two-minute time frame.

The whole purpose of Question Time is for us, the Australian Democrats and others on this side who might like to ask questions to ask them and get answers; it is not to suit Ministers—that is, it is for the benefit of the asker and not the answerer.

          I put it to the Democrats that it is not a question of whether a Minister wants four minutes to answer a question; it is a question of whether the person asking the question is happy with the answer that he or she gets in a two-minute time frame. If he or she is not happy with the answer given because that person thinks it is inadequate in some way, he or she can ask a supplementary question. Therefore, the Minister will have another two minutes to answer. That is how we should be looking at it.

          —Could we just for a moment be a bit practical and even a little fair and reasonable? From my experience of the last sitting week, it is my view that two minutes is unfortunately too short for people to give answers. In the last sitting week when genuine questions of substance were asked—and I mean genuine questions of substance, which were often by the Australian Democrats—Ministers were genuinely unable to complete their answers within two minutes. Therefore, what did we see? We saw the novelty of all these artificial supplementary questions from the Labor Party.

          While talking of time taken up in Question Time, let us not forget the spurious points of order that are raised by the Opposition, 98 per cent of which are not upheld. Four minutes will eliminate artificial supplementaries and give the Minister a reasonable time to answer. Four minutes is totally reasonable. It is not compulsory; it is an option. I remind members of the Opposition that this motion is for a two-week trial. We are quite obviously evolving into some other form. In two weeks we can evaluate the situation.

          —It is disappointing to hear that the Democrats have succumbed to pressure from the Government. I say that for the very simple reason that this proposed amendment will leave us in a worse situation than the one we were in prior to the alteration. The fact is that the new sessional order was brought in in a sense of desperation. It set a time limit of two minutes for answers given by the Government. The reason for that is amply displayed by analysis of the statistics. They clearly show that the very lengthy answers which the Government would indulge in were given in answer to dorothy dixers. They lasted for five minutes on average.

          The introduction of the two-minute answer for a trial period of a week met with good response from the general public. This Question Time is meant to be part of the checks and balances of our system of government. It is meant to be a time when questions are asked of executive government and Ministers are meant to give answers as part of the scrutiny process. They are meant to be accountable for their actions. Too often again and again we saw clear examples of the dorothy dixer being used by a Minister to make a ministerial statement which, quite frankly, ought to be done at a different time in the agenda of the Parliament.

          We agreed as a body to use for a period of one week the limitation of two minutes. By extending it to four minutes and two minutes we are reverting to a position which is worse than the situation we were in previously. We will have fewer and fewer questions and return to the abuse of Question Time—time that is used either to abuse the Opposition or to make a ministerial statement.

          I said it is disappointing to see that the Democrats have succumbed to pressure from the Government because there is no other rational reason for this amendment to take place. If they are honest in saying that we wanted to have a true trial, we would continue the trial that we put in place for one week for at least a fortnight to allow Ministers to get used to the new system whereby they have to be succinct and pertinent to the question asked. If that were to be the case, at the end of the day after a true trial the Democrats may say, `Let's discuss some slight modification'. But they simply want to go back to the old system—quite frankly, back to the bad old days. If the public is to be considered and properly served, we will reject the amendment of the Democrats and we will simply support, as Senator Chamarette has done, the substantive motion moved by Senator Hill.

I believe that the onus ought to be on the Government to ensure that Ministers' responses are within the Standing Orders. The onus ought to be on the people who are asking Ministers questions—whether they be members of the Government, Opposition members, Democrats or Independents—to do so within Standing Orders. If all that were done, there would be no need for such a sessional order.

          Given the fact that we are now presented with two possibilities—the one that was moved by Senator Hill, that is, the two-minute limit for answers, and the amendment moved by Senator Coulter, the four-minute response—I would prefer the two-minute limit. From experience, it seems to me that once members of Parliament are given a time, they tend to talk to that time.

My concern under those circumstances—as was pointed out previously in the debate—is that the four-minute response would cut down substantially the number of questions that could be asked and could be answered. It would not cut down the number of questions that the Democrats could ask at all. They would have the same number of questions.

I have not done the figures, but I have done other figures in the past and I would beg to say that my opportunity and the opportunity of Independents would in fact be affected under those circumstances. I stand to be corrected on that but, off the top of my head, I think our opportunities would be more limited under the proposal put forward by the Democrats than that put forward by the Opposition. Not out of self-interest but out of the interests of the people that elected me, I feel under those circumstances that I should vote for the motion of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill.

         —It is not a matter of the Prime Minister changing his mind or changing his statement of policy in any way. It is simply a matter of clearly articulating Australia's priorities. Australia's priorities are, clearly, firstly, to achieve global trade liberalisation; secondly, to advance the cause of regional trade liberalisation in a manner not inconsistent with global liberalisation; and a long way down the list of the hierarchy of preferences for us is the pursuit of subregional or bilateral free trade arrangements.

         We acknowledge that, in principle, such arrangements can constitute building blocs towards the establishment of those larger free trade areas or principles. But in practice there is a very real difficulty about making that assumption, particularly with bilateral arrangements in which the United States is a partner.

         As this matter was given closer attention and, in particular, in the light of the extraordinarily embarrassing embrace that was directed towards the United States by the Leader of the Opposition in complete indifference to Australia's larger trade policy interests in the Asian region, and in particular with our northern neighbours, it became apparent that there really did need to be stated more firmly Australia's reservations about the down side risks of focusing too much attention on bilateral arrangements.

         Those risks, so far as Australia is concerned, can very simply be stated. In the first place, it is very difficult for us to be able to contemplate a bilateral trade arrangement with the United States in which the benefits to us would manifestly outweigh the costs. Secondly, any such arrangement, if multiplied between us and a number of other so-called spokes, with the United States as its hub, would be very likely to create not an ease in the trading environment but, in the first instance at least, a greater degree of difficulty in the trade patterns as between the United States partners.

I was fortunate enough to be able to be present at that occasion and launched its new logo. The opening of business for the new Authority and the new Broadcasting Act, which took effect yesterday, mark the commencement of a new broadcasting regime in this country. The new regime is the result of an enormous amount of work to bring the 50-year-old Broadcasting Act of 1942 up to date and to provide us with a legislative framework which will take us into the next century. Given the dramatic changes that the new Broadcasting Services Act brings with it, the Government decided that the establishment of a new authority to administer the new regime was the appropriate way to go.

         The Broadcasting Services Act gives effect to the Government's 1987 election commitment, reiterated in 1990, to establish an appropriate regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry that will serve Australia into the twenty-first century. It is also a further significant milestone in this Government's micro-economic reform agenda, which has already achieved landmark reforms in telecommunications, aviation, the national rail system and the waterfront. The new Act provides a framework for broadcasting regulation which can respond to future technological changes. The charter of the Broadcasting Authority is designed to provide for regulatory responsiveness to accommodate this change and, in doing so, to minimise regulatory intervention.

         The new regime is clearly essential to enable the broadcasting industry to respond to the complexities of the modern marketplace and the opportunities created by an ever changing technological landscape. The Australian telecommunications manufacturing sector will also be a winner in a far more dynamic broadcasting environment.

         In the case of Victoria, governments do claim when they come to office that they have mandates for a whole range of things. But the important facts about Victoria are that the Liberals announced industrial relations policies on 23 April, 29 June, 23 and 26 August and last week, and on all occasions they made more vague the terms of what it was that they were proposing—but they announced on Monday that they had a Bill ready to introduce. It would have been very useful if the Bill that they had ready on Monday had been made available last week so that the electorate could scrutinise the actual contents of the legislation. They did not make it available, and I think that speaks for itself. But, most importantly about the weekend, the exit polls show that people voted on financial management of the Government and that the gap between the parties was closed because of the industrial relations policy of the Opposition.

         As I have said, we have been enjoying a record level of industrial peace. I do not think it can be said that there is a clear mandate cast in concrete for industrial relations reform in Victoria based on the election outcome in that State. We have been enjoying record industrial peace in this country, and I will continue to work, as I have been, with  State Ministers of all political persuasions to ensure that that record remains intact. I hope the Victorian Government can follow that in a constructive way too and, if it does, we will have a very good record of industrial harmony in this country.

         The fact is that the Federal Government has said that $1.6 billion will be available for the State public hospital systems over the next five years under these Medicare arrangements.

         The Opposition will take $1.3 billion away from the public hospitals system and use it to subsidise private health insurance premiums.

Should misfortune strike and the Opposition ever come into government, under its policies, 5 per cent will be slashed from the funds made available to the States, which means that less money will be available from the State treasuries to fund their public hospitals. There will be a deterioration in the public hospitals and less access to public hospital beds by ordinary Australians. Fear will drive those Australians to take out private health insurance. The Opposition's objective is that people fund the health care system through their contributions to the private health insurance premium system, or else the Opposition will subsidise it by taking money away from public hospitals.

         There have been all these accusations about listening to the car industry lobby. Senator Campbell should listen and try to understand what we did, if he can get it into his head. In 1991, we adopted an Industry Commission report which made recommendations about the future of the car industry in the face of opposition from the car industry, which wanted a higher in-point tariff. The Opposition then comes in here and asks me questions about yielding to the car industry lobby.

         The Industry Commission report that was adopted by this Government set down a program of reform in tariffs for the car industry to the year 2000. If those opposite do not like it, they should get the report out and, for the first time in their lives, tell us in their newly born view where the Industry Commission is wrong about this issue. The Opposition has a genius in the honourable member for Barker, who thinks he understands the cost of car production better than anybody else, including Toyota, which is just ridiculous.

         The game is not about how many businessmen who talk about 1970s issues—a time when the Opposition was in government—the Opposition has on side. The game is about looking at the appropriate regime for every particular industry in this country, which is what we have done. Members of the Opposition—I can name them, if necessary—went to the mining industry and said, `This Government is going to change the tariffs on four-wheel drive vehicles'. The mining industry thought, `God, they're going to put up tariffs on the four-wheel drive vehicles which we use'. They all came out and made statements,  but they are statements based on lies by people who do not know what is being talked about. That is what happened. If Senator Campbell wants to get an understanding of that he should look at the speech made by Hugh Morgan in his city of Perth.

Admittedly, this is not a straightforward or simple issue but relocating these people at this time would clearly only exacerbate what is already a volatile situation.

In respect of the decision, let me say one or two things. No-one in the debate over the years on this particular issue would ever have imagined the concept of freedom of political communication being embraced by the High Court in the way that it was. The only person in the High Court who, some five or six years ago, even contemplated such a principle was His Honour Justice Lionel Murphy. He was very much on his own at that particular time. I think it is fair to say that no-one involved in the committee hearings or in debate in this place would have expected the sort of decision—and also the reasoning behind the decision—made by the High Court.

It also allows for the preparation of a rehabilitation plan by the Commonwealth, taking into account Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention and the Tasmanian Environment Protection Act, having primary regard for the values of the World Heritage area and providing for the safety requirements as set out in the Tasmanian Mines Inspection Act. The Commonwealth will appoint an independent adviser who will work with the on-site supervising agent to oversee implementation of the rehabilitation plan.

As part of that, India was specifically designated as a target market, as indeed was Pakistan, with a sum of 1.5 million tonnes of wheat being identified alongside India in that respect. That is something that obviously gave us cause for concern at the time when the sales were merely in prospect. Obviously, we have even more concern now that those sales have been announced.

There was alleged to be a prospective EC activity in Pakistan—and I presume the same point would be made in this case—but there certainly is no actual activity going on.

         But, as Senator Panizza rightly interjects, there is a potential price depressing effect. It remains to be seen what price depressing effect the sale of red wheat will have on white wheat sales in the Indian market and more generally. But certainly there is legitimate ground for anxiety and for concern about that. I express that concern now, as I have done publicly already—others have done so in prospect before—and as we must continue to do. The difficulty is that the motivation clearly of this sale is far more to do in the present environment with politics in the United States than good trade policy or even legitimate counterassaults on the EC to bring to a head the battle we are all familiar with about export subsidies in the context of international trade generally.

         We do regard it as a deeply unhappy situation that markets which have been either traditional or significant for Australians should be targeted in this way. One cannot say that India has been a traditional market for Australia. It has not been much of a market for anyone for a number of years. It is only periodically when harvests fail and so on that external sales are sought at all. But there has certainly been some wheat to be sold there this year and there is no evidence that the EC has been in there with subsidised wheat. It is the US that has taken the step of putting its own wheat in there on a subsidised basis with all the implications that we are all only too unhappily aware of.

         The response I got was essentially the same as the one every Australian Minister has had over the last few months. It was repeated again on radio this morning by the US negotiator who was here in person a couple of weeks ago—that the US will continue to respect Australia's position, that the US will act only in those markets where the EC is anticipated to be likely to be present if it is not there already, and that the US is not targeting markets where Australia has been an active traditional player for the kind of wheat in question. The US made that point very strongly in the case of India and, as I say, there is some truth in that which has to be acknowledged.

I ask: firstly, has the Australian Securities Commission been advised by the Queensland Government interdepartmental committee for additional casino licenses of possible errors in its published report of May this year, specifically of a failure to mention a second submission from Jupiters for the Treasury building? Secondly, was this submission in conformity with the published minimum requirements for 200 hotel rooms in the Treasury casino project, and did it involve a complete gutting of the Treasury building so that only the bare facades of this National Estate registered building would remain? Thirdly, did Jupiters, in the knowledge that the IDC would grant a concessionary reduction of 50 in the number of rooms required for the hotel, prepare a second non-conforming tender concurrently with their conforming tender—

As well, the Government has guaranteed the SBS a base funding level maintained in real terms.

         The impact of a 10 per cent cut to SBS funding causes great concern among those—and there are many—who enjoy and benefit from a range of services provided by SBS. In terms of actually giving specific detail about the impact of a 10 per cent cut on an organisation that already has a fairly small budget, Mr Brian Johns, who formerly headed that organisation, said publicly just recently that if one took just one particular component of the organisation's operations it would completely remove, for example, all Australian production from SBS.

         So a cut of this sort, which certainly the Opposition has announced across the board—although it has not provided any detail of how the cuts would be made—would put SBS expansion, which is currently ongoing, in great jeopardy.

I wish to add to the answers I gave on those occasions. On 15 September, Senator Walters tabled a statutory declaration by one of the joint venture partners attesting to various negotiations and some disputation between the company and the Waterside Workers Federation over the handling of cargo for the joint venture vessels at Hobart. Like many industrial disputes, there have been claims and counterclaims from both sides as to the events that led to the withdrawal of the joint venture.

         On 9 September, in answer to a question from Senator Walters, I said that the joint venture had withdrawn before negotiations had commenced with the union. I should have said that the negotiations were not concluded before the announced withdrawal of the project, which I indicated in a subsequent answer on 14 September. This situation is confirmed by the company's statutory declaration, which indicates that the last meeting between the company and the union on 23 July failed to resolve the issues involved with cargo handling of the larger carrier vessels involved in the project.

         On 9 September, I also referred to the company involved in a joint venture as `facing financial difficulties'. I should have referred to the possibility of the joint venture facing difficulties having regard to problems encountered by similar joint venture proposals in other States when apparently the Russian partners had difficulty in meeting their contribution to the venture. I was suggesting that no doubt there were a number of factors associated with the overall commercial standing of the Tasmanian joint venture which were relevant to the decisions not to proceed. The difficulty in resolving the industrial relations issues may not have been the sole reason for withdrawal of the project from Tasmania.

         (1) Yes, the letter was prepared on the basis of knowledge of operations of the Quarry at that time. Senator Cook also stated that, `both the Commonwealth and the State would need to be consulted were there any proposals to extend the boundaries of your operation'.

         (2) The decision to curtail quarrying at Benders Quarry was based on conclusions reached by two studies commissioned by the Tasmanian Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage, Environment and Planning and the Forestry Commission. The Kiernan Report of November 1991 was commissioned to determine the relationship between the Exit Cave karst drainage system and the existing and proposed future boundaries of Benders Quarry. The Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning undertook an Assessment Report in January 1992 on Benders Pty Ltd proposal for future operations and extensions at the Quarry. Both reports concluded that continued quarrying operations at Benders Quarry are likely to damage the World Heritage values of the Ida Bay karst system.

         (3) Legal advice available to me concludes that there is no legal obligation for the Commonwealth to pay compensation under Clause 16 of the Cook/Groom Agreement. Given the express terms of the Agreement, there may be a political commitment to assist Benders Pty Ltd for any closure or relocation. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has offered to negotiate with Benders Pty Ltd an ex-gratia payment for closure of the Quarry of an amount not exceeding the Commonwealth relocation and redundancy offer to Tasmania of $476,000.

         (4) The Commonwealth had undertaken discussions and corresponded with the Tasmanian Government on the cessation of quarrying since February 1992. The Prime Minister indicated in a letter of 15 July 1992 to Premier Groom that should the Commonwealth financial offer for relocation of the Quarry continue to prove unacceptable, the Commonwealth would forthwith move by Regulations under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act to prohibit quarrying. Premier Groom had previously advised at a Tasmanian World Heritage Ministerial Council meeting on 8 July 1992 that the Commonwealth financial offer was unacceptable. The Commonwealth received advice in late July that Benders Pty Ltd was drilling holes in preparation for blasting. As the Prime Minister had not received a reply to his letter of 15 July 1992, a Proclamation was signed at a regular Executive Council meeting on 3 August 1992. The Commonwealth was mindful of the need to take prompt action, if required, to protect the World Heritage values of Exit Cave. Although the Proclamation was signed on 3 August 1992 it did not come into operation until 19 August 1992 after further correspondence and negotiations with Tasmania and written advice from Premier Groom on 18 August 1992 that his Government was not prepared to plan for relocation of the Quarry.

That debate revolved around the four points that the Government, through Senator McMullan, has brought forward again today, namely, that the Government is imposing several very severe conditions on its motion to take note of questions and answers after Question Time.

We then come to the proposition that each senator be restricted to speaking for four minutes in taking note of a Minister's answer. We had considerable debate on this matter the last time the issue was raised. The situation has since changed. The Government did agree to an amendment by the coalition that the original proposal for two minutes be extended to four minutes.

        Today, we have the Government sticking with the four-minute proposal despite the fact that we have increased the amount of time that Government Ministers will have to answer questions from four minutes to six minutes.

        The third condition that the Government has imposed is that the total amount of time in which to take note of answers be restricted to 30 minutes.

        However, I remind honourable senators that if those opposite restrict the total time in which to take note of answers to questions to 30 minutes they are in effect saying that there will be no time to consider answers to probably more than one-third or one-quarter of the answers that have been given during Question Time. That is a major restriction. The coalition cannot accept that proposition. On behalf of the coalition, I propose to move an amendment that the period of 30 minutes be omitted from Senator McMullan's motion and that the period of 60 minutes be substituted. The coalition can accept the fourth point in Senator McMullan's motion, namely, that the time taken for points of order will be omitted from the total time.

Therefore, I do not have too much optimism that the logic of the points I am making will be reflected in the response of the Democrats, but I continue to live in hope.

I hope commonsense will prevail. If honourable senators on both sides of the chamber are really serious about wanting to have the parliamentary institution operate efficiently, effectively and equitably, the coalition's amendments will be adopted.

        —As we have only just concluded Question Time, it is really quite remarkable that the empirical evidence which is before our eyes is not taken into account by Senator Short. Only a few moments ago he said that the amendments which we moved earlier to extend the time for answers to questions during Question Time from two minutes to four minutes wrecked Question Time. A quick tally of the Question Time we have just completed indicates that there were 21 questions and supplementaries at an average time of two minutes and 19 seconds. Moreover, as I recall, Ministers gave answers to all the questions and we did not have the ridiculous situation in which Ministers were simply taking questions on notice. Far from wrecking Question Time, the session today worked extremely well.

        Earlier when we were debating this matter the Opposition was attempting to say that a trial period of one week was insufficient and it wanted a further two weeks in which to continue with the system exactly as it was so that we would get reliable data on which we could judge its effectiveness. The same argument applied in this instance would mean that we would remain with the time of half an hour for taking note of answers. As I recall, during that week the time limit of four minutes for each speaker in taking note of answers was quite adequate: it allowed eight speakers within the half hour, even if every speaker took his or her full time.

        Now, with 21 questions and supplementaries, that should be adequate time for people to take note and for Ministers to make response, if necessary. For precisely the same reason that the Opposition was arguing earlier—namely, that the same system should apply for the three weeks so that we can get a good handle on how well it is working—we believe that the system should continue as it was in that week, and therefore we would stay with the motion as originally moved by Senator McMullan.

        —I think the logic just displayed by Senator Coulter explains why the Democrats got only 3 per cent in the Victorian election. We have heard a man who claims to be intelligent say that he is allowing the Government to have its way by leaving unchanged the time limit for comments on motions to take note of a Minister's answer because we need three weeks to test that—but one week was enough to know that two minutes was too short for Ministers to answer questions, with another two for supplementaries; that is, four minutes. That is simply evidence that he belongs, lock, stock and barrel, to the Government—and no doubt we will in time find out what the price of that was.

        —Yes, they clearly do. What is the purpose of taking note of an answer during Question Time? Why is the practice used and provided for? The answer is, normally, that the answer given by the Minister either is misleading to the public and needs to be dealt with then and there and that 24 hours is too long to go by; or that while the issue is top of mind, while the issue is hot, as it were, it is necessary to set the record straight and to have fair debate on it.

There is a fair exchange while people are thinking of the issues; they are not contrived; somebody has not sat down for two hours out in an office and written out a speech—which is supposed to be against our Standing Orders—as the Democrats do on so many occasions. They are the worst offenders. They stand here and read a prepared text on some issue, whereas if they were asked to speak to it in a spontaneous manner they probably could muster only one minute. I am trying to say that putting a limit on Question Time is the same as putting a limit on that necessary procedure for taking note of an answer given at Question Time; and, to my mind, they should not be tied one to the other at all.

        The reason we put a time limit on the amount of time that a Minister may take for answering a question is very simply that we were seeing an abuse of process. Question Time is meant to be a time when the Executive is accountable. Time and again we would see a dorothy dixer given to a Minister to propound Opposition policy or to make a statement about something that he wanted to get down without using a proper statement by the Minister—probably too much trouble was involved to do it properly and get it circulated so there could be proper debate on it. So we use the properly provided for ability to take note of an answer—or the pseudo-statement, dare I say, in many cases—so that debate can ensue immediately the Minister has made those statements. There is no relationship at all between the amount of time that ought to be available to debate an important statement that has been made during Question Time and the simple time taken to ask a question and for the initial answer to be given.

        So I find this whole debate rather spurious and contrived, but on the last occasion we in the Opposition did agree that we would accept the four-minute level when the two-minute response time was available for Ministers to answer both times—both on the answer and on the supplementary. But for the Democrats to now turn around and say, `Oh, well, you can have only four minutes to take note' when four minutes of answer has just been given just shows what a charade their independence is. It is non-existent. As I said, no doubt time will tell what sort of a deal has been done in order to get the Democrats to agree to what amounts to a gagging of free speech in this chamber.

        One can get very angry at the way the Government chooses to abuse the processes of this Parliament. Anything that does not suit the Executive's convenience somehow has to be struck down. But the truth of the matter is that it can only be struck down with the concurrence of the Democrats. It looks like they have achieved it again—and they cannot even be bothered to sit here and support Senator Coulter's arguments. As I said, the illogicality of what Senator Coulter had to say in his five-minute contribution surely shows why the Democrats are in decline, why Senator Powell left them and why they got only 3 per cent of the vote in the Victorian election.

        That figure is a bit inflated because there are a number of Question Times in which we expanded the length of Question Time and, of course, it incorporates those four days where we lifted the average very substantially.

That is exactly what it was like before the new rules were brought in.

        In contrast to some earlier weeks, I think the Government was remarkably disciplined today. Having won this magnificent coup from Senator Coulter, having fooled the Democrats and got their agreement to take Question Time back to the bad old days, Government senators were pretty sensible today. They said, `We will be fairly disciplined'. `Fairly disciplined' means merely answering the same number of questions which they have answered on average for the whole year. It certainly was not their worst day. That is what Senator Coulter has done. With this simple action of his, he has really destroyed after only four days the major initiative of this chamber in decades to improve the quality of Question Time.

        Then we come to the next issue. The next major initiative that was taken to try to improve the quality of debate in this chamber, and to try to make Ministers more accountable, was the procedure taken to take note of an answer after Question Time. Again, that was a very important initiative by the Senate chamber in which the real debates could properly occur and Ministers had to stay behind and answer for their administration and account for the answers that they gave in Question Time. There was nothing contrived about taking note of an answer. It was not like the formalised matter of public importance procedure. By and large, it was a very genuine debate; an attempt to make Ministers more accountable to the chamber.

        —He can do it anyway. I am simply indicating our position. Not that I have any enthusiasm for it: if Senator Kemp had been to the Procedure Committee he would understand that that is not surprising. Agreements are reached there, but they get rolled in the Opposition's party room and we do not get anywhere. After a lengthy discussion on what everybody thinks are worthwhile reforms, the agreements get knocked over by Senator Kemp and his sort in the party room and therefore it is a waste of time. Nevertheless, on the off chance that on this occasion that will not happen, if someone else wishes to refer this matter to the Procedure Committee we are happy to participate and raise a number of issues concerning procedures for streamlining the operations of this chamber to make it more efficient and effective. I think some of the debate around this matter somewhat debased what had otherwise been a useful contribution.

        Although a motion to take note of an answer is a legitimate procedure, if we want to pretend that there was no abuse of that procedure prior to these resolutions putting a limitation on the procedure, we are quite clearly distorting history. It was a much used but also a much abused procedure and I think a proper constraint has been put upon it which enables the Senate to work efficiently while individuals still have adequate opportunity, and enhanced opportunity compared to any previous arrangement, to outline their concerns and to proceed in the knowledge that while these procedures operate they will always get leave to proceed in the way that was not operating prior to these limitations. I think that is a fair balance which should be continued.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Loosley on this day, relating to Bangladesh.

        As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, made clear in his response to my question, the circumstances which confront the people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh have not attracted great publicity in Australia to date, either within our political circles or in terms of the media coverage of foreign affairs. I hope that situation changes, for the circumstances to which I allude deserve far greater attention.

         We are really talking about very serious human rights concerns that are both legitimate and immediate, and ones which I am pleased to be able to say, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made clear, have been taken up by Australia through our High Commission in Dhaka. Indeed, it is fair to say that the Australian Government has been particularly diligent in this area, as we have been of recent times in neighbouring Burma.

         As the Foreign Minister made abundantly clear, the Bangladeshi security forces have been less than exemplary in the maintenance of peace in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. There have been abuses and very definite identifiable violations of human rights. This is a continuing problem, hence my reason for raising it this afternoon in the Senate.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be aware, Bangladesh is a country that is heavily dependent upon foreign aid for basic services and infrastructure. In this regard, it is reasonable to expect that there will be respect for human rights within Bangladesh as a precondition for the continuing flow of foreign aid. It is quite reasonable for this Parliament to make a linkage between respect for human rights and the continuing flow of Australian aid and Australia's continuing support for participation by Bangladesh within the international aid community and with international aid agencies.

         We are entitled to expect better behaviour on the part of the Government of Bangladesh and the security forces of Bangladesh in respect of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The security forces ought to be able to guarantee rather than threaten the security of the people of the Tracts. Australia's focus on human rights in our region is both established and enduring. It has been effective as our diplomacy has been effective in recent times in the region, examples including APEC and the Cambodian peace process.

         I conclude by saying that a foreign policy which is devoid of human rights concerns is a foreign policy so sterile as to be devoid of both values and decency. Australian foreign policy is based on principles of both national interest and international obligation incorporating concern for fundamental human rights. In that regard it is worthy of endorsement and support, including the concerns expressed today in the Parliament over the circumstances that apply in Bangladesh.

The recent High Court decision that the ban on political advertising was invalid is a damning indictment not just of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) but of the Executive, the whole Labor Caucus and, with the one exception of Senator Sowada, the Australian Democrats themselves. This whole exercise was best described in the

         It is worth recalling the origins of this infamous piece of paper. The original legislation set out to ban at all times political advertisements on radio and television for all levels of government. In other words, for 365 days a year no political party, political candidate or any third party or individual would have been allowed to place on radio or television an advertisement which in any way could affect the outcome of a future election. That in itself would have amounted to a total blackout.

         The original Bill had the tacit support of the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats—the left wing socialists who go around beating their breasts about the freedom and rights of individuals—were about to agree to support a Bill to ban political advertising in this country. If it had not been for the campaign waged by the Liberal and National parties, by radio stations and, I might say, by the print media, which had nothing to gain, that is what would have happened. At that time the television stations were not as outgoing, presumably because of rumours that were floating around all over the place that there would be retribution by this Government if they did so. That is the sort of caper, these are the sorts of standover tactics, that this Government is on about.

         The Liberal and National parties made it abundantly clear that we would never ever accept this outrageous attack on freedom of speech or political expression but that we would accept disclosure provided that all parties were treated equitably. There were two aspects to the Bill. The Minister thought he was being pretty clever. He put those two aspects together and said, `What we are really trying to do is ban advertising; but what we are really after is disclosure. We will embarrass the Opposition because the Opposition will not support the disclosure requirements'. The rug was pulled right from under them. No matter what the bleatings of Senator Bolkus and the Government were, the Opposition stated categorically that we would support disclosure provided it was fair and equitable.

         The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, wrote to the then Prime Minister and requested that the Bill be split. In other words, he was saying, `Look, we will support disclosure provided it is fair and equitable but never will we support this ban, this attack, on freedom of speech'. This request by Dr Hewson was rejected by the Labor Government. The then Prime Minister was quoted as saying—honourable senators opposite ought to remember these words because the High Court has taken a different view—`Let's teach the kid a lesson'. That is what the then Prime Minister said at the time.

         The Minister, quite improperly in my view, hired outside consultancies to keep track of any immediate comments by me and my colleagues such as Senator Kemp and Senator Olsen when he was here. He actually used taxpayers' money—not a few thousand dollars but some hundreds of thousands of dollars—for his own political purposes in order to muzzle the Australian public. As I have said, this was quite an improper use of taxpayers' money.

         The aim of the legislation was twofold and blatantly transparent. The Federal Labor Party was broke and the Labor Government, like its collapsed counterparts—let us never forget this—in Russia and Eastern Europe, was prepared to do anything it could to limit criticism of its own past performances: a key reason why it imposed this outrageous legislation.

         Of course, the Labor Party was concerned that its past performance would be brought to light either during or before an election campaign by the Liberal Party, the National Party or any other third party. What was and is that performance even today? Because there are numerous examples of that performance, it is impossible to go through the lot. One of the major performances about which the Labor Party can hang its head is the fact that it has consigned over one million Australians to the unemployment scrap heap with no light at the end of the tunnel. What a way for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to `teach the kid a lesson'! That is all he could say: `Let us teach the kid a lesson'.

         It has been claimed that the view of the general public was somewhat apathetic. There is a degree of truth in that, but it has always been my belief that the major reason for this apathy was that no Australian citizen could believe that any government would even contemplate bringing in legislation that would remove or limit his or her freedom the way this legislation did. When Senator Olsen, Senator Kemp and myself were going around Australia talking to people, we found them incredulous. The opinion that was coming through was, `We don't believe they will do that'; yet there it was within the legislation.

         At no time during this debate was any mention made by Senator Bolkus or the Labor Party that the real corruption that exists as far as the Labor Party is concerned is the stranglehold exercised upon it by that unelected group, the leaders of the trade union movement. These are the real people who determine who gets preselected by the Labor Party and who stays preselected. If no-one believes me they should ask ex-Senator John Black who I saw in this building just a few days ago. He was waffled out of this place by the AWU and the left wing of the Labor Party.

         The Liberal and National parties called for a Senate select committee inquiry during the 1991 winter recess because we were so concerned about the effect the Bill would have on freedom of speech. This attempt was rejected. In fact, I moved a notice of motion in this place before the winter recess to refer this Bill to a committee. It was rejected by the Labor Party and, I might say, the Democrats, who should hang their heads in shame over this whole sorry episode.

         The confident attitude of the Minister and the reaction we had from discussions with the Democrats were such that it was plainly obvious that a deal, a compromise, call it whatever one likes, had been made. Because we expressed that concern, people in society who until that stage had supported the Democrats also expressed concern. That was one of the reasons why Senator Powell found herself `a talking head', if I might use that expression which came out of the legislation, and lost her political head to Senator Coulter. The expectation then was that that having occurred maybe, just maybe, the Democrats would go back to accepting their responsibilities and acting on behalf of those people in Australia who treasure their freedom and democracy.

All those who gave evidence and those who contributed—from the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, Professor Flint of the Press Council, Professors Alston, Zines, Walker, Gilbert, Henningham and a host of others—were implacably opposed in their evidence to the attack on free speech in this particular legislation.

He also went on to say that nowhere in debate was constitutional validity raised. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was out of that committee and at a public hearing in this very place that Professor Alston said he thought there were constitutional problems. Subsequently, Professor Zines also came out and said there were constitutional problems. This was ignored by the Government.

         The Bill, when debated, resulted in the longest continuous sitting of the Senate since 1964. It was not an engineered filibuster. Those who spoke on the coalition side were genuinely concerned about this atrocious legislation. It was then up to the New South Wales Government and the television stations to take the matter to the High Court. Its decision is a landmark decision as it held that the broadcast ban was invalid because it attacked the doctrine of representative government. That is the reason.

Here was a Minister who with the support of his Executive, the Labor Caucus and the Democrats, had connived to limit the freedom of political expression in Australia. He failed because of the High Court decision. He then had the temerity and audacity to claim it as a victory for freedom of speech in Australia. What an extraordinary statement!

        There is a touch of irony here. Some six years and a few months ago I spent some time with Lionel Murphy. One of the issues that we discussed, as he was being chased off the High Court, was this very issue. We shared a frustration that the concept that he was pursuing at the time was not getting support, was not being accepted. So there is irony in the fact that, some six years later, the High Court has now chosen to basically embrace the philosophy of Justice Murphy in this area.

         There are some basic propositions in this debate—as I say, the sands have changed—that need to be placed on the record at the start. Firstly, there is one party in this Parliament that has been concerned with human rights. Secondly, there is one party in this Parliament that has been consistently opposed to human rights. Thirdly, this Government acted in accordance with international responses to this problem. Fourthly, the High Court surprised everybody. Senator Parer may drag out bits and pieces now, but former Premier Greiner, when launching the challenge and when asked about its chances, said in pretty straight terms, `It's a punter's chance—probably odds against'.

         The concept of freedom of political communication which has been embraced by the High Court was nowhere near the lips of anyone in the debate at that time or previous to it.

         Peter Costello, the shadow Attorney-General, has made comments in recent days which indicate that he, at least, understands the dimension of the High Court decision. Although I do not agree with those comments—I will go to them later—I think it is fairly well balanced to say that a High Court acting in this way offers major challenges to the sort of legislation that Hewson and Howard, for instance, would want to implement in the industrial relations area. It offers huge problems in terms of any agenda that the Opposition may want to put in place. In essence, the Opposition may have won a particular battle but a long fought out war about a Bill of Rights is something that it has not won.

         It is a surprising decision. The result surprised a number of people.

          As I said, Nick Greiner at the time said it was a punter's chance—odds against.

So it was surprising in that sense as well.

         It is also surprising in terms of international comparisons. Justice Brennan, on pages 35 and 36 of his judgment, goes through some of those international comparisons. He says on page 35:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many of the countries which ban paid political advertising during election times have constitutions guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then goes on to quite accurately document the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. He refers to the European Commission of Human Rights on page 35 in his judgment where it held:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the freedom guaranteed by Art. 10—
       </para>
       <para>
        which is freedom of expression—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        "cannot be taken to include a general and unfettered right for any private citizen or organisation to have access to broadcasting time on radio and television in order to forward its opinion". It held that the recognition of a State's power to license broadcasting and television permitted the granting of licences which excluded political advertising.
       </para>
       <para>
        So as well as all those points I have made about there having been a surprise to us in this process, there have been international definitions of freedom of expression which have allowed for interventions and intrusions into the general concept of freedom of expression. Justice Brennan goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It can hardly be doubted that reduction in the cost of effective participation in an election campaign reduces one of the chief impediments to political democracy.

       </para>
       <para>
        If one needed more information in terms of international comparisons, he cites the United Kingdom, where there is a ban on buying advertising time on radio and TV. In defending that ban, in about 1971 the UK Government advised the European Commission of Human Rights that the ban:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . served `to prevent the exponents of political views with the longest purse—whoever these may be—from having an advantage in terms of buying time on television to promote their cause'. If the clause did not exist, less well endowed parties or movements would have great difficulty in maintaining their point of view in the fact of massive purchase of advertising time by their opponents.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is a surprising new concept, one not anticipated even by the then Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, at the time. If you look at the international comparisons, you find that there was enough sustenance for this Government's position.

         The judgment of the High Court is not without some degree of irony because those on the other side have opposed entrenching in our Constitution a Bill of Rights or the concepts of freedom. But in this decision the High Court has entrenched the freedom of political communication in our law. But not only does it do that; Justice Gaudron and, later, Justice Toohey have given signals that the High Court would contemplate going even further. The sorts of rights that they might be entertaining are those that have been marked out very definitely by Justice John Toohey in a speech he gave in Darwin to a constitutional convention last weekend. One particular paragraph is worth repeating. He said in his speech:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In that sense, an implied `Bill of Rights' might be constructed. (The common-law rights that might be expected in an implied Bill of Rights would be such things as freedom of speech, assembly and religion; freedom from search and seizure without a warrant based on sworn evidence and stating what can be searched and seized; freedom from arbitrary arrest; freedom from confiscation of property without compensation; no torture or other cruel or unusual punishment; and a right to trial by jury for serious crimes.)
       </para>
       <para>
        So we have a signal from the High Court judges that they probably expect that they will be asked to address other rights in terms of their role not only in regard to the Constitution but in regard to the general body of law that underpins the constitutional system in this country. The major irony for me is that a concept tossed in by Justice Lionel Murphy was tossed out some six years ago.

         But it does not end there in terms of ironies. Last week, Peter Costello, fearing that this decision opens the door to an activist role for the High Court, responded by saying that in the future we might have to give more parliamentary scrutiny to the appointment of High Court judges. As the office of my colleague Mr Duffy was quoted as saying last week, Costello's comments were a potential threat to the independence of the judiciary. The fact that he responds to a decision such as this by saying that we may have to pay more attention and give more parliamentary scrutiny to whom we appoint to the High Court is expressing a fear on his part that the High Court will and could work in a way that his side of politics would find unacceptable. We on our side would not attempt to politicise the Bench or muzzle the judges. As I indicated last week, the High Court made a decision; we had to cop it, and we do cop it.

A few years later we came back with constitutional amendments to embody in our Constitution a series of rights—the sorts of rights that Justice Gaudron and Justice Toohey talk about in their judgments: the right of one vote one value, the right to vote, freedom of religion, trial by jury and fair compensation for acquisition of property. Those rights were proposed by a bipartisan committee which included Sir Rupert Hamer, a former Premier of Victoria, on the other side of politics. But the Opposition stridently fought against enshrining those rights in our Constitution.

Now Opposition senators will not abolish it; they will maintain it, but they will cut back $4m of its funding. The Commission used to be allocated $6m a year. Quite recently it was given the function of overseeing privacy legislation and was granted an extra $3m to do that. So it has a budget of $9m.

         —Senator Macdonald says that it is only money. If those opposite were running an organisation with a $6m budget and someone took $4m out of its back pocket, there is not much they could do. The Opposition is gutting that organisation. That is the Opposition's promise to this country in the area of civil liberties. The Government's initiatives in this area were guided by a number of factors—to clean up the political environment and to level the playing field. I do not have to go into those areas in great depth.

         As to allegations that the Government is taking this action basically to ensure the survival of the Labor Party, I say that it was Porky Everingham on 9 July who wrote an article headed, `Broke Libs go Begging for Money'. If the Liberal Party and the Labor Party are stretched for funds to stay in the political process—and we all are, that is undisputed now; it is not just one side of politics—what chance do the minor parties have? What chance do the voices outside have? What chance do the Independents have?

         The weekend press is littered with comments from Independents saying they just could not afford to keep up with the major parties in the Victorian election. If we are talking about access to the process, we really have to look at the inequity that is put in place—the latter twentieth century property franchise that is put in place—by the need to have funds to keep one's voice heard. We do not want a Ross Perot manipulating the process in Australia; that is why we took a measure such as this.

        That is precisely what the Government said when it introduced this legislation and they are precisely the sentiments that have been reflected in some of Justice Brennan's thoughts in his judgment in the High Court.

         —Senator Macdonald, with a latter day knowledge, claims it was a stuff-up. During the whole five years of this debate, this Government has been motivated by an intention to clean up this process, and we acted in that way. For five years, nowhere in the debate was the concept of freedom of political expression ever envisaged by anybody. For five years, the constitutional question that has been raised in latter days was not raised until the final days of the debate. It was raised by Premier Greiner who said it was an outside punter's chance, odds against, that they would get up.

         But in the end, this is a counsel of despair. Some time soon, governments must do something about an electoral system in which, increasingly, money decides who is and who is not heard. Ultimately this renders meaningless the right of free speech, which is one of liberal democracy's central features.

         —Yes. I would like to start by reflecting on the role of the High Court. The High Court is the umpire, the sole arbiter of Commonwealth constitutional matters—and we accept that. One alternative would be to have one of the great ideas of the Young Liberals—a privatised judiciary. Another alternative would be to have the American system of an elected judiciary. I think our system is preferable to those, but that does not mean to say that the High Court is above criticism.

         I found the logic of parts of the High Court decision quite inconsistent. The High Court said, `Yes, it's okay, the Commonwealth has power to make laws on elections; yes, the Commonwealth has the power to make laws over broadcasting; but it does not have the power to make laws over the broadcasting of electoral advertising material'. Four of the seven High Court judges ruled that the advertising ban should be totally struck out while two others rejected just part of the legislation. Six of the judges acknowledged that there was an implied right of free speech—not just any absolute free speech but the `freedom to discuss and debate political and public affairs'.

         I welcome confirmation that there are implied human rights in our Constitution. It is not a cause that the Opposition has championed in the past. I recall that it was extremely critical of Justice Murphy over the many years that he championed this cause. But it does seem to be rather selective to say that the right to discuss and debate political and public affairs is more important than perhaps freedom of assembly and association, freedom of movement, the rights of a person charged with a criminal offence, the protection of individual privacy—in other words, what one might expect to find in a Bill of Rights.

         Can we expect the new champions of human rights in Australia—the Party that was going to abolish the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission—to extend their passion for one implied freedom to other equally important freedoms? What did the Liberals say about a Bill of Rights? They opposed it. In opposing the Bill of Rights, in not seeking to improve it by amending it, they opposed many specific rights of Australians. They opposed the right to privacy and the rights of children for which the Bill provided. In voting against a Bill of Rights, in choosing not to improve it by amending it, they opposed the right to trial by jury, to due process and the legislated right to freedom of religion.

         As I have said, a nasty authoritarian streak is appearing in the political process in this country. We have seen it particularly manifesting itself in this Bill to ban political advertising. If Senator Schacht, Senator Bolkus and Senator Kernot were fair dinkum and worried about the costs of elections and the rights of independents to put their views, they would not be banning political advertising; they would be banning direct mail. Direct mail is the most effective but costly form of political campaigning at the present time. It is only accessible to the major parties who have the resources to conduct this comparatively new form of campaigning.

I am one who thinks there are elements in political advertising which can cause problems, but at least we have the right to respond publicly and quickly. Whatever the faults of political advertising, they are writ large in the process of direct mail. Of course, Senator Kernot was caught out very recently with her direct mail to the farm machinery producers. She conveyed to them what we believe to be grossly misleading information and she came into this chamber and attempted to justify it. Of course, Senator Kernot was once again found out.

But Senator Bolkus ignored the advice of the Human Rights Commissioner. One really wonders how committed Senator Bolkus is to the Human Rights Commission when in probably the most controversial action the Human Rights Commission has been involved in, in relation to political advertising, the Government assiduously ignored its advice.

As I said, he pointed to countries that have a bill of rights and where the freedom of speech in relation to political advertising is banned.

         Senator Schacht regularly comes into this chamber and talks about human rights. I do not entirely doubt the sincerity of Senator Schacht on human rights; he has made the subject a special interest of his. But in the end I guess real commitment to human rights is shown by how committed one is when the views actually conflict with the policy of one's party. That is when one is really tested. One can go overseas and lecture to the South Africans, lecture to the Chinese, go around the world and tell them what you think they should be doing. But the question is: how does one act when human rights issues conflict with the narrow interests of one's own political party?

         I have to say that Senator Schacht has been tested in relation to political advertising. It is not that he expressed concern in the party room and then generally removed himself from this debate, as I guess often happens on both sides when members find themselves in conflict with their parties. Senator Schacht, as Chairman of the Select Committee that examined the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, took the lead role in trying to ram this legislation through. He, along with Senator Bolkus, was one of the driving forces behind the Bill. Indeed, it is a great irony—I do not think it will be forgotten in this chamber—that when Senator Schacht, who has at times spoken some sense on human rights issues, was tested and when his hand was put to the fire, he decided to be one of the Bill's great promoters.

         I think there are some concerns about the behaviour and the judgments in recent years of the High Court. Senator Bolkus raised that point. I happen to think on this particular issue that the court got it right, but I would not want it to be thought that a lot of people are not looking closely at the activities and judgments of the High Court. Time, as Senator Bolkus said, will show just how this new decision works through. Maybe it will work in surprising ways. Maybe it will end the rights of the closed shop. Maybe it will enable workers to exercise true freedom of choice in deciding whether to join a trade union or not. So I think quite a few freedoms will be tested, and undoubtedly we will be watching the High Court closely to see how it works itself through these judgments.

In this chamber on Tuesday 3 December, Senator Macdonald on a number of occasions alerted us to the fact that the legislation was liable to be found to be unconstitutional.

         Senator Bolkus in his speech said that there are four things we should know. He said we should know that there is one party that supports human rights—I suppose he thinks that is his Party—and one party that is against them. I suppose he would like to paint that as being the Liberal and National parties. Then he says that everything the Government has done is in accord with international responses. In other words, the Government has done only what everyone else does. The fourth thing the Minister said in his speech was that this move by the High Court was a surprise.

         The Minister is wrong on all four counts. The Labor Party does have a proud record in relation to human rights issues. I do not deny that and I do not know that anyone else does. It is a proud record marred only, I might say, by a very black spot put on it by Senator Bolkus in seeking to limit freedom of speech in this country. Nonetheless, I do not deny that, other than for that black spot, the Government has a very proud record. I think it is uncharitable of the Minister to suggest that my Party does not have a similar record. We might say that these rights should be protected in different ways, but we do not say that they should not exist or be protected in no way at all.

         As to the argument `We have only done what is in accord with international responses', why do we not give away the whole system of responsible government?

It is ludicrous for a Minister of a government to come in here and say, `We have done what everyone else has done'. Why do the people in the galleries pay our salaries if they only want us to do what everyone else does? We could run the country by survey. Would that be a good idea? Of course not. The expectation is that we will look at what other people do, decide for ourselves whether it is a good idea and articulate substantive reasons as to why it is a good idea. That other people are doing it is not a substantive reason. That is the lemmings to the cliff face argument.

         As to the technical legal reasoning of the decision of the High Court, some may think that it is a surprise, but I draw the Minister's attention to a speech I made in August of last year which drew his attention to the Murphy judgment on the Ansett Transport Industries case. Murphy said that there needed to be freedom in relation to speech and other communication, `not only between the States, but in and between every part of the Commonwealth'. He went on to say:

        Senator Bolkus thinks that in some ironical way, the High Court has now returned to a position more closely aligned with former Senator Murphy than it was at the time. I do not think that is ironical at all. That is what the legal system and the High Court is all about. Law is always developing with people changing their minds, moving on, et cetera.

         The Minister says, `Watch out with your industrial relations reforms or you'll be in trouble'. I look forward to a greater elucidation from the court as to what it thinks these powers or implied or assumed rights are. Nothing pleases me more than a greater test of the constitutional limitations that we live under. That is what the High Court is there for, and I do not walk away from that. If the Minister thinks that that is a problem, he has a different view from mine.

         Basically, the Minister said that the concept of a right to freedom of speech in relation to political ideas is new and that nobody has mentioned it. We already know that Murphy had. I also draw his attention to some comments I made on 17 April, particularly to elucidate an argument that might well have informed his mind. In that speech I drew his attention to a number of United States cases, which basically put a simple proposition. You do not need to go to the Human Rights Commission to be told this or to study law to understand it; you just need to understand the premises on which this place works.

         How does it work? People get elected to do what other people want. Every now and then we have an election. People like those in the gallery can decide whether they want to re-elect those opposite—I do not think they will re-elect them next time—or whether they would like to elect us. They will also decide how many of these magpies of politics that are under the table, otherwise referred to as the Australian Democrats, or Independents they will elect. How will they do that? They will only do that if they have some idea of what we think and what we and the Government have done. Information in relation to these matters is passed on through advertising.

        Another United States case, Buckley v Valeo, is worth mentioning.

The court went on to point out that it would be disastrous to exclude all citizens and groups, except candidates and political parties and the institutional press, from the use of the most effective modes of communication. Television and radio have become the most indispensable instruments of effective political free speech.

         I turn to the argument of cost that has been raised by both the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party. They want to say that people with money are bad bogymen. I do not attribute bad faith to people with money in the first instance. This point is constantly repeated in a number of United States cases: one cannot make the assumption that just because one person has $2,000 that person ought not be able to put his or her view. One cannot make that assumption, because if 2,000 people want to put a view and they all put in a dollar they will have the $2,000 to put their view.

Senator Kernot raised a problem with limiting freedom of speech in 28 days out of 365 days. The penny should have dropped in Senator Kernot's mind that the community does not really want to hear from us all day every day. But if the day comes around when people take the casting of a vote as a responsibility there will be a greater interest in who is doing what. It is precisely at that time that freedom of speech, especially in relation to political issues, should be protected.

I, like a number of people, have had a chance to read the decision that has been given. All of us will take some time to study in depth the reasons behind the judgment of the High Court.

         I believe that determining the real meaning of this decision will be a feast for the constitutional lawyers, who are trying to get grants for the next 20 years. The basic decision of the High Court is that, in our Constitution, there is an implied right to freedom of communication. Justice Mason uses the term `freedom of communication' on page 18 of the decision—he does not use `freedom of speech'—as though he is more interested in the delivery modes of speech rather than free speech itself. That is a significant difference. I believe that he is trying to get around his very difficult position in this decision of implying that under the Constitution the Government's legislation was not valid. Nowhere in his decision does Justice Mason quote a particular clause of the Constitution to guarantee the implication of freedom of communication.

         The judgment quotes various decisions of similar cases in Canada, the United States and Great Britain. It quotes all the other similar democracies comparable to ours but completely ignores the fact that all those other comparable countries already have limits, or outright bans, on political advertising. Justice Mason blithely ignores that precedent in those countries and talks about freedom of communication. On page 18, he says:

       <para>
        Nowhere does he come to terms with the fact that the ability to exercise political power in our community can be very much influenced by access to financial resources. Justice Mason made a very substantial mistake in not understanding that an equal share means that one does not allow money to determine how much of that equal share one has. Again, it shows a lack of understanding of the political process in a modern society.

         On page 21 of his decision, Justice Mason says that we are not talking about a bill of rights. He does not want to get into an argument that there is a bill of rights which has an expanded view about freedom of speech. He says:

        In that particular section he raises in my mind the spectre that this will override much of the legislation of the governments of Australia—Federal and State—over the last 100 years or more on such things as obscenity and defamation. For example, I do not think it stretches the imagination too much to say that if this position proceeds the X-rated movie industry based here in Canberra could form a political party and then use that as a basis to say that it could distribute its material under the guise of freedom of communication, if not freedom of speech.

         Those are the sorts of implications that come about when we have a High Court ruling that says there is an implied, not a direct, power in the Constitution. I do not believe Australian parliaments and the Australian people ought to automatically accept the High Court's right to imply anything into the Constitution. It is the people themselves, either directly through referendum or in the parliaments of Australia, who should have the final say. On page 24 of the same decision Chief Justice Mason says:

        But, in the ultimate analysis, it is for the Court to determine whether the constitutional guarantee has been infringed in a given case.

        I reject that notion. I think the Australian people should reject the notion that an unelected appointed body, the High Court of Australia, can determine what the laws of Australia are by saying it is implied in the Constitution. My notion of democracy and the notion of democracy of this Australian community is that it elects people to Parliament to make the laws and if it does not like what they make it votes them out at the next election. It is a very simple definition of democracy, but I think it is the best going.

         I note that last week the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Peter Costello, noted the significance of the High Court's decision and raised the issue that judges of the High Court will have to come under review and discussion about their political role. He accepts the fact that the judges will be making political decisions which are open to wide interpretation. That is a road that the High Court of Australia has previously not gone down, although I believe sometimes in the past, even interpreting particular sections of the Constitution, High Court judges have not been able to divorce their political preferences or prejudices from the decisions they make.

         I believe that in this issue we will have to have a wide community debate to work out what are the responsibilities of the legislature and what are the responsibilities of the High Court. Chief Justice Mason believes that the High Court has the power to overturn legislation. Apparently only yesterday Justice Toohey argued in a speech in Darwin—I am quoting from the press so I do not know whether this is a direct quote—that the High Court had the power and the right to frustrate the will of Parliament by striking down legislation in order to protect and promote individual liberty. That is a statement by one of the justices of the High Court which indicates that as far as he is concerned they have a much wider role than they have had in the past.

         If justices of the High Court—whether it is Justice Toohey or Chief Justice Mason—believe that there is an implied right to guarantee the freedom of communication and overturn legislation, it is no longer a legal view, it is a political view.

They should not use the High Court bench to make political statements.

         In the early 1940s Justice Evatt stepped down from the High Court where he had served for at least 10 years to stand for Parliament. He was elected and then served in the Australian Parliament for nearly 20 years. He understood the difference between a judicial interpretation and political activity. He did the honourable thing of putting himself in front of the people to be elected to this Parliament and to take part in the public debate. We are going to have a position where members of the public and members of the Parliament will criticise judges of the High Court and judges will probably say that this is an attack on the independence of the judiciary. When they start making political decisions, such as they did last week when they overrode the Government's legislation, they are relying on an implied power which is open to the widest interpretation. I do not believe that in any form of sensible democracy we should allow a group of people, unelected, appointed to the age of 70, to have the power to make that decision.

         Finally, if the High Court is only carrying out a judicial role of interpretation of specific sections of the Constitution we can certainly accept that people with eminent legal qualifications should be appointed to the High Court.

If they are going to make political judgments, the High Court ought to reflect the make-up and the mixture of the Australian community. Therefore, the demand will come very quickly that we should appoint people to the High Court who reflect the community and not reflect some high legal qualification alone because they are not reflecting the community at the moment.

On 5 September 1985, we saw the invalidation of provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration (Electricity Industry) Act 1985 that sought to combat Queensland industrial legislation by bringing Queensland power workers under a special Commonwealth arbitration scheme. The law was invalid because it discriminated against a State. That decision was overturned by the High Court. On 12 August 1988, the High Court declared that Government advertisements in support of the referendum campaigns were improper expenditure. The High Court said that this Government was wrong again.

On 1 March 1990, the Executive Government was ruled to have no power to grant additional stamp allowance to members of the House of Representatives in addition to the allowance received under the Remuneration Tribunal.

At Question Time today, Senator Parer, the shadow Minister for Administrative Services, asked Senator Bolkus a range of questions about the costs involved and a whole lot of other questions that relate to this matter and, of course, he was unable to answer one of them.

He said on 1 October that he is glad that the High Court has `signalled entrenchment of freedom of communication and freedom of speech as part of the general legal system'. These are the very rights that he sought to infringe.

         What a sanctimonious lot of garbage we heard this afternoon from Senator Kernot. She tried to quote from the speech that I made in the debate in this chamber on the Bill of Rights, even though she did not participate in that debate. It was a debate that showed how flawed the Government's proposal on the Bill of Rights was. It also quite clearly showed that a lot of the things that they were trying to legislate for were already in place. I find it amazing that Senator Kernot can come into this chamber and say that we should have a bill of rights in order to have freedom of speech. Last week we had a decision by the High Court supporting the fact that the Constitution already has in it an inherent right of freedom of speech. Why do we need a bill of rights to spell it out?

This is another example, added to all the those others that I have given, of where this Government has goofed.

         The Democrats cannot get off scot-free because they were hand in glove with the Government. They were quite happy to accept this legislation because they knew they were going to get more money out of it; they knew they were going to get more ads. When they cannot even rake up 3 per cent in a State election, is it any wonder that they want more? They could only rake up four candidates in Victoria and it is no wonder they want more public funded advertising. It is about time this Government turned around and saw what it was doing.

         We have, therefore, a Labor Minister who is committed to the Orwellian concept of sanitising our democratic procedures to somehow protect us from ourselves. In so doing he was clearly anxious to limit the rights of freedom of speech. Who supported them in doing so? It was the Australian Democrats. It was the same Minister who, in a response to a question on 11 April last year, trotted out the specious argument that political advertising did not represent free speech, but something else that he stigmatised as bought speech. That was another excuse that he used all the way along the line—that if we did not pass the legislation it would be bought speech. We knew better. We know what this Government is like.

         Of course, the Minister went on to quote what was said by that hardly objective and unbiased authority, Phillip Adams, the guru of political correctness—that `we are not jeopardising free speech but defending it'.

         So the arguments used by the Minister and supporters such as the Democrats were illogical and dangerous. If political broadcast media advertising constituted `bought speech', this definition could be extended to all other forms of advertising and, indeed, to all forms of political communication other than the unaided human voice. I think the decision of the High Court last week was correct. Certainly, it is about time that the Government and the Democrats came clean and told us what it cost and who gave them their advice in the first place.

Perhaps the Labor Party has had some luck with chook raffles and lamington drives, and it now has some money to spend. I suppose, Senator Faulkner, that that is the reason for the change of heart.

         Senator Bolkus has always been very adaptable on this issue. In December 1990 he was asked by Senator Parer whether he was preparing legislation to ban election advertisements. He responded that he was not. Three months later—surprise, surprise—the Federal Cabinet was discussing legislation to do just that. The plan was being put to Cabinet by guess who—the bearded man on the other side, Senator Bolkus, to give him his correct title.

         The contortionist tricks of the bearded senator opposite are the most remarkable by any Minister in any Parliament anywhere in the Western world. It has been said that the very concept of representative government and representative democracy signifies government by the people through their representatives. The representatives, of necessity, are accountable to the people. By not allowing people to advertise on the electronic media during election periods, this Government and this Minister, Senator Bolkus, were trying to stifle that concept. Now the contortionist has done his back flip. I would say that the degree of difficulty was about 6.2. He has done a bellyflop in the middle of the pool. I would say that it would have hurt his stomach and it would have hurt the stomach of the Party that he represents. It ensured that he is now a discredited Minister in this chamber.

         There is no doubt that political advertising on the electronic media is very expensive and that it is only available to those people who can afford to use it—the very few large political parties or extremely wealthy candidates who can afford the cost of an electronic advertising campaign. A political party or a political candidate is incapable of expressing complex ideas in electronic media advertising. There is no doubt that this sort of advertising distorts and trivialises the political process. It leads to the sort of situation that exists in the United States—of influence buying and the huge need for money to run any sort of competitive election campaign.

         This Government tried to remove, as far as was possible, the influence of money from election campaigning. That is a worthy aim and objective and it is one that I certainly still support. The proposition that spending money in any way equals free speech is absolute nonsense because there is an unequal and unjust distribution of money in our society. If we look at the nature of Australian election campaigns it becomes obvious that this decision—what has been described as a landmark finding—of the High Court is going to have a huge impact. It has already started. The Liberal Party of Australia has brought two Republicans from the United States of America to Australia as consultants to run its electronic media campaigns, a Mr Larry Cirirgnano and a Mr Bruce Blakeman. Apparently, they were responsible for producing the Liberal pamphlets featuring scared old ladies behind doors because of what the Labor Party had done to make our society unsafe.

His name is on this report. It was when Mr Robb, the genius who is running the Liberal Party campaign for the next Federal election, was national director of the Farmers Federation. It is a very interesting report. It starts off by saying that the activities of the National Farmers Federation in the 1987 Federal election campaign had two focuses. Its second focus was a campaign of opposition to the Government's Industrial Relations Bill. I will not go through all the points because I have not got time, but the fourth point—from Senator Crane and from Mr Robb—was total opposition to a consumption tax and any other increase in indirect taxation.

I have every confidence—even though in principle I do not support the finding of the High Court—that it will turn out to be a great disadvantage to the people who have opposed this legislation that would have been of great benefit to the political process in this country.

As I understand it, the document is a minute of a meeting which I supposedly chaired in I think June 1987. Senator Faulkner made a number of references about me and Mr Andrew Robb, who at that time was the Executive Director of the National Farmers Federation. Senator Faulkner made points particularly relevant to the situation which existed with regard to a consumption tax. He indicated that at that time I opposed the goods and services tax which we in the Opposition have now proposed to the Australian public.

More importantly, whereas that was a single proposal, our proposal today includes the removal of the wholesale sales tax. That was not in Mr Paul Keating's proposal.

He made reference to that particular aspect by elucidating point 2 of this particular document. I and my colleagues' current position on industrial relations and that of the Government were also misrepresented by Senator Faulkner. As the Minister at the table would well remember, the opposition resulted from the proposals at that time by the Government to introduce a labour court. That was the reason for the opposition by the National Farmers Federation at that particular time—and my position on that particular issue was misrepresented also.

        As this annual report of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation clearly shows in the Chairman's opening letter, the year in review has not been one with very many positives for the Australian meat and livestock industry. The Chairman writes in the report that:

        Adverse seasonal and economic conditions had a severe impact on the Australian meat and livestock industry in the year under review.

        Regrettably, this is still the same in much of New South Wales and, indeed, a great deal of Queensland at the present time. The Chairman further writes:

        Consequently, Australian beef cattle to the United States were at high levels.

        The impact of the United States meat import law was felt twice by the industry with control schemes being introduced in September 1991 and in June 1992. These schemes had a dramatic downward effect on cattle prices, especially during 1992.

         On a brighter note, Australia marginally increased its share of the Japanese beef market and exports to Korea grew strongly. These north Asian markets, together with Taiwan, accounted for 41 per cent of Australian beef exports. Lamb exports fell during 1991-92 as a result of lower production levels, and I have no doubt that this was influenced also by the very severe drought that parts of Australia are having. Mutton exports, however, were maintained at the higher levels of the previous year. Mutton prices have improved over the very low levels experienced by producers during 1990-91.

         Just as is the case in most Australian industries during this recession we had to have, the continuing economic downturn has also had an impact on domestic meat consumption. Beef has been the most affected in this area. Consumers, naturally, have turned to cheaper meats or other alternatives as they also fight to beat the problems they face in making the family budget balance.

         While the debate in recent weeks has focused on free and fair trade issues and on the question of protection and tariffs, the horrendous impact of the domestic costs has not received the attention that it warrants. Already some 60 per cent of the cause of reduced incomes to rural industries today relates directly to our internal structures on interest rates, inflation, outdated work practices and the sustained and continuing attack on the productive sector and its assets. It does not matter whether we produce the goods. Factors outside the farm, such as disastrous Government decisions on rural issues in addition to the Government's economic policies, mean that being on the land is just not profitable. I certainly speak as one who has experience, who lives on the land and who regrettably has to pay all the bills that we get there.

         I reiterate: primary industry is not as fully recognised as it should be in this country. It is no use sending a delegation of Ministers or even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the United States or the European Economic Community when these countries have no intention in the long run of reducing support for their producers and consumers. I believe that this is a very important fact to remember. We know that here in Australia we are efficient upon the farm. But if there is a problem, as there is in a number of our primary industries, the Government ought to come to our support.

         Let us look at the other support that government gives to primary industry in this country. We get a rebate on diesel fuel certainly, and there are other little forms of assistance. But we should compare what is given in Australia with what is given in other countries against which our farmers have to compete—and this is the important fact. Our farmer is working his family farm and has his money tied up in the capital of that property in his stock and land. He has to compete with other countries. We ought to be a little more open-minded than we are with regard to the needs of our farmer and the important role he plays so far as our national economy is concerned.

         I know that leading farm organisations within Australia say that farmers want to stand upon their own feet. But can farmers stand on their own feet when we find that other countries are dumping and supporting their farmers so much more financially? The farmer does not want a handout, but he does want to know that he has friends in the Government and the Opposition who are prepared to come to his aid if need be. If we are to compete fairly, assistance has to be there for the farmer.

         The meat industry is an important Australian industry both in the domestic market and the export market, predominantly in beef and sheep, in which the AMLC plays a key role. Its objectives of securing markets for our meat, both domestically and internationally, ensuring that the best possible marketing and transport strategies are utilised and providing appropriate support through market intelligence and other mechanisms, are, in my view, achieved in most cases.

         However, despite all the AMLC's best efforts to encourage Australians to eat more meat, we have a situation at present in Australia where drought and recession have affected our domestic production; slaughterings and consumption and a variety of other factors have impacted on our export levels; and domestically, sadly, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, Australians are eating less meat. Beef, veal and lamb have all lost market share and butchers are buying and selling less meat, which is rather sad. As I said, I have a pecuniary interest in producing good beef for people to eat.

         The domestic trade is worth some $2.6 billion, made up of fresh beef, veal, lamb, pork and poultry. Beef and veal and lamb both lost one per cent in market share to 53 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. The retail price of beef rose only 0.4 per cent and lamb actually fell by 4 per cent. This was despite the fact that Australian meat is among the cheapest and certainly the best quality meat in the world. This is all despite active effective advertising, slick promotion and increased awareness campaigns to encourage the housewife to buy more meat.

         The range of products now available for the health conscious shopper are outstanding. Lean beef and trim lamb are designed to appeal to the diet- and health-conscious family, and I believe butchers have faced the challenge of promoting their product in an admirable manner. Why then are Australians eating less meat? I am sure that I do not know the answer, and I hope the AMLC is working on a solution to that problem. That is very important to me and very important to Australia's meat industry, especially the beef industry.

         What I do know is that, nationally, we are slaughtering at high levels, particularly our females. Some 44 per cent of all slaughterings of our national herd are females.

         As a producer, I am generally pleased with the prices I receive, but only insofar as they are often higher than the average. They are not higher than those I was receiving three or four years ago. In real terms some of my returns are no better than they were three or four years ago. One of the problems is that my returns are all dictated by the cost of slaughtering at the abattoirs and the penalty rates applying there. In addition, there is the cost of transport into the abattoirs and away to the butcher's shop.

         All of those things will be fixed with Fightback. When all that part of the chain is streamlined, transport will become cheaper, abattoirs will be more efficient and the killing costs will be lower. If one looks at AQIS and the cost of inspection charges in our abattoirs compared with what they are in the rest of the world, one discovers that ours are horrific. I know that the AMLC is just as concerned as I am about these inspection charges and costs. It is something that I hope the Corporation can get to the bottom of, but we will definitely get to the bottom of it when we win the next election, institute Fightback and achieve the efficiencies in the meat chain which are very necessary.

          My National Party colleague Mr Bruce Lloyd raised only a month ago the issue of the excessive bureaucratic red tape which is preventing the development of value added meat exports. Red tape requires that the health certificate cannot be prepared until the intention to export form is signed and the truck of meat sealed by an Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service inspector at the meat plant. It also has resulted in the fact that in cases where a simple typing error has appeared on the health certificate, it is rejected and must be retyped. A simple initialling of the changes on the document is not accepted. These unnecessary bureaucratic procedures must indeed be forcing companies to look at establishing businesses offshore.

          Often I have had the opportunity to speak in the Senate on the many issues relating to the Australian meat and livestock industries. Indeed, last year I congratulated the Corporation on the research work it has done into major areas affecting the industry both in the on-farm and off-farm sectors. I noted that the Corporation commissioned a number of research programs to service urgent industry needs. A number of them were designed to maximise the benefits for Australian producers and processors from the expanding Asian beef markets, to increase the volume of land going into the higher value domestic and export market, to increase the demand and price for Australian sheepskins and to increase the productivity of cattle and sheep by genetic engineering or rumen microbes.

          Evidence of the lack of concern is no better demonstrated than by the Government's failure to provide funding last year to the University of New England to become a centre of cooperative research. That is something which definitely should have happened and something which would have provided world standard research into Australian meat production from the paddock to the plate. It would have helped the feedlot industry, which is expanding very quickly. It would mean that we would have to look at the palate of the people in the countries to which we were selling the meat. We would then come back and tell the producers exactly what was required to meet that market. That is the way we should be going.

        This strategy will help save 3,000 to 4,000 lives and prevent up to 150,000 casualties over the next decade. If it achieves that, it will definitely be achieving something really worthwhile in our community. It is interesting to note that the number of road deaths recorded for the last long weekend in New South Wales, for example, was reduced quite dramatically. But people are still speeding; people are still drinking and driving. It will not really matter what any national road safety strategy does unless we can educate the people to be a little more careful. Whenever one gets into a motor car one is playing with a very lethal instrument. People say that guns and rifles should be locked up. I think sometimes that people who drive cars in an irresponsible manner should be dealt with in the same way. I believe those people are playing with fire on the roads and that something should happen.

         The national road safety strategy is about effective cooperation between each level of government. The direct and indirect costs of road trauma in Australia now amount to more than $6 billion per year. I believe that these costs are significant; they are costs that our community cannot sustain or bear. Every year about 2,500 people are killed and a further 30,000 are admitted to hospital as a result of road trauma. The fact that in the next decade one in 10 Australian families will be directly affected by a road death or serious injury is something that we in this chamber should take particular heed of.

         In the last 20 years, the safety of Australian roads has been improved. One could not say it has been improved absolutely consistently, but it has been improved despite almost a doubling of the amount of travel on the particular roads. The number of deaths has fallen from some 3,800 in 1970 to 2,300 in 1990 and 2,112 in 1991. As I have said, the figures for the most recent long weekend in New South Wales are better, but people are still driving at excessive speeds and people are still driving in an irresponsible manner.

         The key priorities of the national road safety strategy include alcohol and drug abuse, speeding and driver fatigue. Driver fatigue is something that has been taken up particularly in my home State and I think the education campaign has been quite successful in that people are beginning to recognise that when they are getting a bit tired it is better to pull to the side of the road and take a breather rather than to drive on, go to sleep and more than likely run into somebody else and cause one of the traumas I talk about. The other priorities are road hazards—a lot more effort has to be put into the roads—and heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicle drivers are now being much more responsible in their driving and are not driving when they are excessively tired.

         Under the coalition's Fightback proposals, the road industry will be the big winner.

I think that will be a great step forward in terms of making a national road safety strategy work properly.

        The purpose of this report is to provide the details for the start of the process of rolling capital funds into university operating grants from 1994. Generally, this is to be welcomed as this new method of funding will increase institutional autonomy and place responsibility for resource management more fully into the hands of higher education institutions. However, the problem remains that the Government still does not go far enough in deregulating the higher education system. The plan outlined by the Government in this report means that the universities will still be hindered by the development of profiles and management reports which are an unnecessary drain on the resources of our universities. The Federal Government needs to accept the fact that higher education will meet the demands placed upon it only it if it is given the freedom and the autonomy to act so that it does not have to worry about government criteria.

         The policy outlined in this report also fails to address the problem of universities that are trying to catch up on inadequate capital funding over the past 10 years. The main concern relating to the catch-up and development is outlined in the summary of responses to the discussion paper sent out to the higher education institutions by the Minister. This also reveals concerns by the universities that the options outlined in the discussion paper do not allow for increased capital costs of emerging institutions such as the central coast campus of the University of Newcastle in my region. Concerns are also expressed about the timing of the roll-in, arguing that some institutions still have to catch up the phase of development that has occurred over the last 10 years.

         A case in point is the University of Southern Queensland. This institution is an excellent example of the way in which higher education is heading in this country with its focus on open learning. It is apparent that it has received a raw deal in capital funding recently. It has been described as outrageous that USQ has not received its capital funding grant to enable it to build a technologies building despite previous assurances to the contrary by the Minister.

         The university missed out on capital funding in the 1980s through no fault of its own and, because of the incompetence of the Minister, it is about to miss out again. The people of southern Queensland should be outraged. This university is the only one in Australia to offer a degree in agricultural engineering and rural industry. It has already committed $1.1m to the end of 1993 for research. With sufficient capital funding, this research could be five times as much as that stated by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the USQ. The approach to capital funding is inconsistent with the value added industry and with allowing the young people of southern Queensland to reach their potential.

         Despite this glaring gap in the report, the broad thrust towards greater autonomy for universities is to be welcomed. It is not really surprising to find that all institutions supported the capital role in concept and principle. Our higher education institutions have been demanding more autonomy and freedom when trying to raise revenue to finance these activities, so they can welcome this small but significant improvement. It is disappointing, however, that the Government has failed to see what nearly everyone else does—that is, that with financial freedom, the higher institutions in Australia would be flexible enough to meet the demands placed upon them.

         I thank the Minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) for his cooperation in this matter. However, I reiterate that the proper course of action would have been for the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to put down a statement on this matter in both houses of this Parliament with the directions that he has issued to the senior bureaucrats in order that they might properly be debated rather than simply treated as papers.

          I do not know why the Government decided to add these very serious matters to the bottom of the list of documents in the unusual way in which it has. However, we are certainly not going to allow that fact to remove from us our responsibility of dealing with these matters thoroughly. We are talking about an unprecedented event in the administration of justice in this country, which is the breakdown of communications between the chairman of the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions to the extent that the administration of justice is not being properly carried out in relation to corporate crime.

          I remember when this Government came into power that it accused us of being soft on corporate crime. It promised the Australian people that it would set up machinery to ensure that corporate crooks were properly brought to justice. What has happened is that the machinery the Government set up has totally broken down. There seems to have been a total absence of direction by the Attorney-General, the Minister responsible in this area, to ensure that the criminal law is properly applied in these instances of major corporate crime.

          It seems that Mr Hartnell, the chairman of the ASC, took it upon himself to allocate the resources basically towards regulatory functions of the ASC rather than criminal prosecutions. This came after we had been told that the 16 major corporate breaches or alleged breaches in particular, which were referred to as the big 16 cases, would be thoroughly investigated and that those who breached the law would be brought to justice.

          But from what we were told by the Director of Public Prosecutions, we have learnt that Mr Hartnell orientated himself in a different direction, as a result of which the cases are not adequately being brought to the DPP's attention. According to the DPP, when cases are brought to his attention, there is insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution. Certainly a philosophical difference has become apparent between the DPP, who, not surprisingly, sees his responsibility as being to prosecute the cases that are brought to his attention, and the body that has the administrative responsibility for getting up cases, for accumulating the evidence and putting the brief to the DPP.

          What was the Minister doing whilst this philosophical breach was taking place between these two senior heads of these departments that could result in this breakdown? It seems that the Attorney-General was sitting on his hands. Basically, he did nothing until this matter came into the public forum. Sadly, it came into the public forum through leaks to newspapers and when these senior bureaucrats had laid their complaints before a parliamentary committee. That is not good enough.

          The Minister should have been taking action, not only to solve the philosophical difference between these senior bureaucrats but also to ensure that this conflict of view as to how these matters should be progressed should not be allowed to defeat the administration of justice in the way that it was. So the Minister not only did not get in and sort out the philosophical difference but he also did not take action to ensure that the administration of justice did not suffer as a result of this breach. It seems that this trouble has been brewing for some 12 months or so. It is simply not good enough.

          What are the consequences of this breach? As I said a moment ago, we have been given these undertakings that, in relation to the big 16, adequate work was being done. But Mr Rozenes, the DPP, alleges that only one or two investigators are working on some of the big 16 cases. That will be ineffective, given the complexity of the matters. Mr Robinson, of the ASC, told Senate Estimates Committee E that in a significant number of these big 16 cases there had been referrals of breach to the DPP.

          Who is telling the truth? Why is not the Minister getting to the bottom of this? Estimates Committee E was told that there had not yet been any convictions in any of the big 16 matters except in relation to the Bond matter. That is totally unsatisfactory and it is too late for the Minister to come before the Parliament and complain about it. I believe that a Senate committee ought to look at this total breakdown of the administration of justice, find exactly where the fault lies and do something positive about it.

          One can only say that one wished either these directions were not necessary or that they were issued much sooner. Very clearly, there was a conflict between those two law enforcement agencies which, I suspect, led to some of our corporate cowboys getting off scot-free and others perhaps being given a chance to get away with civil proceedings whereas they should have been criminally prosecuted. As one of the witnesses who gave evidence before the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities, which held a hearing on these matters, said, the only real deterrent for these corporate wrongdoers is not a fine but a stay in gaol.

          We have a situation where there is an internecine conflict going on between the DPP and the ASC. It developed into a subterranean battle and it was only ultimately resolved by a very embarrassed and wrong-footed Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) when it became public. It became public because of the frustration of the two bodies leaking correspondence to the media to try to win a political point. It is absolutely appalling when law enforcement agencies of this nature and with these grave responsibilities fight their battles for supremacy, control and direction through the media.

Of course, the war simply went on and the temperature went up. As I say, ultimately, out of embarrassment and discomfort, the Attorney-General brought them together and the battle continued in his office. He sent them away and put together some fairly elementary directions that they ought to take in the future.

I think it is important to read some of the text of the letter in order to put it into context. The letter was written in response to a motion passed by the Senate regarding agricultural subsidies.

          The problem with the way this program is operating is that the subsidy is being paid, but we in Australia are being asked to bear part of the burden of that subsidy. The reason I say that is that because of the subsidy that the United States makes available, the price of wheat worldwide is lowered. There is no doubt that we will sell our wheat, but the price at which it will be sold will be lower than it would have been had there been no subsidy from the United States. Later in this debate colleagues of mine will deal very specifically with that question of price.

          Recently I read an article in the press carrying comments by Mr Baker, who is now running President Bush's campaign, saying that Australians should stop whingeing about the export enhancement program and that it will do us no good if we just keep whingeing. The points that we make are based on more than just a simple whinge.

          The basis of the criticisms that we made at that meeting on 16 September, and continue to make, is that we do not accept that the EEP program is somehow designed wholly and solely to make the European Community come to the table to have a satisfactory round of the GATT. As these subsidies are paid, more and more American farmers become dependent upon them. That in turn affects the price of land, which in turn affects the size of mortgages, which in turn affects the banks which hold those mortgages. Every time an additional subsidy is paid the merry-go-round goes on and it becomes ever more difficult to wean those farmers off that scheme.

          The very simple lesson is that if that subsidy were pulled away, there would be a detrimental effect on the price of land, on the servicing of those mortgages and on the viability of those banks. That is a real problem which has existed in the United States ever since the EEP program has been introduced or prior to that when people were being paid not to grow. The problem for us is that it affects the price we receive for our wheat. There can be all sorts of discussions about the fact that we produce better wheat than the Americans, and that they produce more wheat than we produce. The Americans say that they will take every opportunity to protect the interests of non-subsidising exporters such as Australia. I am again quoting the letter.

          Clearly, unless we have applying to our wheat a document equivalent to the Andriessen letter—a letter which applies with regard to the European Community and our beef—we could perhaps understand that there was some meaning in the undertaking given by President Bush to the farmers who demonstrated outside Parliament House when he was here last year and in subsequent statements. But in the meantime, if I can take up the point that Mr Baker made, it is not simply a matter of Australia whingeing. What the United States is doing with that program is making the subsidy an inbuilt part of the economy. The political will becomes harder each time that subsidy is made greater.

          So far as forcing the European Community to the table to find some satisfactory solution to the Uruguay Round of the GATT is concerned, it would be a fallacy if the United States convinced itself that somehow its action with subsidies had caused that to happen. One of the things that will force the European Community to come to any sort of accommodation with regard to the common agricultural policy is simply the financial difficulty that its member nations will get into with regard to the cost of expanding the CAP to cover lands within eastern Germany or other fallow lands which are presently not cultivated.

          —The Senate is debating the letter that the President of the Senate received from Mr Mel Sembler, the Ambassador for the United States. I regret to say that I find the letter quite contemptuous in its offhanded brevity. It does not really address the issue of what damage is being done to Australian wheat farmers; nor does it hold out any hope at all that the United States is prepared to consider what it is doing and to change its ways. As has been previously stated by Senator Bishop, in a very lengthy and erudite exposition, it is quite clear that our farmers are going to suffer. And we can put it quite bluntly: they are being bankrupted. They are not being bankrupted because the United States has any hope of forcing the European Community to the negotiating table in the Uruguay Round but rather because President Bush is concerned about his re-election prospects in the United States. Anyone reading the newspapers in Australia or overseas would have to come to the same conclusion.

In strategic terms they are of no use to Australia's security anyway. So why not make a statement to the United States that has some chance of real effect? I was delighted to see that Mr Malcolm Fraser, a former Liberal Prime Minister, had more courage than members of the Opposition in today's Parliament. He wrote in the

          This behaviour will continue unless the Australian Government is prepared to tell the United States that we are not going to stand for that sort of behaviour. The Australian Government is unlikely to have the courage to do that unless it is supported by the Opposition. So I believe that it is time that we stopped making noises like a doormat, because if we do we will continue to be treated and trodden on like a doormat. We should state quite clearly and categorically that we have an interest in protecting our wheat farmers and that our Government should take action accordingly.

I think it should be put on record here that, whatever our discomfort, concern and disgust at the American export enhancement program to subsidise wheat sales into our traditional markets, one has to concede that the European Community is the No. 1 enemy of free trade that affects our agricultural production in Australia.

          To use the term used by Mr Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, the Americans certainly should not be trade enemy No. 1 but should, I suspect, be trade enemy No. 2 in the list of priorities.

          It has to be accepted that the Americans have responded to the European Community. In no way do I wish to reduce my criticism of the American initiatives in this area. The situation has certainly been brought about this year by the electoral consequences. President Bush can see his chances of re-election slipping away and Mr Clinton can see his chances growing. As the previous speaker said, both candidates are engaged in a Dutch auction. They want to grab some of the last few vital votes in the electoral college from the agricultural states of Mid-West America.

          I want to emphasise that our criticism from this Parliament and our No. 1 target is the European Community, and that our No. 2 target—not by a big margin—is the United States. We do not oppose America or the European Community giving income support to farmers, but we make a real distinction between that and production subsidies. If there are quite legitimate reasons in both countries, for social or economic reasons, to encourage people to stay on their land by giving them income supplements, then that is quite different from encouraging them to over-produce and sell those subsidised goods in our markets and thus affect world agricultural trade.

But we find it absurd that the Americans spend tens of thousands of dollars, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, giving income support to individual farmers. In the case of the European Community, they spend tens of thousands of pounds in a similar way in Great Britain.

Even he thought it was a rort and an extraordinary waste of taxpayers' money. He favoured the free market system. But as Great Britain was part of the European Common Market he was paid to take that land out of production. In the end the taxpayers of the European Community will have to pay that extraordinary cost.

          What has been interesting in Australia in the past month has been the various political responses to what the European Community and the Americans have been announcing. If 10 years ago someone had said that a former conservative Prime Minister of this country would suggest that as a penalty for the American trade decisions the position of the American-Australian joint facilities in Australia should be reviewed, most people would have thought that there was something wrong with the water one had been drinking. I never thought I would see the day when a former conservative Prime Minister would publicly state that, in view of the American position on trade, it is time the question of joint facilities be put on the table.

          It seems that a very odd coalition is emerging in Australia on this issue. On one side we have what one would call the extreme left of the political spectrum—an assortment of former members of the Communist Party, Trotskyites, general anarchists and so on, and people who are indirectly associated through the nuclear disarmament parties. These people, who are demanding the withdrawal of the joint facilities from Australia, are being joined by members of the various farming organisations who are now raising this issue. Members of the National Party are raising it. Of course, a former conservative Prime Minister, who in the 1950s and 1960s was noted for his extreme anti-communist views, his very strong defence of the so-called American alliance, is now openly suggesting that unless America changes its trade policies as they affect Australia, the position of the joint facilities should be reviewed in Australia.

          It is an amazing coalition. The conservative Right and the extreme Left in Australia have a similar view about the action that should be taken against the United States. I do not believe that so far that view is the majority view in the Australian community. However, I recognise that if this debate continues it is inevitable that more and more of the Australian community in the mainstream of the two major political parties—my own Party and the Liberal Party—will also take views similar to what the former conservative Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, said recently.

          Also part of the debate in the post-Cold War period is the role that the joint facilities should fulfil in respect of international affairs and strategic matters. I believe it is inevitable that there will be debate about their future in Australia. There should be a sound debate about their role in the international community of being able to assist in the international verification of weapons treaties and of monitoring developments around the world. For example, we all know that the joint facilities in Australia played a critical role in monitoring Scud missile attacks from Iraq on Israel. I think that is an absolutely defensible role for the joint facilities.

          So I do not think we should automatically jump up and down on the trade issue and say that the joint facilities should go because we are getting hit over the head by the Americans on trade.

I understand that he received more votes in that election than George Bush received in 1988. He is a freely and democratically elected President. So the Cold War which justified the joint facilities no longer exists.

There are no longer three joint facilities. There are now two because North West Cape is an Australian facility. Nurrungar and Pine Gap have a role to play in international strategic matters, in monitoring and securing the so-called new world order international security arrangements.

          Finally, I wish to comment on the Australian Government's response to the trade issue over the last month. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has quite rightly made it very clear that Australia's trade future in the total picture is within our own region of north Asia, east Asia and south-east Asia. Already 60 to 70 per cent—an ever increasing percentage—of our exports go to these regions. That should be the main game in town as far as our total trade picture is concerned. I think the very significant remarks made the week before last in Japan by our Prime Minister are a turning point in the debate in Australia about where our future lies.

          That does not mean to say that we should ignore any opportunity that emerges to improve our trade relations with other countries. It should be noted that we have a $6 billion trade surplus with Japan. I think we have almost a similar trade deficit with the United States of America. So, as far as trade relations with America are concerned, the US is doing very nicely out of us in the general trade picture irrespective of that country dumping wheat into our markets around the world.

This development is of considerable significance to the future trade prospects of this country.

But we should also make sure that we never miss the opportunity to express them even, in many cases, more forcibly to European Community representatives who come to this country. I think the European Community is marginally ahead of the United States in terms of who is doing the most damage to us. I think that should be noted.

          —I, too, would like to refer to the letter from the United States Ambassador to the President following on from a notice of motion I gave some time ago, which motion was carried formally. We had a meeting with Mr Censky and the trade delegation that was out here. We were pretty lucky that we had that meeting; otherwise they would not have filled a quarter of a page, let alone the three-quarters of a page that they filled. All they referred to was that meeting. I attended that friendship meeting and I can tell honourable senators that it was anything but friendship. Mr Censky told us what they were doing: they were not attacking our market share; they were only going in where they thought the EC might have been going in. Even though Mr Censky said that he would leave our market share, he would not agree that what they were doing was depressing our prices.

          Since Mr Bush made that announcement in North Dakota, South Dakota or wherever it was—incidentally, I was there a couple of years ago and took the chance to look at some of the farms, and some of the American wheat farms do not seem to be doing too badly to me, with their advanced equipment—the US started off with a subsidised sale of 220,000 tonnes of wheat to Pakistan, on the basis of a rumour that the EC was about to offer subsidy sales. Since to my knowledge the EC has not been in Pakistan with subsidised sales or any sort of sale, I would like to know where the rumour started. As far as I am concerned, it was probably started by a Pakistani wheat dealer. Pakistan is not a traditional EC market.

          Senator Schacht mentioned in his contribution, in damming the EC—and I agree that the EC is as much to blame as the United States in this matter—that at least with the United States you know when it is going to do a subsidy deal, whereas you do not know with the EC. All I can say about that is: what is the difference? If you get stabbed from the front or the back you are dead, anyway. You will not even live long enough to know whether you were stabbed from the front or the back. So I do not see Senator Schacht's point.

          Now the US has made a deal with India for one million tonnes of red wheat, valued at about $100m. Again, India is not a traditional EC market. The EC has not made a sale to India for five years. So, again, how can the US say that it is doing it because of the fear of subsidisation? They termed it a `pre-emptive strike'. Once again, is it on the basis of a rumour? Or is it just looking for market share? Mr Censky told us when he was here that he was not trying to get our market share; that he was only attacking the EC. But making a sale to India—a subsidised sale at that—has dampened the Australian potential to sell there. The Australian Wheat Board was hoping to make another sale in March. But from the reports I get from the Wheat Board and others at the moment, there is no way this can be done. As I said, earlier this year we made a sale of half a million tonnes of wheat to India. I cannot see how we can get to the next one.

          I turn to the point Senator Evans made today—that the subsidised sale to India was of red wheat. Red wheat is regarded as being of lower quality than the average quality of Australian wheat. Nonetheless, it is still wheat. Senator Evans admitted that the sale had a dampening effect on the price that Australia can get for its better quality wheat. It does not matter how much better quality wheat Australia wants to sell to India or anyone else; if there is someone around offering a subsidised sale, it brings our price down. When you get away from the top quality baking wheat, when you are selling red wheat or ASW—Australian Standard White—you are dealing with protein; that is all you are dealing with. So if you have a downward pressure on any protein product, you have it right across the board. That includes sorghum and corn. The US grows a lot of corn and Australia has an expanding corn industry. A big corn crop or a subsidised corn crop will also affect wheat. It will have a dampening effect because, after all, it is trading in protein. So I cannot see why because the US made that sale in red wheat to India it should be different from if it were white wheat or high protein wheat.

          The cry of the US that it uses the EEP against the EC only is wearing a little thin in Australia now. Internal criticism is mounting in the United States because of the cuts in spending caused by these subsidies being paid out of Treasury to the wheat farmers rather than flowing to programs that badly need it. Hopefully, this matter will be settled when the election has finally come and gone.

          There seems to be a rumour amongst the press this year that subsidised sales as a result of Mr Bush's EEP are not going to affect price. The effects of subsidisation will not be any different to what happened two years ago. Leading up to harvest two years ago, we were looking at an estimated pool return of about $160 per tonne. At about the psychological time when the Australian Wheat Board was setting its estimate of the final pool return on which it does its borrowings, there were massive subsidised sales by the United States—up to $45 a tonne. What happened? That estimated pool return went down to about $115 a tonne, and that is where it remained. The fact is that private contracts were made in New South Wales, and probably southern Queensland and a few other places, on the basis of $160 a tonne, which the estimated pool return was going to be. They are the only ones who did any good out of the wheat crop of that year. The pool went back to $115, and that is where it stayed, and it was a disaster.

          This year we were looking at an estimated pool return on the date that Mr Bush made his announcement—at least a month ago now—at around $160 a tonne, climbing to about $185 a tonne. That is normal. With the flush of the northern wheat harvest, the card price gets depressed. Normally, it gets down to about $150. But as the northern hemisphere places its wheat, the card price gradually rises. We are expected to get $185 by the end of this month. That would have set the pool return for this year.

          The immediate effect of the Wheat Board's next appraisal was a drop of only $5 a tonne—back to about $155. But with the dampening effect of further sales to the likes of India, what is going to happen now? That is where it will stay. It will not have a hope of creeping towards $180 or $185. So much for the journalists who have a rumour around now that it will not affect the price. It is. It will have a total effect of at least $A30-$A35 a tonne, and that is the cream of the Australian wheat crop to the farmer.

I have heard what Mr Kerin, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, has had to say about this matter in the last month. I have not heard from Mr Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy—a Minister from the trade union movement—and I was quite prepared to see what he could do in primary industry development. We have heard very few constructive comments from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the situation. These people have been conspicuous by their silence.

          It is time that the United States treated us as an ally in the same way that we have been an ally to it for the last 50 or 60 years. Senator Schacht offered us a challenge and Senator Spindler said that we should look at the joint defences. I do not believe we have to do that. We have to keep those joint defences. If we throw on the table that the Americans ought to pull out of Australia, they might take the idea up and be happy to go. We can work around this, but I do not want people such as Mr Sembler, Mr Bush or Mr Censky coming to Australia and telling us that they are not affecting our industry. They are affecting it, and they are being hypocritical about it in their statements and platitudes. There are ways to do it; the Australian Government should be more pro-active in getting us to where we ought to go.

          I was at the US-Australian friendship group meeting briefly where this matter was debated and discussed for over an hour and a half. For the short time I was there, the discussions were—to put it fairly mildly—free, full and frank. To say that the Americans came away with an attitude that Australian members of parliament from all sides were anything other than extremely concerned and annoyed that this is happening is a fairly minor understatement. I am not surprised, however, that they stand up and say that EEP does not affect our primary producers.

          When this debate was raging in 1986, I had the opportunity to be part of a young political leaders' exchange program to the US. Part of that trip involved going out to the mid-west, to Kansas and Missouri. In Kansas we met with the Secretary of State for Agriculture in that state. This gentleman had the audacity to say to us that it was our primary producers, our wheat growers, who were being subsidised and not the US growers. No amount of argument or discussion—though it was free, full and frank—with this gentleman could convince him that anything other than that was the case.

          I have recently seen figures which show what the US claims our subsidisation rate for our wheat growers was. It alleges the figure is about 11 per cent. To get to that figure I understand they had to take into consideration the amount that we pay for things like research and development, marketing and things like that—not money that the growers actually receive but money that the growers were contributing so that they could improve their industry. That was in comparison to a 44 per cent subsidy rate to the US wheat producer. Even going on the US figures, they are massively subsidised, well ahead of us. We know that we do not subsidise in those ways.

The reporter concerned rang me seeking my response to comments made by Mr Clough which were highly critical of health insurance generally.

As I said before, I have raised incidents where monks have been imprisoned; I have raised the question of the return of Buddhist property to the Buddhists in Vietnam. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has previously made representations in relation to events which have occurred, and I want to ask him to again make representations to the Government of Vietnam on this matter.

         There are two recent incidents to which I wish briefly to refer. The first is the death of a 25-year-old monk, the Venerable Thich Thien An. He resided at Thien Minh pagoda, Thu Duc, Saigon. He was taken by the Government, imprisoned and tortured. He died in prison in late September of this year, and the Government then spread the word that he had committed suicide. Nobody who knew him believes that. They know that he was taken; they know that he was imprisoned—he was not brought to trial; and they know that he was tortured. He was a young man who was very committed to what he was doing—learning and practising Buddhism. He was very dedicated to the work that he was carrying out in that capacity. From what I know of the incident, there seems to be good reason to believe that he was in fact killed by the authorities in prison, as suggested.

         Just last week two monks were charged on the quite extraordinary pretext of illegal driving and were imprisoned. It happened at 11.30 a.m. on 2 October 1992 at Mac Thi Buoi Street, First District of Saigon. Arrested were two officials of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation, the Very Venerable Thich Khong Tanh and the Venerable Thich Tri Luc. In this there is some significance in that the Venerable Thich Khong Tanh was imprisoned in the year 1976 by the then communist government of Vietnam. He had at that time written to the communist Prime Minister protesting against the order to call up young Buddhist monks for military service. It was seen by the church at that time as one of the steps designed to destroy the Buddhist clergy. For that, he was imprisoned for some considerable time.

         Just last week, as I said, he and his companion were arrested for a driving offence. To be arrested and imprisoned in this fashion for a driving offence seems, at least to me, absolutely extraordinary. But later the same day at about 8 p.m., the police went to the Lien Tri pagoda in the Thu Duc district where the Venerable Khong Tanh resided. They searched and took a number of documents from the place—documents which had been prepared and signed to be sent out to the domestic Vietnamese congregations and to overseas congregations.

         I think we are entitled to ask when there will be freedom to practise Buddhism in Vietnam. It seems a great pity that this sort of persecution is continuing. Religious freedom does not exist in Vietnam; torture and the killing of monks is continuing; and the property of the church has not been restored to its rightful owners. I think there is serious infringement of human rights going on, from what I hear. I hope that the Minister will again make representations, through the Australian Embassy in Vietnam to the authorities there, protesting about this and making it plain that this is behaviour that we do not appreciate or support. The Buddhists in Vietnam have been there for a very long time and are very much a part of the history of that country. It seems to me impossible for Vietnam to again take its place in the world and say that it is a free country while this sort of persecution continues.

        A native forest protection policy which will protect all the diversity, wilderness and aesthetic qualities of Australia's remaining native forests.

        This particular strategy has been recommended by the Resource Assessment Commission and is ignored by the draft national forest policy statement. The second element cited was:

However, I want to make it quite clear that at the time it was a public document which was discussed openly, reported on by the press at the time and, in fact, both myself and the current member for Barker in South Australia, Mr Ian McLachlan, both talked to the press about it.

          The document is quite instructive when one looks at it and notes some of the points that were made at that time. The points in it that I want to comment on are the position that was adopted then by the National Farmers Federation, and in particular myself because I was the chairman of that committee. There was total opposition to a consumption tax and any other increase in indirect taxation. We supported the removal of excises from petroleum products, reintroduction of an effective income equalisation deposit scheme and, finally, a campaign of opposition to the Government's industrial relations Bill, which I will come back to shortly.

          In Senator Faulkner's comments tonight he was casting an aspersion on myself that my position in terms of the Opposition's current policy with regard to taxation is somehow or another at odds with the position that I adopted at that time. I want to make the point very, very clearly that what I was opposing at that time was option 3 of what was then known as the Paul Keating consumption tax presented at the Tax Summit in 1985, if I remember correctly. At that time the National Farmers Federation, including myself, opposed very vigorously, as did most other members of the community, the introduction of that particular consumption tax.

          There are a number of reasons why that was done. The main opposition related to the fact that it was dealing with only one aspect of the taxation system and there were a number of exemptions and a `picking of winners' component in those proposals. Now, when trying to relate that to the current position of the Opposition, one needs to highlight the very significant differences in terms of the position that the coalition now has and which it is presenting to the Australian public. The most notable things in terms of the change—and I will not go into the details of option 3 because it is well and truly on the public record for all to read—is that our position is that we have the total abolition of the wholesale sales tax, the total abolition of payroll tax, the total removal of excises from petroleum products and a number of other initiatives in terms of the taxation system, particularly with regard to the training levy and other points.

          The other point I wanted to raise tonight which is even more significant is the campaign and notice of opposition to the Government's industrial relations Bill. It is appropriate that I remind this chamber and the Australian public of the position of the Government at that time and the position it would love to be in today. That legislation was to introduce a labour court as part of the Hancock committee report and to remove sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. That was the Government's position at that time and if it thought it had half a chance, it would follow that course again.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One must emphasise here the enormous importance of sections 45D and 45E in terms of giving justice in the industrial arena in Australia. They are the provisions which allow people to protect themselves against secondary boycotts wherever those secondary boycotts may come from. They are a very important part of law in this country today. At that time the Bill was also about removing industrial disputation from the law courts of Australia and, as I have already said, putting them under a labour court. This meant that if people were subjected to industrial action they did not have full access to the normal laws of the land. In other words, it was creating selective law separate from the laws of the land for privileged people who thought that, by what is commonly known as the abuse of union power, they could run this country through industrial action. It was going to separate them from the Federal Court, the supreme courts of the various States, the High Court and from the judicial appeals tribunal.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is also worth noting here that both 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act were amendments introduced by the Fraser Government. The judicial appeals tribunal was also established as a result of legislation brought into this place by the Fraser Government, the last Liberal Government of this nation.

          In recent times we have seen, for example in the Contractors Bill, that a commercial contractor who has a legitimate legal contract can be forced to appear before the Industrial Relations Commission to have that commercial contract interfered with. That is just an extension of what the Government was endeavouring to do at that time. For Senator Faulkner today to incorporate these in the ad ban debate defies reason. Nonetheless, he has sought to do so. To try to compare the position of Paul Keating's option three in the May 1985 Tax Summit to the position of the Opposition today, and in particular to my position, is misleading and mischievous.

          —I rise to speak on some issues that I think should be aired in the Parliament relating to some developments with the Australian Democrats and their behaviour towards this Parliament. Today we had two examples of the Australian Democrats voting with the Government to restrict the rights of senators to make Ministers more accountable.

          Not only did the Democrats vote in Question Time substantially to restrict the rights of senators to question Ministers, but they also joined with the Government to effectively limit another very important procedure which has developed in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. I refer to the procedure of taking note of answers after Question Time. This enables this chamber to debate answers given by Ministers during Question Time and in that albeit small but important way help make Ministers more accountable.

          The issues I wish to raise tonight relate first of all to the general voting record of the Australian Democrats. I think it is important to see how the Australian Democrats have been able to succeed or otherwise in their attempt to hold themselves out as honest brokers in this chamber. The other issue I wish to raise relates to the willingness of the Australian Democrats to discourage the abilities of senators to debate Bills which come before this chamber.

          I think it is true that certainly out in the public arena the Australian Democrats like to portray themselves as playing the issues fairly, as trying to encourage both sides of the chamber to debate more effectively the issues which come before this chamber. They would certainly reject the view of Senator Loosley, who put it rather well when he said, `I have always preferred to think of the Democrats as seeking to carve out for themselves a position in Australian politics as being the fourth faction of the Australian Labor Party, some group off to the left in a Labor Government'. I think in some ways that is correct. When I am on platforms debating with the Australian Democrats and when I read the press statements the Australian Democrats put out, I see that that is not the image they try to convey to the public.

          I thought it would be of interest to honourable senators, and I hope the Australian public, to look at the voting record of the Australian Democrats in the Thirty-sixth Parliament, firstly under the leadership of Senator Powell and more recently under the leadership of Senator Coulter. I have had a table prepared which ascertains just how often the Australian Democrats have voted with the Government, how often the Australian Democrats have voted with the Opposition and how often they have split from both the major groupings.

          This table shows that since the last election the Australian Democrats voted with the Government—this excludes of course the number of very important divisions which occurred today; these figures are up to 17 September—on 216 occasions, and voted with the Opposition on 34 occasions. Any attempt by the Australian Democrats to portray themselves as somewhat even-handed, as a party which is playing the issues, is greatly undermined by these figures. In fact, it is very clear from these figures that, on many of the important issues which come before this chamber on which the chamber decides to divide and take a formal vote, the Government has been able to receive the support of the Australian Democrats on 216 occasions, whereas the coalition has received their support on 34 occasions.

          Senator Evans will undoubtedly be interested in the fact that during the three years of the Whitlam Government the total number of Bills which were guillotined through the Parliament was 61. In the seven years of the Fraser Government, a total of 57 Bills were guillotined through the Parliament. Then we come to the Hawke and Keating governments and look at their ability to manage government business. We find that over the period since 1983, some 217 Bills have been guillotined through the Parliament. When we look at the ratio in recent years, particularly since 1990 which is the period of the Thirty-sixth Parliament, we see that well over 100 Bills have been guillotined through the Parliament in the two and a bit years since the last election. These Bills have been able to be guillotined through the Parliament because of the support given by the Australian Democrats to the use of the guillotine.

Senator Evans will know that former Senator Macklin developed the so-called Macklin rule which prevented the other place from dumping legislation into the Senate at the last moment—in other words, trying to force Bills through the Senate without proper consideration.

          —In summary, by guaranteeing the Government the passage of all its legislation through the use of the guillotine, the Australian Democrats are defeating their intention, as expressed in the Macklin rule, to require more adequate consideration of legislation which comes before this chamber. I have pointed out two particular areas this evening. I believe that the behaviour of the Australian Democrats is negating their rule to try to act as honest brokers and certainly negating any principle they hold that it is absolutely vital that honourable senators be given the maximum opportunity to examine legislation which comes before this chamber. It is important that the public realise just what attitudes the Australian Democrats are adopting under their new leader, Senator Coulter.

I have to say to Senator Evans that, amongst the many failures which litter his career, his ability to convince the Australian Democrats to avoid an inquiry by having a discussion on a code of ethics for Ministers must rate as one of his successes.

          indicated that a majority of Democrat senators, some five in all, were in favour of a full inquiry and that three were opposed to it. I do not know who the three were; perhaps that can be revealed at some later stage. Senator Coulter then decided that the vote of three to five meant that the Democrats would not be supporting any proper inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair.

They did this to confirm their view that it was important to restrict the rights of senators to take note of answers after Question Time. In order to fill out the picture of the approach that the Australian Democrats are now taking, it is worth recording the way that they have voted during the Thirty-sixth Parliament and their willingness to negate the Macklin rule and encourage the Government to bring forward as many Bills as possible to be guillotined through the Parliament.

        (4) The Ministerial Committee on Government Information and Advertising (or its appropriate sub-committee) approves a panel of agencies to be invited to submit a proposal for each campaign. The panel is drawn from a register of agencies which have indicated an interest in undertaking government work and which is held by the Office of Government Information and Advertising. Agencies on the register have either responded to public advertisements, made a direct approach or replied to a mailout. In line with general industry practice, the Commonwealth Government does not call tenders for the planning and creation of campaign advertising. It invites competitive submissions from agencies which it is considered may be particularly suited to the subject of the campaign and agencies which have indicated a more general desire to be considered.

        (2) I am aware of the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research (NIEIR) study which included an assessment of the employment benefits of alternative airport developments in the Sydney Region. From the NIEIR study and work associated with the EIS's for Badgerys Creek and the Third Runway it is clear that only a directed development of a major international airport at Badgerys Creek would generate substantial employment growth in that Region. Such a development would not be commercially viable at this time and most of the employment growth at Badgerys Creek would be at the expense of other regions of Sydney.

        (3) The Federal Airports Corporation Regulations establish a licensing regime to ensure that contractors working at the Sydney Airport third runway construction site and dredging sites in Botany Bay comply with environmental standards. These standards are a direct outcome of the environmental assessment process. Because the EIS on the third runway was prepared in accordance with Federal environmental assessment legislation (Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974) and not State legislation, the Regulations are intended to remove any doubt about the extent to which NSW laws apply to the construction of the runway.
