         —Order!  Yesterday, Senator O'Chee addressed a question to me about the televising of Question Time. Senator O'Chee referred specifically to the ending of television broadcasts before Question Time had finished. Orders of the Senate, agreed to on 31 May 1990, authorised the televising of Question Time by the ABC. It should be noted that the ABC is not compelled to televise the proceedings of the Senate. The television broadcasts of Question Time in the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the duration of those broadcasts, are a matter for the ABC. I am advised that the ABC attempts to end the broadcasts of Question Time at the conclusion of the answer which is nearest to 3.00 p.m., in order to comply with network scheduling commitments. I also believe that the ABC will televise Question Time in the House of Representatives for the remainder of the week.

         —The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is conducting an inquiry into Japan's defence, which is due to report by the last day of the first sitting period in February 1993. The Committee has only very recently completed its inquiry into the impact of the United States policies on Australia. I will be tabling that report this week as Chairman of the Committee. The Committee has already embarked on its inquiry into Japan's defence and witnesses from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have given evidence.

         In view of the unexpectedly heavy workload associated with the completion of its United States inquiry and other factors outside its control, the Committee has found it very difficult to schedule a vitally important hearing with the Ambassador of Japan outside the Senate's sitting hours. The Committee attaches great importance to having this evidence before it at an early stage of the inquiry. It is for this reason that the Committee seeks the agreement of the Senate to hold a public hearing for one hour this Thursday, 17 December, to hear the Ambassador of Japan while the Senate is sitting.

         —The Senate is debating two Bills, the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill 1992. The first of those two Bills, the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill, proposes to give legislative effect to the Government's personal income tax cuts announced in the 26 February economic statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the so-called One Nation statement, which in effect has disappeared without trace since that time. There are some relics of that statement still around, and this Bill reflects one of them.

         The second Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill, will increase the taxable value of fringe benefits by the value of tax payable, plus allowing a deduction for any fringe benefits tax payable.

I am sure my colleagues will have more to say, not only on that but also on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill.

         The Tax Legislation Amendment Bill provides new personal income tax scales for 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97 and subsequent years as proposed by the Government in its One Nation statement in February, and subsequently reaffirmed in the Budget and now in this Bill. The one thing to say at the very outset about these proposals of the Government is that in essence they are irrelevant, for two reasons. Firstly, there is no way that the Government will be able to deliver the tax cuts proposed in this Bill in the unlikely event that it is re-elected to govern again. The proposals are arguably the most irresponsible set of proposals for taxation reductions, totally unfunded, that we have seen in the history of this nation. The other reason the Bill is essentially irrelevant is that this Government will not be in power after the next election; therefore, the legislation will not come into effect. The coalition Government, the Hewson Liberal-National Party Government, has a clearly announced agenda for taxation reform and it is that agenda that the incoming Government will implement.

         —As my colleague Senator Knowles said, the Kennett Government in Victoria recently attracted a lot of criticism for rushing through 20 Bills in three weeks. What this Government is doing today is rushing through 30 Bills in one day. In the last two or three weeks of the Senate's sitting, we have had to deal with over 80 Bills. If that is the best that this Government can do with its legislative program, it is just as well that it is on the way out and in its dying days.

         I come back to the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill. The tax cuts that are proposed in the Bill are targeted towards an attempt to buy the votes of swinging voters for the next election. The Senate will recall that these tax cut proposals were rushed through in February. They were contained in the panic statement by the Government, One Nation, in a futile attempt to counter the very exciting proposals for necessary change in the Australian economic scene in the coalition's Fightback proposals. The Government was struck dumb by those. It cobbled together a statement called `One Nation', of which these tax cut proposals were one part. As I said before, we have now seen that One Nation statement sink virtually without trace.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The great fault of the One Nation statement, so far as this type of legislation and these types of proposals are concerned, is that there was no attempt by the Government to explain how it would finance the huge additional spending proposals that it put forward or the tax cuts that were proposed. There is no way that a Labor government could deliver these tax cuts. As I said, it cares only about the next election—so who cares whether these tax cuts are not delivered in three or four years time? The first of the tax cuts does not come into effect until the 1994-95 financial year. At the time these tax cuts were reconfirmed in statements by the Government in September, Terry McCrann wrote in the

        The provenance of these promised tax cuts bears emphasising. They were spawned in One Nation last February and fiscally justified by what can only be described as fraudulent economic projections that could easily have passed for a Bond Corporation balance sheet in the glory days.
       </para>
       <para>
        That has been reconfirmed by everything that has happened since. The One Nation economic forecasts for growth for the period ahead had quite unrealistic growth forecasts of 4 per cent plus, going out each year until the middle years of this decade. Those forecasts have been pared back progressively since they were announced in the One Nation statement.

         Today we have the quite extraordinary situation—and it was debated, at least in part, during Question Time yesterday—where the Prime Minister, on the one hand, says that 4 per cent is still achievable growth and that if we cannot achieve 4 per cent, we ought to pack it in and give up as a government. He has been saying that for several months. His chief acolyte and promoter, who is one of the people who catapulted him into the prime ministership when he politically assassinated Prime Minister Hawke this time last year, Senator Graham Richardson, says that anyone who believes that 4 per cent growth is achievable in the immediate future `would I think be joking'. That is another example of the enormous inconsistency and division that wracks this Government in terms of some of the fundamental elements of government and of the economy, which is the centrepiece of the whole task of reducing the horrendous unemployment problem that Australia faces.

         The other great crime—which is not too strong a word to use—in relation to the particular proposals that are contained in these Bills for tax cuts is that not one cent of tax relief is provided for any low income earners or part time workers earning under $20,700 a year. The tax scales provide no tax relief at all for lower income earners. That is in stark contrast to the proposals that have been put on the table for more than a year now by the coalition in its Fightback tax cut proposals, in which there is very significant relief for income earners at the lower end of the scale. So much for the care, concern and compassion that this Government professes to have for the lower income earners and the more disadvantaged in our community. Colleagues will elaborate on some of my opening remarks.

        These tax cut proposals are not only totally uncaring so far as their regard for lower income earners is concerned; they are also totally irresponsible in that they have not been funded in any way. Therefore, the implications for the economy are very serious indeed, as we move to the middle years of the decade. They will simply further compound the enormous budgetary problems that this Government has introduced over recent years. We have seen a massive deterioration in the Commonwealth's financial position in the last few years—a deterioration which over the last three years has already amounted to about $30,000m. These proposals will just compound that problem in the years ahead.

         Finally, I reiterate that the great fault of this Bill is that it attempts to tie the hands of future governments by proposing tax cuts so far in advance of their date of application. In December 1992 we are dealing with tax cuts which will not even start until 1994-95 and which extend out for four or more years beyond that.

         That is an absolutely and totally irresponsible way to go about the management of economic policy and government in this country.

         —The Senate has before it the Taxation Legislation Amendment Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill. The Taxation Legislation Amendment Bill is unprecedented in the sense that it legislatively provides for tax cuts that are far into the future and are unfunded. Therefore, what this Government is doing in this legislation is putting a millstone around the neck of any future government in terms of its options, given the unfunded nature of this legislation. The Bill is also bad in the sense that it fails to deliver tax cuts to the lower income earners. That is a tragedy at this time when it is essentially these people who are suffering the stigma of low incomes, part time work and so on.

These Bills were introduced in the other place the following day.

To deliver these tax cuts will do nothing but create a millstone, as I said, around the neck of a Labor government should what I regard as the impossible occur and the Labor Party be returned at the next election. The coalition is the party with a well-thought-out plan to deliver genuine and much needed taxation reform.

         A returned Labor government would have difficulty financing the proposed tax cuts. The Government's decision to legislate now for tax cuts in 1994 and beyond shows a desperate attempt to give a facade of legitimacy to its decision that I believe it will be unable to implement. The One Nation growth estimates have been so wrong. Only a few days ago, the economic news out of Europe and Japan was so gloomy that the International Monetary Fund had to downgrade its forecasts with regard to these two countries. In the paper today we read of commodity prices being severely down in a number of areas. What happens on the world stage will impact on Australia and on this Government's ability to deliver those tax cuts.

I have been interested to note that the figures given by various government documents, as to how these cuts are to be financed, do not add up. The numbers in the explanatory memorandum to the legislation conflict with the Treasurer's statement in relation to both Bills. In fact, the explanatory memorandum says that the Government will raise $1,525m from this measure in 1994-95 and $840m in 1995-96. Meanwhile, the summary table explaining the tax changes on page 13 of the tax policy statement says that the fringe benefits measures will raise $1,640m in 1994-95 and $840m in 1995-96.

         The Government has already announced significant changes in terms of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill which will reduce the amount of revenue. On equity grounds, the Opposition agrees to that particular amendment because these organisations, basically the non-profit organisations, would have been discriminated against quite unfairly in the sense that they would pay a grossed-up fringe benefit and would get no deduction in respect of the expenses incurred. For that reason, as we indicated earlier, we will be supporting that amendment.

         The tax cuts proposed in the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill before us are inequitable. Forty-seven per cent of all taxpayers—that is, those on the lowest scales—will receive no tax cuts at all. The Keating tax cuts do not reduce the lowest marginal rate from 20 per cent, as the Opposition's do, to 16.2 per cent, nor do they increase the tax-free threshold of $5,400. You might recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the coalition's Fightback package lifts that threshold to $7,000. Therefore, no taxpayer on an income under $20,700 will obtain a tax cut under this Government, but they will under a Liberal-National Party government.

         The planned personal tax cuts in this Bill will create a hole in this year's Budget. One must not forget that there is also a cumulative deficit of nearly $50 billion from 1991-92 to 1995-96. The question arises: how will this all be paid for? The Government, of course, has relied on its hastily put together tax statement of 16 September that it proposes to raise $2.5 billion over the two years to reform the FBT system. In his statement, the Treasurer says:

         The Government has also stated that it will achieve part of the increased revenue from improved compliance of business on the everyday taxpayer.

         The question arises that if compliance is such a large problem, as the Government claims, why has the Government not dealt with this previously and why forestall the introduction of this part of the statement until 1994? The Tax Office is to receive an extra $114m over three years to implement these extra compliance measures. The Tax Office is critically short of staff at the top end. The money will mainly be spent on hiring extra staff.

The Tax Office is planning to allocate 100 additional staff to the audits of the top 100 companies.

One wonders, after these companies have been audited for up to two, three or possibly four years, how much extra money the Tax Office will continue to obtain from this so-called higher compliance from these sorts of big businesses.

Overall, it has been estimated that the new compliance measures will cost businesses an extra $700m over two years.

I applaud the amendment that the Government is putting forward to exempt the grossing-up effect on, basically, the non-profit sector of Australia, which includes religious institutions, scientific bodies, hospitals and various non-profit organisations. This measure must have been one of the unintended consequences when the legislation was first framed.

         There is no denying that the changes in this Bill are a significant fundraising measure. The changes are to commence on 1 April 1994. In effect, the value of fringe benefits is to be grossed up to an amount paid equal to the cash salary that would need to be paid by an employer to produce the same after tax benefit to an employee. Basically, fringe benefits, by way of emoluments, will disappear from the pay packages around Australia because they simply will not be worth while. The net result of this Bill is that an employer's fringe benefits payments will almost double. At the same time, an employer's income tax will be reduced—that is, if the employer pays any income tax at all—by an amount less than the increased fringe benefits payable.

         According to Butterworths weekly tax bulletin No. 46, there are a number of problems that will arise if this new method is implemented. Firstly, it assumes that all employers started saving tax by reducing employees' cash salaries generally and providing fringe benefits of an amount which left employees in the same after tax position. That is not necessarily true. Secondly, it assumes that all employees who receive fringe benefits tax are in the highest tax bracket—that is, $50,000-plus. That is not true. In most cases the reality is probably quite different. The main type of benefit traditionally provided by an employer, for example, a company car, has always been provided as a fringe benefit. Furthermore, a company car would normally not be able to be cashed out by the employee.

         It appears that the measures may have been derived from a practice of some employers to allow high income employees to use salary packaging to obtain an `arbitrage' benefit on the difference between the company tax rate of 39 per cent and the higher fringe benefits tax and personal tax rate. We believe there is an opportunity for some tax minimisation schemes in that there is too big a difference between the corporate tax rate and the top income tax rate. In salary packaging planning, however, the benefit normally was given to the employee and did not represent a saving to the employer.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The effect of the gross-up goes far beyond preventing the use of salary package planning, given that many benefits will not be able to be cashed out. Instead, it amounts to an additional tax on employers and could be considered harsh for those employers not paying income tax.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, I note the position of the non-profit organisations. Very few of those, effectively, are involved in salary sacrifice packaging arrangements. A further effect of the amendments is that franking credits will be decreased as employers will be paying more fringe benefits tax and less income tax.

         —I rise to speak on the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill 1992. As Senator Watson has already pointed out, it is nothing but a fundraising exercise because of the shortfall that the Taxation Commissioner has had in the last 12 months of raising funds for the tax cuts that this Government has promised—unfunded, of course—out of the One Nation package. It is introducing the grossing-up factor, and the grossing-up factor is to attack the employers or companies that are cashing out FBT.

         It was quite legal, of course, to pay FBT at the tax rate of 39c in the dollar, and that will be taken up to the top tax rate of 49c plus the Medicare levy. The situation is that most small businesses were paying far less than that and were using the cash out system rather than paying the FBT. In my opinion, in most cases they were doing that to get away from paperwork more than anything else. It was better for a small employer with one or two employees to pay the cash benefit so employees were taxed themselves rather than having to go through the paperwork.

He, or whoever is the Treasurer at the time, should be looking at this to make sure that local government is not unduly penalised. In Western Australia alone, local government is up for an extra $1.75m for this grossing-up situation. Local government does not have an endless supply of money, and in this case it can only be recouped from extra rates.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The estimated cost of this legislation to Local Government in Western Australia is $1.75m, the bulk of which comprises additional FBT on private motor vehicle use, which includes travel to and from home for garaging purposes. This sum of $1.75m will now have to be found by Councils, through increased Government grants or property rates, or by the employees of Local Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation increases the tax burden on Local Government from 48.25% to 93.2% of the valuation, whereas the effective tax rate payable by a tax-paying company, after deductions from taxable income, will be 17.85%. And Local Government is supposed to be the tax exempt body!
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In seeking to eliminate a tax "perk", the Government is, in consequence, aggravating inequities within the existing system. These inequities essentially arise by virtue of the regressive nature of the regime in that all fringe benefits are taxed at the top marginal income tax rate, irrespective of the marginal tax rate payable by the recipient. Thus, lower-paid recipients of fringe benefits effectively subsidise the higher-paid. In particular, the increase in the gross tax burden on benefits for the higher-paid, and a widening gap in the tax-inefficiency of remunerating employees on less than the top tax rate in fringe benefits, not cash, will have an especially severe impact on both companies and Government employees in remote regions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I mentioned earlier that the bulk of FBT payable by Councils relates to car usage. This particularly applies to the metropolitan area. However, in remote areas, and particularly the Pilbara, a range of fringe benefits are virtually forced on Councils if they are to compete for labour. Subsidised housing is the principal "fringe benefit" in this context.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Companies in remote Australia have historically had to provide their own infrastructure and basic living conditions for their employees. They are now taxed for doing so, and have no ability to "cash out" the so-called benefits for their employees, because they are written into individual awards and, in he case of the Pilbara, are enforced through State Agreement Acts. They are often provided for employees towards the lower end of the wage structure, and can more realistically be viewed as necessities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Local Governments which exist in this environment must, of course, follow suit, and it is only exacerbating the situation when they have to pay 93.2% tax on the value of these benefits.

        Unless there is a re-appraisal of remote area fringe benefits tax valuations, this current legislative attempt to eliminate "perks" will fall disproportionately and inequitably on remote areas which have an imperative to provide benefits other than cash.

        Given that one of the reasons for the introduction of this legislation is to raise additional revenue to offset intended income tax cuts, and given the statement in your Second Reading Speech that "a significant share of the revenue yield of the changes will come from tax exempt Government sector employees . . .

         That well-known document the annual report of the Australian Taxation Office shows that not only did the Government get its projections wrong with a shortfall in revenue of $3.5 billion because the Tax Office did not even factor in the recession, but the only growth centre of any tax collection is FBT. Accordingly, fringe benefits tax grossing-up provisions are put in place, which are simply a grab to get more tax from businesses which are struggling to survive.

So three weeks after the Budget, that infamous statement on tax policy is brought down—a document prepared by Mr Boucher and his Tax Office, accompanied by the confidential minute signed by Mr Boucher, allegedly finding $1.7 billion to fill up the hole in the Budget.

         In that hearing, we saw that the Commissioner had entered into competing agreements. He had entered into an agreement with the Department of Finance that in order to spend $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money buying information technology for the modernisation program, he in turn agreed that there would be a reduction of 3,000 staff, which is quite clear and quite explicit in the agreement. He then entered into a competing agreement with the Public Sector Union, which virtually outlawed any compulsory redundancies at all.

         What the Tax Office has done to try to remedy that is to convert administration moneys into salary moneys, which is allowable in terms of management but not in terms of abuse. Furthermore, it has forward borrowed $19m against next year's appropriation to try to make up the shortfall. At no stage in all the hearings with Mr Boucher and the officers of the Tax Office did they admit to the shortfall. Indeed, they tried to say everything was lovely, including getting the man that they call their chief bean counter to give a presentation to the Committee which, quite frankly, was wrong. It had two errors in it, and that meant that the Committee was misled by that information.

         One error was that he presented a graph to the Committee which showed that the $19m forward borrowing had in fact been repaid in this financial year to the tune of $18m. It had not.

As and from this year the amount that can be borrowed against forward appropriations has gone from 3 per cent to 6 per cent, and the chief bean counter showed those figures. The only thing he had not done was read the Finance Regulations that accompany those changes. What those Finance Regulations say, very specifically, is that one may not borrow in consecutive years. In other words, it is what I said in the beginning about the Tax Office: that its mismanagement was so bad that had it been a private corporation it would have been put into receivership.

         The other point that remains a very serious question to be answered is what transpired between the Budget and the bringing down of that subsequent statement. In the Budget Papers there is a statement by Mr Dawkins which says:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the fiscal position nearer to the time is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. These changes—referred to in the Budget Statements—would allow for the 1995-96 deficit to be between  1/2 per cent and 1 per cent of gross domestic product.
       </para>
       <para>
        Looking at those statements, one can see that they were talking about having a withholding tax on interest and other taxes. But paragraph 4 of the confidential minute signed by Mr Boucher that accompanies the statement says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Earlier this year, when addressing the question of a domestic withholding tax on interest I made the general point that it is a tenet of income tax administration that the most efficient and effective means of gathering tax is to have it deducted at source.

       <para>
        One of the many questions I asked of Mr Boucher which he refused to answer was: when did he change his mind? Clearly, he had given that advice prior to the Budget. What pressures were brought to bear in order to change that? Mr Boucher is not just like a head of any other department. He is a statutory head. He can only be sacked on the motion of both Houses of Parliament. He is entrenched for a seven-year term, which he has chosen to leave after one year of the second term of appointment.

         There are many questions indeed that need to be answered as to how that $1.7 billion was found in a 2 1/2-week period. When one investigates the figures, one finds that they cannot be substantiated, and yet that whole sorry mess is the basis for the alleged funding for these so-called tax cuts. What a sorry tale has been woven by this Government. There is a debt of $162 billion, one million people unemployed, and the Government has no policies to deal with it at all. What do we get? We get red herrings put on the trail. Yesterday we had Senator Tate, the man who originally told us in this chamber that the Government had no policies, come in and talk about changing the oath of allegiance.

         What we need is solid policies to get rid of that $162 billion debt and to put a dent in the figure of one million unemployed. We need confidence, we need policies and we need strong leadership, but the Government is not giving them. Every time it makes a statement, one can believe that it will be proven wrong down the track. This is just another example. What a subterfuge. We are going to slug the very businesses that have any opportunity of providing employment, on the basis that we have to have a grab for tax so that we can pretend to promise tax cuts years out, when this Government will be out of office.

         There are so many injustices in this package of Bills that they deserve to be thrown out lock, stock and barrel. It is indeed a sad and sorry day when we see debate on this mess curtailed and when we see the tactics of a government, unable to handle its business so as to get through it in an orderly way, panicking, trying to grab at straws and saying, `Umpteen years down the track we might give you a tax cut'. It is not good enough for the Government to pretend that it has the interests of the people at heart. It clearly has not. This package of Bills deserves to be condemned.

         —The first Bill I would like to discuss today is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill 1992. This Bill is a direct result of the very weak recovery of the economy over the last 12 to 18 months. The One Nation statement proposed a number of measures to help stimulate the economy. It proposed, firstly, to return the Budget to surplus within four years and, secondly, to do this while promising what we consider to be ridiculous personal income tax cuts in both 1994 and 1996. The key assumption for all of this to be possible is a rapid and sustained increase in economic growth. Close to 5 per cent was predicted. This was greeted with scepticism, incredulity and hilarity by all commentators and all sides of politics. As we know, it was revised down in the Budget. The fact that it had to be revised down meant that the dual promise of returning the Budget to surplus and making these personal income tax cuts could not be kept without increasing taxation in other areas.

         Today we have before us the related increased compliance regime previously announced by the Treasurer. Despite the fact that these measures for compliance are intrinsically fair, nobody really believes that they will fill the yawning deficit. Contrary to the views of previous speakers, the Australian Democrats believe that the fringe benefits tax is one of the better reforms of the Keating period in Treasury. There was a huge equity problem with the tax treatment of fringe benefits and there was justifiable anger in the community about the unfairness of differing tax burdens, depending upon how an employee's remuneration was structured. The structure of the fringe benefits tax was to impose tax, via the employer, on the net benefit enjoyed by the employee. The benefit is tax deductible to the employer but the fringe benefits tax itself is not. This was a reasonable structure while the company tax rate and the maximum marginal income tax rate were aligned. However, the cut in the company tax rate to 39 per cent introduced a clear advantage to employees in taking their remuneration in the form of fringe benefits. This Bill proposes to impose fringe benefits tax on the gross benefit obtained. The benefit is grossed up by adding the fringe benefits tax to the net benefit, and the fringe benefits tax itself becomes tax deductible to the employer. This will ensure that an employee will face the same effective tax burden whether the income is by way of cash or non-cash benefits. I seek leave to incorporate in

        The fringe benefits tax (FBT) legislation, when first introduced, sought to levy FBT to a similar extent to the income tax that would have been payable had the benefit been payable in a monetary form. This was achieved through the close alignment between the FBT rate, the top marginal rate of income tax and the company income tax rate. However, the position was disturbed by the reduction of company rates on 1 July 1988.

         —The impact of this Bill would have been fairly harsh on some non-taxpaying employers, and this effect was obviously anticipated by the Government. Consequently, the Government has allowed a rebate to some employers who are exempt from income tax, basically to neutralise the effect of this Bill. Some of the bodies affected by this are public benevolent institutions, sporting, educational and scientific bodies, community service organisations and trade unions.

         We think the rebate move is fair and appropriate, and so is the caveat the Government has given. The rebate is to ensure that the legitimate activities of the various organisations are not unduly affected. However, this also makes the provision of fringe benefits very attractive to the employees of those bodies, and so there is a risk of abuse. The Australian Democrats support the Government's proposal for monitoring the level of fringe benefits in order to ensure that the rebate is not overly generous to some employees.

         It is important to note that, although the fringe benefits tax is paid by the employer, the real incidence of the tax is on the employee. This principle does not change whether the employee works for a charity or a trade union. One interesting result of this legislation is that certain types of benefits will become more tax effective, and hence attractive, in salary packages.

         Certain types of expenses do not qualify for tax deductions to the employer, for example, some entertainment and leisure expenses, so they are not subject to the fringe benefits tax.

          The increase in the fringe benefits tax rate effected by this Bill will mean that these non-deductible expenses will be more tax effective than they currently are, so we can be reasonably confident that these larger loopholes could be exploited in the future. I believe that the Government should also address this area to see whether a further restructuring could be achieved to ensure that these non-deductible benefits are treated in a tax neutral manner. Certainly, the Democrats would support any fair moves in this area.

         This measure will commence on 1 April 1994 and will raise over $1.5 billion in 1994-95 and $840m in future years. It is quite extraordinary that this massive revenue measure does not seem to have raised a ripple of community angst. My office has not received any representations at all on this matter. Given the reaction to the superannuation guarantee levy, parking tax and other revenue proposals, I think that is quite unusual, because it is a massive revenue proposal.

         The second Bill in this package is the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill. I am sorry I cannot talk positively about this Bill either. It is the Government's enactment of the One Nation personal income tax cuts and it vies for the award for one of the worst pieces of legislation the Labor Government has introduced over the last 10 years. It is part of the Government's strategy—the `have your cake and eat it too' approach—of promising to broadly match the Fightback income tax cuts but without the nasty GST. So the nation has been involved in what I have been calling an obscene tax auction: when in doubt appeal to the hip pocket. This continues the trend of the Keating Treasury of cutting marginal tax rates, as opposed to adjusting the thresholds at which various marginal rates commence.

         The Government is continually saying that these rate measures must not be viewed in isolation, and this begs the question: why not? We hear at length from the Government that it has broadened the tax base. It has, and it has done that with the support of the Democrats. But many of the measures were long overdue and the coalition has supported many of them as well. The fact that the tax base is fairer is not a justification for making the personal income tax scale less fair. It is so counterproductive of the Government to seek to reverse the good work it has done in the area of base broadening by seeking to give back the additional tax raised by flattening the progressivity of personal income tax.

         This legislation proposes to introduce income tax cuts from 1 July 1994 to 1 January 1996. They are very regressive tax cuts. In my view, there has been insufficient public scrutiny of them until recent weeks. What people have failed to grasp is that this legislation proposes to give absolutely no tax cuts to those people with earnings of less than $20,700 per year; all the low income earners will get no tax relief for at least the next five years.

         This is at a time when we have a significant trend in the economy away from full time employment towards part time employment. Indeed, Access Economics has estimated that there are an additional one million people in Australia who are underemployed; that is, who cannot get the full time work they desire. These people in particular will get nothing from the kinder, more compassionate Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Government claims that reducing unemployment is the No. 1 priority. I agree. But I do not think it can achieve that and at the same time give a huge, unaffordable bribe to those lucky enough to be in full time work or those lucky enough to have significant income from investments.

         Let me repeat: this legislation gives nothing to those earning under $20,700 per year, but it will deliver $47 a week to those earning $50,000 or more. That means people such as us. That means that people such as us in the Senate deserve a $50 a week tax cut, while Australia is racked by what seems like a permanent recession. It makes one wonder about the priorities of those with work. Why should we deserve more consideration while the unemployed become increasingly disillusioned?

         I do not find myself agreeing with Paddy McGuinness very often, but I thought his presentation yesterday was particularly lucid when he said, in essence, that this particular Bill was a very bad Bill and that the decision to pursue tax cuts was a very bad decision. He said that it is bad economics, it is bad fiscal and tax practice, it is bad social policy, it is bad constitutional practice and it is bad ethics. On the issue of bad constitutional practice, we did question the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, on this yesterday. I am still unconvinced that it is appropriate for a government, close to an election, to tie the hands of or to bind a future government. It really does reduce the options of that future government. It does preclude the use of discretionary tax rates either to stimulate or to contract fiscal policy. It significantly ties the hands of a future government. I think it is wrong to do that.

I think it is important to point out that they are following their policy of criticising but not voting against Budget Bills. The Opposition members attached a reservation to yesterday's committee hearings. I draw people's attention to that. It does not go far enough, in my view, because they may then be in government, but they are accepting the right of this present Government to tie their hands. What will they do if they are in government? What will they do with a Senate which may be controlled by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats? I find their attitude disappointing.

         If the Government insists on spending $8 billion, I would suggest to it that it could find much better ways to do that. It could start by looking at the tax thresholds. It could start by looking at the inequities in child-care relief. It could start by paying some attention to the plight of self-funded retirees. These are much fairer ways in which to spend $8 billion. The Democrats believe that these tax cuts are blatantly opportunistic, unaffordable, unfair and irresponsible, and this legislation should be opposed on those grounds.

         The two Bills before us are both important, although quite distinct. The fringe benefits tax legislation has had pretty well widespread support in this chamber. I understand that some senators have raised concerns about some particular sub-parts of it. I do not share their view but I will not traverse that, because broadly people accept the principle that there was, to use the shorthand term, arbitrage going on in the way people were using fringe benefits and getting particular advantage because of the structure of the tax system. That is a practice which will be finished by these changes. That probably explains why Senator Kernot, for example, has not had any expressions of concern about this legislation, because everybody who is caught up in it realises that it is a measure that was overdue. Many of the acknowledged experts had been calling on the Government to take action of this sort for some time.

         The Government amendment to provide a rebate to non-government non-profit organisations so that the impact of this grossing-up is not as severe on them as it otherwise might have been has been well received, though it would not please the tax purists because those non-government non-profit organisations also have the capacity, which some unfortunately have exhibited, to abuse the tax system in the way that they go about providing remuneration packages to their employees. Nevertheless, they are providing a socially worthwhile function and, provided there is no flagrant abuse of this rebate mechanism, we think it is a fair compromise between tax purity and fairness and socially desirable outcomes. I thank honourable senators for their support for that legislation and that proposed amendment. I will not debate it any further.

         The principal matter that has been debated is the One Nation tax cuts. We have to make it very clear right from the start that there is no apology from the Government for the fact that these tax cuts are focused on working Australians, Australians in that range just below and just above average weekly earnings. These are people who are out there working hard to make a living and who have been showing great wage restraint. They have not been the beneficiaries of the increasingly targeted welfare expenditures of the Government, where we have tightened the focus on things like family allowance supplement, so that people in the middle have felt squeezed. They have been showing significant restraint for the last decade. We do not apologise for the fact that we are targeting these tax cuts to those people. I think most Australians would recognise that from time to time, notwithstanding the increasingly tight targeting of expenditure, we have to recognise the pressures on the people in the middle, and this is an example of doing that.

         It is nevertheless true, as was raised in the Committee yesterday and by Senator Kernot—I did not hear anyone else pick it up—that Australia does have to consider how long we can go on reducing the tax take. We do have to look at the fact that we are one of the two lowest taxing countries in the OECD. Australians have reasonable aspirations for a level of government service provision that is consistent with a modern Western democracy, and to fund that we need a reasonable level of tax.

         We cannot go on cutting revenue and not looking at how we are going to provide the services to which Australians consider themselves entitled and which, I think, a reasonable society should provide. But I do not think we cross that bridge on this occasion because we are talking about fairly small tax cuts, if one looks at them over the time period in question. We are looking at substantial, targeted cuts, but we are not talking about any fundamental change in tax as a percentage of GDP.

         I understand the concern that people raised yesterday in the Committee hearing and today in the second reading debate about the long term nature of this legislation, but I think we have to put that in perspective. In the lead up to an election, every party is going to set down what it thinks the tax situation should be over the next three years. The Government has the opportunity to make that intention clear by legislation. The Opposition does not have that opportunity, but it has made clear its view about what the tax levels for Australians should be over the next three years. It may be that it is about to change that view slightly. Nevertheless, whatever it says on Friday, there will then be set down what the Opposition thinks the tax regime should be for the next three years. I assume that at some stage in the course of the debate between now and the election the Australian Democrats will do the same. So we are telling Australians the terms on which we wish to seek re-election. This is one part of it, and we are legislating to make our intention clear.

         It is true that it does not make sense to look at the social or economic impacts of these tax cuts in isolation. No Government initiative stands in isolation from the package of measures that preceded it and accompany it. When one looks at the overall structure of the tax system, with the broadening of the base, particularly the introduction of capital gains and fringe benefits, one will see a substantial enhancement of the equity of the tax system. We have seen a focusing of tax cuts. The biggest percentage drop in the marginal tax rate has been for people earning below $20,000 over the last 10 years, and that is where the tax cuts and the expenditure targeting has been focused. The nature of the tax burden is such that it is not the most effective mechanism to provide assistance to people on incomes below $20,000 a year; it is much more effectively done on the revenue side of the Budget, and the Government intends to continue to do that.

         and I will not speak about it any further. A number of Opposition senators spoke about the Opposition tax cuts. I think Senator Short described them as exciting, and they are certainly exciting some interest amongst Australians and they are expressing their view. That interest continues to be reflected in the opinion polls, and I welcome that. Opposition members spoke about the equity of the tax cuts they are proposing. In these difficult times, and even if they dropped the second stage of their tax cuts, they are proposing to drop the top marginal tax rate even further. That seems to me to be not a priority. It is certainly not a priority the Government shares at this time. This tax measure, which is focused on Australians who are on or about average weekly earnings, does not do that and I do not think it is appropriate. It is the mechanism by which the marginal tax rate for the overwhelming majority of Australian workers is reduced to 30c in the dollar without having to impose a GST on them to fund it.

Overall, it was a positive debate, and a contribution to economic debate in Australia. It is a great pity that Senator Bishop could not resist the temptation to come in and abuse the Tax Office again, even though it had nothing to do with this legislation.

         —I reiterate the Opposition's concern that the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill contains no tax relief for low income earners. Anyone earning less than $20,700 a year will have no tax relief under this Bill. If the Government is seriously concerned about the plight of low income earners and lower income earners in our community and the hardship imposed on them, as it professes to be and as it well should be, then there should be significant tax relief for people in those lower income brackets.

         In relation to the funding of the tax cuts contained in the Bill, nowhere is there mentioned in the Bill or, more significantly, in the explanatory memorandum, the so-called enhanced compliance measures that were announced by the Government in September—some reference was made to this by Senator Bishop in the second reading debate—because the Bills are based on entirely unsubstantiated claims as to where the funding would come from, rather than identifiable provisions. The Government was forced to reveal pseudo additional revenue sources after it brought down its August Budget because it was unable to fund all its fanciful promises, like the tax cuts included in this Bill.

         The Budget contained a secret taxes reference. When the onslaught got too hot and hard to handle, the Treasurer had to act. In response to the obvious huge hole in the Budget, the Treasurer announced a couple of new initiatives to part fill the gap. One of those was a change in the calculation of  fringe benefits tax, included in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill 1992.

         The other item was a so-called compliance windfall that the then Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, claimed that he had suddenly found on 15 September 1992, just a couple of days before the Government made its announcement. That money was estimated at $1.7 billion over two years. However, for an unexplained reason it does not become available until the first tax cut years, 1994-95 and 1995-96, just in time to fill the Government's Budget gap. Again, for an unexplained reason, that money was also not known at the time of the Budget, a mere month earlier.

         The guesstimated figures of the Commissioner and the Treasurer that were released as part of this Bill and its foreshadowing announcement in September have no basis. How can they have any basis when they are currently not collected? Those figures that are ostensibly there to fund at least part of these tax cuts contained in this Bill have no credibility at all.

         On behalf of the coalition, I repeat that this Bill and its specific provisions is a sham. It is nothing more than a cheap political fraud. I have no doubt at all it will be seen as such, but I come back to the point I made earlier in the second reading debate, that to a large degree this is, in fact, irrelevant because, when in government after the next election, the Hewson government will introduce the tax reform agenda that it has announced, and that will overtake this Bill. The Bill is a sham. It is an attempt to buy a few cheap political votes. It will be seen as nothing more than that. I have no doubt at all that this Bill and its provisions will catapult, in a quite counterproductive way, on the Government.

         —I would like to ask Senator Short to explain to those people of Australia who are listening, and those who may watch at some time when this debate is broadcast, given his criticism in his comments in the second reading debate, why he speaks one way and votes differently. I think that it is a distinction which is not clearly understood by the Australian people: why he criticises the Bill but votes for it.

         —The people of Australia have to learn to live with this disastrous Government. The Government will stand or fall on the totality of its legislation, including this legislation which everyone knows is a fraud and a sham. The coalition wants this Government to be, as it will be, judged on this legislation, plus the other legislation and the disastrous incompetencies that have marked its term in office. This is part of a continuing, long term chain of incompetence and political shams that the Government has now become noted for and the people of Australia will judge accordingly at election time. I have nothing more to add on that.

I was confused as to whether it was a second reading amendment or a vote against the Bill. I had not intended to vote against the Bill, and I would like the record to show that. I offer, as an ameliorating factor, the fact that we sat very late last night. I had about one hour's sleep last night; I think we are all in that position, but I was the one who found myself on the wrong side.

         —I would like to make a couple of comments in response to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) said in his summing up. He said that these tax cuts were targeted, but it is a fact that, in the targeting that the Government has chosen, 60 per cent of women are left out by virtue of the fact that they occupy a great many part time jobs, and 46 per cent of Australians will receive no tax cut at all. In times of high and projected continuing unemployment, it is time for a radical rethink about how we share the burden of unemployment in this country. Paying a jobs levy, as suggested by the Australian Democrats, is one way; paying more tax is another.

        To try to translate that into economists' terms, there is at least a component in that of poor incentives, of rewards being given to people who do not particularly deserve them and failure to reward people who are contributing a great deal more to the common good. This, of course, means attention to micro-economics, and broad tax cuts which assist people whatever their micro-economic contribution are rather beside the point.

         The second point made by the Parliamentary Secretary upon which I would like to comment is what he said about the Government's right to legislate into the future. Technically, the Government has that right, but it is most unusual. Governments usually confine themselves to making promises and letting Australians judge on the competing promises. It is most unusual and most inappropriate to attempt to bind the hands of a

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Those amendments are presently limited to employers making superannuation contributions in accordance with an industrial award or law in place prior to 21 August 1991.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment now proposed will extend those standard earnings base measures to employers in the NSW coal industry who make superannuation contributions for employees in accordance with a new industrial agreement called the New South Wales Coal Mining Industry Statutory Superannuation Fund (Salary Sacrifice) Agreement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment will allow this new agreement to be accepted as an industrial award which was in place prior to 21 August 1991. This will have the effect of allowing the standard employee earnings base in the agreement to be acceptable for superannuation guarantee purposes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Further minor amendments are also proposed. One is to extend the time for an employer to obtain a statement from a superannuation scheme so that benefit certificates in relation to it are deemed to relate to a complying superannuation scheme;  the extended time will be 30 days after the Bill receives Royal Assent. The other is to clarify that, when Royal Assent is given to the Bill, retired persons will be able to transfer certain benefits into superannuation funds irrespective of whether they retired before or after the date of Royal Assent.
       </para>

In relation to the self-employed, particularly company directors, would the Parliamentary Secretary confirm whether there will be some classes of persons who will, as a result of being required to have SGC contributions made on their behalf, lose the ability to provide for their own superannuation on a tax deductible basis?

Those concerns were outlined both in the second reading debate and in the extensive committee deliberations that took place with a number of outside people concerned about the impact of this legislation. We had earlier pressed the Government to delay the commencement date. That was partially successful in that the implementation date will no longer be 1 July 1992 but 1 January 1993. We requested that the Government extend the commencement date to 1 July 1993. This was not acceptable, and we could get no assurance that such an amendment would receive passage through this chamber.

         This Bill will have a detrimental effect on many genuine businesses that are exporting Australian expertise where the overseas interest is not a controlling interest. This will be very damaging to the technology industries and those where Australia has built up an expertise. I give examples to indicate the sorts of businesses that we believe are going to be detrimentally affected: car parking and shopping centres. Australian businesses have built up an expertise in this area. They have sent that technology to Europe, particularly to France. Because of local requirements, corporations do not have a majority interest and their interest is below 50 per cent. Those corporations will be caught under the accrual methods even though they make an adequate distribution of income.

         We believe this Bill is deficient in so many areas. It fails to recognise what comparable tax jurisdictions, for example, the UK jurisdiction, do in providing an adequate or sufficient distribution. Therefore, the Liberal-National Party coalition, when it gets into government, will have to review the operations of this Act. It was sold on the basis of being an anti-avoidance piece of legislation. The Government has gone far beyond that. In fact, the legislation will be detrimental to many migrants coming to Australia and expatriates returning to Australia bringing home their superannuation policies where those policies are in excess of $50,000.

Although the matters are important to the people affected, we are now talking about some minor parts of what is a broad concept and an important one. I thank honourable senators for that support. We have had this debate both in the committee and at the second reading stage. Our view is that the scope, both in breadth and depth with regard to this Bill, has been refined sufficiently to strike a fair balance. History will be the judge, but it has been reviewed both in a consultative process by independent experts and by Senate committees and I think we have as good a balance as we are going to strike. Therefore, the Government intends to persist with the legislation as it stands.

Generally, charitable organisations will not be affected in a major way from the point of view of revenue, but from the point of view of equity we have included them.

         The Government, according to this legislation, expects to receive $90m in the first year. According to the Budget Papers, the figure is $120m. We believe that either of those figures can still be achieved because the Government has grossly underestimated the revenue to be derived from this measure. It will have a tremendous impact in terms of revenue raising across the business community and all those other organisations. So the actual amount will be far in excess of either of those amounts.

         —On behalf of the fair-minded people on the Government side, I indicate that we have two concerns with the Opposition's proposed amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill. One, which I think Senator Watson will accept, is a drafting matter—I will raise this as I go through—which is, I think, common to how he wishes to proceed and would allow him to achieve his purpose. The second concern deals with the way in which we would prefer to see this amendment proceed if it must proceed.

         We have to be careful when we say that we do not agree, for example, with taxing education. Let us make it quite clear that the fringe benefits tax legislation at the moment applies to schools. In the Bill we just carried, we voted that it continue to apply to schools at the existing rate. It applies to private schools, public schools, universities and TAFE colleges. It applies to educational institutions; it always has and it always should. Let me make that clear.

         The fringe benefits tax also applies to scientific, religious and charitable institutions. Those three terms—other than educational institutions, because I think that is fairly clear—are very difficult terms to define. In a different context I think there is some degree of precedent about the meaning of those three words in the tax law. But they are here in a different context and we will have significant argument about what they mean. But I want to come back to that in a moment.

         I now want to focus on how we think the amendment should read. I draw Senator Kernot's attention to this proposal too. There are two ways in which we would change it. One I think Senator Watson will agree with, and one goes to substance. Our first problem—the drafting problem—is that saying, `The provisions of this Act do not apply to' is too broad. For example, this Act denies deductibility to employees of their car parking expenses and we do not wish to have that, I assume, not apply to people who work for these sorts of bodies. There is no reason why those employees should be placed in a different circumstance. So I assume that what Senator Watson wishes his amendment to read is, `The provisions of this Act do not apply to benefits provided to employees of'—and then he sets down the categories. I think that actually achieves the purpose which Senator Watson wishes.

         We would like to do a second thing. I made this clear to Senator Watson. We prefer not to have this amendment at all. If I had an indication that that was a possible outcome, that would be the Government's preferred outcome. But, if we cannot have that, our second option, apart from that drafting point, is to limit the application to schools. I understand, and we heard at a committee hearing, that there is significant concern, particularly expressed by private schools, in an Australian sense of the word—the British would call them public schools, but let us keep it sensible in Australian language—which were represented at the hearing. We understand the Opposition's desire, if it is going in that direction, to apply the principle equally to government schools.

         We would not have done either of those two things, but we could live with that, if we must have an amendment of some sort. We could even recognise some net benefit in that. We do not think it is an enhancement, because there are other ways in which the outcome for the schools and individuals in question could have been better handled. But if the Senate is of a mind to carry such an amendment, we would like it to read: `The provisions of this Act do not apply to benefits provided to employees of schools'.

         Having made my point about the drafting, I now address our concerns about the breadth of the exemption that is being proposed, even when it has been properly drafted. The words `scientific, religious and charitable' do not have a definition in this or in any of the accompanying tax legislation to which people would look for interpretation. In the amendments to the previous fringe benefits tax legislation that is not a problem. The wording was exactly the same as the historic wording in the income tax legislation. It is in exactly the same context; it has the same application; and people are confident that they know what the interpretation of that would be. There is a body of precedent and interpretation.

         We have taken these three words out of that context and put them here as an initiative with no limitation. With regard to scientific organisations, there is probably no organisation that employs more bachelors of science than does IBM. Is its research laboratory a scientific organisation? I do not know the answer, but we cannot suddenly say no. The court has every right to interpret it in accordance with the normal meaning of the word. Even by speeches in support of the amendment, we cannot require the court to interpret a word other than in its normal meaning. If the normal meaning is not clear, the court can then look to supplementary sources such as the speeches here to determine its interpretation.

One does not have to draw as long a bow as the IBM example to realise how broadly we are talking when we use the word `scientific'. There are all sorts of bodies out there, lobbying on behalf of the science community, which do not get the income tax exemption because they are lobbying organisations, but they probably could get in under this.

         On the face of it, that problem does not arise with the concept of `religious institution' because we all think we know what that means.

We are not all that happy about that, but the attempt to disentangle that would be too difficult. I suspect that their competitors are even less happy with it, but that is not a matter we are debating today. The Government is not proposing to change that.

         So we are concerned about those three categories and we are concerned about the broad sweep of educational institutions. It would certainly cover private English language ELICOS institutions; it would certainly cover a broad sweep of educational institutions which we believe have got no right to this special provision that is really being sought on behalf of those suburban schools which might be caught up by coincidence. The example we had before the Committee was in the inner western suburbs of Sydney—it may have been Burwood or somewhere in that area. What was raised before the Committee was the concern of a particular school, it being an example of schools of that nature which may get caught by the coincidence of the definition of what constitutes a full day commercial car park, and that there may therefore be an anomalous situation cast upon some schools.

         I am not sure that that is actually an unintended consequence of the legislation, but we accept the concern that was articulated by the National Council of Independent Schools of Australia, by the particular private school that came before the Committee and by a number of back bench members of both parties. It has been Government members who have expressed this concern to me, but I am sure others have expressed it to others, and some candidates have expressed it fairly forthrightly to me. The concern has been fundamentally about schools. We are not talking about much money here, because we are talking about a small number of individuals at a very small number of schools around Australia; those which happen by coincidence to be in the CBD, of which there are very few, or which by dint of circumstance get caught because of their relationship to what is interpreted under this legislation as a full day commercial car park.

         I suspect that, if the Act went through unamended, the final outcome would be that there would actually be very few caught. But if the chamber is of a mind to say, `That is a consequence that is unacceptable to us', then I urge honourable senators not to cast such a broad net but to have the Bill say that the provisions of this Act do not apply to benefits provided to employees of schools. My concern is in two parts. One is merely drafting. I am sure Senator Watson accepts this part at least of what I am proposing, that, even if he wishes to persist with his broader sweep, it should be that the provisions of this Act do not apply to benefits provided to employees of the institutions which he has designated.

I am not trying to imply that the Opposition intends those, and I am therefore urging honourable senators not to open up the possibility of those unintended consequences.

         In terms of the generality of the exemptions we are seeking, we acknowledge that these organisations do not generally pay tax. The refinement Senator McMullan suggested—and I am quite happy to go along with that refinement—is not a significant one, but I agree that it does tidy up the provisions. I would like therefore to amend my amendment, if it is going to be a means of getting the Government to agree to it, to insert the words `benefits provided to employees' prior to the words `scientific, religious, charitable or educational institutions'. As we do not have an explanatory memorandum, for the purposes of determining the significance of the words, they have the meanings and connotations normally associated with them in the Income Tax Assessment Act and the fringe benefits tax legislation as it currently stands.

         Again, it is very important for the community to know that taxes will not be paid on benefits provided to employees under these various headings: scientific, religious, charitable, or educational institutions. These are the institutions that cannot afford this sort of payment. I must point out that the representations made to the Committee from a number of schools, particularly in the Sydney area, indicated that where there is an enrolment of about 700 students the figures could be as high as $80,000 to over $100,000. It is true that fringe benefits tax applies to fringe benefits provided by the schools, but the payments under the other legislation do not have the financial impact of the sorts of figures I have just presented to the Senate. With respect to car parking, these benefits are provided to teachers who are probably parking on the edge of, or even on, the oval, where their cars might get hit with footballs or cricket balls or have kids climbing over them. They have to park behind washrooms and all over the place. They are not car parks in the sense of what would be provided by a major organisation in downtown Collins Street, Melbourne.

         We note that the Parliamentary Secretary would wish it to be confined to schools. I have a particular problem with the discriminatory nature of that. A university such as Melbourne University could have a bill amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. It would be a lot of money to be paid by Melbourne University, and yet other universities which are over one kilometre away from a public car park would escape that imposition completely. Many members of the Liberal Party who are keen on the educational fairness area do not wish this horrendous tax to extend in such a discriminatory manner to universities. True, it raises a significant amount of revenue. I reiterate that the Government is confident, and we are confident, that this tax will not impede in any way the collection of revenue of between $90m and $120m in the first year, as outlined in the various documents. Whichever figure is taken, the amendment will not lessen that figure. It is true that it will reduce the overall take, but we believe that the Government has underestimated the tax take from this car parking levy. The impact will be so great that the Government will receive lots more money—of the dimensions it put forward, for example, when it first legislated for capital gains tax. It was a minimal amount the Government expected to take, but what happened when the returns started coming in? The same sorts of figures came up.

We will then discuss it with representatives of the Opposition and the Democrats on that basis rather than trying to do it on the run here and using up the time of the Committee when we could be dealing with other important matters. I simply say that we do not like that form of words, although we understand what honourable senators opposite are trying to do. If they do it in the more limited way we propose we could agree. If they are not prepared to do it in that more limited way, and if the majority in this place wish to do that, then let the Committee do that. We can then get on with our other business and we will have time during the remaining couple of days this week to try to resolve the matter before us.

        These are tidying up amendments. The first one arises from the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill that we passed at the end of last year. I think it is convenient to tackle at this point in the legislative program something that I believe we overlooked in that Bill.

         The No. 5 Bill proposes to move the provision dealing with tax deductibility of political donations from the deduction provisions in section 51 of the Assessment Act to the gift provisions in section 78. We support that, but in preparing for this it has come to our attention that the rule which allows a deduction of up to $100 for donations to political parties is unfair in that it discriminates against those candidates who are not members of a registered political party. I did not intend to overlook that when we debated this matter in December last year.

         What it means is that an independent candidate is at a fundraising disadvantage relative to a candidate from a party contesting the same division. We think that donations to candidates contesting the same election should be treated equally by the tax law. Currently only donations to a registered political party qualify for deductibility. The amendment will remedy this by allowing deductibility for contributions to nominated candidates as well as to registered political parties.

But let me go to the substance and not fiddle around with that. We will come back to the drafting problem later. The Government's fundamental position is that we do not agree with the deduction in the first instance, so we are not of a view that it should be amended. We do not think it should be there at all. One of those quirky little things that happen to legislation when it passes the Senate is that we get add-ons. We do not like it. I have not got much more to say about that at this stage. I may come back to it.

         I have got something to say about the second one. When I read it, the significance of it did not leap off the page immediately. What we are talking about now is that certain organisations have had extended to them a benefit—that people can make tax deductible donations to them—which is at some cost. The rest of Australia is saying that we will subsidise these organisations in the way that we subsidise a lot of other organisations because we consider them worth while. Not only do we want to encourage individuals to contribute but we want to subsidise them to do so. We are now also going to say that those organisations are exempt from income tax, without being able at this stage to say what all those organisations are.

         I do not think the Committee should go down that path. There is a limited range of people who are eligible to receive tax deductible donations and within that group there is a broad range of organisations. I think that, if we were being rigorous about it, we would say that there is more there than should be there and some should be taken out. But let us put that to one side. There are many organisations which everybody would accept are the sorts of organisations which ought to be there if there are going to be tax deductible donations for anybody.

         Suddenly we find one group has been taken out and people are saying that instead of this benefit, which has only recently been extended to some of those organisations, those organisations should get a second round of benefits, whereby their activity would be exempt from income tax. I have not thought this through yet, but some of them conduct commercial activities and run shops. Why on earth should they be able to be income tax exempt to run a shop when a lot of other people are struggling in competition with them? I have not had a lot of time to think about this but it does not seem to me to be an equitable measure. With apologies to an absent colleague, it is like something that seemed like a good idea at the time it was first suggested, but on second thoughts it seems that this is not a course of action that the Committee should take.

         I would like to make a couple of comments to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan). I understand his objection but, if it is taken to its conclusion, it means that where a group of Australians, for example, associate technically to try to protect an endangered animal or to rehabilitate some degraded land then they should not, we believe, be taxed for that community service. That community service should be recognised by the taxation system, and that is what this amendment will effect. We are not seeking to remove the current prohibition on those bodies which are engaged in political or lobbying purposes. We think that, now there is to be a register of environmental organisations which qualify for deductible status, it is time to grant community service status and hence exemption from income tax for those bodies also.

         I have two problems with amendment No. 1. It is a little like the last one; there are drafting problems we can fix easily, but there is a substantial problem. In two seconds I thought of a loophole that opens, even though I understand what Senator Kernot is trying to do, now I have got it in context. It is hard to argue against that until we think about the consequences. I think it needs to be done a little more tightly.

         The section that should be amended is 78(1)(aaa). Section 78(1B) limits to $100 the amounts which can be contributed; section 78(1)(aaa) gives the eligibility. That is easy to do. If Senator Kernot wishes to persist, I am sure the Committee will give leave for that to be moved in that amended form. We do not need to amend section 78(1B) also; the $100 limit will apply to nominated candidates if the amendment to section 78(1)(aaa) proceeds.

         On the face of it, without Senator Kernot having had a chance to think about it, the Labor Party and the Liberal Party will each have 170 candidates at the next election. That simply means that somebody can make a tax deductible donation of $17,000 to all of us because he may send all our candidates $100 each, or he may send the national secretary a cheque for $17,000, saying, `Please distribute this to each of your candidates equally'. That is a $17,000 tax deductible donation to each of the candidates. Maybe Senator Kernot already knew that that was what was involved and that is what she would like, but I do not. I am very unhappy about the $100; I am appalled by the $17,000.

The second reason—just to reiterate—is that the Government does not like the amendment in the first place, but if it does apply to parties and if we can make it apply to candidates not of parties without blowing open the whole thing, then there is some equity in that.

        This amendment deals with the tax deductibility of donations to conservation bodies. The situation which has obtained until now is that a limited number of conservation bodies have had tax deductible status. The Australian Conservation Foundation, the organisation that I know best because I was on its council for 17 years, had a scheme by which donations made to that body could be accompanied by a letter indicating a preference for the direction in which that donation was to be spent. Through that mechanism, tax deductible status was extended, effectively, to other groups, but involving enormous hassles and administrative costs for the Australian Conservation Foundation and the other organisations.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What the Government is seeking to do here is to remove that system of tax deductibility and replace it with a list under which, as I understand it, a much more extensive group of conservation bodies will achieve tax deductible status directly and in their own right. I understand that the conservation bodies are very happy with that arrangement and certainly it will relieve the Australian Conservation Foundation and several of the other major national bodies of that administrative burden of passing donations on where donors indicated a preference.

         I think the notion that there should be a tax deductible status for conservation bodies should be strongly defended, particularly in view of the attacks that have been made on that tax deductibility by some members of the Opposition over a considerable period. I point to the fact that those who would advertise in a promotional way do so to increase the sale of a particular good or service but do it in a way which seeks to change the perception of the person to whom the advertising is directed. Their interest is in changing the perception to include the consumption of the good or service. That sort of advertising attracts tax deductibility.

         The conservation bodies, on the other hand, advertise not because it will provide any direct benefit for them but because they believe that in the public interest it is important to change the public perceptions to a different point of view, and all that the conservation bodies get out of it is their share of what they perceive as the common good. I think, on that philosophical ground, one could more strongly defend the right of conservation bodies to have tax deductibility, rather than promotional advertising by commercial interests. So I do not think the desirability of conservation bodies having tax deductibility can seriously be tackled on philosophical grounds.

         This particular amendment relates to the process of de-listing, once a body has run the gamut of both the Treasurer and the environment Minister.

         These organisations have run that gauntlet. They have been assessed in terms of the eligibility criteria for registration in order to get onto the list. This amendment seeks quite simply to ensure that, in the process of de-listing, they come back before the Parliament because we are aware, and the conservation groups are very much aware, that there are very powerful vested interests in the community which are inimical to the interests of conservation groups and we would not like to see the process of de-listing carried on simply by the two Ministers putting their heads together, under strong pressure to take a particular organisation off the list. It is therefore appropriate that that decision be reviewed by the Parliament and that good reasons be brought forward as to why an organisation, having achieved tax deductible status, should have its name removed from that list.

         While I am on my feet, and to save time, I would like an assurance from the Government on another aspect that is absolutely vital. Under this amending legislation, the existing organisations that have tax deductible status will lose that tax deductible status and this provision will come in in its place. The replacement, of course, is dependent upon the Treasurer and the Minister for the environment as quickly as possible constructing that registered list. I would like an assurance from the Government that when this legislation is passed, as it will be very shortly, the Government will make every effort to ensure that that list is constructed as quickly as possible so that those organisations that attain tax deductible status under this legislation will not be left in limbo and possibly fall through a hole because there is an election to be held before 1 July, when these provisions would come into effect. I would like to receive that assurance from the Government so that the conservation groups can be certain of the circumstances under which they will operate post-July, particularly in view of the fact that before July there must be an election.

         The issue is certainly very important from the perspective of those who are in opposition, but for those who are in government, given the nature and composition of this Senate, it certainly would take away a degree of flexibility in the case of certain organisations becoming misdirected in the process of their activities. For that purpose, at this time I would have some difficulty with the amendment, because we are going through the pros and cons of the issue of disallowable instruments, and the impact they can have, particularly where organisations, as it were, go off the rails.

We do not wish to see an organisation easily discriminated against, but this register is a very significant enhancement of the situation, as Senator Coulter acknowledged, and I do not think we want to go down this particular route. We already have a register in operation for cultural organisations, which does not have this provision. I certainly do not think we should have a one-off for groups we like. I am not casting any aspersions on the Democrats' attitude to cultural organisations. That is a concern others might wish to enjoy raising; I do not intend to.

         —No. I am simply saying there are only two registers, the cultural register and the environmental register, and they should be treated the same. I do not have to administer the register of cultural organisations, but it seems to be working very well. That comment may not be greeted with much enthusiasm by those closer to the firing line, but from a distance it seems to be working well. I am advised that there is quite a turnover: quite frequently a lot of small organisations go out of existence and go off the register. We do not want to be proliferating disallowable instruments in that way with regard to the management of this register.

         At the moment there has to be some recognition in this Parliament and in this community that one sanction is the sanction of public opinion. That is the democratic sanction. If a future government were to discriminate wilfully against an organisation because it did not like its politics, it would have to take the consequences of having made that decision and be subject to the normal democratic constraints that we all face when we make decisions which people oppose.

         So we should not have one rule for people on the environment register and one rule for others. If people want the protection of requiring parliamentary approval to take off, they do not go down the register route; they go down the specific legislative route, and that is cumbersome. I much prefer the register route which we are going down at the moment. Notwithstanding that I accept that the attempt is to protect people against unfair or discriminatory action, I am not persuaded that this is the appropriate way to go about it at this stage. I do not support the amendment.

         But take, for instance, an organisation like the Conservation Council of South Australia, which has been receiving donations through the Australian Conservation Foundation and therefore attracting indirectly a tax deductible status.

         Clearly, Senator McMullan is anticipating a much larger group because he is talking about smaller groups coming and going, dropping off the list and so on. I do not know how many groups the ACF has acted as a tax deductible umbrella for, but it would be at least tens of groups. I should like some assurance with respect to those groups that the register will be constructed quickly so that those groups can go forward into next year with the assurance that post-July they will have that tax deductible status.

It provides a mechanism to enhance the free movement of goods and service providers across State and Territory boundaries with the objective of making this country one national market. Under the framework set up by the Bill, the various States and Territories will recognise each other's regulatory standards with respect to both goods and occupations.

         Agreement was reached at the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference to work towards implementing a scheme of mutual recognition throughout Australia. On 11 May 1992 an agreement was signed by the States and the Commonwealth under which the States requested the Commonwealth to enact legislation to give effect to certain principles of mutual recognition relating to the interstate sale of goods and the carrying on of occupations.

         The agreement notes that the heads of government have agreed to establish a scheme for implementation of mutual recognition principles for goods and occupations for the purpose of promoting the goal of the freedom of movement of goods and service providers in a national market in Australia. It requests and empowers the Commonwealth to pass a single Act which will override any State or Territory Acts that are inconsistent with the mutual recognition principles. The Commonwealth has the power to make this legislation through section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution which provides that the parliament has the power to make laws about matters referred to it by the parliament of any State or States.

         This Bill is the Commonwealth's part of a scheme involving the enactment of complementary legislation by the States and the Commonwealth. The Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister (Mr Free) advised the House of Representatives during the second reading of this Bill that New South Wales had already passed the necessary complementary legislation. It has recently been introduced into the parliaments of Victoria, Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. This scheme has clear support from governments of all political persuasions, which shows that everyone involved recognises the importance of mutual recognition to the Australian economy.

         There are clearly many advantages in removing the artificial barriers which restrict the movement of goods and labour between States. There will be cost savings for producers of goods who will no longer need to modify their products in order to meet different standards in different States; there will be benefits from the enhanced mobility of the labour force; and, ultimately, the advantages for producers and suppliers of goods and services will obviously result in benefits for the consumers of those goods and services in terms of increased choice and lower cost.

We commend it and trust that mutual recognition will eventually be extended beyond goods and occupations to other parts of the Australian economy.

         —We are debating the Mutual Recognition Bill 1992. It introduces a concept adopted by all State and Territory governments of Australia. It promotes the uniformity of standards for goods and occupations across all States and Territories of Australia. The Bill introduces two principles. First, as it applies to goods, it means that goods that can be sold lawfully in one State or Territory may be sold freely in any other State or Territory, even though they may not comply with all the details of regulatory standards in the second State or Territory. As an extension of this principle, it also means that goods manufactured or produced overseas which comply with the standards in the importing State are able to be sold in all other States or Territories.

         This is a very important piece of legislation and it marks a major change to our present system. The benefits are that uniform standards across Australia become possible.

         Adoption of the principle arose from meetings between the Premiers and the former Prime Minister over the last two years. The heads of agreement between the Commonwealth and the States was signed on 11 May this year and a legislative program was proposed for the State legislation to be enacted by 31 October this year and the Commonwealth legislation by January 1993.

         By passing this Bill, the Commonwealth is meeting its deadline, but as yet all States have not passed the necessary legislation. Mutual recognition has not received a lot of public exposure or discussion. It does mean that a lot of State areas of responsibility are transferred. Many State representatives have concerns about how it will eventually affect some of their State activities.

         To this end, it must be remembered that Australia is a big country and many State standards are geared towards special State conditions. Sometimes regulations cannot be applied uniformly across a State due to the great diversity of working and living conditions found in Australia. It is hoped that mutual recognition will never lead to ridiculously high and costly standards being imposed on businesses and operations where, for example, they may be required in densely populated areas of Australia but not in the remote areas.

         As part of the cooperative federalism and because the States have agreed to this major step on behalf of State organisations and individuals, all State governments have an obligation to ensure that the purpose of mutual recognition is achieved. States must ensure that standards are not lowered to the detriment of industries and, ultimately, Australia. Our high quality and standard of produce in agriculture and manufacturing are the reasons for our great success on export markets. There is a fear that the standard of the lowest common denominator State may become the standard for goods or occupations. Such an outcome must be guarded against and acted upon by the States.

There is a need to ensure that the Australian standard which is eventually adopted and which sets a uniform national standard is the most advantageous standard for Australian industry and its consumers.

         Unless a proper national standard is set at the States' insistence in practical terms, it means that the national standard could become the standard of the State or Territory that has the lowest standard. A real danger lies here with imported goods. Under mutual recognition, any imported good that meets the standard of the first State it is imported into is able to be sold everywhere else in Australia.

         However, in some industries where some goods, particularly agricultural goods, are not produced, some States do not have relevant standards. This is where the States must ensure that a national standard is adopted that maintains the high standards of the existing Australian industry. For example, Australia has a dried fruit industry of the highest standard, which in turn guarantees its high international standard on world markets. But because this industry only exists in some States, only those States have strict industry regulations. This is a case where a national standard must be reached between the States. I believe steps have been taken by some States to have a national standard applied. As it now stands, the non-producing States allow a window of opportunity for the importation of substandard produce under mutual recognition.

         For example, in relation to the Queensland egg industry, which has traditionally organised itself on the basis of a State industry, time will be needed to restructure to gain the most for the industry from changes.

Mutual recognition for goods and occupations comes in with the support of all State and Territory governments. However, in supporting this Bill, I urge all State and Territory governments to meet the State responsibility in endorsing this principle and ensure that their industries and people grow and prosper from the move and that no unintended damage or consequence follows.

Senator Boswell has supplemented that with a slight Queensland gloss, but otherwise with his usual perspicacity. It is a good example of cooperative federalism at work in the national interest. Honourable senators have said that the aim of mutual recognition is to remove artificial barriers to interstate trade in goods and services and to remove the artificial barriers to the mobility of labour caused by regulatory differences amongst the States. We have had many decades of experience in trying to work with regulatory barriers of that kind, and this legislation will go a long way to improving that situation immensely.

        —The coalition supports the Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill 1992. The primary reason for the Bill is to set up a subsidiary of the Pipeline Authority to operate the Authority's commercial sectors. During the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the Opposition moved an amendment that received the agreement of the Government. I understand that it is incorporated in the legislation we are debating today. The amendment ensures that the Government will privatise the Pipeline Authority—or that nothing will be done to prevent the sale or disposal of a pipeline.

        Growth in the natural gas industry over the last 20 years has led to its present position as the third source of primary energy after coal and petroleum in Australia. Australia has abundant proven gas reserves. The 1991-92 annual report of the Authority noted that the projected demand requirements show that the current ratio of proven reserves to annual consumption exceeds 80 years. However, exploring for and proving up gas reserves is still very much a demand driven activity. The main feature of the reform package of this legislation is to provide for the creation of a subsidiary of the Pipeline Authority to undertake those operations that are based on a commercial rate of return.

        The Commonwealth's only direct hands-on role in natural gas operations is through the TPA, an independent statutory authority. Existing contracts with the Australian Gas Light Company restrict the Pipeline Authority to a cost recovery non-commercial basis of operating the gas line from Moomba in South Australia to Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney. This gas pipeline system passed about 70 per cent of the total energy consumed by New South Wales.

        Every time an amendment to the Pipeline Authority Act comes up, I cannot help but recall its origins. This was part of what could only be termed a very loony plan by the mentor of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the late R.F.X. Connor, Minister for Minerals and Energy in the Whitlam Government. Topically, it also had links to some degree with the ill-fated Khemlani loans scandal. The plan by Mr Connor, as honourable senators might recall, was to criss-cross Australia with government operated pipelines and use Arab oil money to buy out the rotten multinationals involved in the mining industry. It was typical Labor pie in the sky stuff, and now we see the Labor Government positioning itself to sell the flag bearer of that previous Labor Government.

        It is also interesting to note the comments at the time by the now Prime Minister, Mr Keating. It was the grand plan, as I said, to criss-cross Australia with pipelines. I think it is worth referring to a few of Mr Keating's remarks. He pointed out in the House of Representatives that the first stage was to be laid from Gidgealpa to Sydney, 780 miles, and that, taking into account all the laterals, eventually there would be 5,500 miles of natural gas pipelines. He equated it to the great Snowy Mountains Authority and so on. He then went on to say, and I think this is a comment worth repeating:

       The grand plan, as I mentioned, was to criss-cross Australia and there was also talk at the time about a further pipeline from Palm Valley to Kalgoorlie and an additional spur line from Sydney to Brisbane. It is interesting to see the reason given for the spur line to Kalgoorlie. The remark was made by the then Minister that the reason for that was that Western Australia was short of natural resources, particularly gas. In the light of recent discoveries and what is happening on the North West Shelf, it just shows you how foolish people in this field can be to make those sorts of predictions and be found out in subsequent years to be so wrong.

        To achieve this grand plan there was to be nationalisation of the plan by the East Australian Pipeline Corporation to acquire what it had already planned in building the pipeline from Gidgealpa. Eastern Australian Pipeline was a subsidiary of AGL. I think it is ironic that the great supporter of the grand plan was the current Prime Minister, who is now presiding over the sale of the pipeline.

        The Opposition supports the Bill, which was successfully amended in the other place, as I have indicated earlier. A sale of the pipeline is unlikely to occur before 1993-94 but it is essential that the Authority operate in the most efficient manner leading up to the sale. The proposed legislative reforms would see the Pipeline Authority set up a subsidiary and operate in accordance with the government business enterprise accountability guidelines. In the past the Pipeline Authority has been constrained by its Act and its contracts with AGL in the types of activities that it can undertake and the profitability of those activities, particularly in the haulage of gas on the main Moomba to Sydney pipeline. The new subsidiary would have wider functions than the Pipeline Authority, including the provision of consultancy and transmission support services relating to pipeline construction, design and operation in Australia and overseas.

        The coalition regrets that the Government did not take advantage of the opportunity it could have availed itself of a couple of years ago in order to proceed to the privatisation of the pipeline. It is coalition policy to privatise the Pipeline Authority in the first year of achieving government. The Government tried to set aside some commercial contracts that we regarded as having been entered into on an arm's length basis, and sought to change those commercial contracts in midstream. The situation has now been rectified and it would appear, based on decisions that have been handed down in the courts, that the Australian Gas Light Co. may well have had a first right of refusal on the sale of the Pipeline Authority and its assets.

        The coalition is of the view that, historically, individuals and companies run enterprises better than governments. Further, if the privatisation process is to achieve the objectives we set out, it is important that employees of any organisation or enterprise that is to be privatised as a part of that process are part of workplace agreements that might arise; also, that they are part of the future ownership of any enterprise that is privatised.

        —The Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act was passed in 1976 and came into operation in 1978. It was originally intended to provide a simple and cheap method of incorporation for Aboriginal organisations at a time when State legislation varied widely between the States. This method of incorporation has proved popular, with over 1,600 organisations being incorporated under this legislation. Once incorporated, many organisations seek funding through ATSIC. They are then subject to regulation by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. In recent times it has become apparent that the powers of the Registrar to ensure minimal accountability of the organisations are limited.

        The Aboriginal Councils and Associations Amendment Bill proposes 13 amendments to improve procedures of organisations, increase accountability and make organisations' financial affairs open and transparent. First, the amendments specify how general meetings of the association, including annual general meetings, are to be called, and the procedures of the conduct of those meetings, including provisions for proxy votes. Second, they disqualify persons who have been found guilty of fraud or dishonesty from being a member of the governing committee. Third, they set a time limit for the preparation and lodgment of financial returns to make them available to members and to ensure that the auditor is independent of the association. Fourth, the amendments set time limits for holding annual general meetings. Fifth, they ensure that there is compliance with the rules of the association. Sixth, they ensure that members of the governing committee act honestly and disclose any conflicts of interest. Seventh, they allow the Registrar to arbitrate in disputes. Eighth, they empower the Registrar to direct persons to produce any books or records. Ninth, the amendments give the Registrar power to convene meetings where requested or where the committee has resigned. Tenth, they empower the Registrar to appoint an administrator in certain circumstances. Eleventh, they clarify the role and functions of auditors. Twelfth, they introduce simple, straightforward procedures and remedies in relation to inspections and investigations. Thirteenth and lastly, the amendments increase the minimum number of people for registration of an organisation from five to 25.

        All these amendments are wholly consistent with the direction the coalition proposes to take in its ATSIC Green Paper; they are not controversial in nature at all. For example, we strongly support No. 13, which increases from five to 25 the number of people for registration. As we understand it, a lot of the existing organisations incorporated under the Act are in fact non-functioning. A recent audit by the registrar of all the organisations that have been incorporated since 1978 has found that something like 400 so far are completely non-functioning, and that inspection is continuing. Although they are non-functioning, they are still registered.

        It seems that there could be some merit in looking to move organisations across from this system into the jurisdiction of the Australian Securities Commission. ATSIC has considered this recently but opinion was divided. On balance, ATSIC members have felt at this stage that they wanted to have organisations incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act, which is fine; but in the longer term there would seem to be some merit if we could adequately grandfather existing organisations so that they would be able to transfer across with minimal inconvenience. It would probably be a much better thing to have Aboriginal organisations incorporated under the ASC so that appropriate measures could be taken in those situations where the interests of members needed to be protected from people who perhaps were using them to their own advantage.

        In support of that preference for organisations to be incorporated under the ASC, the coalition in government would initiate discussions with ATSIC as to the most appropriate mechanism and timing of such a move, if in fact the coalition was capable of getting agreement with ATSIC on this matter. The coalition supports the Bill.

        —As Senator Baume told us, the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act was originally introduced in 1976 in an attempt to provide greater simplicity and flexibility for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups, and today we are looking at it with respect to incorporation. We believe simplicity is important in order to ensure that the administrative and financial burden is not too great, and flexibility is vital to ensure that the needs of a wide variety of community organisations are met. It is important that those twin aims are maintained and, if possible, enhanced. The Democrats are satisfied that this legislation does that and, accordingly, we will be supporting this Bill.

        Since the legislation was first enacted it has become apparent that some aspects of it are less than adequate in enabling the effective functioning of associations. Consequently, we acknowledge the need for amendments clarifying and strengthening the rights of members of associations and ensuring open and adequate accountability to the communities they operate within and on behalf of. Democrats recognise the need to ensure that the opportunity for reform which is presented by this Bill is taken. There are more changes yet which we believe will need to occur, but the amendments contained in this Bill will at least get things moving in the right direction.

        In relation to this point, I have been given undertakings by the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, that there will be a further review of the principal Act in 1993. On that basis I believe it will be appropriate to consider further fine tuning at that time, rather than in the atmosphere that prevails at this time of the year. So while I have a couple of minor concerns with a couple of the amendments, I think it is important that the improvements and the clarifications contained in this legislation are introduced as soon as possible.

        A particular concern I have—I have written to the Minister about this and I hope it will be considered as part of a further examination of the operating of this Act—is about the powers of delegation which have been conferred on the registrar. As was noted by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the registrars are to be given the power to delegate their responsibilities to any person. This power may be too broad. Perhaps consideration should be given to narrowing it, but I acknowledge the difficulty that may occur in this regard because the registrar deals with associations from a range of areas, including geographically remote areas, and it may be difficult to define a specific category of person who should be entitled to receive this delegated authority because of this reality.

       I refer to the Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No 16 of 1992 (11 November 1992) and to the letter from the Secretary of your Committee dated 12 November 1992 concerning the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Amendment Bill 1992 ("the Bill").

       Delegation of power to `a person'
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I agree that as a general proposition there should be appropriate limits placed on powers of delegation of statutory powers. I note the Committee's comment about remoteness being a consideration when the delegation provision was first made. However the remoteness of the locations in which the powers need to be exercised is, in the context of the Bill, now a more compelling consideration than was the case when the original delegation was passed. This is because the Registrar's powers in relation to organisations, many of which are in remote locations, have been considerably enhanced. These enhanced powers include investigation, inspection and arbitration.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Committee is correct in assuming that I have some idea of the persons to whom the power is likely to be delegated. I would expect that, where possible, government employees, employees of statutory bodies (for example Land Councils) and professional people would be delegates. Again, however, because of the remoteness of many organisations I do not think it is practicable to identify all of the classes of persons who may be delegates. For example, a delegation might be given to a respected Aboriginal community leader who possessed greater intimacy with local issues than a Canberra based Registrar. Any delegation would be a single purpose delegation, limited in scope and for a specific duration.

       Reversal of the onus of proof
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       At the outset I should explain that the policy objective of clause 5 of the bill is to make it more likely that the financial reporting provisions are complied with so that the executives of the organisations are more accountable for the manner in which they handle finances.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       In light of the need of that policy objective to make each member of the Council or the Governing Committee responsible for the accounts, records and financial statements of the Council or Committee respectively, it was necessary to provide a defence for the member who was not involved in the business of the body at the relevant time, for instance through absence from the country or illness in hospital.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Further, the provisions relate to financial obligations of the bodies concerned and the liability imposed is likened to the responsibility of partners for the debts and financial obligations of the partnership. In this case this kind of obligation is imposed by statute and it is therefore necessary to provide a statutory defence for the `innocent' member in order to rebut the presumption created. The matters which would go to proof of the defence, on the balance of probabilities, are matters which will be peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant as well as being difficult and costly for the prosecution to negative beyond reasonable doubt. The reversed onus is in my view therefore justified in this case. I understand that this approach is consistent with the principles normally applied by the Senate Committee.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       There are a number of precedents for this kind of defence in other areas where financial obligations are imposed. I refer the Committee to sections 165 and 166 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and subsections 11A(5) and 11B(6) of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Finally I draw the Committee's attention to the relatively low level of penalty attaching to these offences, the regulatory nature of the obligations created and the fact that the defences provide an excuse for what might otherwise be a situation of strict liability made necessary by the policy objective I have referred to above.

       Whilst more high profile measures such as the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation are important, so too are measures such as those that this legislation is trying to achieve. The number of associations incorporated under this Act has grown substantially. The review of the Act is overdue. Fortunately, it has become more widely accepted and acknowledged that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be allowed and enabled to determine the way in which they want their cultural, lifestyle and other community needs addressed in the way which they feel is most appropriate. It is recognised that in any field where agencies and associations exist that are controlled by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, such agencies should receive preference in allocation of the funds which are intended for the benefit of indigenous communities.

        The provision of funding naturally brings with it responsibilities on the part of the recipients adequately to account for the appropriate expenditure of those funds. It is one of those myths that has a lot of currency in Australian society, and one that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is seeking to turn around, that somehow or other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have mountains of money thrown at them which they can spend in any way they wish. The reality is radically different. In fact, indigenous organisations have to provide greater accountability for their funding than any other recipients of government funding in this country. The amount of funding provided is clearly insufficient to deal with many of the very real manifestations of disadvantage with which we are all too familiar.

        This Bill will increase the requirements of Aboriginal councils and associations to account for public funds which are provided to them, and it will increase the ability of the registrars of such councils and associations to ensure that this occurs. Changes have been made to the principal Act to introduce simple procedures for inspecting and investigating organisations and to clarify the registrars' powers. These changes will also make it easier for members of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander communities to address any problems that may arise in any association, whether the problems arise from accidents, other unforeseen difficulties, or malpractice. The Australian Democrats believe that these changes should increase the confidence of the broader community and, more importantly, should increase the confidence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities that their local associations are more able to meet their needs.

        The Aboriginal Councils and Associations Amendment Bill is a major contribution towards achieving greater accountability for the funds spent through Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. The Bill is particularly important at this time when new funding provided by the Government of $400m over five years, in response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, is being distributed in large part through Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. The amendments are necessary to help ensure the effective expenditure of these funds. In that context, I believe they will be welcomed by the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. I thank the members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for their support of the legislation.

As the Minister is aware, the coalition has indicated its support, in principle, for an Australian Defence Force contribution to the Somali tragedy. Bearing in mind that the decision to deploy forces overseas is presumably always taken with great care, would the Minister advise the Senate what exactly will be the task of the Australian force? In his press conference mention was made that it may have a responsibility for disarming the armed factions. If that is to be the case, when is that decision to be made and who will be making it?

         Senator Hill has asked what I think is the crucial question in Operation Restore Hope that has not been finally resolved; that is, will that coalition involve itself in the active disarming of the factions? That is a matter that is being discussed in the United Nations at the moment. There have been discussions with the principal participant in this exercise—the United States—and it is a matter that has exercised the minds of the Prime Minister, Senator Evans, myself and no doubt many other people in this Parliament.

         Our general attitude is that if UNOSOMSOM, the group that follows Operation Restore Hope, is to be successful, some attempt must be made to disarm the warring factions. That does not necessarily imply that people will be rounded up and arms ripped out of their hands. Quite clearly, the warring factions in Somalia are tending to go and hide and bury their weapons. Much of the effort may be put into discovering where those weapons are buried and the destruction thereof. That is an issue that is not finally resolved. I express the view of the Australian Government that to make UNOSOM, the group that follows Operation Restore Hope, work it must be an issue that is given the highest priority for consideration. Australia, being a participant now, will be actively involved in that consideration.

         Senator Hill also raised the very valid question of threat. Our advice is that if the role of Operation Restore Hope is to fall short of disarming, the risk assessment would be medium to high. If, however, Operation Restore Hope goes to the active disarming of the factions, the risk factor would be high to very high. It is one of the reasons why the Australian Government has given thought to committing a battalion rather than a company. It is far more self-supporting and far more capable of defence than a single company would be in these circumstances. It is our evaluation that a battalion is the  minimum contribution we can make if we are going to be active in these circumstances in a peace enforcement exercise.

It broke judicial precedence and, in effect, dismissed the judges of the workers compensation bench. As well, it reduced the entitlement to Victorian workers, and it did that retrospectively. That is to say, under this legislation people who were enjoying an entitlement at law had that entitlement removed retrospectively.

         There were a number of other things, too, that occurred. The definition of `entitlement' was altered so that workers who had previously been entitled now are no longer entitled, despite the nature of their injury and its work-related cause. In addition, a new concept of so-called notional earnings has been introduced to reduce the benefits that would be applicable to workers under workers compensation.

         Let me deal with the tightening of the definition of `compensable injury'. Previously, a worker had to show that the employment had contributed in some way to the injury. Now, the legislation requires that the employment had to be a `significant' factor. The legal difference between `some way' contributed and that the work now is a `significant' factor in contributing means that a whole group of workers who would have been entitled to workers compensation because they suffered accidents while travelling to and from work, because of disease arising at their place of employment, or because of stress imposed on them, are no longer entitled to workers compensation. In addition to that, the notional earnings concept means that an employee will be deemed to have been at a certain stage of recovery and is able notionally to earn some sort of income. That notional amount will be deducted from the employee's workers compensation payment, whether the employee is earning that income or not, thus reducing workers with injuries to penury.

         Importantly, this legislation will push people on to the Australian social security framework. If they are off workers compensation, are unable to claim benefits under workers compensation, and have no income, they become beneficiaries under the social security scheme of the Commonwealth. So, Victoria is subsidising itself by pushing workers out of compensation entitlement and making the taxpayers of Australia pay for a scheme that Victorian employers should fund for workers compensation.

It has done so by increasing the safety protection in the workplace, ensuring a higher safety level, and by providing case work monitoring by Comcare Australia in order to get workers back to work in a way harmonious with their recovery from injury.

Senator Short referred to the `ridiculous' 4 per cent forecast in the One Nation statement.

         As far as the first part of Senator Short's question is concerned, when the joint economic forecasting group reports to the Treasurer, as I believe it will shortly, it will not say anything, I am sure, about One Nation and the forecast in One Nation. It will not say anything about revised forecasts. It will not even say anything about Fightback, because it will be a responsible forecasting document, a best effort by a forecasting group.

         When this Government came to power, there were serious doubts about the future of the shipbuilding industry. There was no reason for confidence. As I said, the figure for shipbuilding this year is around $450m, with exports accounting for more than 80 per cent of that. Today Australia has a sizeable share—about 10 per cent—of the world market in ferries and luxury yachts, with very good prospects in naval and police patrol craft and fishing vessels.

         As to the Government's role, the ship bounty has been of critical importance. So has support from the Export Finance Insurance Corporation and other Government programs.

As a result of Government policy, in June 1992 there were 13 shipyards sharing that bounty money, and exporting nearly $450m worth of exports.

         Less hearteningly, I think we are all deeply concerned by recent reports that we have seen speculating on a possible expansion of conflict into the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Certainly, the Australian Government welcomes the adoption on 11 December of UN Security Council resolution 795, which unanimously approved the Secretary-General's proposal for an 800-strong deployment of UNPROFOR personnel to be located on the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia along its borders with Albania and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).

         This force will have an essentially preventive mandate of monitoring and reporting any developments in the border areas which could undermine confidence and stability in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia or threaten its territory. That deployment will comprise a 700-member infantry battalion, 35 military observers, 26 civilian police monitors and a small civil affairs and administrative component. As the Secretary-General has said, this is the first example of preventive peacekeeping deployment as outlined in his `Agenda for Peace' recently published in the UN General Assembly.

         I am pleased to see the UN taking action in this way to prevent possible conflict. This is an occasion of a number of precedents being set. The Somalian enforcement exercise is the first time chapter VII of the UN Charter has been used in that way in a humanitarian exercise. This is the first time we have seen a preventive deployment of UN personnel. Both, I believe, would be regarded by the international community generally. and certainly in this country, as entirely appropriate roles for the UN to be playing in the post-Cold War environment.

         We also recognise that movement of unemployed persons to areas with few job chances is not really a long term answer to both the problems of unemployment and their standard of living, even in the short term. Nevertheless, taking into account the report and these changes of recent months, the Minister is of the view that it is important that the provisions operate fairly. Consequently, the two departments involved in the administration of the policy, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training, will examine these provisions and will report to the Government on them—I think the due date for report is early April next year—with a view to seeing whether, in view of the changes in the market and in the numbers of those affected, the rule may be reviewed.

I know from personal experience that it is often unachievable for reasons that have nothing whatever to do with human involvement. The Minister has provided me with the following answer to the question. The approach proposed by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency in its discussion paper is perfectly reasonable and is not a recommendation which would allow a serious decline in water quality. The recommendation is merely recognising a simple truth: water in some of our rivers, even under natural conditions, is not always drinkable.

         It would be pointless to have a goal which is unachievable in natural circumstances—which, of course, never stops the Democrats. During flood conditions, water quality will be temporarily reduced because of high turbidity and high levels of nutrients from run-off from farmlands and urban settlements. In periods of low flow, some of our rivers will have increased levels of salinity, even when their catchments have not been disturbed.

         It is also worth noting scientific evidence that suggests that blue-green algal blooms, which occur in our rivers under certain circumstances, occurred prior to European settlement. During such blooms, river water is undrinkable. It is, however, a reasonable expectation that in periods of average or above average flow these rivers would not contain contaminants that make them unfit for drinking. The Government is working hard, through the development of the national water quality management strategy, to put in place measures which are deliverable and which will ensure an improvement in water quality. As to the second part of the question, there will be nothing substandard about the environmental statement, as will be clear on Monday.

In broad terms, the provision of time off for union activity in the Australian Public Service is applicable where safety matters are concerned, to deal with questions of occupational health and safety, and where, broadly, a grievance can be presented, dealt with and dispatched. If the question is about that sort of time off, as I understand the regulations, that is a tolerable exercise of the proper interface between management and unions in managing the Public Service.

As a consequence of that, it anticipates saving some $10m.

The organisation is intact and will remain intact. Management consultants have been brought into it and have restructured it. Workers have had restructured arrangements, restructured awards.

         —The question of the marketing of breast milk substitutes is important even in the Australian community, let alone in developing countries, which seemed to be the burden of Senator Crowley's question. Certainly within Australia the message that is put out by most mothercraft and other nurses is to the effect that breast feeding is the best feeding—

         —`Breast is best', I think was the expression used by Senators Herron and West by way of interjection. I believe that the provision of adequate information relating to breast milk substitutes is very important, as is appropriate marketing, so that women are not put under undue pressure to substitute milk formulas for the natural process. There will, of course, be occasions when that is indicated and is the proper and right thing to do, and in that situation it is important that the importers and suppliers of infant milk formulas do their marketing in a way which conveys correct information and does not turn into a high pressure exercise.

Australia has seized the opportunity to show the world that ethical marketing of infant formula is possible, to the benefit of families everywhere, whether breast fed or bottle fed. I believe a most important aspect of the new agreement has been the setting up of a panel to monitor and advise the Government on its operation and the general marketing of infant formulas. The panel is chaired by Professor Kerin O'Dea, Chair of Human Nutrition at Deakin University. The suppliers are represented by Mr Michael Sharpe, the Managing Director of Sharpe Laboratories. I do not know whether Senator Coates is here, but I note that, importantly, the community representative is Ms Ros Escott, who is a counsellor with the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia and has been very prominent in this particular field.

         I believe that what Australia is doing has significance worldwide. It is being looked at worldwide. It is also important, as Senator Crowley indicated, that we take steps to ensure that particularly Pacific island states, which have less well developed consumer protection mechanisms, have the benefit of a similar approach and a cooperative arrangement with the manufacturers and suppliers of breast milk substitutes to ensure that those people, in their own cultures, do not have their ordinary breast feeding practices subverted by high pressure publicity.

        The size and structure of the workforce in Australia has changed significantly during the past decade. Between 1982-83 and 1989-90 the workforce increased in size by 20.5 per cent. A feature of this growth was the increase in female employment opportunities; in June 1990, females accounted for 41.3 per cent of total employment compared with 37.4 per cent in June 1983. The Government, of course, closely monitors developments in employment composition, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly undertakes detailed surveys of the labour force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The trend towards greatly expanded female employment opportunities reflects a variety of economic and social factors. These include, for example, changing social attitudes to married women joining the workplace, increased female participation in further education (enhancing employment prospects), more opportunities for part-time employment and the increased availability of child care services.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The honourable Senator has suggested that financial compensation be provided to persons who desire to leave the workforce for socially constructive alternatives. The Government believes that financial assistance to families and individuals should continue to be directed on the basis of economic need and not as an inducement to individuals to leave the workforce. The Government has in place a range of policies that directly assist families, including Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement and assistance for child care. Families also benefit from more general policies, such as health and housing.

        For the benefit of Senator Cook, who may reply, I suspect that would mean that the workers would be liable for Commonwealth benefits and, presumably, they would meet the normal tests. I would be interested to hear Senator Cook's remarks on that, since he was rather concerned that such an occurrence may happen under the Victorian scheme. The article continues:

        The South Australian Government had to deal with a similar problem which emerged in Victoria as a result of a poorly designed workers compensation scheme. Senator Cook will be interested to note that under the South Australian changes the concept of being compensated for pain and suffering has been abolished, but not in Victoria where the maximum claim allowed under the maims table is $50,000.

         Two States—one Labor, one Liberal—are seeking to reform the workers compensation scheme, dealing with a very difficult problem which emerged as a result of Labor Government policies during the 1980s. One State has moved in a particular direction, and it appears—at least according to Geoff Easdown; I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments—that South Australia, in many respects, has brought down a scheme which could be described, in the language that Senator Cook would like to use, as being even tougher.

         Secondly, while it is true—and we are proud of it—that the South Australian Government is a Labor Government, it may have escaped Senator Kemp's notice that there has been an ongoing industrial campaign in South Australia over changes to the workers compensation Act because the upper House in South Australia, the Legislative Council, was taking a view about changes that it wanted to impose on the South Australian Government to modify the provisions within the South Australian workers compensation Act.

         What came out as legislation was an unhappy compromise between the blocking powers of the upper chamber over the lower chamber where the South Australian Government is formed and where the legislation was first promoted. So it is not fair then to say that this is a comparison with the policies of a Labor government when the government is in office as a government but not in power in both Houses of the Parliament. It is the outcome of the use of the review powers of the South Australian Legislative Council, which is a different thing.

         If we take a logical view of this matter—I know that is not the long suit of Senator Kemp—nothing that has been said here answers the primary position that I put in answer to my question. It is not logical to say that I am wrong because someone else did it. We have not done it. The Commonwealth has reduced the cost of workers compensation by 25 per cent to Australian taxpayers for Commonwealth employees, without reducing the benefits to the employees, by running an intelligent approach to workers compensation. The debate about workers compensation always misses this fundamental point: the first concern is accident prevention and safety to lower the accident rate.

         The second concern is proper and swift medical attention to repair the accident or damage caused to, or the disease that has been afflicting, the individual. The third responsibility is to ensure proper compensation without loss of wages. The fourth responsibility is to provide a rapid road to rehabilitation for an injured worker. Our scheme concentrates on all of those criteria, not simply on the amount of compensation.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fault of many of the State workers compensation schemes is that they are a gift to the legal community and to the insurance companies. Whenever the cost to employers of compensation premiums rises, the benefits are reduced to keep the costs under control. But no rein is put on the huge legal fees taken out of the system by lawyers or on the rapacious profits of insurance companies taken out of the system. I can sympathise with many employers having to pay the premiums they do, and not seeing them in the pockets of their workers when there is an accident, because the snouts in the trough are those of the legal profession and the insurance companies.

        Senator Archer asked Senator Button a question about the conflict of interest that has emerged from the revelation in the corrected annual accounts of the Brown and Hatton Group—that is the piggery group half-owned by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)—which show that there is a contingent liability totalling $4m to the company of Mr John Brown, the former Minister for Tourism.

         Mr Keating has an equity of $4.2m in this piggery group which has the debt to Mr John Brown. In the 1990 unaudited accounts of Mr Keating's piggery group, the debt was shown as an asset of goodwill of $4.5m, which was offset by the debt of $4.5m due to Mr Brown's company. But in the so-called corrected group accounts filed on 26 November 1992, this debt was converted into shareholders' funds instead of liabilities. It boosted shareholders' funds in Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd to $7.5m and provided, along with an incredible $4m revaluation of buildings, the great bulk of the $8.4m of equity shown in the holding company, Euphron, in which Mr Keating actually holds a half-interest through his family company.

         The clear implications are that there is great pressure on the Prime Minister to bring about the deal with Danpork, which is the only way Mr Brown can get his loot. Clearly, we have a situation where the success of Mr Keating's multimillion dollar pig joint venture with the Danish company, Danpork, will have a massive impact on his company's capacity to pay the $4m to Mr Brown.

         What concerns anyone, I suppose, who has any understanding of the potential for conflict of interest is that there are many government approvals, some of which it is claimed have already been received, that the Danpork venture requires in order to succeed. There are many governmental departments and agencies involved one way or another with the joint venture, and there are many unanswered questions, as Senator O'Chee, for example, has put forward. Clearly, the potential for conflict of interest is a serious one. It seems unfortunate that in his answer to Senator Archer, Senator Button totally ignored that potential for conflict of interest and, as with all matters, simply poured personal abuse on the Opposition for asking the question.

More particularly, as Senator Baume said, to be a success this project needs numerous government approvals. Certainly, at the time at which it was originally proposed, the project needed numerous government approvals. We all know that the original, and perhaps still existing, secret proposal is to import genetic material from Denmark. This is something which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) claimed was never proposed. From the information available as a result of recent hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, we now find that that was the intention way back in 1990.

         On top of that, we have a fax from our Austrade official in Copenhagen dated 22 November 1990 in which he says that he has had a discussion with Mr Hansen of the Federation of Danish Industries, who has just come back from Australia. Mr Hansen told him that all of the outstanding technical matters, principally quarantine ones, had been resolved. Yet AQIS says that this matter was never raised with it. That is the seriousness of the case. The introduction and the acceptance of genetic material from Denmark, where Aujesky's disease and mystery swine disease are rampant, would pose a very serious health threat to the Australian pig herd.

        I rise today to raise this issue purely because of the human aspect involved with regard to Defence Force personnel who have either taken a redundancy package in the past six months or may be contemplating one in the near future. It is well known that most of those people, at the time of making their decision to take a package, were unaware that upon taking it they would not be able to apply for positions in the Australian Public Service which could be won on merit in competition with anybody else in Australia.

         In my question today, I referred to the fact that a legal opinion was obtained from Mr Michael Finnane, QC, which the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) described as very impressive, that the Public Service Commissioner acted outside his authority in applying this policy to members of the Australian Defence Force in restricting them access to jobs in the Australian Public Service. I raise this purely because the commissioner has now advised each department in writing that the enforcement of this policy is in fact at its own discretion and that the commissioner has no power to enforce it.

         The major point I raise is that, if the Public Service Commissioner has confirmed that the enforcement of those guidelines is at the discretion of the Department of Defence, the Department can, without consultation with the Department of Industrial Relations, use that discretion and decide today, if it wants to, to take on redundant Australian Defence Force personnel. I do not believe that the matter needs to go to Cabinet, as the Minister said, and it does not need to be referred to the Department of Industrial Relations because the Public Service Commissioner quite publicly stated that it is at each department's own discretion to enforce the guidelines.

         I raise this particular issue because there are personnel in the defence forces who are considering redundancy packages. That decision is a very difficult decision to make in some cases and the decisions may depend entirely on the financial considerations that those personnel know they might have to face in the future or the opportunity that they might have to gain employment in the Australian Public Service.

       <para first-indent="16">

         A lot of people in the defence forces have been considering these options for a long time and they need to know one way or the other exactly what their situation will be so they can make those decisions with some sort of confidence, rather than waiting for a decision to be made, at some time in the future, by the Department of Defence, Cabinet or in consultation with the Department of Industrial Relations.

         Again, in light of the opinion of Mr Finnane, QC, I would call on the Minister, in consultation with his Department, to instruct the Public Service that it could accept applications from redundant ADF personnel as a result of the current Army and Air Force redundancy programs; and that ADF personnel, who have won positions on merit with the Department of Defence and allied agencies since the commissioner's decision has become known, immediately be considered for employment in the same position or similar positions. Those people are going through unjust hardships at present, wondering just what their future situation will be. I believe that unfair financial duress has been placed on those people because they made their decisions without any knowledge of the restrictions that were to be placed on them then or might be placed on them in the future.

         On 10 December 1990, the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, suggested that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration review the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. On 12 December 1990, the Committee resolved to review the jurisdiction, performance, resources and legislation of the Commonwealth Ombudsman.

         The Committee received 74 submissions from individuals, organisations and Commonwealth Departments and authorities. It took oral evidence from 61 witnesses over 6 hearing days in May, June, August and September 1991. The Committee presented its Report to the President of the Senate on 20 January 1992 and the Report was tabled in the Senate on 25 February 1992.

         Before dealing with the Committee's recommendations, the Government would like to express its thanks to the Committee for its efforts in producing this very useful report. The Government endorses the Committee's view that, over more than 15 years of operation, the Ombudsman has made a positive contribution to Australian public administration. The Committee's recommendations, directed to maintaining and strengthening that contribution, underscore its conclusion that in resolving individual complaints, the office of Ombudsman is performing an important function in its own right.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Over its period of operation, the office of Ombudsman has become a central element in administrative review and in public administration generally. It has compelled administrators to take a second look at the way their actions can impact on the members of the public with whom they come into contact. The Committee's recommendations are directed at producing a stronger and more focused Office, which will continue to deal promptly and effectively with large numbers of complaints from the public. The Government notes particularly the valuable contribution by the Ombudsman at a more general level that has arisen out of the investigation of individual complaints when administrative practices or legislation which may have operated unfairly or capriciously have been changed to the benefit of the public at large.

         At the time of tabling this Report, the Government was aware that the position of Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman was about to become vacant, due to the appointment of the present Ombudsman, Mr Alan Cameron, as Chairperson of the Australian Securities Commission from 1 January 1993. The Government takes this opportunity to thank Mr Cameron for his contribution to public administration, especially in relation to the management of the Office. The response refers to initiatives that Mr Cameron proposed to implement in the Office. While it may be expected that these initiatives could be the subject of review by the new Ombudsman, the Government would see no reason why implementation of them should not proceed.

          Recommendation 1
         </emphasis>
         was that on the next occasion the office of Ombudsman is vacant, the Government seek candidates of merit from fields other than law as well as lawyers. There is no question that legal skills are relevant to the Office of the Ombudsman and, in fact, all Commonwealth Ombudsmen have had legal qualifications. That said, other skills are also relevant, and it is most important that any person appointed as Ombudsman be able to carry out the high level administrative and managerial functions of the position. As noted above, the position of Ombudsman is soon to become vacant. The advertisement calling for applications for appointment seeks "a person of integrity and standing in the community. He or she should be currently engaged in management or administration at a high level, in either the government or non-government sector". This approach does not discriminate against non-lawyers. On this occasion and in future, the Government will make it clear, when applications are sought, that responses from both lawyers and non-lawyers with appropriate management or administration experience will be welcomed.

         be amended to require the Government to respond to reports made to Parliament under section 17 of the Act within 3 months of tabling. The Government accepts that a response should be made within 3 months but does not consider legislation would be required. In circumstances where a section 17 report is referred to a Parliamentary Committee for consideration, the Government considers it would be appropriate to await any report from the Committee before responding. In such a case, the 3 month limit could apply from the making of the Committee report.

         An important power of the Ombudsman is the power to recommend a remedy for the consequences of defective administration, including financial recompense. Where the responsible agency has no legal liability to make such recompense, it may be made by way of an act of grace payment under section 34A of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Audit Act 1901
         </emphasis>
         . In early 1989, the Minister for Finance authorised Secretaries of Departments to approve act of grace payments where the Ombudsman had recommended payment and the Department of Finance had been consulted. A trial of this devolved arrangement was carried out in 1989 and 1990, although devolution continued after the trial was completed. The trial was being evaluated at the time of the Committee's inquiry and the Committee recommended (
         <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
          recommendation 3
         </emphasis>
         ) that, should devolution continue, it should be made subject to a limit of $5,000 (or $1,000 per year for continuing payments) and to a reporting requirement. The proposed amounts are one-tenth of the maximum amount which the Audit Act permits to be paid as an act of grace payment without reference to a statutory committee.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government notes that the Committee was of the view that unless the final evaluation of the trial can point to a real risk of undesirable precedents or significant inequity, it would have to conclude that the devolution should continue.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government accepts the thrust of the Committee's views: authority for remedying the consequences of defective administration should, in principle, reside with the heads of agencies and departments responsible for the defect. Similarly, heads of agencies should expect to be called to account not only for the matter giving rise to the proposal for a remedy but also for the remedy itself. The Government questions, however, whether devolution of the Minister for Finance's unique, statutory, act of grace power is the most appropriate way to achieve this: the power may be devolved to agency heads over whom the Minister has no legal authority, yet it is the Minister who remains ultimately accountable for its exercise.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Accordingly, the Government is considering an alternative solution to establish a non-statutory scheme under which agencies could determine the payment of compensation to persons who have suffered financial detriment as a result of maladministration at the agencies' hands, with provision to make payments for that purpose being included, as required, in the agency's or department's annual appropriations. Devolution of the act of grace power will continue until any new system is implemented.

          Recommendation 4

         was that the Ombudsman should have jurisdiction to deal with complaints from persons and organisations claiming to have been misrepresented on ABC programs. The Government is of the view that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in relation to administrative matters already includes jurisdiction to deal with complaints about misrepresentation. The Government has, however, noted the longstanding dispute between the ABC and the Ombudsman about the extent of the latter's jurisdiction with respect to programming matters and agrees that the problem needs to be resolved.

The Government considers that this should provide an adequate forum for persons who consider that they have been misrepresented by either broadcaster. The Ombudsman will retain jurisdiction over activities relating to matters of administration including those arising in the preparation and broadcast of ABC and SBS programs, except where the subject matter of the complaint comes within the jurisdiction of the ABA.

          Recommendation 5
         </emphasis>
         was that government companies and other bodies be placed within jurisdiction of the Ombudsman unless specifically excluded. The current position is that a government body is within jurisdiction if it is established under an Act. However, a government company is not included unless specifically referred to in a schedule to the Regulations made under the Ombudsman Act. A body which is within jurisdiction can cease to be so simply by becoming a government company unless included in the schedule. The Committee was apparently concerned that the structure of many Commonwealth bodies has changed over the years without explicit consideration being given to whether the actions of the restructured body should remain subject to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. The Committee focused particularly on Government Business Enterprises.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government agrees that it is necessary for the Act to contain a mechanism which would facilitate the making and execution of decisions about whether particular bodies should be within or outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. In deciding to introduce amendments to achieve this, the Government does not intend that bodies presently excluded from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction will be included or that bodies presently included will be excluded. Nor does the Government depart from its general view that Government Business Enterprises operating in a competitive environment should not be subject to constraints not applying to their private sector competitors. The Government notes that the Administrative Review Council (ARC) is to report in the near future on the application of administrative law to Government Business Enterprises.

          Recommendation 6
         </emphasis>
         arose from the fact that the Ombudsman Regulations were out of date and, for example, did not refer to bodies by their current titles and included some bodies which no longer existed. The recommendation was that the schedules to the Regulations specifying bodies included and excluded from jurisdiction should be reviewed. The Government amended the Ombudsman Regulations in December 1991 to take account of the changes that had occurred up to that time. It will make further amendments as required to give effect to this recommendation and to ensure that the Regulations remain current.

         be amended to enable classes of administrative action, specifically commercial actions, to be taken out of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. While recognising and accepting (as did the Committee) that some commercial activities should not be subject to Ombudsman review, the Government believes that adoption of this recommendation could increase the prospect of disputes about jurisdiction between the Ombudsman and Government bodies, a result which could threaten the Ombudsman's overall effectiveness. As noted in relation to recommendation 5, the ARC is to report soon on the application of administrative law to Government Business Enterprises. The Ombudsman has exercised his discretion and decided not to investigate complaints about commercial policy decisions in the past and there is no suggestion he would commence doing so in the future. The Government has decided, however, to introduce legislation to make explicit the Ombudsman's discretion not to investigate complaints about activities of this kind.

         was that the jurisdiction currently with the Merit Protection and Review Agency to investigate employment-related grievances be transferred to the Ombudsman. partly as a means of extending the coverage of the grievance mechanism to Commonwealth employees who do not have access to the MPRA under the present arrangements. The Government does not consider that it is appropriate to make the change proposed by the Committee. Removal of an important function from the Agency would reduce its size and field of operations to a point where its continued status as an important element in public sector management and industrial relations could be jeopardised. Instead, recognising the lack of a distinct border between the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and that of the Agency, the Government will introduce legislation to facilitate the transfer of casework between the two bodies.

Should the Ombudsman be dissatisfied with the response of a Parliamentary Department to a report under section 15 of the Ombudsman Act, he will be able, in recognition of the special position of the Parliamentary Departments, to report directly to the relevant House or Houses of Parliament rather than to the Prime Minister, and then to Parliament.

It is the Government's intention that it not be directly involved in the selection of the TIO. The decision to extend ombudsman-type coverage into the operations of private sector companies was made in the light of the introduction of competition in telecommunications. The scheme accordingly, should reflect the commercial nature of the industry and cater for the commercial manner in which the participants (all the telecommunications carriers and other service providers which decide to participate on a voluntary basis) wish to deal with customer complaints.

As an ex officio member of the Administrative Review Council, the Ombudsman participates in considering appropriate mechanisms for administrative review. While the Council is primarily concerned with external review of administrative decisions, it has recognised the value of internal complaint handling as a first step in resolving individual grievances.

It will be necessary to complete this task and to have the new computer system record sufficient relevant information, before embarking on the formal evaluation program recommended by the Committee. The Ombudsman intends, once those steps are completed, to establish a formal performance evaluation system. The Government notes that the Ombudsman's Office is committed to evaluations of its complaint management system, promotional activities and the specialist investigation unit.

         was that the Government propose and support an increase in the Ombudsman's funding to enable him to carry out the functions proposed by the Committee. As indicated in relation to recommendation 16, the Government has agreed to provide the Ombudsman with $470,000 for the purchase of a new information technology system, with a further $53,000 per annum for ongoing costs associated with the management of the system. The Government has also agreed (see response to recommendation 17) to an increase in annual funding of $335,000 to enable the establishment of a specialist investigation unit. This unit will have the additional role, anticipated in the Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, of investigating complaints by Aboriginals against the Australian Federal Police which relate to death or serious injury in custody. The Government has also agreed to funding to assist the Ombudsman in conducting a survey of public awareness of his office and a modest promotional campaign (see response to recommendation 20). These increases in the resources of the Ombudsman's Office are a practical demonstration of the Government's support for the Ombudsman institution.

The Government considers the issue relates more to the preparation of Cabinet submissions than to coordination comments and will therefore take steps to amend the relevant part of the Cabinet Handbook so as to remind those preparing submissions for consideration by Cabinet of the need to consider possible impacts of proposed initiatives on the Ombudsman and to consult with the Ombudsman's Office in this regard.

         was that the Ombudsman, in consultation with relevant executive agencies, should seek to establish a system of secondment of a limited number of public servants to investigation duties in the Ombudsman's office and that the Government consider the desirability of requiring the agencies subject to the largest number of complaints to fund those secondments. The Government supports this concept, noting that the bodies which attract most complaints are mostly large enough to forego a relatively small proportion of their resources.

         The establishment of a system of secondments, and the nature of that system is, however, a matter for the Ombudsman.

Over recent months, several agencies have expressed a willingness to second staff to the Ombudsman's Office and a number of secondments and exchanges have taken place.

It has agreed to make some minor adjustments to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and legislation and has approved a modest increase in his Office's resources. The fact that so few substantial changes to legislation have been needed after 15 years is an endorsement of the soundness of the policy underlying the creation of the Office. It emphasises the remarkable level of acceptance of the role of the Ombudsman by the community and by the bureaucracy. It is a reflection of the contribution of the present Ombudsman and his predecessors to fair and open decision-making in the Commonwealth sector.

          The response is late as far as the timing promised by the Government for responses to committee reports is concerned, but it is in some ways a convenient time because the Committee has arranged to have a public hearing tomorrow with the Ombudsman in order to discuss his latest annual report. It will also provide an opportunity to discuss with him this Government response and to seek his views about the way in which the Government proposes to deal with some of those recommendations. It is very important that the valuable work of the Ombudsman be fully supported and continue in an acceptable way.

          One recommendation was that the Act be amended to require the Government to respond to reports made to parliament under section 17 of the Act within three months of tabling. The Committee thought it important that there be that obligation. The Government has accepted that a response should be made within three months, but it does not consider that legislation would be required to give it effect. I still think it would have been preferable to amend the Act to require that, but in any case the Government has indicated that it will respond within three months to any such report. Section 17 reports are relatively rare and, hopefully, it will continue to be a rare occurrence that there is a need for such a report.

The Government is considering a completely alternative solution to establish a non-statutory scheme under which agencies could determine the payment of compensation to persons who have suffered financial detriment as a result of maladministration at the agency's hands. The sting is that that would be effected within the department's annual appropriations, so that the agency or department would have to find the funds. That is an interesting alternative way of providing compensation payments that the act of grace system has provided until now.

There is proposed to be an amendment to facilitate the making and execution of decisions about whether particular bodies should be within or outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, but not intending that the bodies presently excluded would be included or that the bodies presently included would be excluded. I particularly disagree with the point that the Government does not depart from its general view that government business enterprises operating in a competitive environment should not be subject to constraints not applying to their private sector competitors. I still take the view that if a body is a government body it should be subject to the Ombudsman, as with other government requirements, even if it is competing in the market place.

It is important to ensure that, as well as the Executive departments in matters of straight administration, the parliamentary departments are also included in the Ombudsman's area of responsibility.

I urge the Opposition to support the proposal that it be dealt with by the committees of both Houses together. I know that they have some reservations about such procedures, but I think it is important that the Ombudsman be seen to have a relationship with both Houses, not just with the Senate.

         I welcome the Government's agreement to this recommendation. However, on a sadder note, I would like to point out that it is now December 1992. In the Budget of 1990-91, the Government decided to repeal section 265 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The cancellation of that section, had it taken place, would have removed the ability of taxpayers to seek relief for small claims in times of hardship and to place their problems before the Taxation Relief Board. It is very important that we have a mechanism that will provide a facility for taxpayers who are in financial distress for a number of reasons to get relief in genuine circumstances.

          However, since that time, the Government has not been able to come up with an alternative as to how it should replace the Taxation Hardship Board. I believe it is time that the Government admitted that it made a mistake in the 1990-91 Budget with its decision to repeal section 265 and, consequently, the Hardship Relief Board mechanism. It has worked well and it has helped hundreds of taxpayers. It is interesting to note that as soon as this Budget decision was announced in 1990, a media release from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, stated:

        <para>
         This chamber is still awaiting the announcement of the new flexible arrangements. In fact, nothing has been heard from the Government about these new arrangements—and fortunately so. But it is of interest to note that in May of this year, during questions in Senate Estimates Committee A, officials from the Australian Taxation Office reaffirmed the use of the Taxation Relief Board should a taxpayer find himself or herself in extreme financial hardship. In fact, it has been business as usual since the Parliamentary Secretary released his media release soon after the Budget.

          The Taxation Relief Board should continue and should not be replaced. I agree that the Ombudsman could provide the same sort of service so long as there is additional resources with specialist facilities locked into that operation, but why change a system that is meeting a need? This board helps the everyday little Australian. Since 1936 thousands of Australian taxpayers in circumstances of great need have benefited through the board, which gives them an independent avenue of appeal.

          The board, with membership comprising the Commissioner of Taxation, the Secretary to the Department of Finance and the Comptroller-General of Customs—or their nominees—was able to assist people who often, through no fault of their own, had not been able to pay tax in certain situations. A good example, of course, is the death of a spouse. In such a case, a tax liability could be waived or eased. The average assistance, taking into account the amount paid and the number of taxpayers asking for assistance, is usually less than $2,000 per person.

          Further, this board has objectivity and independence which it may not have under any new yet to be announced administrative arrangements. When one considers the economic problems of the 1990s, the decision to repeal section 265 of the Act was drastic. This situation has not changed; indeed it has worsened. There is now an even greater need for this board. This is evidenced by the fact that the Government has not yet found a replacement. In 1990 the only reason that the Government could give for the abolition of the Taxation Hardship Board—or the Taxation Relief Board, as it is otherwise known—was that the board was up to 18 months behind in its assessment of hardship cases. I believe that a better plan of action could be to streamline the board, rather than to try something new.

          Therefore, although I welcome the Government's response to the need to increase the Ombudsman's sources, should he need to provide the hardship services, I believe that the best course of action is to continue and increase the services of the Taxation Hardship Board. The Government needs to admit that it was mistaken in announcing the repeal of section 265 two years ago. I believe that this board provides a useful service. I hope that it will continue to provide such relief in genuine necessitating circumstances. I thank the Senate.

         One of the interesting elements of this Treasury statement on tax expenditures is that it reveals the collapse of private sector contribution to film production under this Government as a result of a combination of the recession we had to have and the Government's changed tax laws. Only in 1987-88, the Government was, in fact, providing tax relief totalling $131m as an incentive for the private sector to contribute to the production of films. This year, 1991-92, this document reveals that that relief has fallen to only $43m—less than a third.

          This fall reflects, I believe, one of the major problems that the film industry is facing. It is facing a dramatic collapse in private sector contributions. As a result, it depends more and more heavily on Government grants, leading to the potential for bureaucratic decision making about what should be made. I am glad to say that
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Strictly Ballroom
          </emphasis>
          —perhaps the greatest success we have had in recent times in the film industry—was prompted, I think, by private sector support totalling about $1m.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the other hand, I cannot say that bureaucratic intervention has been massively to anyone's disadvantage, at least not to the industry's disadvantage, to the extent that I think that
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Romper Stomper
          </emphasis>
          required support from governmental film people—including the Victorians. It required bureaucratic support and of course is getting strong reviews, if some occasional critical comments about the violent nature of the film.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          But the essential point is this: because of the tax benefit involved, $43m of tax relief generates something like $108m worth of funds to the industry. I understand that, in 1992-93, that figure will be much less than it has been in recent years. As I said, last year the benefit fell by two-thirds from the level in 1987-88, when the Government changed its policy.

          It is clear that we should do what we can to increase incentives to the private sector to invest in the Australian film industry. It is a marvellous industry with magnificent potential. What we are doing by going about it the way the Government is presently going about it is to reduce private sector investment. Here we have a brilliant opportunity, with
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Strictly Ballroom
          </emphasis>
          , for example, having excited an interest in Australian films to, if you like, provide a situation where ordinary investors, mums and dads who have some savings could, if there were a reasonable instrument and if there were reasonable tax incentives, participate in this industry with a small investment.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Unfortunately, under this Government, there is basically no such opportunity. There is no capacity for the ordinary Australian families to invest, say, $1,000 in a movie that they would like to support, a movie of their choice, largely because of the incredible bureaucracy, particularly in relation to prospectuses, which has developed.

          We have a disastrous situation where the Government will continue to reduce the grants to the film industry while at the same time the amount going in incentives for the private sector to invest is also being slashed. The Film Finance Corporation has revealed that, after $68m in government grants last year, the amount will fall to $61.9m this year, $57m the year after, $54m the year after and $50m the year after that.

          The coalition will provide clear, specific and supportive tax and bureaucratic structures to enable the ordinary Australian to participate in support for the Australian film industry. That is the dramatic difference between the Government's policy—of which one might say that the Australian film industry is doing well in spite of it—and the sort of policy that the coalition has, which will encourage private sector participation in order to maximise the benefit that government funds will get by encouraging private sector funds. For every $100 of government tax benefit, $250 will go to the industry.

          —I rise to speak on this very important document published by the Treasury for 1992. It is an annual summary, published every year, to provide to the Parliament the annual cost to revenue of various concessions given within the taxation system in Australia. It actually indicates in monetary terms the annual cost to the taxpayer and the community of giving various tax concessions, deductions and rebates—a range of tax breaks, if you like—to various groups in the community. I believe it is very important that there should be transparency in the tax system; that taxpayers should be able to see readily the total, based on certain assumptions, of what it actually costs each year to give tax rebates and concessions to particular groups in the community.

          One of the differences between this Government and the previous Liberal Government is that the Liberal Government had a policy of proliferating tax concessions and tax breaks to specific interest groups in the community. It did not tend to look at the tax system as a whole. Rather it tended to address problems in the community by giving concessions for this, that and the other. The net effect of that was to erode the Australian tax base and to weaken the capacity of the system to generate revenue. Of course, taxes are a vitally important ingredient in developed industrialised societies. It is taxes that in fact pay for the very valuable services provided in the modern community, and the level of taxation is very much an indicator of how wealthy a society is.

          It is interesting that in recent years these tax expenditures have totalled, from memory, $3,000m per annum. In other words, the figure in recent years has been $3 billion per annum. It is a very large sum. That is the kind of revenue that has been forgone in recent years as a result of a range of concessions given within the tax system.

          A very large item that has contributed to that large total figure, certainly during the 1980s, was the non-taxation of the surpluses of the superannuation funds, which are very large institutions in Australia. The non-taxation of the surpluses of those institutions compared with the surpluses of other financial organisations has meant that there has been a large tax subsidy to that particular industry in Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">

          Other rebates and concessions also contribute to the annual total of tax expenditures. They include such things as the dependent spouse rebate where one spouse is working and the other is not. There are other rebates on the Australian tax form which provide assistance for specific groups, and they add to the total revenue loss documented by this type of report.

          It is a very significant document. It is vital in a democracy such as Australia that the real or effective tax rates—the tax rates as they impact on people and on businesses in the community—coincide fairly closely with the published or stated tax rates. After all, when we go to vote in elections most of us can only really make judgments about the tax system based on the published rates, the rates that are seen in the tax schedules. But, of course, the more rebates, concessions, tax breaks and tax lurks there are in the system the more those published tax rates are not the effective rates; the effective rates are in fact somewhat lower. So it is important that this annual document is published to indicate the scale of the loss of revenue to the nation through giving a range of tax rebates and tax concessions in the system.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The size of that annual figure gives some idea of the difference between effective rates and the actual published rates on tax forms facing businesses and individuals. Over the years, the Labor Government has taken the view that it is more important to get down the general rates of taxation in the community—getting the schedule rates down rather than giving specific tax concessions in the form of rebates and deductions to particular interest groups, which I think has characterised previous Liberal governments, which have tended to focus on problems in the community by throwing tax lurks at them and providing tax concessions. We take the view that it is more important to benefit all taxpayers by lowering general tax rates on the tax forms.

          The runs are on the board. When we came into office the lowest marginal tax rate on the income tax form was 30c in the dollar. It is now around 20c in the dollar. At the top end of the income scale, in 1983 the marginal tax rate was 60c in the dollar; it is now of the order of 47c. They are very real tax reductions. It is more important to lower general tax rates than to give a range of concessions and rebates.

         The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority is charged with a duty to supervise and manage the transformation of the industry as it becomes necessary to install technical and administrative changes to the barrier controls that affect the TCF industries. The report gives a picture of the import and export balance, which is anything but encouraging. Consumer demand for textile, clothing and footwear products improved during 1992 by almost 4 per cent. However, when we look at the disparity between imports and exports, the picture is not good. In 1991-92 imports increased by nearly 12 per cent to $3.5 billion. Exports rose from a low base by over 14 per cent to reach a mere $418m for the year.

          When considering that report it is relevant to look at some of the evidence that was provided by manufacturers representing the industry before the Committee on Industry, Science and Technology when it was considering the Customs tariffs package. I refer in particular to Mr Trumble's evidence. Mr Trumble is the president of the TCF Council. On the first page of the

         That in part is the answer to the comments of Senator Button, the responsible Minister, when he says that he cannot see that tariff reductions have actually resulted in loss of jobs. How else does he explain the loss of jobs? How else does he explain the increase in imports?  Mr Trumble says further:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The majority of our industry holds no forward orders for the winter of 1993. Therefore, I suggest that our projection of 55,000 people left employed in the industry after March of 1993 is probably highly optimistic.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is less than half the number of people who were employed in the industry only a few years ago. I have looked in vain in the report to find a comment by the Authority on this trend; on this reduction in output by the Australian TCF industry and the resulting loss of jobs coinciding with the current recession. I suggest that the Authority should address itself to this question and should recommend to the Minister that there be, at this stage of the current recession, a pause in tariff cuts to enable the industry to have a breather, to regroup, and to concentrate on those parts of the industry which are able to increase export activities, so that we retain at least part of the TCF industry which forms a substantial part of our manufacturing industry in Australia.

         This is a very timely report as a committee of this Senate, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, has been inquiring into the cost of justice. Clearly, legal aid has a very important function to fulfil in providing access to people who otherwise would not have been able to access the legal system.

          I note that the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee has consulted with a number of legal organisations, such as the Victorian Bar Council, lawyers' organisations in New South Wales, Queensland and others, looking at various aspects of the matters concerning legal aid. It has discussed legal aid funding difficulties in Victoria. I wonder whether it also discussed on that occasion the interest on solicitors' trust accounts which is one of the major sources of legal aid funds in Victoria.

          I wish to put on the record once again my view that the interest on solicitors' trust accounts should be devoted almost entirely to the provision of legal aid funds, that lawyers should fund their activities—such as education, conferences, overseas travel, publication of their journals—from other sources, and should not take funds which rightly belong to the public. After all, the interest on trust funds is not theirs; it results from the funds that people have placed in their trust accounts.

          I note that the report addresses legal expenses insurance and if that becomes a major practice in Australia it should free up funds for legal aid. The report also looks at contingency legal aid funding schemes. Once again, we should be grateful if that is increased under some sort of control. I would favour court approval before contingency fees are permitted.

          I also note that there is a substantial section in the report on the use of paralegals in legal aid activities and also, generally, in the legal profession. Apart from the other barriers that have been noted in this report, we need to make sure that the legal profession opens up its ranks a little and does not place barriers in the way of people who are not fully qualified but who can obviously provide worthwhile legal services.

          There is an interesting statement in the report that the use of interpreters in legal aid service delivery is likely to be affected adversely since the budget of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has not provided for increases in demand.

          One other matter to which the report refers is the provision of legal advice to asylum seekers. We are all aware of the people, mainly from Cambodia, who are currently in detention in WA. I believe the authors of the report are to be congratulated for their request to the Government that we should provide legal advice to these people and that we should not accept the Department's view that a differential standard should be applied. People who are not Australian citizens, but who nevertheless appear before Australian courts, should receive proper legal advice so that their interests can be protected. The view is also contrary to the international conventions that we have signed and ratified on behalf of the Government. It is a very important international legal rights area. I conclude by referring to the fact that the Committee has had contact with the Fitzroy Legal Service.

         I wish to make a few comments on the 1991-92 annual report of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The AWRC took over the $2.7 billion debt, a 4.6 million bale stockpile, the warehouses and other properties held by the former Australian Wool Corporation. The debt has now been reduced by about $412m and the stockpile has been reduced by about 530,000 bales. Of course, that is still hanging over the top of the market all the time and until those stocks are got rid of it will be a matter of concern to the woolgrowers. This will require improved economic conditions and a lot of promotion on the part of the Commission to make sure the wool is dispersed in the community. In the last little while, the economic prospects have deteriorated and that is of grave concern to woolgrowers.

          Yesterday in the debate about the rural adjustment scheme we heard about the problems of the people in the wool growing industry. It is well worth letting people in this chamber know that the objectives of the Wool Realisation Commission are to manage and sell the stockpile, to manage the sales to the extent possible to avoid unduly depressing wool prices, and to create conditions conducive to developing efficient private marketing and selling systems. That is what the Commission has primarily addressed itself to in its first year.

        I refer to the special event that was held in this Parliament last year: the first National Wool Day to stimulate community interest in wool in the national economy. That event gave the Australian Wool Corporation a chance to generate public support. It also helped disseminate information, which was widely reported in the rural press, although it was basically not taken up by the metropolitan media.

          Over the last few weeks I have brought to the attention of the Senate some of the problems facing research in this country. There has been the bungled funding arrangements of the National Health and Medical Research Council where it was assumed that it would get a $3m rise in funding—it actually got a $1m cut. This occurred because the superannuation guarantee levy, which was supported by the Australian Democrats, has taken $1m out of the research budget of the National Health and Medical Research Council.

          This funding problem for the NHMRC has meant that many promising young researchers will be left without local funding and 100 jobs will be lost. The lack of funding by this Government is also evidenced by the fact that 19 per cent of applicants for the Australian Research Council grants were the only ones that were successful. This fact led to the Executive Director of the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies commenting that government support for research in this country was so low that to talk of a clever country was a joke.

         —The Liberal and National parties have concerns about the changes in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1992 to certain of the existing royalty arrangements. Those concerns are shared by the Australian Democrats. A number of other senators would be concerned about the potential loss of jobs as a result of these provisions. The new provisions apply unfairly to existing equipment leases with non-residents. The tax will result in severe financial distress to some taxpayers and will place the employment of many personnel at risk. Australian residents will often carry the tax under the proposal because it is common for royalty agreements to pass the burden for such taxes to the Australian taxpayer.

         The effective rate of tax is up to 43 per cent under current Australian Taxation Office grossing out rules. The amendments incorrectly assume that all large profits are derived on equipment leases which currently escape Australian tax. The impact of the amendments on business unemployment has been ignored. It will be catastrophic in respect of a number of enterprises. Despite claims to the contrary, the amendments are inconsistent with overseas practice on equipment leasing. The amendments are also inconsistent with the move to self-assessment.

         The amendments are effectively retrospective, as they apply to leases entered into or substantially negotiated at the time of the amendments. This is our major cause of complaint. There was no consultation with the equipment leasing industry. I propose that some reasonable transitional or grandfathering provisions be introduced. It is common practice that, when such significant changes to taxation are made—and remember, this is much more than a simple change of rates—transitional provisions should reasonably apply. I deplore the complete absence of transitional provisions in this legislation and the potential effect that their absence could have on employment, the loss of some high tech industry within Australia and possibly the loss of oil rigs operating off the Australian coast.

         Therefore, I intend to place an amendment before the Committee proposing that the traditional transitional provisions apply to contracts entered into up to 5 November 1992, being the date the Bill was passed by the House of Representatives. I recommend this date to the Committee because of a general lack of knowledge in the industry about the amendments. They were not mentioned as such in the Budget Speech. There were no press releases or the like. Because of the significant lead-up time involved in negotiating agreements—many, if not all, of which I believe would have commenced pre-Budget—the lack of consultation and the severe impact that the changes will have on some businesses affected by these changes, I think it is unreasonable, given the general terms of the words used in the Budget announcement, to expect those people affected by such leases to have seen the wider ramifications of this legislation as it affects equipment leases. Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition, I move:

         —The Opposition's amendment represents a considered intervention to protect a wholly Australian owned company employing 175 Australians caught up in the new definition of `equivalent leases'. If the Opposition had not moved this amendment, the Australian Democrats would have done so. I think it is necessary. It is a go-between—between asking the Government to provide transitional arrangements and cutting off these people in their prime, so to speak. This is a wholly Australian owned South Australian company that is expanding and contributing significantly to Australia's economy. Senator Watson's amendment on behalf of the Opposition, moving the date to 5 November 1992, is also worthy of support by the Government.

Now it finds that, having taken the risk, it has been caught.

No-one wants to see any company not succeed. If we are going to say to any company we are concerned about,`Okay, we can fix your problem; you can run your business without paying tax', they will all succeed. The Opposition is saying here, firstly, `Here is a little tip for your tax avoidance trick. We think it was smart so we are going to let you keep doing it'. Secondly, it is saying, `We are not only going to let you get away with it, but we are going to let you get away with it with regard to contracts which you entered into after we announced that we were going to close the loophole'. That has never happened before. The company concerned is saying, `We are a less competent company than any other company that has ever had tax avoidance measures closed in the past'.

They seem to me to be the two fundamental questions at issue. I cannot see how either of them are arguable. In a moment I will come to a third thing that has been drawn to my attention about the terms of the amendment. There are two issues in question. I have had many debates with Senator Watson and Senator Kernot in the past—we have not always agreed—and I cannot understand how those two informed and concerned citizens can argue that we do not have two facts clear in this case. The first is that this is clear and unequivocal tax avoidance. There is no commercial reason to route these things through Jersey. I am not saying that they were breaking the law or that they should be clapped in irons. They just used a tax loophole and we are closing it. I do not think that is arguable. I do not even think they would argue it. They might, but privately they would not.

         At the Committee hearing I listened with interest to some of the concerns that a company raised. I wanted to see whether in some way account might be able to be taken of contracts with a continuing effect that were entered into before the Budget or contracts in respect of which an offer had been made and a response was awaited before the Budget was presented. There were at least arguable grounds for contending that these people were disadvantaged peculiarly by the circumstances in which they found themselves.

         I do not find that a very attractive argument. I have not been dealing with tax legislation all that long, but I cannot recall a previous instance where this sympathetic hearing was extended to people when a loophole which they had been exploiting was closed off. I will not be unequivocal and say that there has never been such an occasion. I have never heard of such an occasion; there has not been one in the last three years. Those are the two key elements. Notwithstanding our concern about individuals and individual companies, we have to run the tax system with a bit of rigour and guts.

         Before I pursue any further the last concern which has been drawn to my attention, I would want the opportunity to look at it more closely. The concern was expressed that the amendment leaves open the possibility of the further extension of the contracts we are grandfathering; that it does not have an end point—that is clear and unequivocal; and that if people extend the contracts which we grandfather, the loophole may continue to be available for those continuing contracts. Honourable senators might gather the impression that the Government is pretty firmly opposed to this amendment. If so, they are right.

         My colleague Senator Kernot referred to one particular South Australian company. I wish to put before the Committee that these sorts of equipment lease arrangements will affect not one but many companies in this area. What this Government has suddenly done in respect of existing contracts is retrospectively change the tax base. It might be one thing to put up the rate of tax, but there are not many businesses which can carry the costs resulting from a completely changed tax base and the introduction of a withholding provision with a gross up of 43 per cent.

         If those opposite want to be strident about this matter, I must say that, in the event of these businesses closing down, the loss of jobs will certainly be on their heads. Let the South Australian Premier be very clear about that. I am not so certain about some of the other contracts. But certainly, the one Senator Kernot referred to would be in a very marginal position. The company concerned has been operating for something like three years. It is introducing high technology—the sorts of things we should be doing—and operates on the basis of complying with existing law and having contracts examined and approved by the Tax Office.

         In some cases an exemption is granted, depending on the nature of the business concerned. Therefore, what we are really doing is retrospectively changing the law. I acknowledge that there would be a tax advantage, a tax minimisation arrangement. We do not mind its being closed. But we believe that contracts that are in place have to be honoured under the old law. I seek the Committee's support in respect of those contracts.

I want to put on the record that, despite what Senator McMullan just said, the Australian Democrats do support anti-avoidance measures. In Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6), one of the issues we did not have time to canvass properly was the issue of limited partnership and the concern about the possible impact of this legislation on the rapidly developing private infrastructure sector.

         Limited partnerships are important vehicles used increasingly by the private sector, providing infrastructure hitherto provided by the public sector. This issue was discussed at length at Friday's Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration hearing. A related matter concerning the effect that this matter would have on the risk capital market was also raised. The special example used by a witness, Dr Dwyer, was the detrimental effect that the proposal to tax limited partnerships would have on the commercialisation of Australian research and technology. I think this is regrettable. We all know how hard it is for genuine entrepreneurs to raise risk capital in Australia. To the extent that this measure will impact on that vital economic activity, we think we should do all we can to avoid that.

         —We have a number of concerns about the Health Insurance (Quality Assurance Confidentiality) Amendment Bill. Our major concern relates to proposed new section 106N. The Government's intransigence in relation to this section defies belief. Originally, this section sought to empower the Minister to authorise disclosure of information about any conduct that may be a serious offence punishable by imprisonment for a period of more than one year. The section allowed the Minister to authorise disclosure of information for the purposes of law enforcement, a royal commission or other purposes described by regulation.

         In the past two months, the Government has been told, literally by all and sundry, that this ministerial discretion has the potential to undermine the objects of this legislation. My colleague Senator Herron put most ably, from the point of view of not only a senator but also a practitioner in the field as a surgeon, what he saw were the problems that this legislation would bring to the area of quality assurance. On 31 October, the Federal Council of the Australian Medical Association reiterated its commitment to the principles of quality assurance, but emphasised that:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . quality assurance programs can only be successful if all the information furnished to quality assurance committees is assured of absolute privilege.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequently, the Federal Council of the AMA moved to reject section 106N, which allows the Minister to withdraw retrospectively such privilege. On 29 November, the Council of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners resolved that section 106N may impair the purpose of the Act. In explanation, the President of the RACGP stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . Council is of the opinion that total immunity of information granted under the Act is essential for the purpose of the Act. Quality assurance mechanisms are designed to allow the most comprehensive enquiry to improve the performance of health professionals. Practitioners need to be able to explore issues thoroughly. They need to speculate and to express opinions and suspicions. When this involves people (identifiable practitioners or cases), this exploratory examination can be seriously impeded if there is a possibility of use of the material in litigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Director of the Australian Hospital Association has written to me, stating that he believes that the presence or application of section 106N would seriously undermine quality assurance activities. He states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Quality assurance largely relies on the voluntary disclosure of clinical information by doctors. There can only be frank disclosure and discussion where both the committee members and the attending practitioner are assured of the confidentiality of the proceedings.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a letter to the Chair of the Professional Indemnity Review Committee of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Executive Officer of the Quality Assurance Network, Dr Moss Cass, also expresses doubt at the wisdom of including ministerial discretion in the Bill. Dr Cass states that, if section 106N is not removed, he will be interested to see how the discretionary power can be used without destroying the process. He states that he does not believe that this discretion can be retained, be effective and not lead to the quality assurance process being defective. He asks:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Who will ever want to participate in the quality assurance process when a possible outcome is that, as a participant, one could be dealt with in a punitive fashion, and might have to have to undertake legal proceedings at great cost—financial and in time—to seek to defend oneself; or could be required to appear in court by someone else seeking to defend themselves and clear their name under the appeal mechanism?
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Cass also provided a copy of a letter from the Department of Anaesthesia at the Christchurch School of Medicine in New Zealand, which shows how the Anaesthetic Mortality Assessment Committee—and this is a national peer review process—had, according to it, become virtually inoperable as a result of information obtained by the committee being provided for a police investigation. Here we have a perfect example of the very concern we are expressing. Interestingly, in a letter to Mr Howe, expressing concern about the maintenance of section 106N, the President of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The College and its Fellows would in no way condone the concealment of offences against the law by an individual. Even the more hazy inclusion of "written and unwritten" would not be reason for exculpation. However there are many avenues available for the redress of medical negligence, culpability and misadventure. They are in no way vitiated by the restraint which should surround the voluntary, peer-reviewed and innocently proffered information coming from the Quality Assurance process. I earnestly and urgently request that you exert influence to ensure complete and inviolable confidentiality surrounding that process.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not coming from one section; it is coming from a broad range of areas. Because of my concern about the retrospectivity aspect of the Bill, I referred that part of the Bill to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Despite the fact that it had already considered this Bill, its members very graciously said that they would look at it again. I appreciate the attention that they have given to it. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Committee accepts Senator Patterson's point about the retrospective aspect of the proposed new section's operation, the Committee notes that the `serious offences' referred to would have had to have been serious offences at the time that they were committed and that, in that respect, the provision could not be considered to be retrospectively making unlawful—

        and they have underlined the `un'—

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        be able to be prosecuted because of the confidentiality provisions contained in the Bill. However, in making this comment, the Committee seeks the Minister's advice as to whether there is currently (ie apart from the provisions of this Bill) any statutory or other legal prohibition against such information being divulged and used in the way contemplated by proposed new section 160N—

        I think, with all due respect to the Minister, I have to come down on the side of the AMA rather than, in this case, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's interpretation of it. The Bill says they `may have' committed an offence not that there is overwhelming evidence that the person has committed an offence. I am really quite concerned that evidence could be extracted on that basis.

         The Government, in an effort to stifle the pressure being placed on it but, at the same time, maintaining this ministerial discretion, has been gradually watering down section 106N and the consequential sections of this Bill. We have now got to the stage where the Minister cannot authorise the disclosure of information of a non-factual nature, such as the statements of opinion, unless the information consists only of matter contained in a report prepared by a person engaged in the quality assurance activity.

         However, this narrowing of the ministerial discretion still misses the central point. The fact is that total immunity and confidentiality are a necessary pre-requisite of an effective quality assurance process. The ability of medical professionals to be able to provide information to their peers without fear or favour is absolutely essential to the objects of this Bill. Again, I reiterate the comments that Senator Herron made about the importance of being able to be as frank as possible without fear or favour in that quality assurance process. As Dr Cass has stated, it is likely that this ministerial discretion will leave us in the very position that we are in now in which practitioners are hesitant to provide information due to the legal ramification that may result; this is the very position that necessitated this Bill.

         The amendments of the Australian Democrats attempt to narrow the ministerial discretion even further by prohibiting a ministerial authorised disclosure in cases where non-factual information, such as statements of opinion, are contained in a report prepared by a person who is engaged in the quality assurance activity. While the coalition agrees that it is totally inappropriate for non-factual information to be disclosed by the Minister, we believe that the Democrats, like the Government, have totally missed the point. For any quality assurance activity to be effective, the providers of the information must be 100 per cent confident that they can be open and forthright without facing the likelihood of exposing themselves to expensive, time consuming and personally damaging legal repercussions.

         The Democrats will undoubtedly say—and I think it is unhygienic to put words in their mouths, but I will have a go—`We only want to make sure that those who engage in real criminal or negligent activities are caught'.

         The coalition agrees that it is entirely appropriate for the Government to allow the Minister to authorise disclosure for prescribed purposes other than law enforcement. Again, however, the Democrats have missed the point. Quality assurance committees are not the equivalent of policemen. The workings of a quality assurance committee do not, in any way, prevent a hospital from investigating what it believes may be a negligent or criminal activity. All the information is still available for such investigations. Quality assurance committees do not take any previously available information and lock it away in a safe preventing either internal or external investigators from accessing it. Quality assurance committees should not be forced into a role of de facto medical investigators nor should the results of the information provided on a confidential basis during the peer review process be used retrospectively by other investigating bodies.

I seek leave to move amendments Nos 1 to 5 standing in my name on behalf of the Opposition.

         —Of course the Government does not accept Senator Patterson's amendments. It is very clear that in trying to establish protection for quality assurance activities being undertaken within the medical profession, it is important that we provide an environment of confidentiality and certainty that that confidentiality will not be breached, as being the normal way in which the activities of health professionals can be put under scrutiny by peer groups or the quality assurance groups in a particular institution.

         The question of whether that should be an absolute quarantine situation or whether there can be some modification of it has been a matter which has properly exercised the minds of those who engage in these activities and want them to succeed.

         I think it needs to be emphasised that in relation to section 106N, we are talking about a very circumscribed set of activities or situation. We are talking about circumstances where it appears to the Minister that information became known after the commencement of the part, solely as a result of the declared quality assurance activity relating to conduct—whether that conduct took place before or after that commencement—which may have been a serious offence against a law. That is still the main thrust of this measure.

         Senator Patterson raised the question: why use the phrase `which may have been'? Quite clearly, it would be improper for a Minister to substitute him or herself for a jury or a criminal trial. Therefore, there has to be a supposition on the part of the Minister concerning the possibility of the alleged activity having occurred and then characterising it as serious in accordance with the definition offered in the interpretation section: `being an offence punishable by imprisonment for a period of more than one year'.

         Perhaps it has not been sufficiently emphasised that there is no duty on the Committee to disclose such an offence to the Minister. I think it is very important to understand that. There is no duty on the Committee to disclose its awareness of the possibility of such an offence to the Minister. So this whole matter is very largely in the hands of the Committee. If it considers that a matter ought to be brought to the attention of the Minister, then no doubt it will be, and then the Minister of course has to make a decision in relation to section 106N.

         The other matter which has been mentioned by honourable senators is that the Committee of Presidents of Medical Colleges was concerned about the original terminology in which section 106N was cast. In fact, amendments were made, which have now been incorporated in the Bill, which indicate very clearly that it is matters of fact and not matters of opinion that may be disclosed pursuant to this particular provision, unless the information consists only of matter contained in a report prepared by a person who engaged in the quality assurance activity. Basically, we are now saying that the subsection does not permit the Minister to authorise the disclosure of information of a non-factual nature such as statements of opinion.

Both those scandals were exposed by the media. This legislation would penalise the media with a threat of two-year imprisonment.

         This Bill takes the medical profession back to the dark ages of paranoid conspiracy and privilege instead of openness to scrutiny and accountability. It is an insult to all the highly professional, competent and dedicated medical practitioners who are known to me. I will be voting against the Bill. I have not opposed any Government amendments which may ameliorate its deficiencies; however, I do oppose the Opposition's amendments, which in my view make it even worse.

I would also like to know whether anybody other than a member of the Committee can bring to the Minister's attention the fact that a serious offence against a law in force in any State or Territory may have been committed.

         Finally, I want to respond to some of Senator Chamarette's comments—and I am sure that some of the doctors will be interested to read what she said—and to some of Senator Lees's comments about a letter from the AMA, the same letter to which I referred when I was talking about the comments of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.

        First, in any and every case of a surgical death, for example, it would be possible to say that a serious criminal offence may have been committed. Rarely will one actually have been committed. Secondly, preventing use of material generated for the purposes of the peer review will not prevent the Courts and criminal investigators having access to other materials which would enable them to investigate and prosecute effectively in appropriate cases. For example, clinical and surgical records would still be available. It would still be open for investigators to interview each of the health professionals involved in the relevant surgical procedure, and for all of those persons to give evidence to the Court—if necessary to be compelled by subpoena. Giving absolute privilege to materials brought into existence solely for the purposes of the quality assurance activity does not in any way prejudice those other mechanisms.

Having listened carefully, in particular to Senator Chamarette, I feel constrained to very briefly put on record that, with respect, I believe that in her arguments she has confused two different issues. One is the issue of having information such as patients' records, the records of hospitals and the records of operations available for prosecution of any offences or for the careful examination of what has happened.

         That is one issue. I do not think it should be confused with the issue of maintaining, as far as possible, the effectiveness of the quality assurance process, which I am persuaded would be severely damaged if, whether rightly or wrongly, those practitioners who participate in it would have to expect, in their perception, that if they disclose information within that circle, then that information could be used even in that strictly limited situation that the Bill now provides for the Minister, and from there for possible prosecution. I am making this decision on a very fine balance, but on the basis of first-hand information provided to me from people active in the field. I believe it is the correct one.

         —I have already spoken on this matter of quality assurance, but I had to rise on hearing the speeches of Senator Lees and Senator Chamarette. They said that they were concerned about the consumers and that there is a conspiracy of medical silence. All of us are concerned about the consumers. The whole of the medical profession is concerned about quality outcome and the delivery of quality service. Senator Chamarette said quite rightly that that is the aim of all the royal colleges, the Australian Medical Association and everybody that we can name.

         —I think the analogy is relevant—a question on notice was asked of the Minister, `How many general practitioners were referred to a medical services committee of inquiry?'. In 1991, of about 22,800 general practitioners, 14 were referred to medical services committees of inquiry. I will put on notice later how many actually proceeded to prosecution for any offence and how many were actually convicted. In 1991-92, of what would be a greater number, 12 actually went to medical services committees of inquiry out of 25,000 or so. In my 34 years of being attached to a teaching hospital, I do not recall anyone, as a result of a quality assurance program, ever being charged, convicted or in any way committed to a court of law.

         The introduction of new section 106N will have the effect, as in New Zealand, of stopping people coming forward. As I said previously, why would someone come forward to assist in an inquiry if they thought that retrospectively a Minister at his or her discretion could send them for prosecution? `Trust me, I am a politician' is what will go out from this to quality assurance programs if it is in the hands of the Minister retrospectively.

         We have to approach reality here. If the Minister goes ahead with this, he will kill the quality assurance programs. Senator Chamarette referred to such things as the Chelmsford committee of inquiry. That was not a teaching hospital. I am not on firm ground here because I am not totally familiar with the matter, but peer review should not be confused with quality assurance programs. Peer review is within the profession with a formal mechanism to determine whether that treatment was in accordance with the current treatment of the day. In the case of Chelmsford it was. There was a legitimate argument that deep coma therapy was a form of treatment for psychiatric illness. I suppose, putting it another way, facts are at best current hypotheses; and it was the fact in those days that that was an effective form of treatment. Retrospectively, why did the nursing profession not speak out; why did everybody else not speak out at that time? It is all very well to look into these things retrospectively.

Once this legislation goes forward—and I thank Senator Spindler for his support in this regard—it is a matter that requires a fair amount of understanding to appreciate the significance of what is being proposed in this particular clause. Time will tell whether what I am saying is correct, but on the best evidence that I have from the people who have spoken to me about it and my own experience—

         Already within the medical literature there has been commentary on this matter, as the Minister will know because of the lobbying that has occurred from the medical organisations. If this proposal goes ahead, it will be paid lip-service; the quality assurance programs will go ahead but the Government will never ever know whether it has achieved the objective of helping the consumers and promoting the quality of health care that should be a result, but will not be because of the failure to exclude proposed new section 106N.

Senator Chamarette raised issues of a more general character as the foundation for her approach to whether this Bill should be supported at all.

         Senator Chamarette also raised the question of the Chelmsford incident. All that can be said about that is that if there had been a declared quality assurance program in place at Chelmsford with a declared committee et cetera, it is not fanciful to imagine that a member of the committee could have come forward at an early stage and made the Minister aware of what could have been regarded as serious criminal conduct in relation to the treatment of the patients concerned. I believe that there may have been an opportunity there, paradoxically, in terms of this Bill for an earlier disclosure of these matters than appeared to occur.

         It is also important to emphasise, as Senator Spindler did in response to part of Senator Chamarette's remarks, that the only material or information we are talking about is information which is brought into existence solely for the purposes of the quality assurance program of activity within that committee. The other files, records and knowledge of matters which would be held within the hospital or known to personnel within the hospital could be available for a criminal trial, should one be undertaken. Those matters ought to be kept clearly in mind. We are talking about a fairly restricted body of information generated solely for the purposes of the quality assurance activities.

         Senator Patterson asked for clarification on a couple of matters. Firstly, she asked what the Government had in mind as to what might count as prescribed purposes. It may be that this matter can be better dealt with when the Democrats move their amendments. In relation to that matter, because the activity that we are talking about of a criminal nature is primarily a matter for the States and the Territories, the Government wished to be in a position where, if a State or Territory said that it considered that this sort of information might, for example, be usefully disclosed at a coronial inquest, that might be a matter which after discussion with the States ought to be set down as a prescribed purpose. That was the type of further extension we had in mind when that was put forward. It has to be emphasised once again that all that would be disclosed would be matters of a factual nature, which could be useful to an inquest that was being undertaken.

         Senator Patterson also asked whether a party outside the Committee could disclose matters to a Minister so that proposed section 106N would be triggered. I suppose, theoretically, that would be possible. How a person outside the committee would come to be aware of the information would be a matter of concern, because under proposed section 106M the disclosure of such matters to a third party by a member of the committee would itself be a serious offence in terms of the Bill.

         The first hurdle that would have to be jumped is that one would have to assume a lack of confidentiality by committee members themselves, who are not under a duty to disclose information. Do not forget that they cannot be compelled to disclose matters; they are under no legal obligation to do so. In feeling that a matter ought to be kept confidential, they may not disclose it to a Minister but nevertheless disclose it to a third party, who could then disclose it to the Minister. That would have to be the way that it would work, but that would be a very rare instance indeed.

         Senator Herron indicated that, in his view, the imposition of proposed section 106N on top of the great immunities that are given to this process by the Bill will undo the good intent that may lie behind the more general structure of the Bill. Though I defer to his experience—as he recounted it to the Senate, he said that he had spent several decades working in the medical profession and in association with a teaching hospital and so on—even his experience indicates that in like circumstances he has never been in a situation where what was revealed led, or could lead, to a charge of the doctor concerned.

         In other words, generally speaking, in 99 per cent of cases—and doctors know this when they enter quality assurance programs—one is not dealing with material that could form information which a Minister considers ought to be disclosed to a law enforcement or royal commission process because one is fearful that a serious criminal offence has occurred. So doctors, understanding that that sort of situation will be extremely rare, will find within the structure of this Bill very real protections for the confidentiality of the process to which they submit themselves and an immunity from civil suits for those who undertake the work on these quality assurance committees. It will allow them to continue to discharge their very useful function of providing health care within Australia without being killed off in the way that Senator Herron fears. I have dealt with most of the matters that were raised in the Committee. I commend the Bill as it has been amended by us.

        The wording of the Government's amendment, as it stands, is far too broad. I pick up what Senator Tate was saying earlier about some of the possible other prescribed purposes, such as coronial inquiries. If it were so specified and actually set out as a specific reason, then we would not have the problems that we do have. But trucks could be driven through it the way it is drafted at the moment. At some time in the future it could be defined to mean almost any `prescribed purpose', because all it says is for `other prescribed purpose'. Basically, the Democrat amendment takes out those words and lets the rest of the proposed section stand. In other words, we have no great difficulty with disclosure for the purposes of law enforcement or for royal commissions. It is one thing to say that people participating in quality assurance run the risk of having the protection waived if those sorts of problems arise, but we believe that it should not then be stretched out to also include `other prescribed purpose'. I believe it is unduly vague and may well undermine the whole process.

         To pick up on a few of the points that Senator Heron made earlier, we do want this to work. It is about perceptions, as I said earlier. I think health professionals would be entitled to feel rather edgy about the potential size of the hole that could be blown through the whole immunity process. By removing these words, the health professions will have more confidence in the quality assurance process. That is obviously crucial to the success of this legislation.

         —I reiterate what I said in relation to this matter a little earlier, namely, that `prescribed purpose' is really put in to cover the situation that enforcement of criminal laws is a matter for the States or Territories. It may be that, after discussion and consultation with the States or Territories, they would wish the same sort of disclosure of this restricted body of information, created solely for the purpose of the quality assurance committee process, to be possible. They would like to see the disclosure, for example, to a coronial inquiry.

         I also need to emphasise that the prescription of such a purpose would be contained in an instrument, which would be disallowable. Therefore, if it were brought before the Senate and any senator had misgivings about the way in which the further extension had occurred, then it could be disallowed. I imagine that, given the sort of debate that we have had this afternoon, it would be a very vigilant Senate which would look at any such prescription. The disallowable instrument would have a very hard time and would probably be disallowed unless, as I said, it were most carefully justified. For those reasons, the Government will not support the amendment moved by Senator Lees.

        This final amendment relates to Government amendment No. 5. All we are doing is taking out the last few words. To go back to something Senator Tate said earlier about not wanting opinion disclosed, there may be opinion in that particular report. Again, our concern is that the confidence of the medical profession will be undermined because of holes in this legislation. I hope the Opposition will consider this amendment carefully, because it goes some way towards achieving what it said earlier it was interested in achieving.

         Senator Chamarette has expressed her concern about consumers. I am concerned about consumers too. People will not feel free, without fear or favour, to put forward their concerns or thoughts about what may or may not have been the case if they had time to think again in a particular emergency situation or if they had time to reassess whether somebody had some other factor involved in their condition and whether they may have done something different. They will not say those sorts of things. The Democrats will in fact reduce quality care of the people that we in the coalition are concerned about and whom the Government says it is concerned about. They are the people the legislation will affect. Let the Government and the Democrats live with the consequences. We put up what we thought were the best amendments. The Democrats and the Government did not agree with them. Let the public and the medical system live with what the Government says is best, despite all the advice it was given.

         I stress again that the important aspect of this amendment—it is perhaps even more important than the previous amendment—is that the way the proposed section reads at the moment the Government can have non-factual material disclosed to the Minister. As long as it is written down in that report, anything goes. We believe that that is not satisfactory and that it will undermine the quality assurance process. We want to see this process work. There is a very fine balance in making sure that all the various competing interests and concerns are accommodated and, indeed, dealt with as best as possible. All I can do is recommend that we leave aside the politics and try to get the best possible system that we can.

         This provision would allow the release of such reports for the purposes of law enforcement at royal commissions because of the likely difficulty of releasing the factual information completely void of any opinion. But it is important to recognise that whilst it will be available for law enforcement investigation, expert opinion will not be admissible in any subsequent criminal proceedings unless the court determines that those who expressed the opinions were expert witnesses for the purposes of the criminal proceedings, and such members would then be cross-examinable on any such opinions expressed. So it really will have a narrow effect in the unlikely event that any of this leads to a criminal trial.

On that basis I believe the chamber ought to support the original amendment moved by the Government. It should stand and not be further modified by the Democrat's amendment.

        The coalition's first amendment to the Medicare Agreements Bill seeks to extend the date on which the Bill receives royal assent. This extension of the date will not prevent the negotiation and signing of Medicare agreements with the States. It must be remembered that both sets of Medicare agreements to date have not required legislation such as this Bill. We have had two rounds of Medicare agreements which have not required legislation. It seems to me that the negotiations can go on and the agreements can be signed without this legislation actually being in place. There is no practical reason why the legislation has to be passed prior to the signing of the agreements, except that it will lock the States and Commonwealth into the Government's brand of public health care until June 1998.

         The Government does not have a mandate to do this. The election is close at hand. We know that there are great differences in our approaches to health and health care delivery. This would tie up a lot of the flexibility that would be available if this legislation was not to be passed until after the election. It seems to be an obvious attempt by the Government to put its policies in place prior to the election. The Government does have a mandate to negotiate agreements in readiness for the expiry of the current agreements. I have no objection to that. It is quite appropriate that the States and the Commonwealth should be negotiating those agreements in readiness for the start-up date of 1 July 1993, but there is no earthly reason why the legislation needs to be passed for that process to actually go on and almost reach its culmination.

         The Government does not have a mandate to force its health care policy onto the State public hospital system for another five years, regardless of the result of the next election. I call on the Australian Democrats and the Independents to support this amendment. The States and the Government can work towards those agreements, and the government of the day, that of the Liberal-National coalition, can work towards revamping those agreements, if it so requires—and obviously it would—and the people will be able to make the decision. We will have the mandate to do that.

         The Government is ramming this legislation through. All I can say is that it is ramming this legislation through. Last Friday, the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs was absolutely atrocious. Senator Lees was present, but I was interested to find senators from the States most affected—the Independent senator from Victoria, Senator Powell, and the Democrat senators from New South Wales and Victoria—not there. It was a very important time. Two State Ministers came to present to the Committee their concerns about the effect of this legislation on their States. I would have expected those senators to have been present at that hearing to hear what those Ministers had to say.

         As I said, it was appalling. One Minister told us that, at 1 o'clock in the morning, a journalist rang her and said, `Have you seen the alteration to the agreement?'. The Minister said that she had not seen it. Senator Tate, in a very rushed way, then tabled a letter. I do not blame Senator Tate for this; he is just the messenger who has to deliver all this nonsense when the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) does not negotiate.

         Senator Tate came in with the letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Premiers outlining the changes to the agreement. The two Ministers sat there—one was giving evidence and the other was sitting behind—astounded that this letter was being circulated. They were supposed to be presenting information. Yet a change to the agreement had obviously been leaked to the press—it was in the newspapers. The Minister from New South Wales said that he woke up to read it in the newspaper or hear it on the radio. That is not the way to develop agreements on the outline of a five-year plan for health.

         I call on those senators from the two States most affected—New South Wales and Victoria—to support this amendment to enable the people to decide what form of health care service they require, through the use of the Medicare money, after the next election. This amendment will allow them to do that. I will be very interested to see, as will the people of both Victoria and New South Wales, where those senators sit when we vote on this amendment.

         As I say, this will give a certainty not hitherto available to the States, the Territories and the Commonwealth in the negotiating process that is still to be undertaken. Many months of consultation and deliberation between the various parties has already occurred, despite Senator Patterson's dismissal of the consultations which she characterises as being either trivial or non-existent. In fact, they have been extensive. We believe that the passage of this Bill will give a certain structure to the framework and foundation of the Medicare agreements. The certainty that is thereby engendered will enable the States and Territories to assent more willingly to the agreements which are sought to be achieved.

It will end up like Queensland. In Queensland there is an 18-month waiting list to get an appointment at the orthopaedic department of the Royal Brisbane Hospital.

         The amendment is to allow more time. The legislation will not come in until July next year. There is to be an election and I believe we will be given the greatest mandate we have ever had. Amongst the factors that will come into the election is the health care of this nation, which is rapidly deteriorating—3 per cent of expenditure going on the capital developments of the hospital stock, which is disappearing rapidly. We get this promise of an increase in the Medicare levy, which provides another $300m to be put into capital stock of hospitals. Two States already recognise that that will not work. Even the Labor States said they would not sign the agreement if they were put at disadvantage—and we still have not heard whether they will be put at disadvantage.

        Currently in the Bill a `public hospital service' is defined as a hospital service provided in a recognised hospital or a hospital in respect of which the Commonwealth or a State provides funding for the provision of hospital services to public patients. The coalition believes that this definition is too narrow, particularly as the Bill links the provision of `public hospital services' to funding. The coalition believes that funding should be service based rather than hospital based. This current definition may mean that certain services, which are obviously `public hospital services' may be excluded.

         We have to think of the fact that this agreement will be in place for five years and that some considerable changes may occur. For example, with the emphasis on shortening hospital stays, there will be a greater emphasis on providing home services.

        Currently the Bill provides that financial assistance is not payable to a State after 1 July 1993 unless an agreement has been entered into by that State. New subsection 25(2) sets out the five components of financial assistance payable under an agreement. Subsection 25(3) states that the agreement must provide for the method of calculating the base hospital funding grant. Subsection 25(4) states that financial assistance will be payable as set out in the agreement while subsection 25(5) states that funding will be provided on the conditions set out in the Medicare principles and commitments section. The coalition's amendment does not make the signing of the agreement a prerequisite of ongoing funding. We do not believe that the country's public hospital system and the health of thousands of Australian should be held to ransom in this way.

         Secondly, the coalition's amendment removes the five components of funding which the Government seeks to impose on the States until June 1998. The coalition believes that in the context of a five-year agreement there should be greater flexibility available for other methods of funding. This section seeks to set the funding components in concrete when further down the track it is quite feasible that more efficient and effective methods of funding may be determined.

         The fact that last Friday the Federal Government announced quite significant changes to the previous funding proposals only highlights the need for that flexibility. For example, in five years time it is likely to be more appropriate that funding for acute care for the aged be moved across to the aged care funding category. In addition, the Government's insistence on five bands of funding would mean a massive increase in reporting, accounting, bureaucracies and in detailing the information and administration of the agreements and of maintaining that system of financial bands. For those reasons we have moved the amendment.

         —The Government will be rejecting the amendment which deals with several portions of proposed section 25. The effect of the amendment would be to move the focus of the section from the specific terms and conditions of financial assistance payable by the Commonwealth to a State to the largely unspecified details and agreements that relate to financial assistance. The proposed amendment removes specific reference to the condition requiring that an agreement must be entered into before financial assistance is payable by the Commonwealth to a State—that is, subsection 25(1). That is omitted in Senator Patterson's amendment. Obviously, omitting subsection 25(1) would have the effect of not formally requiring a State to enter into an agreement before it is paid financial assistance by the Commonwealth; whereas retaining subsection 25(1) subjects the Commonwealth and the States to a discipline which would be absent if the requirement were not to be inserted into an agreement. Retention of this proposed subsection is a guarantee to the Australian public that both levels of government are committed to implementing the Budget reforms and building a better health system.

         I now turn to the other proposed subsections which are dealt with in a way which removes reference to four out of the five components of financial assistance payable by the Commonwealth to a State, being 25(2)(b)—the hospital bonus payment; 25(2)(c)—the hospital incentive package; 25(2)(d)—a mental health incentive package; and 25(2)(e)—other health services funding. This appears to have the effect of freeing up the Commonwealth from apportioning the financial assistance in the manner specified in the subsection and, as such, is clearly inconsistent with the categories of funding and specified formulas in the draft agreements.

         Removal of proposed subsection 25(4) provides greater scope for the Commonwealth not to pay a State amounts provided for in an agreement if circumstances changed. Inclusion of this provision provides security of knowledge that the Commonwealth will pay to a State a particular amount of financial assistance. The proposed subsection reads:

        Scope and procedures for variation of such amounts are dealt with elsewhere in the Bill. The amendment means that the States would not be guaranteed payment of money determined in the Medicare agreement. That surely would not be satisfactory. I believe the amendment is such that it ought to be rejected by the Committee.

It is not necessary for the States to sign the agreement. There have already been two agreements and the sky has not fallen in. The States have been able to negotiate with the Commonwealth and get on with the business of organising—not all that wonderfully, let me say, and the point was made that there was no legislation for the agreement—to enter into an agreement. Bringing in legislation is only a new thing and we all know why. It is absolutely transparent. Legislation is being introduced to put in place the Government's policy for the next five years. Earlier I said `1988' when I should have said `1998'. I presume

I do not believe it is necessary to have enshrined in legislation a requirement for the States to sign an agreement. We believe that our amendment provides us with a much better way of going about this.

It seems to me that as we are one nation we should have, as much as possible, a standardised, adequate health service across all States. I am particularly concerned about the removal of the need for a mental health incentives package, which is a quite reasonable proposal. We are dealing with some very large sums of money and I am sure that taxpayers in all States would want to see such services ensured. Therefore, we will not support the amendment.

Indeed, as they came before us we found that Victoria and New South Wales had very basic disagreements, starting with the principles of the Bill. Western Australia still had problems with it. Western Australia said the problems were not great enough that it would want the Bill delayed. Queensland said that it did not have any problems with it. However, not one of the States said it would sign. None of the States has had any financial positions agreed upon.

Then halfway through the hearings the Minister came in with another letter—a letter for the New South Wales Minister for health and the Victorian Minister for health. There was none for Queensland or Western Australia. When I asked the Western Australian representative whether they were concerned that they had not received a letter, he said, `Well, we don't even know what is going on'.

There is no agreement. None of the States has signed anything.

         I support the amendment that Senator Patterson has moved on behalf of the Opposition. I again ask the Minister, `Why carry on the charade?' It is not necessary. We have plenty of time to reach a proper outcome with all the States through negotiations being carried out in the proper way. Do not let us misunderstand the position. Negotiations have not taken place. That was made very clear to us by Minister Tehan and Minister Phillips from Victoria and New South Wales.

         In addition, the Parliament should state the principles that should underpin in particular the care of eligible persons who are entitled to the provision of public hospital services. However, there should be an acknowledgment of the right of people to choose to be treated in private hospitals. Underpinning that choice is private health insurance. It is thought to be important at this stage in the evolution of our social history to incorporate and give statutory strength to those principles and agreements. For that reason, the Government has brought this forward for the consideration of the Parliament.

However, I wish to add to some of the concerns expressed by Senator Walters about the actual process and the way the States have been dealt with in negotiations. Before doing that, I must stress that we are not in the business of being involved in those negotiations. All we are doing is setting up a framework within which those negotiations can take place. It is then over to the States and the Federal Government to sort that out between themselves.

Putting that aside, I believe the committee process on Friday was very worth while when we were actually looking at the legislation before us.

In other words, the Cabinets of the various Australian jurisdictions elected by the people will finally determine whether the agreements should be entered into or not. We believe that these Medicare principles and the commitments, which are in a sense subsidiary but certainly attached to those principles, are of high importance.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this section, `adopt' means to enact legislation that establishes the Principles and Commitments as guidelines that will govern the delivery of public hospital services to eligible persons in a State, but neither the obligation to enact that legislation, nor the State legislation so enacted, operates to create in any person legal rights not in existence before the enactment of the State legislation, unless the State legislation expressly provides otherwise.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is a fair and reasonable way to put the obligation which is meant to be imposed on a State: it will establish legislation as guidelines, but one cannot vest in a person a right to insist that particular treatment be provided in accordance with those guidelines. That allows for the fact that it is always difficult to provide these services and it may not be possible in any particular instance to ensure that the principles and commitments work in favour of a patient presenting for that service. I believe it is important, nevertheless, to maintain proposed section 26. The Commonwealth cannot accept the amendment, which would have the effect of undermining the principles and commitments set out in the Bill.

We do that because we know that over 78,000 people are on waiting lists in those States that do put forward their waiting lists. Queensland does not. Queensland did not know what its waiting list was. It has not even bothered to find out or to record its waiting list. Tonight Senator Herron gave us some fine examples.

The Minister says that that is all covered in proposed section 26(3)(b). Then he scuppers his own principles and commitments by saying that if the States cannot adopt the principles and commitments they must make reasonable efforts. What on earth does he think Senator Patterson's amendment is if it is not that?  The Minister might answer me later on what he classes as `make reasonable efforts', because I do not know what that means.

Don't get carried away enough to think we mean it, because if the States can't give it to you, then all we require them to do is to make some sort of reasonable effort'—whatever `reasonable' happens to be. Then it says, `If you still can't get it when they make the reasonable effort, don't get carried away and think we really mean it, because you've got no legal rights anyway. We don't give you a legal right to have access to the money you pay in your Medicare levy. We're not going to make the States give you eligible persons access. If they can't, we'll just say, "You make reasonable efforts and we'll pass that as being OK"'. The problem is that this Bill, along with the Government's whole health policy, is ideology-driven.

That would leave beds in the public hospitals so that pensioners and the less well off could have their cardiac surgery done in time so that they would not die on the waiting lists because of the Government's ideology. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain that to me.

         —Senator Walters has raised—genuinely, but in a way which itself was laced with ideology—some questions which need to be addressed, but I will deal firstly with the more objective matter of waiting lists. I agree with Senator Walters in regarding it as a disgrace that a State in Australia is not able to describe the waiting list situation in the jurisdiction for which it is responsible. I think the fact that Queensland does not have such a list is a matter which ought to attract adverse comment—and obviously has.

         I think it will be extremely important, if we are to reduce the waiting lists—whether known with precision or just anecdotally—to an acceptable level, for that information to be made available so that proper programs of management can be put in place to reduce the waiting time. There is no doubt that the $70m over two years, which is not a huge amount, will help in that waiting list reduction program. But it ought to be seen in the context of the $1.6 billion over six years which will be put into the public hospital services of Australia under the Medicare agreements to be negotiated, which I believe will have a cumulative effect of reducing those waiting lists.

         I think it is worth mentioning that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), at the heads of government meeting in Perth, cut the nexus which had been in place between in-principle agreement to the Medicare agreements and the provision of the waiting list moneys—the $70m over two years. He invited States such as New South Wales and Victoria immediately to enter into a subsidiary agreement, a completely separate arrangement, to allow those moneys to flow into their jurisdictions to help reduce the waiting lists in New South Wales and Victoria, even though in principle they may not be prepared at this moment to agree to the Medicare agreements.

         I would go one step further and say that if those States do not make that move to accept the waiting list money in the near future, given the instances which Senator Walters brought to the attention of the chamber, perhaps the Commonwealth should look directly to funding the hospitals concerned, bypassing the States with waiting list moneys. The money is sitting there. It is a human tragedy, and a fatal situation for some, that that money is not being expended. I believe that all the States ought to take up those moneys.

         As to the question of ideology, I think Senator Walters undervalues the contribution which she has made to the Australian health system simply by the payment of her taxes and the Medicare levy on the high income she has been earning over the last several years. That gives her an entitlement to go into the public hospital system to receive treatment for an illness or to undo the effects of an accident that she may have suffered.

         Senator Walters is not correct to use the terminology she did when she said that she would be somewhat embarrassed or would feel that she would be bludging on the system if she were to go into a public hospital. She is entitled to go into a public hospital. She has paid high taxes, and a high proportion further by way of the Medicare levy over many years, to help provide those services. I believe that she is entitled to go to the Royal Hobart Hospital if she so desires.

         Of course we cannot go into personal details, but Senator Walters chose to go to a private hospital, I take it, in order to have the treatment she required. That is a choice that the honourable senator made. She made it because she had chosen to take out private health insurance. Once again, I believe that is the correct ideological position. We favour choice. We favour the fact that one should choose, if one so wishes, private health insurance. I admit that I made an error in my rather flamboyant reply in the chamber the other day about the question of Fightback and private health insurance.

         Finally, I think it also has to be said, on behalf of some of our very well regarded public hospitals, that the reason a person might choose and want to be treated there rather than at a private hospital is simply because of the reputation of the public hospital. Perhaps it has a clinical school attached to it and is a teaching hospital. It may well be that a person would make a very positive choice to be treated in the public hospital rather than in the private hospital and to exercise their entitlements, as I say, which they have as a taxpayer and Medicare levy payer to be served there as a public patient.

         That is the brief answer, and I think we could go on all night about the personal reasons which underlie our commitment to a particular form of the provision of hospital services and their financing.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Senator Walters has given her personal anecdote; I might just give mine. In 1963, when at first year uni I had a massive car accident, my parents were on the top of the MBF table. Like most Australian families after the war, my father had paid in at the top rate to protect his family. I forget what it was, but I think it was after a hundred days, or maybe it was 10 weeks, the MBF payments ceased and we were thrown back on to the financial resources of a family of two parents and three young children all being educated. Quite frankly, those resources were stretched to the absolute limit to deal with a situation where one was in hospital for month after month after month, year after year after year. It caused financial trauma, on top of the need to be healed physically so far as the family was concerned.

         I determined then that if I were ever in a position to ensure that regardless of apparent income a person would be entitled to hospital services of a high quality without having to be financially traumatised by having to face very high hospital bills or the need to take out very high premium payments in order to protect oneself against an eventuality, I should look for something better than my family and I were confronted with at that time. That is the reason I have always been a very strong supporter of Medicare; and I believe that these particular principles and commitments are deserving of the support of the Parliament.

As to what the Minister said a few moments ago, yes, under Fightback there would be a tax penalty, but we would not raise the Medicare levy for the poor as those opposite have done. From 1 June or 1 July the levy goes up to 1.4 per cent. We would not have done that. We have said no, that we will retain the levy, and anyone who wants to stay with Medicare can stay. We would not have raised the levy. Only people with the higher income would have had an increase if they did not decide to privately insure.

We would have said to the people who could afford it, `You will pay an additional levy'. It would not have been the poorer people but just the wealthier people who would have paid the additional levy—unless they had decided to take out private insurance, in which case for them the levy would not have been increased. We would have said to the poorer people, `If you want to privately insure, we will assist you and will pay some of that contribution for you'. So again I ask the Minister not to  misquote Fightback.

        This amendment will add an additional commitment, namely, the establishment of a national health policy by the end of 1994. The States have been pushing for this for a number of years. They recognise the need to delineate the roles and responsibilities of State and Federal levels of government in health care and to examine all aspects of Australian health care, funded and managed by both levels of government.

         Obviously, such rationalisation should include agreed national health goals and targets. The benefits of such rationalisation will be substantial in areas such as health services for the aged. A national health policy will prevent the unnecessary duplication of services and will result in a greater clarification of responsibilities. It will mean less bureaucracy, greater accountability of scant resources and, most importantly, a better standard of health care for the public.

         It is worth noting that the Australian Democrats have foreshadowed a similar amendment, although their amendment is restricted to national health goals and targets. We believe that no national health policy is anywhere near complete if it does not assess current funding arrangements or the Federal-State relations and their various responsibilities in the area of health care and health care delivery.

         Written into the whole idea of a national health policy is this ongoing argument about where the money is coming from. We would for once like to put that aside in this chamber. Recent health debates in here show that we always seem to end up on that same sticking point—whether health care will be public or private and where the money will come from. We want to get away from that and start looking at goals and setting some targets so that we know what we are aiming towards. We want to put aside that ideological debate—not to ignore it but to not include it in the basic principles that we should be determining.

         There has been an endless amount of research. I will talk more about that when I move my amendment. We do not need to go into any more background papers; we have it all written out before us. We need to simply put it together and to discuss and debate it with the States. We believe that that can be done in 12 months. Therefore, we will not be supporting the Liberal Party amendment, but we will be seeking support for our amendment at a later stage.

        This amendment will delete proposed subparagraph 28(1)(f), which seeks to require that certain variations to Medicare agreements can take effect only if both Houses of Parliament approve the variations by resolution. This is another example of this Government valiantly attempting to hold on to its failed system of public health, regardless of whether it retains power at the next Federal election.

         This clause begs the question, `When is an agreement not an agreement?'. The answer is: when both the Commonwealth and the States agree to variations of a Medicare agreement, they must still have these variations ratified by both Houses of the Federal Parliament. This clause would mean that, when a Federal government does not have the numbers in the Senate, the Opposition with the assistance of those who sit on the cross-benches can block variations in the funding arrangements relating to a Medicare agreement. This is a far cry from the two previous sets of Medicare agreements in 1984 and 1988 where there was no overriding legislation, let alone the ability of an upper House to veto variations in agreements.

         One wonders whether Mr Keating knows about this nasty little clause that is in this Bill. I presume that he does.

         This clause is an attempt by Labor to enshrine its form of Medicare for another five years. The coalition believes that it is totally inappropriate for the Federal Parliament to potentially have the ability to lock an agreement into place where a State and the Commonwealth have agreed to variations to the agreement. At a time when there are major changes to our public hospital system, which the Australian Democrats have publicly acknowledged in their amendment, this will reduce the potential for flexibility in funding arrangements in areas such as aged care as well as in the development of a case mix approach.

         I was interested to hear Senator Lees speak on my amendment No. 4. I cannot remember her exact words, but they were to the effect that she wanted to create a framework for the governments to come to an agreement and to then leave it up to the governments to get on with it. Senator Tate, in supporting Senator Lees, said that the Cabinets will decide whether the agreements will be entered into. They may decide that, but the Parliament may decide differently. The two of them can say both those things, but it is not really the case. The Cabinets cannot vary it; they are not in a position to do that. We are not leaving the Cabinets to decide whether they can vary these agreements. Senator Lees argued against her own point, and it was not very logical.

At other times—we argue very strongly that last night was one of those times—it is not appropriate.

         If honourable senators read through the first amendment, they will see that a review is triggered by a drop of 2 per cent on an ongoing basis. In other words, it would be triggered in 1994 and it could be triggered again in 1995, depending on the actual movement of people out of private insurance. The second amendment is consequential upon that.

         These amendments as a whole really treat the symptoms and not the cause. The Democrats are saying, `Throw some more money at this. If there is a problem, if the number of people who are taking up private health insurance decreases, we will just throw some more taxpayers' money to plug up the hole'. The fact that they voted with the Government just a moment ago in not enshrining in this legislation the role of private health insurance is consistent with what they are saying here: `We are not going to correct the problem of declining and decreasing private health insurance numbers. If the numbers go down, we understand that the States will need more money, so we will organise for them to have it'.

         We ought to be looking at methods to provide incentives to encourage people to take out private health insurance. I have said tonight, and I will say again, that the Australian Hospitals Association and the Australian Private Hospitals Association together in an unprecedented venture put that case very strongly. Wherever we go throughout Australia, to either a public or a private hospital, the peak bodies and their members are saying exactly the same thing, that we need methods and incentives to encourage people to take out private health insurance. We should be doing that. In fact, our Fightback package provides tax credits for people on lower income levels who take out private health insurance rather than having taxpayers pay more money to fix up the inherent problem, which is what this amendment is doing.

         —As it is my amendment, perhaps I should endeavour to explain it. Looking at the various tables, it seems that the supplementary hospital table is the one that people are moving out of most rapidly. Therefore, that was chosen instead of the base table. As for the ongoing debate—I suppose I cannot avoid getting back into public versus private again—somewhere we have to find the money. We do not believe that we should force Australians into private insurance, costing them many hundreds of dollars on top of whatever grant they may be given, depending on their income.

         The Opposition package removes the restraints on the AMA by way of charging fees. While we may be able to trust our local GPs not to jack up their fees more than $4 or $5 a visit, I do not believe we can trust all and certainly not a lot of the specialists. So we will have an enormous blow-out in the costs of health. Rather than going down, as Senator Patterson suggested, the costs of health insurance could indeed rise further, particularly as the Opposition is also taking out bulkbilling and removing the gap. The gap is one of those price signals that lets people know that it will actually cost them something.

         I wonder why, when we are trying to provide some sort of a mechanism by which there will be additional funds to try to prevent any further waiting lists, Senator Patterson now seems to have a problem with that, having complained so bitterly earlier about waiting lists. This is actually a way of solving the problem, to some extent at least, and of coming to terms with the fact that we have to put more money into the system to ensure that people in genuine need of treatment are able to get it.

         —When I appeared before the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on Friday I indicated that the Federal Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) would be writing to his State counterparts indicating that he would agree to a provision for a review of the funding arrangements in the event of major changes in the health environment which resulted in significant and unavoidable increases in demand or cost. I went on to say that this would include significant decreases in private health insurance participation rates.

         So it will not surprise the Committee to learn that the Government will support this amendment because it gives greater precision to that undertaking. I think Senator Lees has sufficiently explained why the supplementary hospital table was chosen. I understand that 88 per cent of those Australians who take out private health insurance do take out supplementary hospital insurance. As this is the table that gives access to private hospitals, if shifts occur onto public demand, they will be more significant obviously as a shift from private hospital to public hospital provision of care.

         So this is an important specification, if you like, of an undertaking that I had signalled to the Committee that met on Friday. I believe that for that reason the Government can give its support to the amendment. The effect of the amendment is to precisely specify the point at which a review of the level of Commonwealth hospital bonus payments would be triggered, being two percentage points or greater drop below the June 1993 level of the proportion of the national population with supplementary private insurance. Further reviews could then be triggered by subsequent two percentage point drops.

         Quite clearly, the States have a very real and genuine concern about their financial liability in the event of significant decreases in private insurance participation rates. We did argue on Friday that such decreases do not necessarily lead to corresponding increases in public hospital activity or costs. Indeed, attachment 4 to the New South Wales Minister's submission to the Senate Committee revealed that in the face of declining private insurance membership in New South Wales:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there has been an increase in private sector activity. This suggests that there have been no movement from the private to the public sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not good English, but that is what the attachment said. The amendment quite appropriately links potential reimbursement for significant decreases of people with private insurance following a review to demonstrable increases in public hospital activity through the bonus component of the agreement. For that reason, the amendment is accepted.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The consequent amendment provides that the data used to determine the national supplementary health insurance participation rate will be based upon that published by an independent authority, namely, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. We think that is a useful guarantee and safeguard for the States and we are pleased to be able to support that amendment too.

         —The amendment as read out by Senator Lees is self-explanatory. It certainly accords with the intention of the Commonwealth Government to assist the States and Territories to achieve a more appropriate balance between institutional and community care, and between curative care, disease prevention and health promotion activities. This is a very large assignment, but I believe it is one that needs to be undertaken. We are happy to do so in accordance with the framing of this amendment. Therefore, we support it.

I would not know how many times over the last two or three weeks Bills have been on and off and up and down. I think the arrangements have been changed five or six times today.

         The Bills deal with issues of customs administration and implement a number of decisions on industry assistance, as well as dealing with a number of housekeeping matters, especially in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). Key issues are, however, the amendments to anti-dumping administration and the further phasing down of assistance to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. This highlights the interaction of these two facets of industry policy.

         The Opposition supports an orderly phase-down in tariffs, but it must be accompanied by effective protection against predatory dumping and subsidisation of goods exported to Australia. It must also be facilitated through the micro-economic reforms so necessary to enable Australian industry to compete both domestically and abroad. The Government has failed to measure up in both these areas.

         While these amendments to the anti-dumping administration are welcomed by the Opposition, they are late in arriving and do not go far enough. Why has it taken so long for Australia to adopt the European and North American approach of a mandatory up-front interim duty? Was it because the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology took the initiative to look at the question of dumping?

         Unlike the present situation where duty is not collected if the exporter raises the export price to the level of the normal value determined by Customs on price undertaking, firm action will now occur in each case where dumping or subsidisation is found to cause material injury. The onus remains on the applicant for dumping and subsidy action to make a case for material injury occurring. This is appropriate. The legislation now places the onus of proof on the exporter-importer when it comes to adjustments to the duty liability or a review of the liability, and this is how it should be.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Some press reports have stated that because dumping duty will now be payable for each and every shipment of an item for a six-month period, irrespective of any bona fide change in the export price of the goods, importers can have a problem. It is suggested that an importer can face enormous price disadvantages in the marketplace over this period. While this could be true in some cases, the local producer of the goods concerned would also have experienced price disadvantages in the market prior to the imposition of dumping duty.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Part of the solution for the importer is to have very close relations with the overseas supplier to ensure that the goods do not get involved in a dumping or subsidy situation in the first place. This may not always be easy, but under this legislation there is now a real incentive to avoid problems arising. Our anti-dumping mechanism should be swift and effective but in no way provide an alternative form of protection for industry in lieu of tariff protection. Neither should it be a de facto means of industry protection, but an effective measure to be used against those who cheat in international trade.

         While this legislation improves the effectiveness of our anti-dumping administration, it is not as speedy as it should be. Following the Government's statement of 5 December 1991, it legislated to reduce the period for a preliminary finding to 125 days, or 145 days for the more complex cases. This is 25 days for determining a prima facie case and 100 days for the Customs investigation. This in the commercial world is still just too long.

         I turn now to the TCF industry. In maintaining its timetable for the phase-down of the TCF tariffs, the Government has put in place a program of measures to assist restructuring, boosting exports and enhancing the import credit scheme. Because we have reached the TCF area, I think it is appropriate that I make some mention of the report of the Industry Commission which came down last week. I draw particular attention to this on account of the fact that I am aware that there will be an amendment coming forward from another quarter concerning the actual quota figures. On page 5 of the IC annual report it states:

        To give in to calls for a delay would send the wrong signals to industry.

The cost to the nation in terms of building opportunities for growth and sustainable jobs would be substantial.

         Australian industry must become more internationally competitive. A lowering of our protective walls is consistent with the objective, but so essentially is the reform of the economic infrastructure within such industry functions.

         —In debating this package of Customs Bills, I turn first to the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. This is an omnibus Bill proposing amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985. There are three main proposals contained in this Bill. Firstly, it is designed to provide the legislative framework to establish a cargo automation system. Such a system will involve the electronic transmission to Customs of information relating to the reporting, screening and clearance of cargo. It will permit limited on-line computer access to such information by other specified agencies.

         Secondly, it proposes to improve waterfront security in accordance with recommendations by the joint review committee which examined the 1989 report of the National Crime Authority on port security and in particular to increase control over ships' crews and other individuals in waterfront areas. Thirdly, it seeks to extend the eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate scheme to vessels servicing oil and gas operations in the North West Shelf and Timor Gap exploration areas when those vessels travel to and from Australian ship repair yards for refits or repairs.

         I turn my attention to the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Bill 1992 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. I was very pleased to hear Senator Archer say that the Opposition will again move amendments to reduce the prima facie stage of anti-dumping applications to five days. I recall that the last time customs legislation was before the Senate the Australian Democrats and the Opposition moved a similar amendment. It went to the House of Representatives and was rejected there. When it came back to the Senate, the Opposition had gone to water and was not prepared to stick with the amendment. The Australian Democrats will support that particular amendment. We hope that this time the coalition parties will stick with their resolve and that the amendment will be passed. The Democrats will certainly seek to ensure that.

         The two Bills that the Senate is discussing at the moment propose to amend the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 to introduce a new regime for the imposition and collection of both interim and final dumping and countervailing duties. Under the present anti-dumping regime, dumping duty is not payable where the dumping margin is purportedly eliminated by an exporter raising the export price of the goods to the level of the normal value. These Bills propose to impose an up-front duty payable on all goods, the subject of a duty notice issued upon a positive preliminary finding. The importer can then have his or her actual duty liability assessed by the Minister at a later stage with a possibility of having any excess, up-front duty, repaid.

         The details of the major initiatives proposed in these two Bills are as follows: to provide a mechanism whereby an interim duty will be imposed on each importation of goods subject to anti-dumping or countervailing measures; to introduce a requirement that unless information is provided in confidence a dumping duty notice or countervailing duty notice must show the normal value, export price and non-injurious price of the goods. In the case of countervailing duties, this will include any financial assistance by way of subsidy or bounty, and the non-injurious price of goods of that kind. Subsequent adjustments are calculated on each consignment of goods imported in the six-months period or, alternatively, the importer can ask for a review and substitution of another rate of duty 12 months after the last duty notice or ministerial review.

We thoroughly agree with that statement. Once again I ask the responsible Minister to address this question in the committee stage and to advise whether he is prepared to examine the best way to bring such franchise or distributor agreements within the definition of business associates.

         I now turn to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. The Bill proposes to enact a range of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Many of the proposed amendments are non-contentious. It is proposed to remove import duties from aquarium aerators, transmission shafts and cranks for outboard motors, and master recording blanks; to reduce the customs duty on aviation gasoline; to increase the duty on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by $5 per kilogram; and to revoke the customs component of duty on imported beer so that imported beer will attract the same rate of excise as locally brewed beer. I do not know what the local beer brewing industry has to say about that proposed amendment, but at this stage we have not had any reaction to it.

         There are some measures designed to increase the competitiveness of Australian industry, and they are certainly welcome. One of them is to assist local footwear manufacturers by removing quota restrictions from certain parts of footwear, reducing the tariff rate from 32 per cent to 10 per cent, and accelerating the phasing out of preference for goods from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Certainly it will be welcomed that the hard-pressed footwear industry in Australia will get this benefit of a reduced duty on parts that it has to import. The other measure also is long overdue. It is hardly sensible to give preference to highly mechanised manufacturing economies such as Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.

This is a novel initiative. While at first glance it looks as though we are exporting jobs, it must be realised that the alternative in most of these cases probably would be for the manufacturer to go totally offshore with the manufacturing set-up.

The code of conduct—which the Government should accept but as yet has not—would take into account the wages and working conditions, the human rights situation, and what I call the exploitation index prevalent in countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and China where some of these agreements are going to be implemented. Clearly we must make sure that we do not profit by the repression and exploitation of other human beings. I believe we should press for working conditions to be lifted to the standards we enforce in Australia rather than to use and exploit human beings in other countries.

         The most contentious amendments in this Bill are contained in schedule 6. These amendments give effect to the Government's announcement made in March 1991 to abolish quota arrangements for TCF goods from 1 March 1993. Goods previously subject to quota will now be subject to ad valorem rates of duty. This is an initiative from the Government which the Democrats strongly oppose. It is crazy for us to be removing quota restrictions when just about every other country in the world with any TCF industry of note has such protection in place. The reason is easily found, and I will quote yet again, as I did earlier today, from the information we have on the wages paid in China where the wage for a six-day, 48-hour week in a textile factory is less than $20.

It did employ approximately 120,000 people. The latest figure we have, for March 1992, is 76,000. The prediction is that by March 1993, which is only about three months away, the figure will be 55,000 or lower. The latest drop is very much a direct result of the measures proposed in this Bill.

         We can easily see what is happening. In March 1992 the value of imports from developing countries, principally China, went up by 23 per cent for a value increase of 31 per cent. Next March, when the tariff rates drop a further four points, the flood of imports coming into this country from China will have the potential, as they did in New Zealand, to wipe out the local industry for the ensuing 12 months. It is almost impossible now to book a container out of a port in South East Asia to arrive in Australia before 1 March. If that is not a flood of imports—which Senator Button, the responsible Minister, continues to deny—I do not know what is.

The amendment goes further than this announcement, as it proposes to allow non-profit organisations and individuals with disabilities to import free of duty aids and appliances which assist with their disabilities.

         Most importantly, coalition policy does not require the same decimation of local industry to establish material injury. There are still many difficulties encountered in our anti-dumping system. Two weeks ago there was the extraordinary negative finding by the Australian Customs Service on pork imported from Canada. Feed accounts for 70 per cent of the cost of producing a pig. Canadian producers get a 49 per cent subsidy on barley and a 26 per cent subsidy on corn. Despite that, Customs refused to accept that anti-dumping or countervailing duties needed to be imposed. It found a 2 per cent market share gain by Canadian frozen pork, a dumping margin of 2c per kilo and a subsidy of a few cents per kilo.

There are many instances of goods kept out of the massive US and EC markets by high retaliatory tariffs. These goods are often redirected to the available and waiting Australian markets. There are also situations where certain imports are targeted at Australian products with the intention of killing off the Australian competitor. There are still a great many problems in the anti-dumping and countervailing system. Legislative changes have not addressed the unfair trading practices—an environment that Australian industries have had to face against dumped and subsidised imports. These take many forms, and I shall mention some across a range of products.

         There is the recent case which was brought against Canadian pork, whose producers benefited from high feed subsidies, as I have mentioned, and there were 20 other subsidies on that Canadian pork. Already there is a level of subsidisation that Australian producers do not receive and cannot compete against.

         The recent pork case is instructive. The pork industry showed the usual independence and resourcefulness of an Australian rural producer and funded its own case from its own resources. The case for the Canadians was funded by the Canadian Federal and provincial governments. Against the might of Canadian treasuries was the farmer fighting alone and unfunded to save the industry. Canadian imports began in August 1990. By the first six months of this year, pig prices were down by 25 per cent and producers were losing $20 a pig. The industry was facing its worst crisis for 20 years. Productive capacity was being permanently lost to the industry from high numbers of producers being forced out.

         The way dumped and subsidised imports hit Australian industry can be illustrated by the pork industry experience. By mid-year, processors normally start stockpiling products to prepare for Christmas demand. This puts a floor under the prices. But this year they did not start storing because they knew they could use cheap imports at any time to meet the demand. Also, as they did not know how low the imports would force the local price, they did not want to get caught with stock on hand. The availability of imports drove prices down and at the same time out of all proportion to the quantities that have come in.

         Subsidised products have brought Australian industries and companies to crisis point. Large international companies and governments are able to employ all sorts of techniques to disguise their dumping practices. In the pork case, subsidies reduced the normal price so the difference between the normal and export price was less than it would have been in the absence of subsidisation. As with the fork-lifts, large international companies can manipulate transactions between their overseas manufacturing company and their local representatives. They can practise dumping where the full costs of the sale are not reflected in the selling price in Australia. Nissan, in the face of a dumping notice against a Japanese trading house, has reverted to exporting trucks direct rather than through the trading house specified in the dumping notice, thereby avoiding the dumping duties altogether. Customs apparently has been aware of this alteration for months but has done nothing about it.

         The Minister in December 1989 instructed Customs to monitor the importation of fork-lift trucks within the various product lines to ensure that the intention of the controls was not circumvented by the importation of the particular model and its subsequent sale with another category rating. To date, despite much documented evidence, Customs has failed to make one wharf inspection or follow up the supplied information—and I hope Senator Cook, if he is going to—

         —I thank the Minister. In the fork-lift and pork cases, Customs did not invite further submissions on its changed direction, which has had the effect of reducing duties further. It issued the decision before it received a reply from the industry. Australian industries have to ask what more they can do to continue operating against the onslaught from dumped and subsidised products and against the way our anti-dumping system is administered. They spend their own resources on expensive and lengthy anti-dumping and countervailing actions without any government financial assistance such as their opponents receive. They take matters to the Federal Court at great expense. They assist and cooperate with Customs. They look for concessional by-laws against dumped components not made in Australia and find that they do not exist. They want to keep going employing Australian workers, developing their Australian industries and supporting other Australian component industries. Australian customers want to keep buying from them, but they are being blown out of the water by world surpluses of dumped and subsidised manufactured products finding easy entry into this country.

         All industries across the board are being affected. Many multi-million dollar operations are close to closing their Australian operations because of the damage being done by dumped imports. Vitally needed business investment is not taking place because of the uncertainty caused by dumped competition. Viable industries are on their knees after losing obvious anti-dumping cases. Even when a lengthy and extremely costly case is won, the industry is subject to overseas government-funded appeals in our court—and I hope Senator Button is listening to this. This can be aided and abetted by Australian retail chains with their dominant position in the marketplace. The same big grocery chains promoting themselves with `Buy Australian' campaigns are at the same time importing and bringing action against successful anti-dumping actions, as is occurring at present in the tomato industry.

         It is hoped that the reforms in this Bill will address some of the current problems in the system. However, the operation of our anti-dumping and countervailing laws is at the heart of the current major difficulties for Australian industry. The Government must be getting the same feedback from industry that I am getting—that our anti-dumping system is not creating a fair result for Australian manufacturers when faced by the many dumping practices adopted for imported products. The Minister's response when approached by suffering industries has been to give assurances that the offending practices will be monitored by Customs.

I support these Bills but urge the Government to take very seriously the irreparable damage being done to otherwise viable Australian industries by Australia being a soft destination for dumped and subsidised imports.

         —I wish to speak only briefly to the Bills before us tonight and to confine my comments to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, particularly to the amendments proposed by Senator Spindler relating to the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. Senator Spindler moved two amendments to schedule 6 of the Bill. The first amendment would have removed the proposed tariff reduction program for TCF products for the period 1 July 1994 to 1 July 2000 inclusive so that the tariff levels proposed by the Bill to come into effect on 1 March 1993 would remain at that level until amended.

         The second amendment would leave in place the out-of-quota controls on textiles, clothing and footwear which the Bill proposes to abolish. Neither of these amendments were supported by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on 13 November 1992. The meeting of that Committee, which I attended along with Senator Button, Senator Spindler and representatives from the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Council of Australia, was extremely interesting. I would like to share with honourable senators some of the major points that emerged from this meeting.

         —Senator Spindler has already mentioned that Mr Alan Trumble, the President of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Council of Australia, was present at that meeting. He also mentioned that Mr Trumble had said that in the 1980s the industry employed 120,000 people, and that as at March 1992 this had dropped to 76,000 people. Of course, what Senator Spindler did not tell us was that all of this drop in employment occurred while the quotas were in place and the tariffs were at their previously high levels.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The TCF Council said that, after March 1993 when the industry quotas cease to exist, employment in the industry will fall to 55,000. Mr Trumble stated that the reason for this dramatic drop is that the industry is trying to compete with Third World countries such as China, where the rate of pay for a 46-hour, six-day week is the equivalent of $A20. It is obvious that the TCF industry is labour intensive. The major reason why developing countries are so competitive is that they can supply labour at a much lower cost. Under our wage structure in Australia we can never compete with countries such as China. As Mr Trumble said, even if we get 5 per cent efficiency improvement per year, there is no hope for us to compete on that basis.

         The TCF Council is calling for the immediate introduction of import controls to safeguard the current market share for the local industry until an economic recovery is well under way. That is, it wants bilateral voluntary restraints in the form of quotas negotiated with developing countries. The Council is after quotas, not tariffs because, rather than relying on tariff protection to raise the price of imported T-shirts, the Council would prefer to limit the number of imported T-shirts sold in Australia.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The question I asked at the Committee meeting was whether the TCF Council wanted us to make a special exemption for the TCF industry over and above all other industries in Australia. The answer I received was yes. Senator Button at that hearing did not support this request from the industry. In fact, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . what you are suggesting here is that this industry should have a totally different treatment from every other industry in Australia by having quotas or high tariffs. I have to say that my answer to that is no; that cannot be so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Spindler supported the Council by saying that tariffs are useful in competing against other OECD countries, but against developing countries there is a need to have quotas. He then asked the TCF Council representatives whether the Australian TCF industry would be competitive with world standards, provided that there were no barriers in other countries and that they would not be asking for assistance if the Government were successful in getting other countries to remove their barriers. Mr Kreitals of the Council said yes, but he then said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Perhaps that needs some qualification. It strikes me as being a little too broad. If we take the prime developing country, China, unless we have quantitative restraint against China—on which it may say, `We have nothing against you'—we will not survive against that sort of situation because of the wage differential.
       </para>
       <para>
        This does not appear to make sense to me. It would appear from the evidence before the Committee that in our textiles, clothing and footwear industry we can compete against other developed nations, but that we will never be competitive against developing nations. Surely that is the point: why are we trying to compete against countries such as China, Korea and Taiwan? The only way to compete against developing countries is to place quotas on their exports to Australia. However, I think that is going down the wrong track.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Australia cannot single out countries such as China for quota restrictions. Either we have restrictions for everybody or we have them against nobody. The whole tenor of what the Council was saying was extremely pessimistic. As Senator Button said during that hearing, one would think there were no successful TCF businesses in Australia any more. But that simply is not the case. There are successful TCF businesses and they are the ones that produce high quality goods. However, there seemed to be some reluctance on behalf of the Council to admit that high quality was the way to go.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Council stated that it was dependent on Australia's clothing industry. This is a very narrow view. We cannot have a prospering TCF industry based on 17 million people unless it is heavily protected. The obvious answer is to export high quality goods. Furthermore, when I asked Mr Trumble from the Council for his reaction to people who say that the future of the industry lies in producing and exporting these high quality, well-designed goods requiring highly skilled workers, he replied that most of those exports were going to developed countries, which would indicate:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that we can have a competitive industry when needs be and that our cost structure is not obviously out of line in those areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        What does he mean by `when needs be'?  Does this mean that the TCF industry is competitive only when it feels it needs to be?  If the industry can feel the need to be competitive some of the time, why can it not feel the need all of the time?  I am sure that the majority of the Australian public would be concerned, if not horrified, by this statement. Why should the taxpayer prop up an uncompetitive TCF business?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another argument put forward by the TCF Council against abolishing quotas was that it believes thousands of jobs would be lost. Surely it has not escaped the Council's attention that the major loss of employment in the TCF industry from 120,000 in the late 1980s to 76,000 in March 1992 occurred while the industry received substantial assistance through tariffs and quotas. This loss of employment also occurred against the background of an economic recession. Who is to say that there is not going to be a further drop in employment, even if protection were to remain as it was during the 1980s?  In fact, Senator Button said at this hearing:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What I distrust most is the empty promise. I regard it as a totally empty promise that, if you had a stop in the tariff cuts and quotas for this industry, there would be no more closures . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Putting all this together, the bottom line appears to be that the TCF industry not only wants all international barriers to trade withdrawn but at the same time to reduce the amount of imports from developing countries. No other Australian industry has this form of protection, so why should the TCF industry have it?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Australia is good at producing many products, but we are unable to produce all our requirements. We should import those products that we are unable to produce or that we are not good at producing. If that means that our textiles, clothing and footwear industry switches to producing high quality goods which we can export to wealthier developed countries, that is what we should do. If it means that we import cheap T-shirts from developing countries, so be it. The Opposition supports the Government in abolishing quotas for the TCF industry under the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992.

First, I refer Senator Spindler to appendix 1 in the annual report of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, which was tabled in the Senate yesterday, and in particular to the import penetration ratios of textiles, clothing and footwear into Australia contained in table 9 on page 25. In 1986-87, the import penetration ratio for textiles was 56.9 per cent. In 1991-92, it was 54.3 per cent. In respect of clothing and footwear together, the ratio was 20.4 per cent in 1986-87, 25 per cent in 1990-91 and 27.7 per cent in 1991-92. There were four significant changes to the protection regime.

         The 1991-92 figures show that the import penetration ratio for clothing and footwear is 27.7 per cent. For all other manufacturing, it is 31.1 per cent. Senator Ferguson wondered why this industry is singled out for special attention when it has that relatively low import penetration ratio in clothing and footwear. The textile import ratio has always been quite high—about 50 per cent—because we do not produce certain textiles in Australia or textiles of certain qualities and so on. The whole argument really turns on that sort of information.

         On page 27 of the same report, there is a table showing wage and salary earners in these industries. According to the ABS figures produced here, the 1991-92 figure of 80,000 has come down from a high in 1986-87 of 108,000. That is no different from other industries. The figure for total manufacturing in the same period has gone from 1.04 million to 908,000. So the fall in TCF as a percentage of manufacturing decline in employment is 8.8 per cent. I commend Senator Spindler to a reading of some of these figures. Policy has to be made on the basis of facts and not on allegations made by particular vested interests.

         —All right, six. He said that there had been some factory closures in those towns. That is true and that is difficult, but nothing he advocates will stop that problem. What worries me about Senator Spindler's views on these matters is that he is going around holding out false promises and false hopes to people as a populist thing, which will not get anybody anywhere. Senator Spindler will presumably move his amendments in the committee stage of this legislation and we will oppose them. Let us be clear about that. But I warn him now that he will have to do it with a better factual argument than he has put in this debate to date. It is sometimes said that there is a lot of theatre in politics. But one cannot resort to theatre of the absurd when policy making. That is what I am afraid is happening here.

         Senator Archer, in his contribution to the debate, said that he wants a preliminary finding on dumping in five days. That is not possible. It does not happen anywhere in the world. It is contrary to GATT. I know that it is Opposition policy in Fightback, but it is quite clear amongst those in the Opposition who have thought about it—when we last dealt with this matter I had a discussion with Senator Short about it—that that is quite an impossible proposition. It is warm and comforting, but it is quite impossible.

         —The amendments to be moved by the Government were considered by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs at a hearing on Monday. One reason for referring this matter to the Committee is that it was apparent that these amendments, if enacted, would enable union bosses to transfer from the State to the Federal jurisdiction where there is not a system of compulsory arbitration in the State. It was also apparent that this legislation was squarely aimed at Victoria. In fact, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) said so in either his second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum.

         This legislation has been a shambles from beginning to end. It was cobbled together after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a statement in respect of the Victorian legislation. That is reflected in the fact that we were given amendments very indirectly earlier last week and given some 24 hours to look at them. Even subsequently since those amendments were put forward, another set of amendments has been tabled here in the Senate today. They were cobbled together in haste for no other reason but to appease union mates.

         The original amendments would have had unintended consequences in New South Wales and would have caught enterprise agreements in New South Wales with up to a three-year lifespan. Those enterprise agreements are put together in New South Wales in such a way that they vary from some 18 months to three years. During that period the agreements remain intact and can be varied only with the agreement of both the employers and employees. The amendments as introduced last week by Senator Cook would have caught those New South Wales enterprise agreements. New South Wales itself has a system of arbitration and yet within that period the agreements cannot be altered.

         It is possible to foresee a situation in which a union may well want to access the direct bargaining features of the Victorian legislation, or in any other State where similar legislation is enacted in a way that makes life for an employer uncomfortable. That employer might wish to apply to a State industrial relations commission but be vetoed by a union in getting access to that commission and thus be forced to deal with the union and its ability to apply its particular brand of pressure in the field.

         The Commonwealth regards that set of circumstances, should it obtain, as not desirable and that employers should have the right to apply to the Federal Commission to transfer the award. Similarly, it is possible to contemplate that the boot could be on the other foot and a union may wish to apply. This legislation requires that, should either party wish to apply, there has to be some satisfaction by the Federal Commission that it is the employees' choice to make the application where it be a union and that they support that. That means that there is a clear choice.

         What we have before the chamber now is the outcome—albeit within a short time—which has observed the necessary courtesies of consultation, exposure, accommodation, redrafting and presentation in a more final form to the Senate. The hallmark of this Government is to engage in that process. The process was not one that was engaged in—if one cites the State of Victoria—vis-a-vis people covered by Federal awards in the Federal jurisdiction when that State Government enacted State laws which in our contention affect the rights of those people under Federal laws. However, this is not a matter on which we simply wish to engage in a political debate to score points. They are the clear facts of the matter and I commend the legislation to the Senate.

I understand Professor Craven is a newly appointed consultant to the Kennett Government to advise on this sort of legislation and other changes in legislation in Victoria. I respect the right of any government to employ outside consultants. I certainly have no objection to the Victorian Government employing Professor Craven. He is clearly an ideological soul mate of the Kennett regime in Victoria. He has certainly written previously on a whole range of issues, particularly concerning State rights. His view on State rights is in about 1856 in support of the colonies. If he had been alive in 1891 or 1896 he would have been opposing the Federation as affecting State rights. That is his view.

Over the last 20 years the States have dragged their feet to stop Federal governments—Labor and Liberal—from signing the international civil and political covenants and the various protocols. I do not excuse some State Labor governments for being just as tardy as State Liberal governments in delaying the signing of these protocols. Delaying the signing of those protocols has meant that Australia is not up to the mark in its human rights obligations. The reason Australia is not up to the mark is that State governments have used the State rights power that Professor Craven is so keen on to stop the accession of those accords and the ratification of those conventions.

         I find it hypocritical of people such as Professor Craven to talk about human rights and claim that federalism is the greatest protection of human rights. In my view, over the last half century in this country State rights have done more to restrict human rights than any other single concept. I look forward to seeing Professor Craven supporting the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, which said that in a number of cases we ought to accede to various conventions—including ILO conventions which are mentioned in the legislation.

         Senator Cook mentioned that he felt there had been sufficient consultation. It is interesting that in the submission that was given to the Committee, the Victorian Government indicated its view that this was the most intrusive exercise of Commonwealth power since World War II. According to the Victorian Government, there are no national emergency circumstances which support or justify this move. The only basis for it is to allow a privileged group, the trade union movement, to flee from a modern industrial relations jurisdiction—one which the democratic expression of a State parliament has set up and which the trade union movement does not like—to the one which preserves and now seeks to extend pre-existing privilege.

It further shows that there is no other State in this country which will be affected by these amendments. Senator Cook showed that, despite any protestations that he may now make. The transcript is writ large. Undoubtedly, when this Bill is challenged before the High Court, the words of Senator Cook will be very carefully read in this regard.

         I was intrigued by some of the comments of Senator Schacht. Senator Schacht is regarded as one—and, Mr Acting Deputy Chairman, you will know this—who has a particular interest in human rights. I do not dispute that this is of particular interest to Senator Schacht. He regularly comes in here and reminds us of his views. All of us welcome a concern for human rights. One of the problems that I have with Senator Schacht is—and I have said this before—that when issues on human rights come into conflict with Labor Party interests, he always comes down on the side of Labor Party interests.

         Complex issues are involved here. There is the issue of the Federal principle. I would not demean this country like Senator Schacht did when he came into the Senate and said that Australia was remiss in its human rights records. I do not pretend that we are perfect but, by the standards of human endeavour and by the standards of most countries, Australia has been astonishingly successful. It has an absolutely outstanding record over a very long period in its concern for human rights. It is a pity that a man who is concerned with human rights feels so free to demean his own country in this area.

         I also differ from Senator Schacht in that I believe one of the mechanisms that many countries that are democracies have put into place in trying to protect human rights is a mechanism to enable the effective division of power. Along with Professor Craven, I believe that the Federal principle—the Federal Constitution—is one of our protections. It is one of those protections which helps divide power. That is one of the reasons why I strongly support the Federal principle. It is a pity that if people differ with Senator Schacht, who holds himself out to be such a strong advocate of human rights, they are liable to cop the proverbial Labor Party bucket. Many people in the area of human rights would see that the division of power is important. Professor Craven would have much support in thinking that the Federal principle and the division of powers is an important way of protecting human rights.

It was a central feature of the electoral campaign in Victoria.

         —Senator Schacht has had his say: can I have mine? The Australian Labor Party ran innumerable advertisements. There was a great deal of shock horror stuff, as one can imagine in an election campaign, warning people about what may happen if a Kennett government were elected. A Kennett government was elected and was able to record the greatest electoral victory in Victoria, certainly since 1907, and arguably in 150 years of Victorian political history. For the thrust of its industrial relations policy the Kennett Government received an overwhelming mandate from the Victorian people.

         When a government is elected and has a clear mandate, is it entitled to put those policies into effect? I would have thought that the man who talks about human rights in this chamber more than anyone else might have been able to reflect on that issue. I strongly hold the view that the Victorian Government had a very clear mandate to put its policies into effect. However, those policies do conflict with the interests of the trade union movement and, therefore, with the interests of its political arm—the Labor Party. As a consequence we have particular amendments before us.

         Again on the human rights issue, one of the interesting features to come out of the hearing of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was that there is no comparative country in the world which insists on compulsory arbitration as one of the great inalienable rights of its industrial relations system. Apparently Australia is unique in this regard. So all those countries which Senator Button, Senator Schacht, Senator Cook and others like to quote to us do not have a system which insists that across the whole economy there be a system of compulsory arbitration, which apparently is so vital in this country that we have to override the Federal principle, which I—in contrast to Senator Schacht—happen to believe is extremely important.

         Another matter I wish to raise—I do not agree with this, but I accept that there is an argument for it—is that I am always worried where a country such as ours, a democracy, should make its own laws and those laws should be interpreted in tribunals and courts which reflect the composition and values of the Australian people. I am far less comfortable than Senator Schacht in ceaselessly relying on ILO conventions and other mechanisms. Nonetheless I concede that there is an argument, although I am not comfortable about it. Again I go back to my basic principles that Australia has dealt with this better than most other countries.

         I ask the Minister whether he can point to the ILO convention which the Victorian Act appears to transgress. It is an important point because those opposite constantly speak about ILO conventions. It will be interesting to see whether, in the Minister's mind, there is any particular ILO convention which the Victorian Act transgresses. If it does, because it does not see the inalienable right of compulsory arbitration, it would suggest that an awful lot of countries are also outside the ILO convention. Perhaps the Minister, in his future remarks, could turn his mind to and point out the particular conventions which he believes the Victorian Act transgresses. Perhaps he can also indicate whether, if there is not such an Act, it is correct that interpreting the ILO conventions is a matter with which the Commonwealth Government in particular should concern itself or whether, as was put in the submission by the Victorian Government, it is more a matter for the relevant ILO body.

         However, it is quite clear that the legislation will apply to other States if a State government in Australia chooses to force workers into a position where they have no choice but to accept an enterprise agreement or a one-to-one agreement with an employer without the protection of an award and without the possibility of going to a tribunal to have it adjudicated.

         I think it is perfectly reasonable that if there is a disagreement we do not resolve it by fighting in the streets, by industrial action, but that we do it in a civilised manner under the protection of arbitration legislation. When we say that a State government has the right to initiate whatever legislation it chooses, particularly if it claims to have had an electoral mandate—although I suspect that the voters of Victoria never suspected that they would be placed in the sort of position that the Victorian legislation is placing them in—we should not forget that a State is a part of Australia, indeed that Australia is a part of the world, and that there are certain common standards of human behaviour that apply to all.

         I turn to the issue of whether other countries have similar legislation which at the behest of one party, employer or employee, enjoins the other party to appear before a tribunal to have a difference arbitrated—the so-called compulsory arbitration. I think we should also consider that most other countries that do not bother to have such legislation have actually a legislated right to strike, which Australia does not have. I think that is a factor that in most cases explains the absence of this particular legislation.

         Basically, we have the choice between whether workers should be forced into enterprise or individual agreements without regard to arbitration or awards, and whether we should put up with the instability, the industrial jungle warfare that this will cause and the loss of profits, stability and predictability and, ultimately, the loss of jobs that this will create. Will that happen, or do we want a system that adjudicates the differences that employers and employees may have in a civilised manner and according to law? I would suggest that this is the central question that is at issue. The Australian Democrats come down firmly on the rule of law rather than the rule of the jungle.

In fact, he has made the remark in the past that he has met employers unnamed who would like to remain under the existing system. Is it not a fact that under the Victorian industrial relations legislation, if an employer and his or her employees wish to remain under that system with a form of arbitration, they are entitled to do so? I would also like to ask, following up on the question by my colleague Senator Kemp, is it not a fact that relevant ILO conventions are concerned to promote the practice of voluntary collective bargaining and actually to prevent the imposition of compulsory systems?

         This nonsense about a mandate and about the industrial relations policy repeated just recently for our benefit by Senator Parer—all 15 words of it—did not include any mention of the emasculation of the Victorian IRC; it did not include any mention of the poll tax; it did not include any mention of the leave loading. No wonder the Victorian people recoiled in shock. They are in a state of shock all right, and I dare say they are welcoming this opportunity to return to the conditions enjoyed by the rest of Australia. Therefore, we support these amendments.

         —I would also like to make some remarks about the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 and pick up a couple of points that have been mentioned here tonight. When examining this legislation, the first thing we have to do is to look at what the real intent is. The real intent of this legislation is to centralise power in Canberra. One cannot interpret it as being anything else. It certainly disappoints me when I hear Senator Powell, Senator Bell and Senator Spindler being part of that process.

         The federal system—the role of the States and the role of the Commonwealth—has been very important in the history of Australia. When we examine what is behind this legislation we should look particularly at proposed new clause 3A(ba). There is no question or doubt in my mind that this clause, which says `to facilitate access to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and prompt settlement of industrial disputes', will end up in the High Court of Australia. I make the same prediction that I made when the legislation dealing with the super- or mega-unions of more than 10,000 members came into this place that, in time, such legislation will be overridden by the High Court.

         I firmly believe that we should be cognisant of and take into account the likely outcome of the legislation we are putting in place. I would put it to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), to Senator Powell, to Senator Bell and to Senator Spindler, that deep down they probably also expect that that will be the result of this legislation. They are adopting a position for short-term expediency because they think they can get some political capital from the mandate which was given to the Kennett Government in Victoria. That is what this legislation is all about. In particular, that is what this amendment is all about. It is a direct attack on the Australian Constitution because it quite clearly leaves out the additional words of section 51(xxxv) of the Constitution—the words `extending beyond the limits of any one State'.

         I believe that this legislation will change only for a short period the face of industrial relations in this country. It is going to override areas in which traditionally the States have operated. As we all know in this chamber, in the 90 years of industrial relations in this country, there has been a joint State-Federal system. There have also been some moves, albeit slowly in recent times, for some decentralisation or deregulation in terms of that industrial system.

         This legislation will turn back the clock in terms of the little that has been achieved so far. It will not turn it back for very long for two principal reasons: firstly, as I have already mentioned, it will not stand up to the test of the highest court in this land; and secondly, it will not be very long before this Government is out of power.

We must admit, as is perfectly obvious, that Senator Cook is an expert in the field of industrial relations from the union point of view. He has had years and years of experience and he knows what he is on about. The Democrats have no idea—not only on this issue but on just about every other issue debated in this place. Senator Cook knows it is unworkable. That is the reason why it has been agreed to. I will give the Committee the reasons for that. The Democrat amendment talks about the outcome of any consultation between an organisation of employees, as does the Government amendment, by the way in which it is couched in somewhat similar terms. It has no definition in it whatsoever as to what is meant by `consultation'.

It means having a secret ballot of those people who the union does not even know exists and who, incidentally, do not want to know the damn union. There is no recognition whatsoever in that amendment of the employers being consulted by the employees or the unions. There is no obligation for the union to consult the employees nor for the views of the employer to be made available to the Commission. I will not prolong the debate, except to say that they are the reasons why we oppose this amendment.

The test is: what is the view of the employees concerned in the area that is covered by the relevant State award? The Commission is enjoined by our motion to take that into account. The amendment requires that the Commissioner must take it into account and must be satisfied that there has been an exercise of an appropriate expression of view.

         In some circumstances the Commission may regard that the parties reporting to the bench following documented meetings would be sufficient. In other cases, particularly where doubt by a respondent has been cast upon the case for the applicant, it may be that the Commission wishes to remove that doubt by ordering a ballot and doing so for part or whole of the people concerned. It seems to me that that is a reasonable thing. The practicalities or the difficulties would obviously be something that the parties might address themselves to in order to encourage the Commissioner to form a view about logistical possibilities or the practicality of what is being sought. The Commission, as a practical body, no doubt will make a wise decision in each particular case and a decision relevant to each particular and peculiar set of circumstances. So I have no difficulty in accepting the amendment.

         In conclusion, I would add that if the Opposition votes against this amendment, it will be a surprising departure from all its rhetoric. That rhetoric has concentrated on propagating the pretence that industrial relations decisions are not always democratic. It may well be that in some cases they are not democratic, and where that occurs that is to be condemned. But it is not the case that universally they are not democratic, and in my experience in most cases they are.

         The propaganda of the Opposition has always been that somehow this is a manipulation by union bosses and the Opposition has been strong in proclaiming the need for secret ballots to test that situation in any particular set of circumstances. Here is an option where it can be tested—and it seems to me that the remarks of the Opposition are to shrink from that possibility for fear that perhaps the decision may not flatter its own case.

        I had made the point that the Government, in moving that amendment, had conveniently left off a portion which relates to our Constitution. During the debate in this chamber on the establishment of mega-unions with a minimum membership of 10,000, the Government was told by me and other speakers that that legislation would be challenged in court and that in time, and at great cost, it would be found to be unlawful. That, of course, is what has happened.

         I particularly want to make the point that the Government, Senator Powell and the Australian Democrats know full well that this legislation will end up in the High Court. In due course, I believe that the High Court will rule that the legislation contradicts what is in our Constitution. The Government, Senator Powell and the Democrats are going down this particular course in the knowledge that that would be the most likely outcome and that such a challenge would impose an enormous cost on a whole host of people in this country. Therefore, they should be more responsible in terms of bringing legislation before this chamber when they know what course it will take and the cost that will be borne by individuals as a result of the High Court challenges which are made.

         I particularly make this point because we have consistently heard not only from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in this place but also from Senator Tate, in his capacity as the Minister for Justice, and others that there must be easy and cheap access to the law. This is cheap political point scoring, because the Government believes that it can get some political advantage out of this move, despite the fact that the Kennett Government was given a very clear mandate for addressing the many problems in Victoria in a whole range of areas, particularly industrial relations. In Victoria, the worst of the excesses which occur are mainly perpetuated by two people—Mr Halfpenny and Mr Wally Curran, who has been involved in the meat industry.

         The Government is being totally negligent in its responsibility to pass legislation which will stand up in the highest court of the land. I will develop that point a little further. If this amendment to the Act were so good and so important to decentralising and deregulating the labour system in this country, the Government would have moved on it on its own merits and not on the basis of how high it should jump in response to what has occurred in Victoria.

         There is no doubt that Western Australia is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, defender of the rights of the States in determining certain things which come under their jurisdiction. I have previously made the point that this legislation will have an impact across all States. The whole basis of this amendment and what is being attempted to be done will wind back the clock for industrial relations in this country. It is not a movement away from the centralised wage fixing system that we have had in this nation; it will centralise it even more. As such, it will be detrimental to the economic performance and well-being of this nation and to the very people whom it is supposed to protect.

         I was particularly interested in Senator Schacht's comments about human rights. I believe it is very important that industrial relations reflect the broadest possible definition of human rights. Approximately 30 per cent of members of the Australian work force, probably less today, are members of unions. I challenge the Government to put this legislation to a referendum of employers and employees across this country. If it did, I doubt whether the Government would get close to having that 30 per cent support. The greatest portion of people in the work force in this country have made a decision not to be a member of a union, to stay out of the industrial relations system and to negotiate totally free from the industrial regimes that we have in this nation.

         The impact of this amendment in terms of the fundamental rights of the federation of the States will come back to haunt this Government. It will create an enormous cost that should not exist. This legislation is put forward on the basis that a failing government thinks it can get some political capital out of it. But I do not believe that that is the case. In fact, in a very short time, we will see this legislation going down the drain because it is in direct contradiction of and conflict with the Constitution of this nation.

That survey, which was jointly run by my Department and the peak employer body in Australia, found that 55 per cent of small businessmen preferred awards for the simple reason that they knew and understood them. They could reach for an award, find out the base rate and offer a prospective employee five or 10 bucks over the odds, shake hands on the deal and then get on with their business. They did not have to sit down and negotiate a complex agreement; it was all laid out for them. It was convenient, they understood it and they cherished and supported it. I cite that as an example.

If a Victorian employer and union choose to opt for arbitration under the Victorian Act, they can have it. I have no objection to that part of it.

If employers are vetoed, I think they should have the right to arbitration to settle a dispute, and that unions or workers should also have that right if they are vetoed by an employer. The right should be equal. Where they both agree, we have harmony; ergo, no problem. Where they do not agree and one is using veto powers against the other, we have a problem and one which ought to be solved in a civilised way. In this country that is access to arbitration.

         —The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has vast experience in industrial relations, certainly from the union side, so he is well aware of the practicalities as opposed to the theories that abound. I think he would probably agree with me in private moments that the legalism that exists within the industrial relations system is a pain in the neck to all parties. I ask the Minister: does the legislation not mean that any union in Victoria can manufacture a phoney paper dispute? In the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Minister when referring to disputation said that he did not mean strike action, he meant in disagreement form; so any union can manufacture a phoney paper dispute with an ambit claim, with which most employees are familiar, simply to force the change from a State award to a Federal award. In other words, it is an engineered situation. In this economic climate, why is the Government prepared to continue to play silly games, or to allow the unions to continue those silly games, when what is desperately needed is reform of this antiquated and inflexible system?

         On the subject of how a dispute is created, I could not agree, and I do not think any judicial body in Australia would agree, that the finding of a dispute in the manner practised by the Federal Commission could be called phoney. I do not think that is a fair comment at all. It is in conformity with the Constitution, wherever it has been challenged it has always been upheld, and it is a method of getting the matter before the Commission in order that it be resolved. What the community is interested in is that disputes are resolved and that they are resolved peacefully, without disruption, and in a way in which industrial life can continue uninterrupted and preferably in a more harmonious way. The mechanisms provided by the Federal Commission allow that, and one should acknowledge it. They cannot be called phoney.

         My final comment is in relation to a question Senator Crane put to me earlier. Among all the speakers here this evening, Senator Crane has probably spoken most about the alleged infringement of States rights in this debate. Senator Crane and I both come from Western Australia, a State that vigorously proclaims its own rights. I would contend that this legislation does not infringe States rights. I think Senator Crane should be aware of his own Party's policy. That policy clearly states that, if the States do not agree to the system of industrial relations the Opposition is proposing, all heads of constitutional power will be used to shift the State jurisdiction to the Commonwealth, save the external affairs power. If Senator Crane is a loyal adherent to his Party's policy, he is in favour of taking industrial relations as practised by the States from the States, using every head of power in the Constitution save the external affairs one. He has been constant and loud tonight and, indeed, indignant about the invasion of States rights. If there is ever a chance for the Opposition's policy to be tested, I trust he will be consistent.

         I conclude these remarks by drawing the Minister's attention to a magnificent speech given in this Parliament some 61 years ago by Joseph Lyons when he walked out on the Labor Party. In that speech he covered many aspects of the Party's policies at that time, including the Arbitration Court. The Minister may be interested in what Lyons said:

         The big issue before the people at the last election was the maintenance of the Arbitration Court and all that that tribunal stands for. Have we maintained that court? On the contrary, we have done everything possible to thwart it. Every means by which it could be prevented from functioning has been adopted, even up to within the last few days, and at the table on Wednesday night, the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. Blakeley) said, "We shall do it again." If we had to say to the people, "We shall maintain the Arbitration Court, and stand by it so long as its decisions suit us but will upset it if they do not," the people would have swept us out of existence on that occasion as they did the other party.

         I ask the Minister to reflect on the words of Joseph Lyons. He walked out on the Labor Party because of a number of aspects, but because of that aspect in particular. I suspect that history may be repeating itself when the Government undermines the people's trust in an institution, while at the same time pretending to build it up. The Government is leading this nation into a potential crisis, and seems to be walking in blindfold.

The shorthand is to recognise the registered unions acting for and on behalf of their members and the incorporated entity of the employer acting for and on behalf of itself, either as a respondent or as an applicant, as the case may be. That does not raise any questions of discrimination. The Commission would need, as a preliminary procedure, to satisfy itself that any application lodged before it by a union arose from a properly constituted meeting of the union and represented the views of that union—that union being defined, of course, as its members.

         The big error in a lot of the logic the Opposition argues is that it sees the union as some sort of disembodied organisation, acting without reference to its own rank and file. I think we will find that the Commission is at pains to make sure that what is put in the way of claims is properly minuted and documented and reflects the views of the organisation. The fault the Opposition falls into is to shoot the messenger and ignore the message. If this legislation is adopted by the Senate and the House of Representatives and becomes law, it will be interesting to see how many people in Australia wish to vote with their feet to access this Commission. There will be no surer sign of their will than their taking those initiatives.

         In the debate about enterprise bargaining or individual work contracts, the tendency is to forget that the awards in the private sector prescribe a minimum rate, by and large; frequently and almost invariably, employers—maybe not so much in these more difficult times but in ordinary times—pay a little more in order to indicate their generosity and loyalty to their employees, which is quite legal. It happens all the time. It may contain an element of individual negotiation. So be it. No-one wants to regulate it. It is all lawful and has all the infinite flexibilities that anyone could want. The flexibility it does not have is to break the law, which is to say, not pay the minimum conditions and standards provided for in an award.

         The other thing I should say is that if an employer in a particular case feels that the award standards are too high and too onerous and would run that particular company into financial difficulty, then all that employer needs to do is to apply to the Commission and the Commission can exempt that employer from an award or impose less onerous conditions. The fact that this avenue is rarely resorted to suggests that there is a lot of talk about inflexibility but not much real action on the subject when it is put to the test.

         Furthermore, since the Commission would need to be satisfied that the allegations of the employer are true and would want to see the books of the employer to be sure that that is the case—very few employers are prepared to be open about their allegations and provide evidence of that character and to that level—the option is there and is exercised from time to time. It is one of the options that tends to be ignored in this debate but it is indicative of the flexibility of the system we have.

         I had not meant to go into that sort of detail, but I was taunted by the interjection of Senator Chamarette, who apparently is prepared to say `tut tut!' to people such as John Halfpenny, and neglect the incredible damage done by people such as him to families, to single income families and to those families where there is no wage-earner. Such people have brought about the sort of tragedy we have seen. That fact cannot be avoided. The Democrats should respond to the comments by the person who founded them.

We are not voting for the Bill, we are voting for the amended Bill.

         I share one of the opinions expressed there that if we have any capacity to reduce the authority of so-called bully boys in this then we should take that opportunity. We should not be like the hypocritical coalition senators who sit there and say that they want to do something about it. When coalition senators have the opportunity to vote in support of the concept and practicality of secret ballots, they cringe on the other side saying, `We must not vote because somebody else thought of it', or, `We must not vote for something because we are afeard that it will not do the whole job'. Was I knocked over by the clamour of Opposition senators rushing to my door to try to help bring about the system of secret ballots which would work? No. We just see them comfortably sitting back, with their usual hypocritical manner, saying that it will not work. Unable to amend and perfect legislation, they are gleefully rubbing their hands at the prospect that it might not work. I think this will work. That is why we are voting for the amended Bill.

        Like the Government, faced with the changing face of industrial relations in this country and as a member of this Parliament, I asked myself whether there was anything I could do, particularly as a Victorian. Having a look at many aspects of industrial relations as they exist through legislation in this country, it did occur to me that one of the things that this Parliament should be doing is to shift the secondary boycotts provisions—sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act—out of that Act and into the ambit of the Industrial Relations Act. This is not, of course, an inspiration of mine; it is not something that I dreamed up myself. It is, in fact, something which many people over a considerable period of time have also believed should be done and indeed have attempted to do. While my amendments have been in circulation in this chamber for some five days, the particular measures that these amendments put in place have been around for eight years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In 1984, the Hawke Government sought to do this very thing and failed to do so in this very chamber. The amendments that I am moving now are in exactly the same terms—apart from the fact that, because of subsequent or intervening changes to the Industrial Relations Act from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the necessary changes have already been made—as those which were put before this Parliament eight years ago by the Hawke Government. I will not go through all the rationale that was put forward then, I will simply say, as the then Minister Button in this chamber said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The principal objective of any regulation in this area—
       </para>
       <para>
        of secondary boycotts—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        must be the speedy, fair and effective resolution of the underlying dispute. This is not achieved by the legislative prohibition of secondary boycott activity. Indeed, provisions such as sections 45D and 45E may only serve to exacerbate a dispute and resort to them may result in a worsened industrial relations climate not only between the parties, but in the relevant industry as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is just one of the points of rationale that the Government put forward through Senator Button in that case in 1984. But it is not just the Government in 1984 which has put forward objections to the way the secondary boycotts provisions are placed at the moment in Australian legislation. The view expressed in 1984 by the Government is widely shared. It will probably upset the Opposition, but I will quote ACTU policy, and it may upset Government members if these amendments are not passed. The policy says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act prohibit a wide range of legitimate industrial action by unions, members and officials. They should be repealed at the earliest possible opportunity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Trade Practices Act is a totally unacceptable vehicle through which to attempt to regulate the legitimate industrial activities of trade unions. The Act should be used only for promoting free competition and fair trading by business enterprises.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Section 45D actions that have been taken against unions clearly demonstrate that the Trade Practices Act is not merely useless in settling industrial disputes but is positively harmful. The special characteristics of industrial disputes demand that they be dealt with under industrial legislation and not by recourse to the Trade Practices Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1991 in a direct request relating to convention No. 87 on freedom of association and protection of the right to organise, the ILO Committee of Experts also had a comment on Australia's secondary boycotts legislation. I will read from that request:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In its 1989 direct request the Committee noted that Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974, rendered unlawful a wide range of boycott activity and most, if not all, sympathy action. The Committee considers that both of these forms of industrial action should be permissible in certain circumstances. For example, it should be possible to impose boycotts in relation to health and safety disputes on construction sites where there are several different employers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The quote goes on to point out other areas where the Committee believes that such actions ought to be possible. It says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These considerations led the Committee to ask the Government to provide information as to the practical application for Section 45D and its associated provisions, and to indicate whether it had any plans to amend the 1974 Act so as to bring it into conformity with the requirements of the Convention.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee remains of the view that Section 45D and its associated provisions render unlawful certain forms of industrial action which ought to be permissible. Accordingly, it calls upon the Government again to take steps to bring this legislation into full conformity with the requirements of the Convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission itself, in its fourth annual report, as far back as 1978, said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commission would propose to limit court proceedings it might bring to cases affecting competition. . . because it is probably more appropriate that the right of private action or the Minister's right to bring proceedings should be exercised in cases not affecting competition. The Commission is a competition authority and it would seem desirable to avoid, where competition is not affected, getting involved in industrial disputes where the ultimate decisions as to the continuing or settling of cases may need to be taken by companies on commercial grounds or the government on political grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        When this Government was first requested by the ILO in 1989 to deal with the problem that it saw as posed by sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act, it responded by pointing out that its attempt to repeal the provisions in 1984 was defeated in the Senate, where the Government did not have control. It cited `strenuous opposition' by major employer groups and by the parliamentary Opposition. At this point, late in 1992, the Government faces an entirely different situation. Because of a change of policy by the Australian Democrats, the Government will now have no difficulty in gaining passage of repeal measures through this chamber. Obviously, it does not have any problem in the House of Representatives.

         Another change is the distinctly turbulent industrial relations scene at the moment with the advent of conservative State governments and the possible advent of a Federal coalition with intentions of bringing in a similar highly deregulated industrial relations policy. In this climate, surely nothing could be more vital than appropriate secondary boycotts provisions being in place. I say `appropriate secondary boycotts provisions'; I do not say `no secondary boycotts provisions'. My amendments are, in fact, relatively temperate as they are based on the eight-year-old amendments put forward by the Hawke Government.

         I first put forward this initiative back in October. Recently—in fact, just last week—a very disturbing element has entered into the debate, and that is the Western Australian decision against the BLF. The ruling was given that the union had acted against section 45D in mounting a picket, in spite of that picket being entirely peaceful and the fact that union officials had given instructions not to stop anyone crossing the picket or to direct or request anyone not to cross. That is a very disturbing development and a very recent example of the difficulties this legislation poses. Surely, then, this situation effectively denies the right to peacefully picket and, indeed, quite possibly the right to demonstrate. Such a situation should not be tolerated in a country where freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and freedom of association are supposed to exist. When Senator Button concluded the debate on the 1984 amendments, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The place for dealing with the industrial disputes is not in the hands of the Trade Practices Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already quoted from the Commission where it says that it agrees with that view. Indeed, it has agreed with it since the 1970s. Senator Button went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have said that on numerous occasions and we will say it again in the course of dealing with this legislation. It is a matter which was in the Labor platform well before we came to government. It has been a consistent position.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That consistent position was not particularly evident earlier this year when the Government supported a Democrat move to investigate these issues yet again, for another seven months or so, to a time beyond the next election. I put these amendments forward as a contribution in the spirit of the legislation we have before us tonight and in the spirit of the amendments the Government has already moved to this legislation, to ensure that the Australian industrial relations law and provisions are appropriate and adequate, and give access to all parties in any disputes and are, therefore, available to all Australian people who may wish to express their views and exercise rights under industrial relations legislation.

         As I said, there is a wide body of opinion that sections 45D and 45E put in place by the Fraser Government are inappropriate to deal with secondary boycotts. I believe my amendments are the most appropriate way that this form of action should be dealt with. They do not impede access to common law. In fact, they speed up the process of dealing with such problems with a 48-hour provision, with the Commission required very quickly to make a decision about whether or not it believes it can deal with any particular dispute and any particular boycott.

         I commend these amendments to the Senate. The Australian Democrats have indicated previously that they will support these amendments. It really is up to the Government at this point to take this further step. It is not a new step; it is one this Government has attempted to take before to give maximum availability to people to exercise their rights and to have protections under industrial relations law in this country.

         —I rise to make a few short comments in support of the amendments moved by Senator Powell to repeal the secondary boycott provisions known as sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act 1974. As I said on 12 October, when these sections were being referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, participatory democracy is extremely important to the Greens, and we support ways of allowing people at a local community level to challenge decision making that has been taken out of their hands. Particularly in relation to environmental issues, sections 45D and 45E challenge the right of direct protest. The voluntary conservation movement needs all the help it can get if there is a coalition government after the next Federal election.

         Community views on such issues as uranium mining, nuclear ship visits, nuclear technology experimentation, mining in national parks, forest destruction and hazardous waste disposal are often marginalised by government processes and vested interest lobbying. Protests against developments and discriminatory practices by companies come under threat also. On labour issues, sections 45D and 45E are unduly harsh and restrictive when compared with International Labour Organisation conventions on freedom of association and the right of free speech in the Australian Constitution. If anyone in this chamber needs an example of how restrictive these sections are, I refer them to a decision of a Federal Court judge, mentioned earlier by Senator Powell, on an action taken against the Australian Builders Labourers Federation, WA Branch, by the owners of J-Corp for forming a peaceful picket line outside the premises of a company. It stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In my opinion . . . the applicant has succeeded in establishing as against the BLF that by establishing and maintaining the picket line at the Riverdale site from 27 July 1992 it contravened s.45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
       </para>
       <para>
        This came at the same time as accepting evidence that no union official stopped anyone from crossing the picket, neither had they directed or requested anyone not to cross. Their mere presence was held to be in contravention of section 45D. As K.N. Reynolds, branch secretary of the BLF, said in a letter to the Trades and Labour Council last week regarding this case:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The implications for the trade union movement and indeed for any community protest are staggering. The right to peacefully picket at all is so constrained by this judgment as to effectively deny that right. Any party, person or group engaged in the picket is by cause of this judgment open to an interpretation by their mere presence of having threatened the supply and delivery of goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thus, I might add, being in contravention of these two sections of the Trade Practices Act. Community values have shifted to the right, as they tend to in times of recession, and the Labor Party has been dragged away from its roots by the pragmatic politics of government. At such a time, extending such interpretations of boycott brings us to a potentially oppressive situation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I can think of no more graphic an example of how these sections could be used against the conservation movement than the protest outside the Eden woodchip mill on Sunday, at which I spoke. There, 150 peaceful protesters rallied to draw public attention to the continued destruction of Australia's native forest by the woodchip industry. Yet the manager of the Eden woodchip plant had told all log truck operators to stay home and not attempt to deliver logs to the mill until after the protest had finished. Under the judgment of the Federal Court, those 150 people are liable under sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Another example is the longstanding and ongoing protest outside the old Swan Brewery in Perth, a protest which has the support of 78 per cent of the local community, who oppose that development. Even when it is clear that protesters are not attempting to stop workers entering the site, their mere presence is sufficient for them to come within the sanctioning powers of these sections. The court judgment reads:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The establishment and maintenance of the picket line involved an implied direction that it should not be crossed. Thus a boycott exists.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not expect that the coalition is willing to support the repeal of sections 45D and 45E. However, I would like to remind the Australian Democrats and the Labor Government that the repeal is part of their policy platforms. It is ironic that at a point approaching an election, where we still have the Labor Government—at least in name—it remains up to an independent senator to make the running on the repeal of sections 45D and 45E, with the support of a solitary Green, to be a voice for the Labor movement and its right to dissent, peaceful protest and freedom of assembly. I support Senator Powell's amendments and I urge the Democrats and the Government to do so also.

It would be rather amusing to attempt to do the same thing with Fightback, I am sure—distinguishing which version we are talking about would deliver us with utmost hilarity daily. To remain consistent with the policy which has been well established and which we endorse, of course we support these amendments.

         —It was about a month ago, on 12 October, that the Senate agreed, on the motion of Senator Bell, to refer this matter for inquiry to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. That was an occasion on which the Senate divided, with all parties voting one way and the two Independent senators, Senator Powell and Senator Chamarette, voting another way. The matter has been referred to that Committee, terms of reference have been given to it, and the matter now arises in this manner outside the Committee and outside the process agreed by the Senate.

         I have to say on behalf of the Government that it is indeed a little surprising. It was the Democrats in 1984 who defeated the motion that is now being moved. It is a little surprising too that, having referred the matter to a committee for inquiry, the matter should be indicated in the way in which it is. The Government is in the position of saying that we do not support the continued operation of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act in industrial relations. That would be consistent with the finding of the ILO. This matter is in the process of the Parliament inquiring and reporting.

For those reasons, the Government will not be supporting this motion tonight.

         —I want to make a few remarks about the amendments and endorse the comments the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) made just a short time ago. This matter has been the subject of debate within the Australian Labor Party for a considerable number of years. The Minister has indicated the efforts the Government has made in order to get a proper measure of legislation to govern the impacts of industrial disputes and secondary disputes. Those efforts were tried in 1984 and failed. The Minister went on to indicate that the matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training some two months ago. I am not exactly sure what that Committee has engaged in so far. It has had the reference for two months. I hope the Committee will expedite the inquiry and that when Labor is returned to the treasury bench following the next Federal election the Committee, after giving due consideration to the reference points in front of it, after listening to the evidence from employer groups, trade unions, workers, greens and independents, and the range of the community, will bring forward a recommendation. I hope the newly elected fifth term Labor Government will act immediately to implement moves to remove sections 45D and 45E from the industrial relations arena.

Sections 45D and 45E in the Trade Practices Act fit very badly with the other legislation because that really is devoted to two things: competition amongst businesses and consumer protection. This really goes to another issue relating to the sorts of restraints that should be imposed upon people who want to impose secondary boycotts and, in certain circumstances, even primary boycotts.

I think they should be a bit shamefaced in doing so—Senator Sherry put it another way—because without the Minister's reference tonight to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) would have had a great deal more difficulty in ducking the issue and not adhering to his Party's policy. When he first got up to speak tonight, the Minister rose to a challenge from Senator Parer and made the comment that there is a great difference between deft quickness and undue haste.

         The move on 12 October by the Democrats to establish a committee with a reporting date beyond the next Federal election was just such an act of haste. Senator Chamarette and I attempted to put an amendment which would have meant that if the Labor Party, which had had the policy for a long time, and the Democrats, who had had the policy for a shorter time, had needed more time, they could have taken until the end of November and we would have had a committee report now. But Senator Chamarette and I sat on our own that night, trying to tell the Democrats that they were making a wrong move. Now this Minister has been able to use the vehicle given to him by the Democrats to avoid the opportunity provided by these amendments to enact the policy of both of those parties.

It is a ducking of an issue; it is a ducking of party policy by both those parties in this chamber.

During his speech referring the matter to the Committee, Senator Bell put on the record that the Democrats are very mindful of the position of small business, and that they see the abolition of sections 45D and 45E as going hand in hand with the establishment of either a labour court or increased powers for the Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that there is proper recourse to adjudication of such a matter and that it is handled according to law, as I have had occasion to say tonight, instead of the law of the jungle. Senator Kemp should stop misrepresenting the position of other people when he either knows, or should know, what the facts are.

         —Some things are important, Mr Chairman. I have stayed around here much later at night on matters much more frivolous and on debates without such substance. It is now quite clear that everybody is going into this election with their position on the secondary boycotts legislation very clear; Senator Kemp has made that clear. But there is some lack of clarity in one area that I would like particularly Senator Kemp and his cohorts to understand and acknowledge. When we talk in the shorthand of saying we should repeal sections 45D and 45E and take out the secondary boycotts provisions from the Trades Practices Act, we are not throwing the secondary boycotts provisions to the wind. They are to be inserted in a very reasonable, rational, responsible, efficient and effective way under the appropriate umbrella of the Industrial Relations Act. I think that is a thing that needs to be said, to be fair. That is the first point I want to make.

         The second point may even encourage Senator Cook to save the time of members of Cabinet, because I doubt that they are going to disagree with the position they have taken for more than eight years—and, as Senator Button said, the position they took before they were even in government. The sort of noise and protest and campaigning—mostly, probably, a campaign of misinformation—against any such move as this, which the Labor Party has always been fearful of and which the Democrats have always been fearful of, is going to be just a drop in the bucket in the present industrial relations climate. Peter Boyle has got his work cut out telling us all that beggars cannot be choosers.

         Because of the turbulent situation in industrial relations in this country at the moment it seems to me that there has never been a better time to take this small extra step. To my mind the Government is doing the right thing as evidenced by its own amendments. There has never been a better time to take this small extra step, particularly as we go to the next election, and speaking as a Victorian, I say that with some vehemence. I just wish to encourage the Minister, even in the little time he has left, as the Chairman very slowly puts the question, to take a decision which I am quite sure his Cabinet will endorse retrospectively.

No-one raised the point at that time that somehow there was not sufficient opportunity.

          —History is important in this chamber because a lot of our behaviour is based on precedent. Is Senator Macdonald saying that, if at any time through some misadventure this did occur, a major amendment to a Bill would have been affected? We recommitted that motion without the Opposition having to go through the requirement of a contingent notice of motion or anything else. We offered to recommit it and then we lost that division.

          —I am talking to the contingent notice of motion that Senator McMullan has moved. Is Senator Macdonald saying that we were mugs two or three years ago to offer them that courtesy and that that will never be shown to this side? Ultimately what we want in this chamber, I think, is to reflect the views of the chamber and of the majority in the chamber, whichever way it goes. I think anyone would concede that the previous division did not do that. So I cannot see why we have to go through all the process at this time of night when a simple offer from the Opposition to recommit the motion could be made without any of this fuss, in the same way as it was made two or three years ago.

          —I support the Government's motion. I also support the view that Senator Ray is putting. However, if the Opposition wants it to be done the hard way, I am quite prepared for that. I support the Government's motion for a reason of substance, not for a reason of political point-scoring of any kind. This is an important piece of legislation made all the more important by the amendments that have been passed. Indeed, I relish the possible opportunity of the recommittal of the amendments that were not passed. Nevertheless, this is, in its present form, or in the form it had reached in the Committee, a vitally important piece of legislation. I am prepared to support this motion and to do anything else that is necessary to see its recommittal and its passage.

         —There are several matters of concern to which I want to draw the Senate's attention, arising from the Loan Council inquiry that took place this evening. We received no satisfactory answer at all from Mr Cole, the Secretary of the Treasury, as to why, for 19 days between 17 June 1992 and 6 July 1992, he did not report to his Minister, the Treasurer, that he had found a $1.3 billion blow-out outside the global limits of the loan arrangements. As I said, there was no satisfactory answer given at all, despite persistent questioning.

         There was another more alarming concern. Senator Coulter in the chair ruled in a very narrow way that the question of Mr Dawkins' failure to put into the Budget Paper No. 4 the fact that that blow-out of $1.3 billion, of which he, Mr Cole and the officers of the Treasury were all aware, was not within the terms of reference. It was a very technical and narrow decision, and I think it is one that has to be looked at thoroughly because, quite frankly, the Australian people want some answers.

         There was a further move by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, to intimidate members of the Committee into the sorts of questions they would be allowed to ask at the inquiry. I wrote to Mr Dawkins in the following terms on 15 December 1992:

        I have signed the letter and I have attached a copy of one of the letters that he wrote to the Committee which has indeed been published by that Committee. Most disappointing was the lack of information that officers were prepared to give today. When the Treasurer has a duty to be informed and the right to be informed, I think we have to take a very dim view of a Secretary who refuses to inform his Minister of a serious breach for 19 days with no good reason.

        This is for several reasons. Most importantly, by retaining domestic passes Customs is able to maintain its controls and prevent the passes from being reused or fraudulently altered. Allowing a passenger to retain a used boarding pass gives the passenger, or other members of the travelling public, the opportunity to reuse it later on an international flight in order to evade Customs attention. The pressures at the Customs barrier, where the passes are collected, are such that it is possible an officer would not notice that the date or flight on a boarding pass did not match the situation.

        Breaches, both unintentional and deliberate, have been detected where arriving international passengers have evaded or attempted to evade normal control procedures by using domestic boarding passes. The implementation of the recent reforms has increased this risk represented to Customs by domestic passengers. The increase in the number of domestic travellers could result in an increase in the misuse of boarding passes.

        Customs could tear the "D" sticker from the boarding pass so that it was no longer identifiable as domestic. The passenger could then proceed with the remainder of the pass. The disadvantage of this system is the added time required to perform the task, which could impact on facilitation rates and the effectiveness of Customs controls.

        It is not practical for Customs to develop alternate identity and security procedures, as a new "D" sticker has only recently been designed by the airlines in conjunction with Customs and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It is currently being introduced. The sticker will be attached to the front of the domestic boarding pass, and it will be an important identification and security document.
