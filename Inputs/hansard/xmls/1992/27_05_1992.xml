The Committee's terms of reference require it to resolve the fundamental question of applying community standards in the context of existing classifications for films, videos and literature to the new services of pay television, videotex and telephone message services. The Committee intends to bring down an interim report tomorrow in relation to recorded telephone message services. Next month, the Committee will hold a final public hearing in relation to the question of the suitability of R-rated and X-rated material for pay television. The Committee has decided that it requires more time to give due consideration to the issues of applying community standards to videotex and the soon-to-be-introduced pay television service.

        AVIATION FUEL REVENUES (SPECIAL APPROPRIATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill makes technical amendments to the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act to enable reductions to be made to the avgas Excise and customs Duty rate while preserving the Civil Aviation Authority's revenue entitlement under the Act. The purpose of the amendments is to permit the phasing out of the collection of that proportion of avgas duty that is directly attributed to the Department of Transport and Communications's aerodrome cost recovery programme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In August 1990 the Government announced its intention to transfer the remaining Commonwealth-owned aerodromes to full local ownership and to encourage aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan (ALOP) to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the number of aerodromes financially supported by the Government is reduced there is a corresponding reduction in Government outlays. The Government has given a commitment to the aviation industry to pass on savings through the progressive reduction of the rate of Excise and Customs Duty on avgas. This Bill will enable this commitment to be implemented.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current rate of duty on avgas is 27.480 cents /litre of which 3.010 cents is attributable to aerodrome cost recovery purposes. The balance of the duty is attributable to cost recovering aviation functions carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill enables the 3.010 cents to be phased out while retaining the existing level of revenue entitlements that the Civil Aviation Authority has under the present Act. At the same time the amendments enable the Civil Aviation Authority with the agreement of the Minister to vary the amount of revenue it receives for cost recovery purposes from the duty. This preserves the intent of the arrangements under the present Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill will allow immediate amendment of the Customs and Excise Tariffs to provide a 1 cent reduction in the avgas duty. A further 1 cent reduction in the avgas duty will take place when the combined number of Commonwealth Aerodromes and ALOP Aerodromes is reduced to 100. The final component of duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery programme is scheduled to be removed in June 1993 when the aerodrome transfer and withdrawal process is anticipated to be completed.

        BACKGROUND
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When this Government took office in 1983, most people would look to the age pension as their main source of retirement income. Superannuation was the preserve of a few, mainly the wealthy, and a substantial proportion of concessionally taxed superannuation savings was dissipated well before retirement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reform of superannuation has been one of the great achievements of the Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Over its term of office, the Government has greatly expanded access to superannuation savings. In particular, award superannuation has fostered the spread of superannuation to large areas of the work force which previously had no cover.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has also restructured the tax concessions for superannuation to make them more consistent with retirement incomes objectives, while still maintaining them at a generous level.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, access to superannuation concessions has been made substantially more equitable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These reforms have moved superannuation from being a concessionally taxed source of windfall gains for high income earners towards being a genuine retirement savings vehicle for most Australians.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When we came to office, 40 per cent of the work force had some superannuation cover; in 1991, the proportion was 72 per cent. On this basis alone, our reforms of superannuation are an achievement which the retirees of the future will value highly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Despite these reforms, there is an ongoing need to ensure that as many Australians as possible have access to superannuation. There is also a need to increase the average level of superannuation savings for each individual, if these savings are to provide an adequate level of retirement income. Consistent with these goals, the Superannuation Guarantee Levy was announced in last year's budget.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Superannuation Guarantee Levy represents another major step forward in the development of retirement incomes policy. It will lay the foundation for income security and higher standard of living in retirement for future generations of retirees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Superannuation Guarantee Levy provides:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        a major extension of superannuation coverage;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        an efficient method of encouraging employers to comply with their award obligations; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        an orderly mechanism by which employer superannuation support can be increased over time, consistent with the economy's capacity to pay.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Levy will consolidate the reforms implemented since 1983, and will provide a coherent and equitable framework in which retirement incomes objectives can be progressed. It will ensure that by the beginning of the next century, virtually all employees will be accumulating substantial superannuation savings to help fund their retirement income.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The increased self-provision for retirement will permit a higher standard of living in retirement than if we continued to rely on the age pension alone. The increased self-provision will also enable future Commonwealth Governments to improve the retirement conditions for those Australians who were unable to fund adequately their own retirement incomes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Lastly, self-provision will increase the flexibility in the Commonwealth's budget in future years, especially as our population ages and will increase our national savings overall, thus reducing our reliance on the savings of foreigners to fund our development.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In December last year an Information Paper was released for comment on issues raised by the operation of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy. The Government then undertook wide ranging consultations on the issues raised by the Information Paper.

        HOW THE SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE SCHEME WILL WORK
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill, which applies from 1 July 1992, will encourage employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation support for employees. Where employers provide less than the minimum level of superannuation support, they will be liable for a superannuation guarantee charge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The superannuation guarantee charge—which will not be a deductible expense for employers—will be used to meet the superannuation contribution entitlements of the relevant employee and will be used, as I discuss later, to fund administration costs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I should stress that this mechanism is not intended to be the principal vehicle for the funding of employees' own contribution entitlements. It is intended, instead, to be an incentive for employers to meet their own obligations, and to be a support mechanism for employees where those obligations are not met.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In introducing the Levy, the Government has been particularly conscious of minimising the labour cost impact of the Levy on employers. We have designed the Levy to be a floor under existing superannuation arrangements. All existing employer superannuation support, that meets the provisions of the Levy arrangements, will count towards the minimum prescribed level of support.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The level of superannuation support an employer is expected to provide will depend on the employer's annual payroll. For the 1992-93 year, employers with an annual payroll in excess of $500,000 will be expected to contribute 5 per cent of an employee's earnings base to a complying superannuation fund. This percentage will increase over the next nine years to 9 per cent. Employers with an annual payroll of $500,000 or less will be required to contribute 3 per cent increasing on a slower transition schedule to 9 per cent.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An employee's earnings base will depend on whether the employer was providing superannuation support for employees on 20 August 1991. Employers who, on that date, were contributing to a superannuation scheme which has an earnings base, can continue to use that earnings base so long as it is not reduced. This will help minimise compliance costs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In any other case, the employer will be assessed against an earnings base that the employer is required to use under an industrial award or a base not less than ordinary time earnings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Superannuation support must be provided through a complying superannuation fund in order to be counted towards the minimum level of superannuation support. The fund can be either a defined contribution fund or a defined benefit fund. In the case of a defined benefit fund, the employer will be required to obtain an actuarial certificate specifying the level of employer superannuation support implicit in the benefits available to employees in the fund. For all other funds, the employer's level of support will be based on the actual contributions made to the fund.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The level of superannuation support will be measured on a financial year basis for the 1992-93 year. However, where an employer has provided insufficient superannuation support during that year, the employer will be able to make up any shortfall in contributions by 14 August 1993.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has decided that from the 1993-94 year and subsequent years, employer support will be measured on a monthly basis. The employer will be expected to provide the minimum level of superannuation support either before or during the month (or within 28 days of the end of the month). However, if there is a shortfall in employer superannuation support, the superannuation guarantee charge will not be due until 14 August in the next financial year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If an employer does not provide the minimum level of superannuation support, a charge will be imposed on the employer. The charge will be equal to the sum of:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        the total of the employer's individual superannuation guarantee shortfalls;
       </para>

        an interest component; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        an administration component.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A superannuation shortfall for an employee is calculated by applying to the employee's salary and wages the percentage difference between the minimum level of superannuation support and the actual employer support.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The interest component is a proxy for superannuation fund earnings. The interest will be calculated from the commencement of the financial year until the time the superannuation guarantee charge is due to be paid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of the administration charge is to recover some of the costs incurred in administering the tax. The charge will initially consist of a flat amount of $50 plus an amount of $30 for each employee in respect of whom the employer has a superannuation shortfall.

        AWARD SUPERANNUATION
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has decided to support the inclusion in existing superannuation award provisions of the rates of contribution to superannuation funds required by the Superannuation Guarantee Scheme as they become operative.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government considers that, where there is no agreement between the parties to an existing award superannuation provision nominating a particular fund, the fund to which such additional award contributions are to be made should be determined by the relevant industrial tribunal looking to the best interests of the beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Superannuation Guarantee Scheme is designed to encourage employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation support. It is intended to improve the position of those employees who have inadequate superannuation coverage. It is not designed to provide a mechanism for a general increase in superannuation support for those employees who are already receiving in excess of the prescribed minimum level.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government expects that increases in the prescribed minimum level would not result in additional contributions in cases where employers were already providing superannuation support at or above that level.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course, parties are free to negotiate levels of superannuation support above the minimum as part of enterprise agreement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many employers already provide such higher levels, often through a combination of contributions to industry funds and employer funds. In such cases, the Government expects negotiations between the parties on a case-by-case basis would determine the fund or funds to which Superannuation Guarantee/award contributions would be made. Any breakdown in negotiations should be referred to the relevant industrial tribunal.

        COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 ("The CERC Act") and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 ("The OH&amp;S Act"). It also proposes technical, drafting and consequential amendments to other Acts.
       </para>

        The provisions of the Bill are explained in the explanatory memorandum. I propose to therefore confine my comments to the major amendments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The main focus of the Bill is to continue the reform of Commonwealth employees' compensation arrangements in line with the recommendations of the Brown Review of the Comcare program. In this, it fulfils the Government's undertaking that this would be done in the present sittings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees ("The Commission") which operated as Comcare, was established under the CERC Act. Its purpose was effectively to manage the Commonwealth Public Sector Workers' Compensation System. The Commission's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers was emphasised.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In December 1990, Mr Ron Brown, a Management Consultant, was commissioned to carry out a comprehensive review of the Comcare program. The Brown review involved consideration of the effectiveness of the Comcare scheme and recommendation of policy and legislative changes needed to better achieve the Government's objectives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The review acknowledged the success of improvements in workers' compensation arrangements and policy achieved by the commission since its establishment under this Government. Nevertheless it targeted additional areas where effectiveness could be enhanced.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In December 1991, the first step in implementing the Brown Review's recommendations was taken. The Commission was restructured as a regulatory body distinct from Comcare and with a separate chairperson. It is responsible for regulatory functions associated with the CERC Act and the OH&amp;S Act. This includes determining compensation premiums.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Comcare was restructured as a service delivery body, headed by its chief executive officer. It is responsible for commercial administrative and service functions under the legislation, including providing support to the Commission.

        The licensing of Commonwealth authorities to perform certain functions under the CERC Act in respect of their own employees under the supervision of the Commission;   and

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the CERC Act in 1988, provision was made for both Australia Post and Telecom to become self-administrators of the Commonwealth Workers' Compensation Scheme. This was for a two year trial period. Under these arrangements the two organisations were responsible for all aspects of the administration of the CERC Act for their employees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Brown Review recommended that these self-administration arrangements should end, and be replaced with a system of licences for self-insurance and in-house claims management.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill provides for the implementation of that recommendation. It does so in a way that is consistent with preserving flexibility and increasing efficiency in the operation of the Commonwealth's employee compensation arrangements. But, at the same time, it will ensure that the licensed authorities operate under an appropriate system of regulation by the Commission. That system of regulation will, among other things, ensure consistency of practice between Comcare and the licensed authorities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Commonwealth authorities will be able to apply to the Commission for licences under the Act. The Commission will have the power to grant or refuse applications, based on their consideration against criteria set out in the legislation. An application fee will need to be paid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new arrangements will allow the Commission to issue three classes of licence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A class 1 licence will allow an authority to operate as a self-insurer. The licence will transfer to the licensed authority all or part of Comcare's obligation to compensate its employees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A class 2 licence will allow an authority to determine its own claims. The license will transfer to the licensed authority, wholly or in part, Comcare's function of determining its employees claims under the CERC Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A class 3 licence will allow an authority to self-insure and determine the claims of its employees.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Licences are to be subject to a system of conditions set out in the CERC Act, as well as other conditions imposed on a case-by-case basis by the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The principal statutory conditions are to be requirements that licensed authorities comply with the CERC Act and pay their annual license fees. The conditions able to be set by the Commission will include conditions limiting the maximum liability for which a licensed authority may self-insure, or in respect of which it may make a determination. If a limit is imposed by way of a condition, then once exceeded, liability to make payments or to determine a claim, or both, will revert to Comcare depending on the class of license.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another possible condition to which a self-insurance licence may be made subject is a requirement that the licensed authority obtain specified bank or other guarantees or other specified securities.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government recognises that consistency, equality and independence of decision-making are of paramount importance in these processes, particularly at the review stage. Accordingly, the Commission will be able to impose a condition on a licence that the reconsideration of claims determined by a class 2 or class 3 licence holder be carried out by Comcare or another authority.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To ensure consistency and equality of decision-making, licence holders will be obliged to comply with guidelines issued by the Commission.

        In addition, the Commission will be able to give a direction to a licensed authority either generally or in respect of a particular matter or class of matters. Licensed authorities are to be required by the CERC Act to comply with such directions.

        Because a licensed authority will be bound, as a condition of its license to comply with the Act, a failure to comply with guidelines or directions of the Commission will involve a breach of that condition. The Commission will be able to suspend a class 2 or class 3 license or revoke a licence of any class for breach of any condition. It will also be able to direct a licensed authority to comply with conditions of the licence. The provisions of the Bill also detail the effects of a suspension or revocation.

        STATES AND NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANTS (RURAL ADJUSTMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill amends several of the provisions of the current Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) which was introduced in January 1989 following an extensive review. At the time of setting up this revised Scheme it was envisaged that it would operate in a more flexible and innovative way to address more adequately the changing structural adjustment forces acting in the Australian agricultural sector and to more closely match the requirements for assistance of individual farmers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the first years of the revised Scheme, the rural economy was generally buoyant but towards the end of 1990 it had become apparent that the sector was experiencing the beginning of a severe downturn and that a number of farmers were facing financial difficulties as a result of depressed commodity prices. This was to be the first real test of the adequacy of the Scheme. In Queensland and northern New South Wales the severe drought in 1991 exacerbated the difficulties being faced by farmers in those areas.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Department of Primary Industries and Energy undertook assessments in April and October 1991 to determine whether the assistance measures available under the Scheme were adequate to meet the pressures placed on individual farming families.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It became apparent as a result of these assessments that additional measures would need to be introduced to assist farmers with long term prospects, but in financial difficulties, as a result of the downturn. The resultant changes to the Scheme augmented the existing measures which would assist in maintaining the basis for an internationally competitive rural base. Funding was progressively increased from $62.45 million in 1990—91 to $193.91 million for 1991—92 and at present some 10,000 farmers are receiving RAS assistance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These variations, in conjunction with other initiatives such as the modification of hardship provisions under the Social Security Act have provided a safety net for those farmers facing severe financial difficulties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is provision under the Agreement to amend the terms and provisions available under the Scheme provided that the concurrence is sought from State and Territory Ministers. This provision has been particularly useful as it has allowed access to the assistance without delay. The first two amendments have been made by Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and Northern Territory. It is now appropriate to bring these amendments before the Commonwealth Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The third amendment being introduced at this time is to formally extend the Scheme to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Following self government, the Territory has assumed responsibility for program delivery. There has been very little demand for assistance under the Scheme by the Territory's farmers as there are only 230 farmers in the ACT of which approximately 25% would be assessed as being bona fide farmers under the criteria laid out in the Agreement. Under the current arrangements, New South Wales has been acting as an agent for the administration of the Scheme where there has been a need for assistance for ACT farmers. While there has been little demand to date, it is only equitable that those few genuine farmers in the ACT should also have access to the RAS.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The first initiative to be introduced was the new measure available under Part A of the Scheme entitled "Debt Restructuring with Interest Subsidies" or DRIS. Farmers, who have long term prospects in farming, but due to various reasons including low incomes, are not able to obtain further finance from their creditors, may be eligible for an interest subsidy on their existing debts. This measure was designed to improve farmers' cash flows. This provision has been applied with other measures available under the RAS, such as the support to obtain carry—on finance to meet the individual needs of farmers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Following the Prime Minister's Economic Statement in February 1992, additional funds were provided which will assist some farmers to plant broadacre and sugar crops in the 1992 winter and 1992—93 summer crop planting seasons. The crop planting scheme is designed to support the provision of working capital for crop plantings and raise confidence in the broadacre industries. For this purpose broadacre crops have been defined as cereals, coarse grains, oilseeds, peanuts and grain legumes. Needy producers in the sugar industry are also included. These industries are in need of working capital.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Assistance for crop planting has been available since March 1992 under Part B of the Scheme. Support is in the form of a 75 percent interest subsidy on their commercial crop planting loans. Under the terms and provisions that have been agreed with the States, to be eligible for assistance the farm enterprise should be profitable in the long term, but unable to obtain sufficient commercial carry—on finance to undertake normal cropping programs. Assistance will be limited to a maximum $10,000 subsidy and can be used for normal crop planting expenses such as wages, seed, fertiliser, fuel and repairs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the development of a national drought policy, the provision of relief for farmers affected by dry seasonal conditions is provided under Part B of the Scheme. This component supports farmers in financial difficulties through causes beyond their control, to obtain carry—on finance through the provision of interest subsidies on commercial borrowings. Part B assistance was activated in 1991 primarily because of the severe financial hardship being suffered by many farmers as a result of the low commodity prices, but this situation was compounded in Queensland and northern New South Wales by the severe drought conditions in the latter part of the year. Under the arrangements for the current Scheme, funding for Part B has been shared equally by the Commonwealth and the States. In recognition of the difficulty of some States to provide matching funds, the Commonwealth agreed in October 1991 to alter the funding contribution. Under the revised funding arrangements for Part B, the Commonwealth will provide two dollars for each dollar provided by the States.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Scheme has, in general, withstood the considerable pressures exerted by the downturn and drought. These new measures have contributed significantly to the effectiveness of the Scheme. They have complemented the measures already available under the Scheme as well as a number of other Commonwealth and state programs that have also been under similar pressure to support the rural sector through this crisis. Evidence suggest that 1991—92 will prove to be the lowest point of the adverse conditions in the sector and that 1992—93 will see a recovery.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Scheme is currently being evaluated in line with Government policy of regularly reviewing the effectiveness of its programs. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy  will be reporting on the outcome of this review to the next meeting of the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand at the end of July. The evaluation may recommend the need to further modify the Scheme in order to meet the primary objective of ensuring structural adjustment in the industry. The manner in which the Scheme has coped through the downturn will be closely scrutinised, in particular its effectiveness in assisting to modify the effects of future downturns in the farming in Australia.

        Whilst the proportion of young people remaining to the end of secondary school has virtually doubled in a decade, and student numbers at our universities have risen by over 50%, this is not the case for TAFE. While student demand for TAFE and training has continued to increase strongly there has not been the growth experienced in the other sectors.

        Discussions between the States and the Commonwealth the funding issues raised by the Finn Report are still in progress but this funding initiative, when taken together with other funding initiatives announced in the Prime Ministers "One Nation" statement, will contribute markedly towards setting funding for vocational education and training on a proper basis.

         —When we adjourned this discussion some weeks ago, we were considering questions relating to the ADCNET program, the Australian diplomatic corps network program of computer procurement by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Committee of the Whole will recall that there have been a number of questions raised about the tender process. The question principally that I was concerned with, both in the Estimates Committee and in the Committee of the Whole, was whether or not the awarding of the contract to HP was done in a manner to effectively exclude products from an Australian company, Labtam, in respect of terminals for the ADCNET program. The Government has recognised the need for departments to ensure, so far as is possible, that Australian and New Zealand goods and services are given a fair go. The tender document stated:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has directed Commonwealth agencies not to draw up purchasing specifications (including technical, performance and delivery requirements) so as to exclude A/NZ products which are suitable, or reasonably adaptable, to Commonwealth needs, or to evaluate offers in a manner which is biased against Australian and New Zealand suppliers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The structure of the tendering process in this instance was considered by the Department to require a company that was tendering for the project to give the total solution. Because of that, the principal tenderers were all foreign owned companies. So far as Labtam was concerned, it was required to offer its terminals through Hewlett-Packard which, so far as the terminals were concerned, was one of its principal competitors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Questions relating to that matter proceeded between the Department and me at Estimates committee hearings where I indicated, when discussion was foreclosed on this matter, that there would be a number of questions that I would want answered. I am grateful to the Department for addressing this particular matter in the detail which it has. I am not satisfied with the responses in a policy sense. I am not suggesting that there is any bias on the part of the Department whatsoever. I feel, however, that there is an inherent bias in the structure of the tendering process. We have a situation where an Australian firm, under this particular tendering process, was required to go through a competitor to have its terminals considered by those who were authorised by the Department to consider the network as a whole. It is impossible, in the Committee of the Whole, to go into the details of this.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So far as the Australian producer of terminals is concerned, it has been recognised by many people, both here in Australia and internationally, that its terminals rank amongst the best in the world. It is impossible to take forward these matters of the detailed considerations of the Department's responses in the Committee of the Whole. I understand that Labtam has put this matter before the Commonwealth Ombudsman and presumably that is where the matter can be considered in detail.

         I appreciate the fact that the Department has addressed this issue and is taking extremely seriously the questions that I raised on the matter. However, it is still my view that consideration should be given to the tendering process to ensure that Australian manufacturers feel confident that their products can be taken on their merits and that they do not have to go through a competitor for the purposes of having their products considered for inclusion in such a major networking system.

In turn, I acknowledge the remarks he has made about the underlying policy considerations that are involved in his concerns about this matter. I assure him that the Department and the Government generally will take very much on board the purport of those remarks and will see what can be done to give companies like Labtam, which are unquestionably effective, good Australian performers, a better chance in the future when major projects of this kind are involved.

So DFAT plays a very relevant part in this matter.

Then, on 18 March this year, there was another immigration request concerning Mr Symons, Senator Richardson's good friend, who was trying to get a Taiwanese national, who was the son of an investor, into Australia. Of course, he was to come into Australia as a consultant. That well known company Multiplex in fact wrote and said that it wanted this particular Taiwanese person to come into Australia. As our only representation in Taiwan is a commercial one and it has to be dealt with by another post—and that post, of course, is the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—I wonder whether the Minister could tell me what records he has in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade relating to this particular matter on or about 18 March this year.

        That pretty well exhausts the range of matters that Senator Bishop seems to be concerned with. My point stands that DFAT has no direct involvement in this.

         There tends to be constant confusion in the public mind on these matters.

I say that knowing full well that the Minister only became responsible for Austrade in November last year. However, he has been responsible for the DIFF scheme.

I do not want it to be limited to the granting of a grant; I want to know whatever correspondence he has from Mr Symons concerning Taiwanese nationals.

Before we had started on Finance, a matter arose which showed that the Minister misled the Senate on this matter.

        Austrade was asked by my Office to look for information relevant to the Symons affair, as well as being prompted by your press releases and Freedom of Information requests to conduct a search on its own behalf. A direct request from the Prime Minister was therefore unnecessary.

        This question appears to be based on a misunderstanding on your part, in that Austrade has already made clear that neither Mr Symons nor Feedtech Pty.

        Having answered the specific points raised in your press release, let me now address a more general issue relating to the EMDG Scheme with which the coalition parties seem to be having some difficulty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The EMDG scheme provides taxable cash grants based on eligible export development expenditure already incurred: ie. quantitative and evidentiary rather than qualitative and discretionary criteria are the basis for payment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Those quantitative criteria are rigorously applied to EMDG applications by Austrade's Investigation Officers in much the same way a tax return is assessed by the Taxation Office.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because the criteria are quantitative rather that qualitative there is no margin of improper external influence. Eligibility criteria are either met or they are not: end of story. This also ensures that the scheme can be administered efficiently and effectively at a cost of about 1.3 per cent of grant funding.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I trust I have gone some way towards correcting the confusion which seems to prevail in Opposition discussion of this issue—confusion which I might add did not seem so prevalent in the Opposition's support for the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No2) which followed a thoroughgoing review of the EMDG Scheme and was enacted in December 1990 after debate in both Houses.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Your colleague, Mr Ian McLachlan, the Member for Barker, in speaking to the EMDG Bill, referred to it as `a piece of quite complex legislation enacting complex changes to a scheme which involves a plethora of eligibility criteria, rules and definitions.' (Hansard, 14/11/90)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In your press release of 19 May 1992, only 18 months later, you refer to your `call for a review and tightening of the eligibility criteria for Export Market Development Grant EMDG) awards.'
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Coalition supported that legislation. It had no concerns about the eligibility criteria being loose or unsatisfactory at that time—in fact, based on the Member for Barker's comments, it is reasonable to assume that at least some in the Coalition found the eligibility criteria too stringent and restrictive.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Your recent `call for a review and tightening of eligibility criteria' sits a little awkwardly with this position.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In light of this, the deep concern your comments have aroused among the many Australian businesses who benefit from the EMDG Scheme is an unnecessary and disturbing development. I am sure you are aware of this, as many of the letters I have received on this matter over recent days have also been copied to your Office.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All are concerned that the `review' you are calling for will limit the effectiveness and efficiency of a scheme that they value very highly. One writer even claimed that he had information that the scheme was going to cease operation as of July 1 this year. As you know, these fears are totally unfounded and are based upon your campaign which is largely politically motivated.
       </para>

        I seek your cooperation in quelling these fears and enabling the companies involved to concentrate on what they do best developing export markets.

        A clear statement for you reaffirming the Coalition's support for the EMDG Scheme and indicating any further Coalition policy intentions in this area would be one way for you to inform all those concerned about where they stand.

         —The first item on the running sheet is Appropriation Bill No. 5. It is dealt with on page 5 of the report of Senate Estimates Committee B. It is also dealt with, I think, in the reservation. More particularly, it was the subject of a considerable amount of discussion during the hearings of Estimates B and that is why it is specifically mentioned on page 5 of the Committee's report to the Senate. The report reads:

        The Department advised that alternative measures to introducing an additional appropriation bill, such as using the Advance to the Minister for Finance or not fulfilling contractual obligations, were considered. It was proposed that the AMF would have been placed under considerable pressure if requests from the three programs involved were received simultaneously, as was anticipated and, together with Parliament's expressed opinions on the use of the AMF, the view was adopted that it was preferable to be specific so that Parliament knew exactly the purpose of the appropriation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That part of the Committee's report was based on the assertion by the Department and by the Government, through Senator McMullan, that there were contractual obligations that required payments to be made during the April and May period of this quarter for child-care relief and one or two other purposes. So the whole of the Government's approach and the whole rationale—the whole underpinning—for the extraordinary, unprecedented action that was taken in the introduction of Appropriation Bill (No. 5) was that there were contractual obligations that had to be fulfilled.

Even if it were said only once, there would still be a question as to why it was said. It remains my advice—not a matter of my personal knowledge or expertise—that under the two headings relating to urgency, that is, contractual obligations or normal expectations of people with regard to regular payments on which they may be relying, there are payments which arise relating to Appropriation Bill (No. 5). That was my advice. That is why I said it then. It remains my advice.

         Let me draw Senator McMullan's attention to what I think we both agree are the more legal documents. In each document there is the term `the Minister may provide funds' under a  certain payments schedule. In other documents it says that `subject to the availability of funds' the payments will be made, and so on. The handbooks issued in relation to some of these programs—I am looking at the child-care relief handbook—and the associated guidelines seem to go beyond the Act and the agreements that have been undertaken as a result of the Act. But the legal underpinning of the handbooks, the guidelines and the agreements must be the Act of Parliament. The Act of Parliament does not, on my reading, contain a mandatory provision for the payments in the time period that the Government said was required.

         —Senator Short raises an important question. I think anyone listening would probably find it very arcane and detailed and obscure. Nevertheless, I recognise that there is an important underlying principle about accountability. Because I regard this as an important matter, I will check and get a written response to Senator Short if there is anything to add. My understanding is that the legislation authorises the Minister to enter into contracts and, once a contract is entered into, authorised by legislation—although the details of it may not be specified in the legislation—the contract is binding on the Commonwealth.

If, for example, there is a suggestion that the guidelines go beyond the authority of the Act, I will check on those things, because they should not do so. They may be authorised by the Act to do things beyond the Act, but they cannot do things which are not authorised by the Act. I will check on those things. If there is a problem, apart from advising Senator Short, I will draw it to the attention of the responsible Minister. My understanding at the moment is that the Department of Finance is satisfied that these things are being done in accordance with the law and that the appropriations were warranted, according to the criteria I outlined before.

         On 26 or 27 February the Government introduced two Bills—Appropriation Bills No. 3 and No. 4—in the normal due process of additional estimates and additional appropriations. That is proper, accepted practice. It did it on the basis of its best understanding of its financial, revenue and expenditure requirements until the end of the financial year. That is the way things are normally done. Within four weeks of having done that, the Government said that it was forced to come into this Parliament and say, `We got it wrong only four weeks ago. Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 do not really do the trick. We got that wrong. We have to amend them before they have even been considered properly by the Parliament, and we have to introduce another Bill'. Apart from the legalities we have been talking about, that smacks of gross financial incompetence. It is a point the Government is bound to respond to because it is typical of what appears to be happening at the moment in the financial administration of this country.

         Two weeks ago the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, admitted that there was now going to be a Budget deficit for this year of $9.3 billion, when only three or four weeks earlier—despite the discussion, which Senator McMullan will recall, that we had in Estimates Committee B about the forecasts and the Budget estimates—the Government had been sticking very dogmatically to its forecast deficit for the year of $6.8 billion. Within three weeks it was forced to make an admission that it was $2 1/2 billion out. Even that $6.8 billion, which was announced in the economic statement of 26 February, was a further blow-out of an estimate that had been given as pretty firm by the new Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, in January, just a month earlier, that the deficit for this year was going to be $5.3 billion.

         That one in turn was a forced admission from him, after severe questioning by the Opposition and every economic commentator in Australia who follows these matters, that the original Budget estimate of $4.7 billion was not going to be achieved. That was the Budget estimate last August. It has now had three revisions: in January to $5.3 billion; in February to $6.8 billion; and on 11 May to $9.3 billion.

Now Senator McMullan has come into the Senate and said, `I'll have another look at it'. I put it to him frankly that that is not good enough. He should have had all those answers weeks ago. This was due to be debated two or three weeks ago, and still he does not have the answers he should have had then, if not in the Estimates Committee when this was raised.

         The reason we were bogged down in a bit of detail about contracts is that Senator Short raised what was to me a new question, to which I was trying to respond, concerning the obligations which were entered into being beyond the power of the relevant authorising legislation. To the best of my knowledge, that question has not been raised before—certainly not according to the material that I have before me at the moment. If it were true, it would be an important point and therefore I undertook to pursue it. I did not have the answer because the honourable senator was raising something with me which had not been raised before. This is not actually directly relevant to the Department of Finance. However, it does relate to this appropriation and I am happy to pursue it. As the honourable senator would know, the legislation and the contracts to which he is referring would actually be the responsibility of other departments. Rather than hide behind that, let us pursue it and see whether it is accurate because if it is accurate, it is important.

         The core of the question is that if Appropriation Bill (No. 5) had not been passed, hardship would have been caused to many individuals, companies and charitable organisations. It would have been irresponsible not to do so, and that is why we did it. That should be put on the record. This point has not come up today because we have been pursuing the legislative underpinning of the Bill. But, fundamentally, without it unnecessary and unwarranted hardship would have been caused. Therefore, we introduced the Bill and it would have been irresponsible not to have done so.

         What it boils down to is that, had the Government got its act right so far as its financial forecasting, administration and management were concerned, all of this would have been avoided. Appropriation Bills (No. 3) and (No. 4) would have provided the necessary amounts, unless there were contractual obligations which made that impossible because of the time involved in Senate and other consideration of the Bills. As I say, the necessary supporting evidence has not been presented to the Senate to say that those legal obligations were there.

         With that as a background, I point out that on 30 March Senator McMullan claimed that almost all the amounts were due and payable on 1 April, which was only two days later. I think that was in relation to child-care. Yet, in fact payments could not be made, as I understand it, for at least seven to 10 days later, based on the time needed to obtain royal assent and other due process. That seems to me to mean either that the pressing need was not as pressing, or that it was going to be met from other sources.

         —My understanding, and the information I have before me, is that there are payments with regard to child-care fee relief from the AMF in April. If they were made—and that is not immediately clear to me on the information in front of me—they were to be subsumed within Bill No. 5. Therefore, the Advance would have been compensated for that. The payments were anticipated in April on this document I have, which I think is very similar to that which was before me on the night of the discussion in question.

In terms of explaining what were the implications for the Department's capacity to meet all its payments, that would depend upon information in the possession of that Department.

         As Senator Short has indicated—and I think we have the same documents—there was a payment from the AMF to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services for child-care fee relief of $32m in April, and that which was anticipated might be required was, on the figures available, $67m. It is not clear from these documents whether the Department of Health was able to meet all its obligations on 1 April with the $32m.

It is absurd to suggest that the role of the Department of Finance with regard to a government proposal would be the same as its analysis with regard to any other. For example, all the expenditure proposals in One Nation are subject to continuing analysis by the Department of Finance like any other Government expenditure proposal, as Senator Short well knows. He is very well informed about those things. Unlike some of his colleagues, he would be aware of that role and would understand it.

         The Government's costings of those things, based on the advice from, amongst others, the Department of Finance, are public and available for scrutiny by others. That is as it should be. Proposals that come from elsewhere which have potential Budget implications—whether they are from the Opposition or from significant community groups, industry or whatever—are assessed by the Department of Finance on a quite separate basis because they do not emerge from the normal processes of the Department; they come from outside and, therefore, are subject to a quite different sort of scrutiny. Inevitably, and without any cause for surprise, alarm or concern, that is the normal course of events. It could not conceivably be otherwise. I think the question was, have I thought about it any more? The answer is no, I was satisfied on the day.

         I am not saying that Senator Short was implying that; I want to make sure that the record is clear. The role the Department of Finance plays rigorously within the Government is to review departmental proposals to ensure that the assumptions are sufficiently rigorous and take sufficient concern for their implications for revenue. It would not be surprising if that were the case because that is a fairly standard function about which many departments express concern from time to time when they have disagreements with the Department of Finance. In my experience, the Department of Finance nearly always wins. History tends to vindicate the Department's judgments very often.

         I do not want to get into a debate about the nature of the documents. I do not think that that is an Estimates matter. The fact that they were developed and the debate we had about how much it cost to do it are matters for an Estimates committee. What is in the documents is for political debate in other forums.

         I want to test this one out a little further in the light of the discussions we had at the time of Estimates Committee B. We have now received—I think we may have received it in the course of those discussions—correspondence in relation to this matter between the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance going back to June and September 1987. Yet it was only in the past few months that the fact that the Department of Finance was in effect acting unconstitutionally was discovered, or at least recognised. That was done essentially as a result of an audit by the Auditor-General.

         —We are playing games again. I have been at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee dealing with a very important issue, the introduction of the new legislation concerning the Australian National Audit Office. For that reason I was unable to be in the chamber. I know we have a problem because the Senate rules that committees ought not to sit while the Senate is sitting, but that is a joint committee and, as such, there is a dilemma between rulings of the House of Representatives and the Senate. So I note Senator McMullan's very clever, `too smart by half' answer, that he has already answered the question. I wonder whether somebody who is present could possibly tell me what he said.

         —Madam Chair, I am sorry about this. The situation is that I am quite happy to cooperate but Senator Short asked leave to conclude dealing with that section so that we could deal with extra matters that Senator Bishop wished to raise. I was happy to cooperate, and so we stopped dealing with this section and went on. I am simply saying that that is the point at which we stopped. Senator Short asked the question. I said then, as I think I said to the Estimates Committee—I do not think I added anything extra but perhaps I did—that of course One Nation was analysed by the Department of Finance, as all government expenditure proposals are analysed by the Department of Finance, and the Government's costings based on that advice, amongst others, were made public and have been subjected to scrutiny by independent commentators since that time.

         It has always been the case that the analysis of government expenditure proposals is conducted through a different process from that used to analyse all other proposals, emanating from any non-government source—whether it be the Opposition, an independent commentator, an interest group or whatever—by definition, because all proposals as they are developed within government are subject to the constant review and analysis of the Department of Finance. That is its primary task although, as Senator Bishop and, before her, Senator Short correctly said, there is an ongoing brief to the Department of Finance to assess matters of public debate which may have budgetary implications.

An even-handed analysis of the One Nation statement and the Fightback package has not been conducted. They were in fact—by your own admission—subject to different types of analyses. So having got no for an answer, I will ask this question. For the purposes of the analysis of the Fightback package by the Department of Finance officers, did the officers use the special model built by the Department of Treasury?

What I cannot say at this stage—but will say when the officers of the Department of the Treasury come here—is whether the model had in any way been refined between the two stages. I do not know that. It is a matter which is not—as far as I know—a secret, so I will ask when the Treasury officers are here.

         —Clearly, Senator McMullan has a very curious understanding of the English language; the distinction between criticism and abuse is great indeed. If he referred to Senator Cooney's speech yesterday, and if he chooses to read the one previous to that when we were dealing with a censure motion of Senator Richardson, he would see that as well as being able to discern that I am capable of being extremely critical when it is necessary, Senator Cooney also paid me some very nice compliments. I would recommend those to Senator McMullan as well but I would not expect him to manage to find them by himself. That is why I have referred him to them.

         I want to go back to the very precise point that I was making. Senator McMullan stood there and purported to tell us that on the advice of the people in the box next to him the treatment of the two statements was the same, except for a `minor refinement'—that was the first phrase—and `a slight alteration' which was, I think, the second phrase. The fundamental point that I want to have on the record is that the advisers sitting in the box have not the faintest idea whether the parameters, the equations—or anything else in the model—were changed for the purposes of treating the Fightback package and treating the One Nation statement. Yes, we can quite accurately determine that when we come to Treasury. But at the moment, as I said, it is wrong for Senator McMullan to try to say that there was no difference, when he simply has no knowledge of it and when the advice that is conveyed to him is such that he can answer, `I do not know'.

I think we have to acknowledge that the Department of Finance played an important role in the analysis of the Fightback package, just as it did when it was in the care and control of Senator Walsh when he was the Finance Minister, when he attacked the economic action plan, using Finance officers quite improperly to do so prior to the last election. We are concerned that people are aware of the fact that this Government, this Executive, is choosing to politicise particular officers within departments and that we find that unacceptable.

In other words, his task is to see that taxpayers' money is properly spent, and accountable to the Parliament.

         From time to time we find many areas where we are indeed concerned at the way in which the Executive tries to fetter that independence and, indeed, to limit his mandate. We expressed in that report concern that there should be an audit committee of the Parliament established which would break the power that the Executive presently has to limit the function of the Auditor-General by limiting the financial resources made available to him. The Committee report was very strong on the point that an audit committee could break that nexus and make the Auditor-General truly independent.

         On the question of mandate, we were drawing attention, in respect of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, to the fact that the question of mandate should be fully recognised. That means that the auditor for government business enterprises, as well as government departments and other agencies, should always be the Auditor-General. He has the power to use the private sector by way of contract. That is being done, and most successfully done, but at the end of the day it is the Auditor-General who is the auditor for that enterprise. At every stage we are concerned about making the Auditor-General truly independent and truly appear to be independent.

         However, something has come to my attention which worries me greatly. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to tell me whether it is true. I understand that the Australian Labor Party is building a new building opposite the National Press Club here in Canberra, and that the major tenant of the Australian Labor Party will be the Australian National Audit Office. If that is true, it is a scandal. I would ask, right at the beginning: is it in fact true that it has been negotiated that in this building, on which the Australian Labor Party cannot be spending less than some $80m—and I would love to know where the money is coming from, and perhaps that is the real reason for the amendment to the disclosure provisions coming through—the Australian National Audit Office is to be a tenant of the Australian Labor Party?

         —Mr Chairman, to say that I think that is a scandal is to put it mildly. It is absolutely appalling that someone so important to the question of scrutiny should be the subject of a tenancy to a political party. I would ask that all documents, negotiations, letters, and terms and conditions relating to the payment of lease be tabled in the Senate so that they can be there for all to see. I would suggest that, when we are looking at legislation that is to come in to replace the Audit Act, there should be some provision made to prevent this scandalous affair whereby the Australian National Audit Office—or, indeed, any department of the Government—can be a tenant giving rent and income to a political party. I ask that all those documents be tabled in the Senate: leases, negotiations, quotes, tenders—the lot.

         —Firstly, I make it clear that there is nothing unusual about government departments being tenants of political parties. There have been government tenants in McEwen House for as long as I can remember—I think since it was built—quite correctly and quite appropriately; I do not have any disagreement with it. Let us put that in perspective. It has been the case, I would have thought, probably for 20 years. I may not be correct about that, but it has been a long time and, as far as I know, it is still the case. It is some time since I checked that it certainly has been the case. With regard to the Auditor-General and the Audit Office and their tenancies, I will refer that question to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis).

As I have said, the Public Accounts Committee has been at great strength and at great pains to point out that the Auditor-General must be truly independent. The Auditor-General cannot be seen to be truly independent if he is a tenant of a political party, let alone the political party that is in power and an Executive that tries to limit his function. Not only have things got to be done correctly in this world; they have got to be seen to be done correctly.

         On the question of scrutiny and the powers of the Auditor-General, he has to be above temptation, above suspicion and above being pressured. To have his office in a building owned and operated by the Australian Labor Party is simply not acceptable.

         —My question is to the Foreign Minister. I refer to the Minister's revelation in Question Time yesterday that his Department has a file note of a conversation on 6 April between the Minister's adviser and a departmental officer in which the Minister's adviser was told of rumours circulating in the Marshall Islands that Senator Richardson had been in contact with the President and possibly other Cabinet Ministers in the Marshall Islands. That is a file note for 6 April saying that the rumours were that Senator Richardson had been in contact. I ask: when was the Department advised by its post in Micronesia that Senator Richardson had been making these calls? On what dates and under what circumstances did the Embassy in Pohnpei report the existence of these rumours? What calls did the Embassy in Pohnpei understand had been made, and when?

         The document in question is a handwritten file note dated 6 April. It notes a phone call to the officer in question, Mr O'Leary in my Department, from Mr Peter Stanford, who is our Ambassador to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, based in Pohnpei.

        That is the line that appears in this particular file note. Notice the status of this document. It is a file note recording a telephone conversation from our Ambassador in Pohnpei, who in turn is reporting what he has heard that day from the Marshall Islands. He has heard official news that people have been arrested—Australian citizens—in circumstances that are manifestly of interest to the Department, as these things always are, and he is reporting a rumour that has been circulating that day in Majuro—a `suggestion that Richardson has been ringing members of Cabinet and President seeking leniency'.

         The Ambassador is reporting it on the basis, I am able to further advise the Opposition, of his contact with an Australian official based in Majuro and someone close to the Government. The rumour is one in the terms expressed. The rumour is that what Senator Richardson was doing was ringing not just the President but the President and members of Cabinet—more than one phone call. The other substantive thing in the rumour is that what was involved was not a mere request for denial of a passport to be overturned to enable him to prepare his defence but, rather, seeking of leniency. But rumours—these sorts of things—have a life of their own. That is why they are rumours. That is why courts distinguish between rumours and evidence.

         What actually happened is that Senator Richardson's account—which the Opposition has heard from him publicly, first, in his public statement of 28 April; secondly, in this Parliament on 29 April and on a number of days subsequently; and, as to my part in it, also in full in the Parliament on 29 April; and, further, in Senator Richardson's account that he gave in his report to the Prime Minister on 18 May—is quite different from the terms of that rumour. There were not multiple phone calls but one phone call only to the President—a short phone call in circumstances which are fully described on page 6 of Senator Richardson's report, as well as in other places. There was a short phone call in which Senator Richardson made clear he was holding himself out not as a member of the Australian Government but as a private citizen, doing so on behalf of a family connection, and not seeking leniency, not seeking in any way a reaction to the substantive matters in issue, but simply addressing the question of the passport.

         —The political situation in Thailand is obviously still very fluid at the moment. The political parties remain deadlocked over the formation of a new government. A new Prime Minister is yet to be named. The constitutional tribunal is expected to meet today, 27 May, to consider the validity of the royal decree which gave amnesty to all parties involved in the violence in Bangkok last week, the handling of which issue is obviously of crucial significance to the whole political future of the country as well as to the reaction of other countries such as Australia.

          We are hopeful about the prospects for a peaceful solution. The resignation of General Suchinda was obviously a positive step which could well prove to be not just significant in resolving the current crisis but also a major development, a watershed perhaps, in the evolution of the Thai democratic process.

         The horror which we all felt as the details of the violence became clear in the course of last week was, I assure the Senate, wholly shared by me. The fact that I did not make public comment about it was simply because I was overseas, badly out of communication in terms of the evolving events, and needed to be fully apprised of the scale of it and the responsibility for it, because of the policy consequences that flowed from that analysis. I say now for the record that I was absolutely appalled by the violence.

         I am further appalled by the fact that there is now compelling evidence that a great deal of the death toll was a result of deliberate actions by a number of senior Thai generals. The size of the death toll is still unclear. Latest figures suggest that there are as many as 589 people missing on current compilations and, unhappily, it does seem reasonable to assume that a very large proportion of those—if not all—are, in fact, dead. We would hope and expect that there will be a satisfactory formal accounting for the events which took place and there are already strong pressures within Thailand itself to that end.

         —My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to his advice to the Senate yesterday that a departmental officer, Mr O'Leary, had faxed to the Minister's office on 6 April documents relating to Mr Symons's contact with the Australian Embassy in Washington. We now have a copy of the file note that refers to the fax having been sent. I also refer to the fact that yesterday the Minister said that his senior adviser, Mr Kupa, had no recollection of seeing any of the faxed documents and that his office had no record of the faxes. I remind the Minister that he filed a statutory declaration by Mr Kupa to support Mr Kupa's claim in some way. Of course, in doing that he attacks the credibility of Mr O'Leary. I ask the Minister: what inquiries have been undertaken in the Department to verify Mr O'Leary's claim that he had, in fact, sent the documents? Is there not a record in the Department of the faxes sent? Is there not a record in the Minister's office of faxes received, such as a fax log? What opportunity has been afforded to Mr O'Leary to substantiate his claim that the faxes were, in fact, sent?

I have only one copy of this, but Senator Hill is welcome to look at it if he doubts me. There is no doubt that the departmental record at that end of it suggests these faxes were sent.

         The Opposition can get positively orgiastic over there with excitement about this, but the truth of the matter is that in the particular context in which these events were occurring this was pretty small beer information and not the kind of thing that would justify any particular excitement. In the normal course, if faxes go astray, they are followed up at the departmental end or at our end. And faxes do go astray; they get misfiled or gathered up and put in the wastepaper basket when they should be routed somewhere else. In this situation, the Department did not follow up to see what had happened to the material in question and, of course, there was no follow-up at the office end.

         All of this has been explained by my particular officer, in whose integrity may I say publicly that I have complete confidence. I do not simply rely on statutory declarations to earn my confidence. I have absolute confidence in his integrity and his efficiency. It just so happened that in this particular case some faxed documents went astray. There is no mystery about what those documents were; they are attached to his statutory declaration, which was tabled yesterday. It is publicly available. There are no missing documents in that sense. Those opposite can see for themselves the significance or lack of significance of them.

         It is just because those opposite are such a mob of miserable cynics both in what they are likely to believe about him and what they are likely to believe about me that I thought it might be appropriate—it would not be necessary for reasonable and decent people, but for that lot it is—to put the matter beyond doubt by asking my officer in question to put the matter into a statutory declaration.

         —The recent publication of the Bureau of Industry Economics industry brief on the services sector of May 1992 makes it clear that the services sector is playing a vital role in providing new jobs in Australia and in contributing to the improvement in Australia's balance of payments. It is a fact that job growth in Australia in the last year has been particularly strong in two—and I single out two—of Australia's service industry sectors, in spite of the recession. Those sectors relate to community services and recreational and personal services. In the latter case, the employment growth was 6.4 per cent through the year.

         The recreational services sector is overwhelmingly conducted in the private sector and is weighted towards small business activity. I imagine that Senator Colston has a particular interest in this sector because he is a Queensland senator, and tourism plays a major role in the sector. It makes a significant contribution to Australia's balance of payments. It occurs on both sides of the balance of payments account. Foreign tourists coming in is the equivalent of increased export earnings and Australians holidaying in Australia rather than overseas is import replacement expenditure.

         The BIE report about which Senator Colston asked me shows that the economic outlook for the services sector as a whole is good. The survey of business expectations conducted by the National Australia Bank in the March quarter indicated a fairly bullish approach to an increased demand for services, with 68.1 per cent expecting demand to increase and firms expecting profitability to improve through the year.

         Secondly, the tourist industry would be penalised because it deals largely in services and in food and refreshments. In that sense, the industry stands to gain little from a proposed abolition of the wholesale sales tax. The Treasury analysis of the Opposition's version of a consumption tax shows that the Australian tourism industry would be hit with price rises of between 8.4 and 11.4 per cent.

The detailed Treasury analysis shows, for example, that electricity charges would increase by 10.65 per cent, gas charges would increase by 7.6 per cent, postal and telephone service charges would increase by 8.14 per cent, urban transport fares would rise by 6.5 per cent—the Opposition's spokesman in Queensland had something to say about that, but we will come to that another time—and dry cleaning and shoe repairs would rise in cost by 10.5 per cent.

Secondly, does the Leader of the Government agree that for Senator Richardson to provide a reference on ministerial letterhead, rather than his senatorial letterhead, and to do so without seeking any documentary evidence or making any independent background checks, does not fall within his ministerial responsibilities and is a form of largess which is open to abuse?

I am not keen on advocating that as a solution to this problem. With respect to the first part of the question, Senator Coulter quoted Senator Richardson in part. He asked me whether this was a normal execution of constituency duties. Let me make it quite clear that Senator Richardson, in terms of his actions, has made it clear on a number of occasions that he regarded that as part of a constituency duty.

In so far as the use of ministerial letterhead is concerned, Senator Coulter asked me whether the writing of letters of that kind falls within a Minister's responsibilities. Sometimes it does; on many occasions it does. All Ministers, both in this country and overseas, from time to time write letters of endorsement. I am not making any judgment about the letter which Senator Richardson wrote; other people have made that judgment. All Ministers make judgments about these things and write letters. It is done both here and internationally. I do not see any objection to that at all. Of course, Ministers have to exercise due care in the way in which they do that.

Today is the second anniversary of the 1990 elections held in Burma to elect a National Assembly in which the National League for Democracy, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, swept to a landslide victory but has been prevented from taking office by the repressive SLORC regime. Can the Minister advise whether the SLORC, under the new Chairman, General Than Shwe, firstly, is any closer to handing over power to a democratically elected National Assembly; secondly, is any closer to convening a national convention in October this year; thirdly, has released any more political prisoners; fourthly, has honoured the agreement for repatriation of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh; and, fifthly, has stopped Burmese Army attacks against the Karen National Union forces near the Thai-Burma border? Further, does the Minister have reports about the well being of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi following the recent visit by her husband, Michael Aris? Lastly, if there has not been any significant improvement in these matters by the SLORC, will the Australian Government impose economic sanctions against the Burmese regime?

         As to the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees, that, regrettably, did not commence on 15 May as had been agreed and the suffering of those people continues. We understand that that is due to the failure of the Burmese Government to provide adequate preparations for the safe return of the refugees in question. On the eastern border, the cease-fire between the Burmese Army and the Karen National Union forces does appear to be holding. We remain, however, cautious about the significance of that because, as I have previously stated, the onset of the monsoon could have been the key factor in that particular Burmese decision. As to the condition of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, all I can say is that, as has already been seen from public reporting of a statement recently issued by her husband, she is in good spirits and good health despite almost three years in detention.

         I might just mention the fact for the record—we pulled out these figures in the context of all the anxiety about leaks the other day—that the Department produces some 180,000 original classified cables each year. Together with the number of copies of each that are prepared and distributed, that results in something like 22 1/2 million new documents a year being produced in relation to cables alone. It is also estimated that my Department produces or receives in Canberra each year in the form of originals and copies over 13 million other classified documents not being cables. From my experience, a fair proportion of that sort of material flows through my office.

         It just happens to be the case that at any given time there are 100 or 200 significant issues running, all with documentation of one kind or another. The fact that in one particular corner of the Department there may be some material in existence relating to one particular matter of no obvious substantive significance so far as public policy is concerned, should be in itself an indication of the way in which this particular matter was treated and an explanation of the way in which what might otherwise be inexplicable failures to recall things or to seek access to documents and so on actually occurred. In the real world that we inhabit there are many, many other preoccupations and many, many other documents competing for attention.

         —Yesterday Senator Chamarette asked me a question concerning a nuclear test claim case. I am advised that Mrs Smith, through her solicitors, has applied for legal aid from the Commonwealth. The request is being considered under the public interest and test case scheme and Senator Chamarette will be familiar with paragraph 18 of the guidelines made by the then Attorney-General, Senator Durack, in March 1981 and tabled in the Senate at that time. Requisitions were delivered to the solicitors on 14 May to which they replied on 19 May but without furnishing the information sought. The matter is receiving priority attention.

        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) during Question Time, in particular the last question that he answered to Senator Hill.

       This afternoon in Question Time we have not seen theatre, as Senator Evans would wish us to believe, but the debasement of the parliamentary process. Quite frankly, a very simple question remains unanswered in any way, shape or form that can be in any way considered satisfactory. It relates to the question I asked the Minister on 7 May when I rose after Question Time, according to the
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       , at 3.54 p.m. to take note of his answer. Senator Evans rose at 3.57 p.m. to answer my taking note of the answer and the time on the top of the faxed document is 3.53 p.m.

        In other words, any staff who did not get that document over to the Minister in this chamber forthwith are not behaving properly. If the Minister says he did not see it until he got back to his office after 4 p.m., he then had a number of hours—until five minutes past 11 that night—to come into this chamber and say that this documentation had been received.

        The Minister has offered no explanation at all. He has simply offered in his defence that it was 2 o'clock in the morning in Washington and he could not ring Washington. It was not necessary for him to ring Washington in order for him to inform the Senate that, in fact, the information he had given us during the course of his answer could now be illuminated. He had that knowledge at the same time. It was available to him. He deliberately chose not to come back into the Senate. When Senator Hill said the Minister misled the Senate by omission, he was quite correct.

        This morning we saw another example of it. During the appropriations debate in the Committee of the Whole we had a little dissertation about a letter written by Mr Kerin to Mr Peacock. The Minister read out parts of the letter and said that I could not have the whole letter because it was private correspondence. Subsequently, I got the letter and discovered that Andrew Peacock had published it. However, the part that the Minister neatly did not care to read out to me during the time he was answering me was the last paragraph of Mr Kerin's letter where he said:

        The Minister sits there and tells us that he did not mislead the Parliament. He sits there and has the hide—the audacity—to tell us that he can answer questions put by Senator Schacht about Myanmar with great recall and attention to detail, but as to the running of his own Department, that documentation has been in his Department since 6 April. He now digs up a further document dated 21 April and tells us that not one of his staff has told him anything about it at all.

We would be most interested to know what is in those cables. We would also be most interested to know what has been blacked out in this file note.

He has given no explanation at all as to why he did not do that. The question of whether he wanted to speak to Washington is irrelevant to that point. The point is that the Minister chose to deprive the Senate of information that it was entitled to have. He can say if he likes that he considers that to be satisfactory ministerial behaviour.

I think it is most important that we are informed how that statutory declaration came into existence. The Minister has many questions unanswered. This matter will not disappear. It is a matter that we will pursue until we see all the documentation, until we know the truth of this matter and until we know how far the tentacles of this sordid affair really reach.

Given that there was nothing new in any of this, nothing that required any action, nothing that was at odds with our understanding of the situation, it was manifestly the kind of thing that did not require to be communicated to me.

       Then there are some words with regard to Peter Byrne and some other people. Miles Kupa's name is mentioned again. They are all in this note of the conversation. As I have said, there are some fluorescent matters there which say that this is not just an ordinary matter—this is not just an ordinary arrest. It is not only a consular matter; it is a matter that involves political connections in Washington, involves the President of the Senate, involves a senior Cabinet Minister and is likely to lead to public comment. The very first thing to be alerted to in the file note is that this matter might blow up into a public controversy in Australia.

        This was communicated to the Minister's office on 6 April—one month before 7 May when Senator Bishop asked the Minister what he knew about this man Symons. The Minister said—he cannot have it two ways—one month later that he had no knowledge. However, when he is giving his defence as to why his officer Mr Kupa, who is advising him here in the chamber, did not, as it is alleged from his statutory declaration, bring it to his attention one month earlier despite these fluorescent references, he says that he did not bring it to his attention because he already knew that on 3 April—three days before—Senator Richardson had rung him to ask his advice before he rang the President of the Marshall Islands.

        So Senator Evans `understood' the matter. He understood from Senator Richardson's telephone conversation that this was a sensitive matter. It was about business migration, it was about Symons and about people being arrested. He knew the political sensitivities. He therefore uses that knowledge, personally derived from Senator Richardson, as the excuse for why his principal adviser in his own office did not bring this file note of some dynamite or, as I say, fluorescence to his attention. Senator Evans cannot have it both ways. If he claimed that the reason it was not brought to his attention, if it was not, was that he already knew about these things, why did he not give that answer here in the Senate on 7 May when he was asked? He did not give that answer. He gave the answer, `I have no understanding of the matter'.

        There is one other matter to which I wish to refer. It arises as a result of the lack of credibility of Senator Evans in this whole matter over these last few days. There is no independent evidence that Senator Richardson ever spoke to Senator Evans. No note has been given by Senator Richardson; no note has been given by Senator Evans. There appears to be no witness to this conversation. One possibility is that it never happened.

        When this file note is received by the Minister's personal adviser and when it is communicated from our Ambassador in the Marshall Islands—when it is received by the responsible officer, O'Leary, in the Department—they do not have any knowledge that three days earlier, so it is alleged, there was a conversation between two senior Cabinet Ministers about the propriety of that Minister, Senator Richardson, ringing the President of the Marshall Islands or other Cabinet Ministers of the Marshall Islands either to ask for leniency in respect of his cousin Symons or to ask that his cousin be able to defend his case by returning to Australia and that his passport be given back. They are the two versions of the story we have received. Originally the story was that there was a request that his passport be given back; now we hear that the rumour is that he was asking for leniency. We still do not know which one of those is true.

        In any event, I put it clearly that over these last two days, after some maybe 30 questions to the Minister and literally the greater part of three hours of him answering questions, Senator Evans has not been able to give one shred of evidence that there was in fact that conversation and, if there was the conversation, why there was no note of it and, if there was a conversation, why some note or advice was not given to the Department or at least to our Ambassador in the Marshall Islands.

        Obviously it was a matter that was sufficiently important for Senator Richardson to ask the advice of the Foreign Minister about the sensitivities of the Marshall Islands, yet not of sufficient importance in the mind of that Minister to bring it to the attention of our Ambassador and representative who, it was clear, was going to be in for quite a deal of at least consular and possibly public controversy with all of the US connection and so on. There are not only New South Wales senators but also South Australian senators in this chamber. I put it to Senator Evans that most of this chamber has seen his lack of credibility in the answers he has given over the last two days and that he has not satisfactorily addressed these matters.

I must have known of the entire contents of this particular document, and in fact I said I did. What I said, and I just want to clarify it again for the record, is that I knew of two important matters that are referred to in this document. Firstly, I knew of the arrest of Mr Symons; and, secondly, I knew of the actual involvement of Senator Richardson so far as a phone call to the Marshall Islands was concerned. My senior adviser also knew of those two matters because I had told him about them.

But I did not know of anything else, and I hope the record is now absolutely clear on that particular matter.

A few matters have arisen from listening to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has had to say and also from having a closer look at the documentation made available yesterday and today. I note that this file note with the deletions in it has a side note that says, `Telephone call from Peter Stanford, 6.4.92'. I then went back to the statutory declaration sworn by Mr Kupa and I found a document which is a fax from the Federated States of Micronesia to Kylie Oakes. It is dated 3 December 1991. It says, `Subject: Australian Consultants to the RMI Government: Request for Assistance'. The opening words are:

       If Mr Peter Stanford undertook to make investigations about Washington in December 1991, presumably he followed that up. Where are the results of his investigations and can we have them tabled also?

        There is more documentation we need to see. I would be most interested to hear from Mr Kupa himself, and indeed from Mr O'Leary. I suppose the only way we can do that is to perhaps have the inquiry we first sought, or else—and we might examine this proposition—we could move in the Senate that Mr Kupa be heard by the Senate. The Minister has simply said that he had no knowledge at all of this matter when, quite clearly, early on in the piece, as a result of the investigations that Mr Stanford must have done, he must have found out about Senator Sibraa's letter. We have evidence from the Minister that he spoke with another Minister about calling a foreign government and the appropriateness of that, and that he apparently did not even ask his staff what was known about this matter; he did not even bother to inquire. If that is truly the way the Minister conducts his business, he ought to stand down, because that is not proper behaviour.

        The alternative is that, if he did in fact ask, he must have been told and, therefore, he has simply not been telling us the truth when he said that he knew nothing at all. I find it very difficult to believe that a man who prides himself on attention to detail—right down to the point of writing a book about what a great job he has done—would not be sufficiently in touch with his staff to be informed about a matter which had all the inklings and alarm bells of a scandal. It had all the alarm bells of improper behaviour; it had all the alarm bells of, `Why the hell does my colleague Senator Richardson want to ring the Marshall Islands to intervene on behalf of a relative-cum-mate?'.

Then, on the day when he was finally put to the test and asked whether he would conduct an inquiry, whether he would find out and tell us, he said that there was nothing of substance and that he had no reason to look at that. He used his favourite word—`fulminate'.

        —by leave—In order to avoid yet another missing document conspiracy starting, I draw Senator Bishop's attention to the material she has in front of her so far as these faxes are concerned. The particular fax from Peter Stanford of 3 December which says `re: your fax' is a response to the document that is on the very next page, the fax signed, `thanks, Kylie'—that being Kylie Oakes of my Department—on 29 November, which fax covered the three subsequent pages that Senator Bishop can see there. They referred to the basic exchange between Canberra and Washington—not an exchange, but setting out Senator Sibraa's letter. Basically, on 29 November, my Department sent the same material that it had sent to it from Washington that is sent to Pohnpei. That is clearly the case. Senator Bishop can see that that particular fax says there are four pages in it—this one plus three others. There is a box with the figure `4' in the top right-hand corner. That is what was sent to Stanford and his document is a reply to that. So I am sorry to have to tell Senator Bishop that there ain't no missing fax so far as that is concerned; it is sitting right in front of her eyes.

That, in fact, means that there are millions of missing females. That is the direct result of China's one-child family policy. I called that barbaric.

        The Minister did not address the latter part of that question at all. I would like a response to that, and I will deal with that in a moment. But, in his reply, the Minister said that it was very much Senator Harradine's judgment that the Chinese population policy is barbaric.

I have never said anything about the Chinese population control program that has not been able to be backed up by evidence—contrary to what Senator Schacht has done in his human rights delegation report, in which he repeated certain assertions without checking them and without having the documentation to check them.

        The opposing arguments on the question of whether the Chinese family planning program is coercive do not really start from a common body of evidence. Critics of the program document their charges; defenders avoid coming to grips with the concrete evidence. Many defenders of the Chinese program, including family planners and some demographers, have value conflicts and conflicts of interest in the matter. Most have accepted the "population crisis" idea as established fact, even though it has been seriously challenged on the grounds that it is simplistic and unproven. Family planners want to identify with the evident success of the Chinese program. Some demographers are afraid to criticise it lest they lose their access to Chinese population data, research opportunities, and contacts with Chinese colleagues. Because of the resulting biases, the case put by defenders of the Chinese program is seriously flawed.

        The Hull report tries to redefine "coercion" as narrowly as possible to dispel the coercion charge without meeting it head on. It accepts the Chinese cover story that coercion occurs only as a local deviation from government policy and is stopped whenever it is detected. But it ignores substantial evidence that coercion is encouraged from the top and that some forms of coercion have been openly commended by the central authorities.

        The report argues that the adoption of a new round of provincial family planning laws since 1985 represents an attempt by the authorities to establish a "rule of law" that would prevent the local cadres from resorting to coercive measures. But the laws themselves contain no prohibitions against coercive tactics, nor have the Chinese authorities come up with a specific case of a cadre being punished for using coercion in family planning work. Besides, the domestic media make it perfectly clear that the purpose of the new laws is to tighten, not loosen, the pressures for compliance with family planning demands.

        Hull follows Greenhalgh's lead in insisting that enforcement of family planning policies is becoming more lax because of changes in other aspects of domestic policy, including economic reforms. Both assume that family planning policies cannot be tightened if other aspects of policy are becoming more relaxed. However, the descriptive evidence suggests that the trend in family planning policy has been to tighten control since 1985, and the statistical evidence shows that numbers of family planning surgeries have risen since 1985 and that the total fertility rate, which had rebounded in 1986 and 1987, fell again in 1988, 1989, and 1990.

        Hull argues that Australian support for the Chinese program will eventually moderate its extreme aspects, but that does not seem to have happened as a result of the United Nations Population Fund involvement that began in 1979 or the International Planned Parenthood Federation involvement that began in 1983. Neither organisation was in a position to exercise a moderating influence in view of their unstinting praise of the program and their unwillingness to recognise its coercive aspects, which the Chinese authorities have correctly interpreted as approval for the program as a whole. Despite their major financial and technical contributions, neither organisation seems to have any real leverage over the program.

        For some time now, as honourable senators will recall, ministerial and departmental responses to my questions on human rights violations inherent in the PRC's population control program have intrigued me by their mixture of evasiveness and dogmatism. I became concerned about this when it emerged that the Australian human rights delegation to China was so poorly briefed that it was unable to challenge the assurances of Sichuan Province family planning officials, which were then simply repeated in the delegation's report to Parliament. The delegation was not even provided with a copy of this Province's draconian family planning regulations at its briefing prior to departure.

My concern was heightened when it became clear that the Minister was prepared to accept Dr Hull's report as a basis for Government policy and refused my request that AIDAB publish a more balanced and objective study.

The tabled document is that response. I challenge the Minister, his Department and AIDAB to ensure its distribution to those who have or will receive the whole report from AIDAB. I should like the Minister to tell the Senate why the delegation is in China and on whose advice that delegation is there at this moment.

        I must say to Senator Harradine that, until one actually visits China and gets some perspective of what a country with 1,100 million to 1,200 million people looks and feels like, it is a little hard to moralise back here in Australia on all aspects of their family planning program. For example, 110 million people live in Sichuan Province, the area of which is probably not much greater than the total area of Tasmania, a State in Australia that has half a million people. If Senator Harradine can imagine 110 million people living in Tasmania and what that would do to the quality of life in every sense of the word, he will start to get a concept of the Chinese obsession with family planning and living standards for their people.

        In the questions we put to China's planning officials—and it is in our report—they made no bones about the fact that one of their major problems is female infanticide. They openly gave us the figures, which showed that in the previous year in Sichuan province, for every 107 boys registered at birth, only 100 girls were registered. So there was a disparity in that year. According to their figures, it was about seven. Clearly, by any demographer's analysis, that means that there is an imbalance. The figures should be much closer. As I understand it, the normal imbalance between male and female births is one or two—for example, between 100 and 101, or 100 and 102.

        The planning officials openly admitted without hesitation the problem of female infanticide, particularly in rural and remote rural areas. They also openly admitted the problem of having to rely on abortion as a contraception means. They admitted that three years ago the number of registered births in the province was about two million and the number of abortions 600,000. They pointed out that, two years later, for two million births they had about 300,000 or 400,000 abortions—again a very high figure which under no circumstances were they happy with.

        It was clear to us from talking to the officials and to the local people that the high incidence of abortion is a result of not having the facilities in the family planning process to provide decent mechanical contraceptive devices to all the population. This became clear when we went to the villages. The officials openly admitted that not everybody has access to condoms, the pill or IUDs and that, as a result, when women become pregnant there is pressure put on them to have an abortion. There is the social pressure of the community as well as psychological pressure. There is financial pressure put on them in that if they have two or more children they pay a financial penalty.

        The officials admitted that people traditionally would rather have a son than a daughter. That puts female babies at risk of being killed. We raised a specific question that was raised by Senator Harradine and by the then Senator Olsen in a Senate Estimates committee hearing a couple of years ago: whether ultrasonic equipment provided by an Australian aid program was being used to determine the sex of children so that female foetuses could be aborted. The officials said that it was illegal under Chinese law. They do not want people to know the sex of the baby because they do not want an abortion to be carried out. They admitted that they have difficulty in stopping it occurring, that bribery takes place and so on, but that is the law they work under. It is an offence for a doctor or a medical official to give information to parents about the sex of the foetus. But they admitted that there are many gaps and difficulties in the historical culture of China—which favours male births—which make it difficult for all of this to be carried through.

My view, and the view of the delegation, is that the issue that we should be looking at in terms of family planning in China is assistance in the area of women's health, because the contraceptive devices being made available to Chinese women put their health at risk. I have to say, after seeing some of the locally made IUDs that are provided, that they look more like a torture weapon to me than a contraceptive device. But they are all that they have available.

        I would hope that in any family planning program in which we can assist China we can provide better information, technical facilities and devices so that women's health is not so adversely affected. One of the problems China has at the moment is the high number of abortions. If we provide better contraceptive devices and better educational information, in my view there will be far fewer abortions, and I am sure that would be in line with Senator Harradine's wishes.

        I make no bones about the fact that since my return to Australia last year I have asked a number of questions of the relevant Estimates committee about pushing AIDAB to take a higher profile on family planning matters. I have asked questions about the need for us to substantially increase the funding under Australia's bilateral and multilateral aid programs to provide information and assistance to family planning programs in developing countries, programs that are not coercive but that are educational and supportive and, above all else, that give the women in the Third World, the developing world, the same right of choice as women in Australia have. That is the fundamental issue that should be dealt with.

        Unfortunately, Senator Harradine's remarks and the issues he raises seem to indicate that he is less concerned about the health of women in the Third World than he is about the issue of abortion or coercion. The issue of coercion is important, and we should do everything we can to say to people that family planning has to be voluntary; that it has to be consensorial. If Senator Harradine can imagine 110 million people living in an area the size of Tasmania, then he will start having to make the judgment that he does not have many options about what he can do in regard to family planning and the size of the population.

        The Chinese make it quite clear. They say, `If we do not adopt a very severe family planning policy, if you want us not to worry about it, what are you and the rest of the world going to do in the year 2020 or 2015, when there are two billion Chinese people living in the same area? Will you take 150 million people into Australia?'. It is a very good question to ask all of us who wish to moralise about their draconian policy. They have certainly put the shoe on the other foot. Would we take millions or tens of millions of Chinese immigrants to relieve the strain and pressure of the population on their country?

But if there is a population growth rate of 3 per cent or 4 per cent, the economic growth rates of China will not only be unable to provide an increased standard of living; they will not even be able to maintain the present standard of living, and the country will descend into economic chaos as more and more people fight over fewer and fewer resources'.

        These are the fundamental issues that the Chinese Government is trying to come to terms with—a Government which I will criticise and have criticised on human rights issues across the board. As the Chinese reminded us endlessly, there is a human right in China: it is the right to exist. Senator Bourne heard that endlessly when we raised political, human and social rights. The only right is the right to exist. If there is no stability in China, there will be chaos and a lot of people will die of starvation or as a result of inadequate health and social services.

        I note Senator Harradine's concern, but to raise this issue as though some untoward or misleading briefing has been given in the past to our delegation by AIDAB, or will be given to it in the future, is absolutely erroneous. We sought information from a range of experts before we went to China, including experts on family planning. This was most useful information.

        One of the fundamental issues that the world has to face is its population crisis. Australia is a developed country and a large continent with only 17 million people. If nothing else, we have a very strong moral obligation. We have the luxury of not being an overcrowded country and, compared with most of the rest of the world, we have a decent standard of living. We have a responsibility to assist those overcrowded countries which, as a result, are affected by poverty and low living standards. We ought to make a larger contribution to assist them in decent, consensorial family planning policies and not bark up Senator Harradine's tree by saying that this is some sort of devious plot to interfere with the rights of individuals.

        Delegation members did not even have the regulations of the Sichuan province with them at that stage. Therefore, they were not in a position to challenge those assurances. Had they had those regulations, they would have seen that those regulations not only do not proscribe coerced abortions and forced sterilisations, they in fact prescribe them; they make them mandatory in certain circumstances. If Senator Schacht's delegation was aware of that, it should have then challenged the officials. It would have been able to report to us that this is how the officials dealt with those allegations and this is how they interpret those regulations.

        Senator Schacht accuses me in an unfounded way of not being concerned about women's health. I am very concerned about women's health. Senator Schacht may not have been at the Senate Estimates committee hearings when I raised the very important issue of women's health in Africa. What has happened to the request for action to be taken by the Government in respect of that matter? I am personally involved in the area of aid for health, including women's health, in developing countries, but I am not prepared to demean myself to detail those matters here.

        I then come to Senator Schacht's other point, which is also unfounded. Without any analysis at all, he seems to accept the population bomb crisis that has been advanced, largely by the international population control bureaucrats. The more they can build up that fear in people's minds, the more money they will get, irrespective of how it affects the health of women.

        Many people have criticised population control measures—for example, in East Timor and Bangladesh. Some Bangladesh feminist group called the feminist population control program `anti-poor and anti-women'. To blame the fertility of poor women in poor countries for a range of problems as some people do is totally unfair. To suggest that we ought to become involved in some way in this `barbaric program'—and that is the only term one can use—by providing more modern IUDs or whatever, is to become embroiled in the coercive population control program itself.

        Senator Schacht talked about the Chinese wanting to do something in the population area. It is the PRC Government and the State Family Planning Commission and their operators in the particular provinces that want to do something. Surely the Chinese people have a right to determine these issues. It is not as though people do not make responsible decisions; of course they do. How has Senator Schacht got the right to paternalistically pontificate here as to what ordinary Chinese parents should or should not do? The situation is well covered. I appeal to honourable senators to read and study the document that has been tabled because it deals with the population issues in a scholarly fashion on the basis of evidence and in a way which would demolish the points that have been made by Senator Schacht.

Senator Schacht accuses me of saying that the Hulls are devils incarnate. I have not reflected at all on the characters or the internal dispositions of the Hulls. Valerie Hull is head of the section in AIDAB. Dr Terry Hull, her husband, received the grant to do this paper. It was a substantial grant.

       Those are very serious statements and I think they should be taken on board by the Government.

That is fair, is it not? I ask anybody: is it not fair that AIDAB should send the Aird document out to everybody who has received or will receive the Hull document? We will see whether that takes place. We will see whether some still have closed minds and are not prepared to face up to the evidence.

        That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Chee on 26 May 1992 relating to Mr Greg Symons.

       This is a matter of importance that relates to a question asked yesterday regarding the Marshall Islands affair. A search of the bankruptcy registry in New South Wales yesterday failed to disclose documents relating to Mr Symons's insolvency which should have been on the file and available for public scrutiny. I asked the Minister yesterday why those documents were not present. At that stage I was of the understanding that Mr Symons had entered into a deed of arrangement. At any rate, whatever his arrangement is with his creditors—it turns out that it was a composition—that document should have been on the file and the certificate of release, if any had been issued, should also have been on the file. I ask the question very clearly: why were these documents missing from the file and why was my search clerk told that these matters were confidential? Senator Tate subsequently issued a press release headed, `O'Chee gets it wrong'. It states:

       Senator Tate this afternoon described the comments as wrong, vindictive and a grossly unjustified slur on Government officers and Ministers.

       The fact is that my search clerk did have the right file. When I was in Question Time yesterday I had the statement of affairs that was sworn by Mr Gregory Bernard Symons on 27 September 1989. There is no more incontrovertible proof that these documents came from Gregory Bernard Symons's file. The correct file was searched, but the documents in question relating to Mr Symons's insolvency agreements, the documents relating to his possible release from those agreements, were not available for my search clerk. That is a breach of the Bankruptcy Act and a breach of the bankruptcy regulations. These are statutory public documents. Why were they absent from the file? Why were they not given to my search clerk?

        Subsequently, yesterday evening Senator Tate advised me that he had the information I sought. He came into the Senate and tabled the information. I congratulate him; at least we have one Government Minister who wants to table information. Essentially, the document Senator Tate tabled and subsequent documents which have come into my possession vindicate my concern that those documents related to certain possible breaches of the Corporations Act which Mr Symons may have committed and, moreover, they are highly damaging to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

         Commonwealth of Australia Gazette

        No. B48 on 12 December 1989. It was item NX227/89. Notice was given that Gregory Bernard Symons was to pay his trustee on behalf of his creditors the sum of $25,000 on or before 31 December 1989. That was the deal that Mr Symons did to be released from $1.5m of debts. It goes further. Had the documents I sought been available to me yesterday, it would have been possible to show that Mr Symons in fact did not meet those requirements, did not in fact pay the money until some time in October 1991 and that his certificate of release, far from being signed in December 1989 or early 1990, was not signed by his trustee until November 1991, almost two years after the due date for Mr Symons to pay the $25,000.

        What is the significance of this delay? The significance of this delay is simple. The $25,000 payment made by Mr Symons to relieve himself of $1.5m of debt coincided with an export market development grant given by Austrade to Mr Symons in or about October 1991. In effect, not only has Mr Symons evaded $1.5m of debt by doing this cosy little arrangement with some of his creditors but moreover there is a very strong case to be put that the Australian taxpayer has provided Mr Symons with the money that he needed to get out of his bankruptcy obligations. I ask this chamber: is it reasonable for us to tolerate Austrade providing people such as Mr Symons, through export market development grants, with the money they need to meet their bankruptcy obligations?

He can believe the fact that the money was never paid on the due date. Mr Symons did not pay it by the end of December 1989. He did not pay it in 1990.

        The argument could be made by those on the other side of the chamber, if they had enough wit or wisdom to try to put the argument, that Mr Symons first of all had to expend funds to get an export market development grant. Indeed, he would. But there is one little problem with that: when Mr Symons swore the affidavit verifying his statement of affairs on 27 September 1989 he said that his total realisable assets amounted to $10 cash at bank. The $10 millionaire!

        While Mr Symons's total assets were $10, how could he expend enough money to be due a $131,000 export market development grant? Either one of two things occurred: either Mr Symons was due that grant at the time at which he swore the statement of affairs and he did not disclose it or he received funding from another source. That is a matter of which Austrade should have inquired and a matter of which Austrade should be cognisant. This Senate and the Australian people deserve to know how it was that $131,000 of taxpayers' money was made available to Mr Symons, and about that time he used $25,000 to pay off $1.5m of bankruptcy obligations.

       Importantly the passage of the referendum is the very foundation of Commonwealth action in Aboriginal affairs.

       The Prime Minister addressed the inaugural meeting of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in February.

        —The 1967 referendum is often referred to as a landmark in Aboriginal affairs. The 25 years since then represents a large chunk of this country's history since European settlement—nearly one-eighth. From the view of this land's indigenous people, that 25 years is just a blip in the tens of thousands of years of their history on this continent. From that perspective of time, the enormous changes and upheavals which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have had to endure are even more tumultuous than would at first appear.

        The 1967 referendum is significant for the fact that it achieved easily the greatest level of agreement amongst Australians with 91 per cent of people voting yes to enable Aboriginal people to be counted as Australians and to enable the Commonwealth Government to make laws for Aboriginal people throughout the country.

        In the 25 years since the referendum result there have been many more changes and developments. There have been concerted and generally well-intentioned efforts to redress some of the wrongs perpetrated on the indigenous people. As we all know, not all these efforts have met with success. In recent times the many failures and injustices which have been enacted by governments of this nation have been widely described and acknowledged in this Parliament: for example, at the time of the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and the bringing down of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, as well as the more recent governmental responses to those recommendations.

         For a start, the horrendous act of removing Aboriginal children from their families continued. So too did the incredible restrictions which were placed on the lives of Aboriginal people living on reserves. The restrictive laws and practices placed over the lives of those people still have not been fully removed today. The legacy of those acts, and the many other brutal and appalling acts which went hand in hand with the colonisation of this land and the dispossession of its indigenous people, is still very much with us today and is even more strongly present in the collective and individual consciousness of this land's indigenous people.

        Stacked up against this legacy of injustice, the 1967 referendum is a very small act of redress. Nonetheless, it is a powerful symbol. The occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary is perhaps a good time to acknowledge some of the positive achievements that have occurred; but in making the acknowledgment I stress that I do not see it as some sort of ultimate checklist of how well we have done. I see these things as simply beginnings. We have seen the development of Aboriginal legal services, beginning in Redfern in 1970; Aboriginal health and medical services, starting again in Redfern in 1971; and land rights legislation in the Northern Territory in 1976, still seen by many of us as the best such legislation in this country. We have seen laws that go some way, although often not far enough, towards protecting sacred sites and significant areas and items that are part of the indigenous people's traditional heritage. We have seen the handing back of Uluru and Katherine Gorge to their traditional owners in 1985 and 1989 respectively. These actions were also a powerful symbol of correcting past dispossession and injustice. In 1990 we saw the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which was a significant move, I believe, towards enabling the goal of self-determination to be more achievable. The Australian Democrats believe that ATSIC is a body which must be supported and given the opportunity to work.

        It was around the time of the 1967 referendum that interest in Aboriginal culture began to develop. It is obvious, though not yet widely recognised, that indigenous cultures are integral to an Australian identity. The notion of a national identity is something which has gained some attention of late, particularly because of Prime Minister Keating's remarks on the flag and republicanism. I would have liked to have seen him extend his remarks to make clear that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their traditions, culture and heritage have a major part to play in the formation and composition of a true Australian identity.

        I was interested to note in a speech made recently by the Chairperson of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, to commemorate the 1967 referendum that she referred to an item which listed the things that Americans most associated with Australia. The top five items included Aborigines, koalas, kangaroos and the Great Barrier Reef. This is a simple example of how integral Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are to the very nature of Australia. Sometimes we use this culture in an exploitative way, particularly when we pick and choose to suit our own tourism demands.

        The culture of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is one which we are starting to recognise has a value for all Australians. So, too, are we acknowledging its importance. As we tackle global environmental issues, we take time to reflect upon the approaches taken by those who lived in harmony with this land for so many years. We need to consider those approaches. We need to look anew for the lessons contained therein. The 1967 referendum is often seen as the time when Aboriginal people were finally acknowledged as being part of the Australian nation. I think that is far too generous an interpretation to place upon the significance of the 1967 referendum.

        I would like to make a special mention of the role of Torres Strait Islander people. Torres Strait Islanders are still often seen as being indistinguishable from Aboriginal people and the reality of their own distinct culture and history is often overlooked. As a minority within a minority, being a group whose homeland is so far from where 99 per cent of Australians live, Torres Strait Islanders often find their culture and their needs ignored. Whilst this is a small group of people, their role in the future of this nation should not be overlooked.

        The 1967 referendum signalled a decision by the people of Australia to make changes to the Constitution of Australia. As we move towards 2001, consideration is being given by many people to what changes should be made to our Constitution to make it more appropriate and more relevant to our nation as it enters the twenty-first century. The place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our nation must be a very important part of that consideration.

        The actions of those who came to this land after 1788 have caused indescribable suffering and destruction. The actions of those people must now be focused on working in conjunction with indigenous people to redress these wrongs. Thus 1967 was important. It was a symbol. We have seen many steps taken since then, steps which I regard as small steps. We still have an awfully long way to go, but I still acknowledge the role of 1967 in the contemporary history of the last few decades of this nation.

        We commemorate a milestone of 25 years since one of the most crucial decisions that affected the Aboriginal people of Australia, some one per cent of our total Australian community. That one per cent had for 180 years been shut out of their own country. By the decision of the Australian people, 91 per cent of them voting in favour of the referendum to allow the Commonwealth to make laws for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it was possible for the Commonwealth, by making laws and by adopting programs relating to health, housing, education and employment, to take the first substantial initiatives that have led to some progress in the development of the Aboriginal communities of Australia. It was a historic decision. That is the first part of this motion that we are adopting today.

That has perhaps been a little less distinct in the past few years because of the setting up of the successor to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in that we now have an independent and fully Aboriginal institute that, through its council, is to look after the affairs of and initiatives from the Commonwealth in Aboriginal affairs. That family began with the Liberal and National parties and it has continued with the Labor Party in government. It went again with the Liberal Fraser Government.

She does that in consultation with representatives of all the Aboriginal people of Australia. I remember when Lois was a nurse who used to look after the whole of the Pitjantjatjara community, single-handed, at the back of a truck. She used to wander from one community to the other.

        Twenty-five years ago today, an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in a referendum to give the Commonwealth Government power to legislate over Aboriginal affairs. Until then, Aboriginal policy, regarded as a welfare function, was the province of the states, although the Commonwealth had direct responsibilities in the Northern Territory. The referendum result reflected a clear view by most Australians that something more—and something better—had to be done; that the paltry efforts until that time had been a national and an international embarrassment. By almost any standard of well-being—health, education, employment, housing or socio-economic status—Aborigines were the worst-off of all Australians. They were only beginning to emerge from formal legal discriminations. Underfunded paternalistic rule—which tended to measure Aboriginal "advancement" in terms of complete assimilation into white society and abandonment of Aboriginal culture and traditions—coupled with decades of remoteness, public indifference and hostility, at last was overtaken by a belief on the part of most Australians that a prosperous and civilised society should, and could, do more.

        Twenty-five years later, the situation in Aboriginal affairs remains a national and international embarrassment. Similar social and economic indices would show, at best, that Aborigines still lagged behind other Australians to at least the same extent; in many key areas, particularly health, there has been little improvement at all.

        The problem now, however, is not primarily one of funds; nor, over most of the intervening period, has it been one of broad goodwill on the part of government or most Australians. More than $25 billion, in today's value, has been spent on programs specifically focused on Aboriginal advancement. A considerable bureaucracy was established, both at government level and in Aboriginal communities. Some of the investment has produced good results: in general terms, for example, Aborigines are now better housed, even if housing for too many Aborigines is still inadequate. Even acknowledging that progress takes time and that some programs, in education, say, yield results only after years of effort, it is clear that more of the same is not necessarily going to produce much better results. It is also doubtful how much longer the political will exists to maintain current levels of funding.

        The real question is whether—assuming the will exists—more of the same is capable of producing necessary changes. There are increasing arguments that it is not. Two of the primary enemies of change—the collectivisation of Aborigines, and the bureaucratisation of their affairs—are increasing, and widening the gulf between Aborigines and other Australians. Aborigines are becoming increasingly dependent on government. That the form of government has a facade of Aboriginal control cannot mask the pauperisation and lack of effective service-delivery involved.

        TOO FEW funds are devoted to creating capital that will enhance the capacity of Aborigines, individually or corporately, to make their own way; too much is spent creating local economies—remote from the wider community—based on everyone taking in each other's washing. Aboriginal initiative is still seriously stifled, far too much Aboriginal energy remains focused on notions that real change depends primarily on non-Aborigines doing something—whether changing the law or changing attitudes—rather than seizing the hour and the opportunities themselves. Aboriginal Australians, for many reasons, have a claim on the conscience of other Australians. But liberation from their disadvantage depends on their determination.

        Twenty-five years ago most Australians believed that government—the Commonwealth Government in particular—ought to do more for Aborigines. It took time for that "more" to occur but, in the intervening period, most of the limits of what government could do have been reached. Aborigines are in a far better position in 1992 to take a very critical look at where the energy, resources and expenditures of the past 25 years have gone, what has been achieved and what has failed. The political will to help Aborigines still exists, though it has to some extent been diluted by disappointment. Whether by May 27, 2017—50 years after the referendum—Aboriginal Australians still stand out for disadvantage to the extent they did in 1967 and 1992 depends more on the way they redirect their energies over the next 25 years than on their building on the precarious base constructed over the past 25.

His death was one of the first Aboriginal deaths in custody that was investigated by the Royal Commission. I remember the enormous sadness that we felt at the death of this young man. I attended his funeral. Only a matter of a few weeks ago, his mother also took her life in their family home. I regard it as a terrible loss, and so too does her community. These tragedies continue day by day, week by week, and with all of our efforts, we still have not enabled the Aboriginal people to free themselves to a level of progress which would enable them to be a part of the full Australian community that we would wish.

It serves as an opportunity to reflect on how far we have come or not come in the past 25 years. At a ceremony outside the old Parliament House building at the Aboriginal Embassy today, the Aboriginal flag was at half mast to mourn the latest death in custody of a woman in Brisbane who lost her life because of the failure of our society to meet her needs and those of her people. I think she also symbolises the death of Mrs Dixon whom Senator Teague has just mentioned.

        I would like to share with honourable senators the story of this trust and how it came about. One Saturday morning in January 1992 at about 3 a.m., 19-year-old Louis Johnson was walking home along a road in the quiet middle-class Perth suburb of North Beach. It was his birthday and he had been at a party. He stopped to lie down on the grass verge for a while. Some time later a car containing five other youths completely unknown to him pulled up alongside. The three boys and two girls got out of the car and Louis was viciously bashed by two of them while the others watched. He was then left lying beside the road. Moments later some of the youths returned in the car and deliberately ran over him at high speed. The five white youths then returned to observe their victim. The driver said to the group, `I have got him. I am glad I got the black sod'.

        Louis lay beside North Beach Road with massive internal injuries and a shattered pelvis until a passing cyclist spotted him at around 7 a.m. and called for an ambulance. Waiting for the ambulance, Louis was still conscious and lucid enough to talk to the cyclist who, as a lay person, had formed the view that Louis was seriously ill.

        Tragic ironies seem to attach themselves to this horrific affair. Louis's middle name was St John. He was a fully paid up subscriber to the St John's Ambulance fund. But, according to the cyclist, the ambulance attendants simply assumed, without any examination, that Louis had been sniffing petrol. Instead of taking him to hospital, they took him home, telling his younger sister that he was intoxicated, that it was not a hospital case and that he should sleep it off in bed. Later that morning the Johnsons found their son in bed. It was obvious that he was seriously injured and they called a second ambulance. Louis died before it arrived. His grieving father, Bill, described his son as dying with `dignity, courage and stoicism'.

        In a taped confession to police after being arrested some days later, the driver of the car claimed that it had not been his intention to kill Louis, only to break his legs. Why had he done it? He answered openly, `Because he was black'. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison. Another youth was awaiting trial at the time this material was written. He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder.

        When the sinister circumstances became established, this killing should have attracted prominent media attention, given the fact that, according to a concurrent media campaign, Perth was in the grip of a spiralling youth crime rampage. Only nine days earlier, on Boxing Day, youths had stolen a car and, while under high speed pursuit by police, had collided with another car, killing a pregnant mother and her son. This was the latest of about a dozen tragic deaths during such high speed car chases in little over a year and it intensified the media and public campaign for a police and legislative crackdown on juvenile crime.

        some two months after the killing, his case was not taken up by the media with equal fervour, despite being in some ways even more horrifying than those of car chase victims. For instance, where those deaths were accidental, Louis's assailants attacked him with premeditated and repeated violence. Moreover, Louis was killed because he was Aboriginal, and for no other reason. Thus, in Western Australia enormous emotional values were attached to accidental killings but they did not seem to apply to the cold-blooded racist murder of an innocent Aboriginal man.

        The relative lack of media interest in the killing of Louis Johnson raises serious questions about the entire structure of news reporting in Perth and about the role of the media in shaping public attitudes towards crime, aboriginality and justice. The muted media response to Louis Johnson's murder was nowhere so quiet as on Perth's high rating morning radio program

        . It was not mentioned. This silence is noteworthy as Howard Sattler has established himself as the unchallenged champion of previous victims of juvenile crime. He used his show to mobilise a gathering of up to 20,000 people at Parliament House in August 1991 to demand stiffer gaol sentences for juvenile offenders—the so-called Rally for Justice. It was Howard Sattler who kicked off this crusade in April 1990 with a now notorious pronouncement on air about the deaths of three Aboriginal youths in a high-speed police chase. Sattler said:

        Sattler went on to convert his program into one of the most effective public policy lobbies ever seen in Perth, with daily stolen car reports, interviews with victims of crime and promotions for the Rally for Justice. Balanced journalism got short shrift as Sattler deftly classified as `protectors of criminals' anyone who suggested that locking kids in gaol was not the best solution to juvenile offending. The do-gooder social workers, profiteering lawyers and lenient judges, the heads in the sand academics, the self-promoting Human Rights Commissioner, fringe groups and the Aboriginal Legal Service were given those adjectives by Saddler in order to discredit their genuine concerns about what was happening in Western Australia.

        At the ceremony today there was another flag, which was a contribution by a South Australian group. It was a design which incorporated both the Aboriginal flag colours and the Southern Cross. While the spirit underlying the design is commendable, it exposes the sad reality of how far we are from such a point. This deep significance deserves to be considered. There can be no genuine talk of reconciliation until the day the Aboriginal flag has equal status on our flagpole with the Union Jack. It would have been a fitting symbol for today to share our flagpole with the Aboriginal flag.

        Like a number of my colleagues—and Senator Teague has spoken of his involvement in the 1967 referendum campaign—I too was involved in the referendum campaign in North Queensland. In North Queensland in 1967, as I am sure many honourable senators will understand, I had no concept of a 91 per cent acceptance of that constitutional change. It was a major victory. It was a very pleasant surprise to us when that vote was announced from around the nation.

People like Faith Bandler, John Newfong, Joe McGuiness, Charles Perkins and Pat O'Shane—names that then did not mean anything very much to anybody, I am sure they will agree, but names that have become very significant names in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community over the years.

        After the referendum in North Queensland a number of us got together and said, `Really, what is needed now is some follow-up to the referendum'. We were involved in a major conference that was called, `We the Australians, what is to follow the referendum?' At the time some of us thought the name was a little quaint and that perhaps it did not go all the way to emphasising the crucial significance of the referendum passing, but we wanted to ensure that governments of whatever political persuasion did actually act on that very historic reform.

        Our conference was addressed by people like Dr Colin Tatz, Professor Charles Rowley, Joe McGuiness and Faith Bandler. At that time, again, in North Queensland it was regarded as a somewhat sinister conference. It was a conference that did not have the support of many people in the community. It did not have the support of the National Party Government of the day, but it was an important conference for our community. I believe that it was an important conference in terms of the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians who, for the first time, came together—in that part of the world anyway—for a conference to debate the issues and to look at the future agenda.

         In talking about the present it is important to acknowledge that, while the passing of that referendum was historic, while there have been so many changes in social policy, in social attitudes and in opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there is certainly no cause for what I would call celebration.

        It is appropriate to commemorate and to mark this significant milestone, but despite all the best efforts—and Senator Teague spoke about Ministers and governments—all have succeeded and all have failed in some respects. That is a tragedy for all Australians in that yes, there have been tremendous social reforms; yes, there has been good intent on behalf of governments and Ministers; and yes, a great deal has been achieved; but we are only a short way down the track with regard to fundamental change in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy in this country.

        I think that we will have an opportunity to understand just how far we have yet to go down that path of changing attitudes if we look at some of the attitudes that are available through opinion polling about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia in 1991. Whereas in 1967 we were able to achieve that magnificent 91 per cent support, now, when we look at some of the statistics, there is some cause for concern, but equally some cause for optimism. For example, with regard to the question, `Should Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders take more responsibility for their own lives?' there was an overwhelming 96 per cent yes vote, according to the opinion poll. But in the same opinion poll, when asked, `What about self-government for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people?' the vote was only 35 per cent.

        Clearly, there is a very real double standard here. On the one hand the Australian community is very quick to blame Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and tell them that they should get out and do things in the way that other Australians do. On the other hand, when we say in the next breath, `What about land rights? What about self-government? What about autonomy?' immediately the answer is `Oh no, we don't mean that. We mean that Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders should do more, but we are not prepared to give them the autonomy with which to do so'. That is a fundamental conflict that has to be resolved.

        It is interesting, on a more optimistic note, however, that in regard to questions relating to strengthening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island culture, and more funds being made available for doing so with regard to education and employment training, the statistics go up into the 70s and the 80s: 88 per cent for strengthening culture; 76 per cent for special education programs; and 78 per cent for special employment programs. However, when it comes to Australians who would support a formal recognition that Australian Aborigines and Islanders were the first Australians in terms of being here before colonisation—a treaty or some other form of document, declaration, compact; the name does not matter—then only 55 per cent support such a treaty.

We do not have another 25 years, frankly. We have had 25 years to get to where we are today. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people have been extremely patient, but I have to say to honourable senators without being alarmist, I hope, that I just wonder how long their patience will last.

        , and today being the National Union of Students national day of action on student financial assistance, highlight the need for re-evaluation and reform of the current system. The student financial assistance scheme, Austudy, remains a restrictive and inequitable system. It is a mass of inconsistencies. Today's debate deals with one of those inequities.

         I have moved this disallowance motion today in order to rectify one of the many problems with the scheme. Regulation 35 deems that the recoverable amount of interest payable on late repayment of overpayments shall be 20 per cent per year. That is, the Government seeks to prescribe a 20 per cent interest rate on the late repayment of Austudy overpayments. While the Student Assistance Act 1973 allows for an interest rate to be charged on these payments, the amount the Government has prescribed in this case is exorbitant. The figure of 20 per cent bears no relation to current market rates, but is loosely based on what the Government has deemed a corresponding provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

         The role of Austudy is to alleviate financial hardships and to assist participation in education, not to add to these burdens or to cripple students with debts and charges. A 20 per cent interest rate is a punitive measure. It is a measure designed to scare students who have failed to repay or to make arrangements to repay their debts within a three-month period. However, we know the realities of the administration of the Austudy scheme, and it is common knowledge that information such as changes in circumstances leading to overpayments is often not received or is delayed by the Department. The Department of Employment, Education and Training does not deny that many of the students who will incur this excessive amount of interest are simply victims of circumstance, as one DEET official has described them.

         The Government's intention to prescribe an interest rate on late repayments of overpayments is understandable. It is both necessary and financially sensible to recoup these financial losses, and is a move reflected in many pieces of legislation dealing with the payments of benefits of various kinds. What the Democrats object to is the amount of interest that will be charged in this case. Twenty per cent is an unnecessarily high and punitive amount. I have to say that the measure to disallow this regulation has considerable support amongst both academics and students. On 26 May I received a letter from the Society of St Vincent de Paul.

         —The situation of overpayments must be examined more closely before this interest figure is determined. We cannot overlook that fact that some of the overpayment cases are the result of administrative difficulties and that many students receive overpayments through no fault of their own but due to the Department failing to respond quickly to or failing to process information. Although as much as $52m per annum was paid to ineligible students last year, over half this money has been recouped and arrangements have been made to recover most of the outstanding funds.

         Contrary to the Opposition's belief, students receiving overpayments are not perpetrators of fraudulent deeds or guilty behaviour. It is also necessary to identify the types of people we are talking about. Students are not part of a well off socio-economic order. Typically, students live on incomes that are below the poverty line and may face low living standards. It seems a ruthless move and one that shows a complete lack of understanding of the realities of student life which allows the Government to hit students with an interest rate of 20 per cent on overpayments that may not even be their fault at a time when they may be attempting to find employment or may be without a job.

         The Democrats oppose regulation 35 on legislative and financially sustainable grounds. We oppose the excessive amount of interest that is proposed, but base this objection also on legal precedent in the income tax legislation. The rationale behind the interest rate is somewhat misguided. Although there are allowances in corresponding legislation for a 20 per cent interest charge on overpayments such as those contained in the Social Security Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act, the latter is currently under revision.

         New taxation legislation introduced in Parliament yesterday seeks to clarify the existing Income Tax Assessment Act. The new income tax legislation reviews the legislative penalties and, in so doing, differentiates between the types of actions resulting in underpayment of tax. Currently, section 3 of the Taxation (Interest on Underpayments) Act prescribes an interest rate of 14.026 per cent. This figure is more appropriate financially and illustrates a compatibility with market rates. This figure is the interest rate attached to underpayments of taxation which are the equivalent of Austudy overpayments. In the new tax legislation, for the purposes of recouping tax which is innocently or inadvertently underpaid, the Government nominates a charge which is equal to the 13-week Treasury note average yield plus 4 per cent, and currently this works out to about 10 or 11 per cent.

Many of these recommendations deserve serious consideration if we are to make the scheme more flexible and a more appropriately targeted one. However, the Chapman report also considers some aggressive measures such as the introduction of a loans scheme. The Democrats believe that this would have a devastating effect on participation rates in higher education and we are unanimously opposed to its introduction. The notion that grants should be replaced by a system of loans has alarmed and outraged the student, academic and wider community. They quite rightly see this as formally entrenching user pays education in this country; nor can we expect students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds—this includes women, mature-age, part time, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds—to face the prospect of debt with equanimity.

         Another proposal is the concept of a `mix and match' loans and grants scheme. To many this represents the thin edge of the wedge and would set a precedent for an erosion in the value of grants. In this scheme students would be able to trade in their grants for twice the amount in a loan form. This loan would then be repaid through the taxation system in a manner similar to that of the higher education contribution scheme. The rhetoric promotes this as increased choice for students. It claims that this represents a more flexible approach in a hitherto restrictive system. The reality, of course, is that many students would be forced to take out the doubled loan amount due to desperate economic circumstances. Thus, the concept of choice is farcical.

         Despite a proliferation of Government reports into student financial assistance in the past three years, we have yet to see any substantial reform of the system. There are some changes in the current set of regulations we are debating today that the Democrats do welcome. The increase in the personal income tax threshold from $4,000 to $5,000 is a small step towards defining a realistic personal income threshold so that students are no longer heavily penalised for attempting to earn an income above their meagre Austudy benefits. Until the Government recognises $8,000 per annum as the minimum personal threshold, its commitment to providing a realistic means of student financial support is questionable. It is worth noting that this was a recommendation of the Chapman report.

         In these regulations the minor relaxation in the academic progress rules is also a desirable change. Nevertheless, there remain glaring inequities in the scheme. The definition of `independence' at the age of 25 years has been considered arbitrary and ridiculous for many years. Despite the fact that young people are deemed eligible to vote, to drink, to marry, to bear arms and to drive at the age of 18 and earlier, they are still considered dependent upon their parents until the age of 25 by virtue of being a student. This defies all logic in today's world.

         The assumption that young students up to the age of 25 receive material support from their parents reveals the Government's lack of knowledge about the situation for many young people in society who, despite total financial independence from their families for the purposes of Austudy, are judged to be supported by their parents' incomes. This myth has been exposed many times. Material support for students and young people is not always forthcoming from their parents for many reasons. In fact, young people are often expected to contribute to their families to assist with living costs such as rent, utilities and food. Despite evidence that refutes the assumption that under 21-year-olds are assisted by their parents, Austudy still bases its method of payment on the parental living income and assets.

         The change in the independent status from the age of 25 to 21 years is strongly supported by a range of groups in the community, including NUS and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, and has been reinforced in reports, including the Chapman report and the report of the Government's own House of Representatives Standing Committee on student financial assistance. This week, the AVCC has publicly supported changes to the age of independence. In its report for the 1993-95 triennium entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         </emphasis>
         , Austudy is described as `a scheme of fundamental importance to students and especially to fair and equitable access to universities.' It then recommends an increase in Austudy payments to the level of unemployment benefits, a lowering of the age of independence, an increase in the personal income threshold and a review of the parental assets and income test. The AVCC recognises that students are the foundation of our clever country.

It is time to re-examine our commitment to education and to re-evaluate the concept of student financial assistance as a vital part of this commitment to education. The Government must decide whether Austudy exists as a form of income supplement. If it does, it must allow students to earn additional money without punitive levels of taxation or a low income tax threshold. If Austudy is considered an income in itself, we must provide for a realistic living allowance.

We must demonstrate a realistic commitment to those aspiring to undertake education and training.

I challenge the Government to make the necessary and long overdue changes and, until then, to stop placating the student movement with false hopes and promises in the form of additional reports.

         In the meantime, attempts to recoup funds by hitting those most in need with an interest rate of 20 per cent defies all logic. It is another short-sighted measure that has little basis in legislation or welfare. I commend the motion to the Senate.

The extravagant words of Senator Sowada, my good friend, do not justify the motion that she has brought to the Senate today. The Senate knows that the Austudy regulations that were brought down in April were open to disallowance by either chamber over the 15 sitting days that have followed.

         So it is that we now come to that very small part of the total Austudy regulations that Senator Sowada has addressed in her remarks today. It involves a single innovation of a 20 per cent interest rate to be applied as a penalty to overpayments or wrong payments of Austudy if those amounts are not repaid within a three-month period.

         The Chapman report roundly calls for a whole range of new initiatives for Austudy, many of which are in tune with the views of the Opposition—the Liberal and National parties—over the last five and even 10 years. He contemplates a more flexible Austudy scheme that would allow students to opt to forsake some part of their grant in order to gain double that amount in a loans scheme that would be repaid under the higher education contribution scheme.

         The Chapman report calls for more precise targeting of those students who are in need. That has been the cry of the Liberal and National parties. There is a call for reviewing the family income assessment so that the present inequities that arise are overcome. Again, the Liberal and National parties have called for that. Above all, there is a call—a proposition that the Liberal and National parties have been putting for some time—that no student in Australia should be prevented from taking a course of study through a lack of financial resources alone. The Chapman report finds that a minority—something like 20 per cent; I cannot find it immediately as I have only been able to look at the report in a cursory way this afternoon—of students would not have proceeded to tertiary study if there had not been the Austudy payments.

         We have been seeing for the first time, whether from the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, the tertiary education assistance scheme or the Austudy scheme, that when there is an overpayment or a wrong payment the student has with proper notice three months to repay that overpayment. From 1 January this year there has been 20 per cent per annum interest on that amount of overpayment.

         At the moment, $1.171 billion is paid out in the Austudy scheme. The amount of overpayment or wrong payment is about 4 per cent of that figure. In the last financial year, $42m in overpayments or wrong payments was paid out by the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Austudy benefits. Of that amount, unfortunately, only $19m has been recovered. In summary, $1.2 billion is paid out in Austudy; 4 per cent of that amount is in wrong payment; and only 2 per cent, half of that, is recovered. It is clear that by this new regulation the Government wants to give a direct penalty as an incentive for those overpayments to be returned into the program so that the students for whom Austudy is rightly targeted should receive the benefit and not those for whom it is not targeted.

         Senator Sowada has said that this is an excessive amount. It happens to be exactly the introductory penalty interest rate for those who are at fault in not paying due taxes under the income tax system. Income tax penalties can greatly exceed 20 per cent. I am sure that the parallel between the penalty rate for tax in the Taxation Office and the penalty rate for these payments—there being such a harmony these days between payments such as Austudy and the tax system—is appropriate. It is not arbitrary, it is not excessive and it has two buffer periods. First, there is the buffer period of three months before that interest rate begins and, secondly, there is a period in which a student who thinks that this payment ought to be reconsidered, or for which he thinks there is a claim, can appeal through the appropriate appeal mechanisms. In many cases it would be a matter of some six months before that interest rate penalty would begin.

         The Opposition does not support the attempt by the Democrats to eliminate that interest rate penalty; rather, we think it is appropriate. I note that one of the main reasons for overpayment or wrong payment is that an incorrect statement on an application may be discovered when that application is being audited and as a result the assessor within the Department of Employment, Education and Training will review and change the eligibility for all or some of the Austudy payment. Some of it will be backdated to the beginning of the year and some will be backdated to a particular event in the year.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another reason is where a student changes circumstances but those circumstances are not brought to the attention of the Department until some later period. For example, if a student is enrolled in less than three-quarters of a year's workload, they are no longer defined as a full time student, and Austudy is only available to full time students. If by withdrawing from one half subject a student moves over that line, they may even not be aware that they have moved into a position where they are no longer to receive Austudy from the date of that change in their enrolment. From that date, they are no longer eligible to receive the Austudy payments and a repayment is required of them. The three months in which they are to make the repayment of that amount starts at that time. At the end of the three months they may well have a continuing period arising from their appeal. But, in any event, the interest rate begins only after those two buffer periods.

         Today I received a letter from the South Australian President of the National Union of Students. Being a South Australian and having been a student at the University of Adelaide and an adviser to students—in fact, I was responsible for student services at the university—I give very real attention to such a letter. The letter says that we should knock out this 20 per cent interest charge. It gives examples of the kinds of reasons why overpayments arise. The second paragraph of Carla Stacey's letter of today's date states:

        I honestly say to my good friend Carla Stacey, and to any other students, that these are two of the lesser reasons for there being an overpayment under Austudy. I ask them to reconsider it and more comprehensively address the kinds of circumstances that lead to overpayment.

It is wrong of the National Union of Students to misrepresent the situation to students and it is counterproductive vis-a-vis their credibility if they move the Government or next year's government—the Liberal-National Party government—to rightly respond to those credible requests that are to be made for improvement of the system.

         Let me refer to two other matters. One is the approach of the Democrats generally in this area, which I do not accept, and the other is the improvements to Austudy that the Liberal and National parties have already announced as part of the Fightback package. It has now become well-known in this chamber that the Liberal and National parties will, on coming to office, spend more than $3 billion of additional money on tertiary, secondary and primary education. A considerable proportion of that additional $3 billion for new education programs will be spent on students who are receiving Austudy, both at the tertiary and secondary level. All educational services will be free of the goods and services tax.

         In addition, the higher education contribution scheme will be retained. There will be an increase in the discount for that portion which is eventually subject to HECS and which can be avoided by an upfront payment. Under the present Government, there is a 15 per cent discount if the HECS liability is avoided by an upfront payment. We will increase that discount to 25 per cent. It will give a genuine benefit to many students who will take the option of paying upfront that portion of what is required of them for their academic enrolment.

         We will review the student assistance arrangements to ensure that assistance is provided equitably and that no-one is shut out of higher education purely on financial grounds. I repeat: a guiding light of the approach of the Liberal and National parties is to have an Austudy scheme which ensures that nobody is shut out of higher education purely on financial grounds. We will better target Austudy by including only those receivers of it who are eligible for $30 a week or more. The actual benefit under Austudy will increase by 6 per cent, which will occur automatically at the time of the introduction of the new taxation arrangements, targeted for 1 October, 1994. This increase in Austudy amounts exceeds the 4.4 per cent increase in costs estimated to flow from the introduction of a GST.

We will stop the bureaucratic monopolies of decision-making that have been arrogated by the Labor Government in Canberra and that have been a block to so many good initiatives that otherwise would have happened at the local institutional level for the benefit of students.

Every single student would qualify for the full amount; there would be no targeting on the basis of family incomes. The Democrats want to give Austudy to everybody. They want to make sure that it is increased to 120 per cent of the poverty line, and that it is indexed. This is the bleeding hearts party of the Democrats.

But that is not enough for the Democrats. They will go immediately to one per cent. An article written by Richard Farmer, dated 21 February 1990, states:

The Democrats want no tertiary taxes or fees—that is, no HECS—and Austudy to be increased to 120 per cent of the poverty line, and indexed, and available to all students.

I think it is sufficient to say that the Government's position on these measures has been spelt out by the relevant Minister. I think it is also sufficient to say that much of the argument I would embark on has been put forward by Senator Teague.

         There is a reason for the regulation and for the rate of interest of 20 per cent. It is inappropriate to compare the rate of 20 per cent to the commercial rate, and I think Senator Sowada understands that very well. From the smile on her face, it is quite apparent that she does. As Senator Teague and Senator MacDonald said in the last half hour, it is a populist approach and we can understand why the Democrats are doing it.

         We are talking about an area that has had major and exponential increase in terms of support to students over recent years. But we are also talking about an area which has been subject to criticism in the past from, for instance, the Australian National Audit Office. The Department was criticised for not implementing the penalty provisions relating to debts. The regulation that is the subject of debate this evening is a regulation that will apply to those who are not paying their debts promptly. As Senator Teague said, it does not apply to all students who have moneys outstanding in this area.

         No interest charge applies to debtors who repay the overpayment within three months of the notification of the debt. That point needs to be made in this debate because it was not recognised sufficiently by Senator Sowada. We should also make the point that those who repay their debts by instalments in accordance with acceptable arrangements with the Department will also not incur interest. Students who continue to be entitled to assistance will not be penalised as their debts will be recovered by withholding a portion of their entitlement. Debtors without financial resources to repay debts may also have their debt considered for write-off action. So the regulation is not as stringent, not as hard, as the Democrats would have it appear.

         The reason we have fixed on 20 per cent is that what the Government recognises is needed here and what the Opposition also recognises is needed here is a powerful inducement to encourage former clients of the Department to repay their overpayments promptly. There are mechanisms in place—there are pressure valves—to ensure that those suffering hardship and those who do pay are not penalised. However, it is important to ensure that there is a powerful inducement in the process. It should be recognised that the 20 per cent rate of interest is consistent with the charge that applies to taxpayers with outstanding liabilities to the Commissioner of Taxation.

         The question also is: who will pay that money? It may well be the student. The student normally, under those circumstances, does not have the money to pay for it. The obligation to pay then goes back to the parents. They are the ones who, all along the line, have been disadvantaged by a number of government decisions in the last seven or eight years—even further back. The position is that an unjustifiably heavy tax burden is placed on those parents who are keeping their sons and daughters at university without any assistance or with minimal assistance from the Government.

         I take issue here with a point made in the Chapman report. The Chapman report, which was referred to by Senator Teague, indicates that the most important consideration for an income support scheme which is designed to remove financial barriers to participation in education by the disadvantaged lies in ensuring that the right amount of support goes to the right people. Although I have not completely read this paper—it came into my possession only today—the point is that that is only one aspect. It is true that it is a very important aspect but it is only one. It does not go to the question of horizontal tax equity; that is, tax equity for those families at whatever level of income who have sons and daughters going through universities and whose university related expenses are paid for by those families. Compare such a family with another family whose sons and daughters are not going through university and therefore does not have the burden of paying for fees, books, transport and so on. To be quite frank, that is an issue which has to be considered and faced up to, but it is not being faced up to.

         Before 1976 one could claim a taxation deduction in respect of the expenditure from the family income on the education of one's sons and daughters. Now one cannot. It can be done by a company, it can be done by a business, but the most important business in Australia, families, cannot claim. I agree that, under the particular rules, if there is an overpayment there should be an incentive for it to be paid back. Creating the incentive surely is action that can be taken by the Government for crying out loud.

         If a particular rate is to be levied in respect of that particular overpayment, it should be made a reasonable rate, on the basis of justice, not on the basis of incentive. The incentive, surely, should apply to the benefits control units, in terms of getting the money back. Indeed, I am not so sure that the description of the situation given by the Minister and by Senator Teague is adequate. I am not saying that what they said is incorrect, but the overall rate for underpayments as I have it in the tax rates and tables 1991-92—that is, the underpayments by the taxpayer to the Taxation department, which is the equivalent of overpayments by DEET to students—appears to be 14.026 per cent. Of course, even that figure is well above the commercial rate.

         —in reply—I wish briefly to exercise my right of reply on this issue, especially after listening to Senator Teague's rather gratuitous criticisms of various aspects of Democrat policy. It is quite clear that he had not read the Chapman report in any detail. If he had, he would have noted that one of Chapman's recommendations was that Austudy be indexed to the CPI. He would also have noted that Chapman himself noted that Austudy is below the dole. What incentive is there for students to continue their education when they can in fact receive a higher level of benefits on the dole? On those two elements alone, it is clear Senator Teague is simply talking off the top of his head. Quite clearly he had received the report only this afternoon and had not had a chance to read it in detail. Certainly Chapman himself recognises that the inadequacy of current Austudy benefits is a major problem and is a disincentive for many students to continue their education.

         Senator Bolkus referred to criticism about DEET and its administration in respect of Austudy. It is well known that DEET has been very heavily criticised for its administration of Austudy, for the fact that many students receive overpayments to which they are not entitled, and for the fact that many aspects of student requests for changes to their benefits take a long time to feed through the system. It is not only simply a matter of students failing in their responsibilities but also a problem of administration in DEET which has been recognised by the Auditor-General and by this place.

         Senator Teague also mentioned Democrat policy in relation to a significant increase in funds for research activity. I think it would be widely recognised by higher education institutions, by business and, in fact, by this Government that there must be a significant increase in Australia's research and development activities if it is to become internationally competitive. It is absolutely critical that we develop new technologies, that we develop market niches and that we can hold our heads high on the international stage as our markets for our traditional exports fall and as income from those exports falls. We must significantly increase research activity for high-tech products. If Senator Teague believes that this is an inappropriate activity for universities and for business to be engaged in, he is obviously not in touch with what is going on in the marketplace and with what Australia needs to become internationally competitive.

That is a significant public investment directly into an area of technology which will yield significant benefits to that country over a long period. We will be left behind if we simply believe that Australia can carry on its merry way by simply ripping minerals out of the ground, ripping wool off the sheep's back and continuing to grow wheat and so forth. We must become internationally competitive by improving our technological base and using the intellects that we know we have in Australia's scientific community.

         We should also look at what the Opposition plans to do to education. This is a very important point because Senator Teague referred to a number of elements of the Democrat policy. He said that we were being populist. Senator Teague is obviously not aware that his own Party's policies are in fact not widely supported within the academic community and especially amongst students. The Opposition has every reason to be extremely concerned about its education policies and how they may well be received over the coming 12 months. Once the people of Australia find out what those policies will actually do, I think they will be extremely worried about the prospect of a coalition government.

         It is worth noting that the Opposition proposes fees for university courses. It proposes to introduce student vouchers. There will be a set amount of money for a student to be able to go along to an institution and enrol in whichever course they choose, and then universities will be allowed to charge a fee in addition to that voucher. It is worth noting that we have seen significant deregulation of course fees for postgraduate study. In the past 12 months we have seen universities take advantage of and grasp in both hands this deregulatory mechanism that has been offered to them.

         What has in fact happened is that, for a variety of course work programs at various institutions which will involve postgraduate degrees to help people improve their professional qualifications, many institutions have chosen to charge most exorbitant rates for those courses. For example, an institution in Melbourne now charges $26,000 for an MBA program. That is under this Government's current policies. I ask you, Mr Deputy President, to consider what would happen under the Opposition's policies if this particular method of deregulation was extended across the entire university system and applied to undergraduate degrees as well.

         The AVCC has said that it is extremely concerned about the kind of mechanism that this would introduce into tertiary institutions in Australia. We could see the cost of a medical degree reaching the level of $130,000, given the fact that it is a five year degree and given the level of capital works and the level of equipment that is needed for degrees of that nature. We could find that many degrees such as medicine, veterinary science and other science degrees become totally out of reach for the average Australian simply because universities took advantage of market driven policies. That would price many courses out of the reach of average students. It is quite clear that many of the Opposition's education policies are not widely supported. People are very concerned about them. The Opposition will have a great deal of difficulty in trying to sell an education policy to the electorate where excellence in education actually equals elitism.

         To get back to the Austudy motion for disallowance, which is what this debate is actually about, I reiterate that the Democrats do not object to the notion of charging an interest rate for a late repayment of an Austudy overpayment, but we do object to punitive interest rates and an interest rate that bears no relationship to the current level of market rates. For example, Senator Teague referred to much higher interest rates applicable in tax legislation, and certainly that is very true.

         I seek to clarify my earlier comments in relation to tax. I mentioned earlier a tax Bill that is currently being considered by this House—the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self-Assessment) Bill 1992—which was introduced into the Parliament this week. This legislation actually reforms the legislative penalties and differentiates between the types of actions resulting in the underpayment of tax, remembering of course that the underpayment of tax is equivalent to an Austudy overpayment.

         This particular legislation provides for a dichotomous system consisting of separate penalty provisions and separate interest provisions; that is, a system that deliberately takes into account the circumstances leading to the underpayment of tax and imposes penalties according to the actions of the taxpayer. Where there is no fault on behalf of the taxpayer there is no penal component, although there is an interest component. Where the taxpayer is at fault there is a penal charge plus interest imposed. This differentiation is supported by the Democrats and we ask the Government why it does not institute a similar system for Austudy. Notwithstanding this superior system, the tax legislation I have cited also proposes to change the existing interest rate component which will be charged at 4 per cent above the Government's short term borrowing rate. That change to the interest rate for tax underpayments is currently before the Parliament and will in fact reduce the level of interest payable to tax underpayments.

It is a totally inconsistent position that, once again, we have seen the Government put before this Parliament. We are not saying to the Government, `Simply disallow this regulation and let us have a zero interest component on Austudy overpayments'. We are saying, `Go back to the drawing board and have another think about this in light of legislation you are currently passing and come up with something more reasonable'.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Act to correct a deficiency in the Act in relation to the giving of evidence of analysts in court proceedings by way of a certificate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The AMLC Act currently provides that a certificate of analysis (for example, analysis of product for residues) is prima facie evidence of the information it contains. The deficiency arises, however, in that the certificate fails to establish that the substances which have been analysed were those found in the possession of the accused, seized and passed onto the analyst for analysis. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions believes that this deficiency requires the analyst to attend court to give evidence in support of other continuity witnesses.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendment proposed in this Bill will allow the certificate of the analyst to contain information as to the date of receipt of the substance, the name of the person from whom it was received and a description of the substance. This will directly link the substances analysed with those found in the possession of the accused and overcome the gap in the chain of evidence, obviating the need for the analyst to attend court to give evidence, unless called by the defendant.

        The major part of this Bill is to provide for amendments to legislation for the wool industry. The amendments relate specifically to the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991 (the AWC Act), the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 the (AWRC Act), and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 (PIERD Act).

        In addition, as part of the overall package of changes to the wool industry legislation, proposed amendments to the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964, and to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5)1964, will be introduced separately.

        The primary purpose of the package of amendments to the wool legislation is to provide mechanisms for distributing surplus Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC) funds to wool growers and to introduce more flexibility into the current debt reduction arrangements. Both of these initiatives were recently announced in the `One Nation' statement. The package will also provide for other relatively minor amendments to the wool industry legislation, most of which are at the request of those involved in aspects of its administration.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the wool industry represents yet another case which clearly demonstrates this Government's capacity to work with industry to develop sound public policy. The Government's position has always been clear: we will accept advice from a variety of sources, we will consult with the industry and jointly develop a policy base that will take those industries forward. What we have also made clear is that we will not be driven by ideological approaches that fail to recognise the concerns and requirements of industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, Honourable Senators will be aware of the radical changes to the statutory industry framework and marketing arrangements for wool which came into effect in July last year. The new statutory authorities (the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC), the new Australian Wool Corporation (AWC), and the Wool R&amp;D Corporation (WRDC) have taken up their respective roles with enthusiasm and commitment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The AWRC, in particular, has a significant challenge in selling the stockpile and discharging the industry debt. At the same time it must have regard for the overall impact of its activities on the market. While ever there is a large stockpile there is a potential for that stockpile to overhang the market in such a way as to create uncertainty and affect demand.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Twelve months ago the stockpile stood at 4.7 million bales and the debt was around $2.7 billion. At the time we expected that the AWRC would only be able to pay off a small amount of the debt in 1991/92 and the debt schedule therefore set the repayment target for the year at $20 million.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since July the AWRC has been affected by a range of factors combining to enable it to achieve a higher income from sales from its stockpile of wool than was anticipated at the start of the season. The reasons for this include lower levels of wool production, the quality of the wool in the stockpile being different to recent drought affected production, increased demand for stocks to replenish the wool processing pipeline, and higher prices than expected. As a result, the AWRC is now well ahead of its required debt repayment target for this year.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To build on that better than expected outcome for the AWRC, the Government decided it was appropriate to change the AWRC debt reduction schedule from an annual to a cumulative basis as announced in the `One Nation' statement. This provision will give the AWRC more flexibility in adjusting its operations to market conditions. In the event of a market downturn the flexibility to pay off more debt in some years will give it the capacity to pay off less if returns are lower in others. It will however, need to ensure that the maximum debt balances at the end of each year do not exceed the limits set within the cumulative debt schedule.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is possible in some years that funds might be generated by the AWRC which are not prudently required for the debt repayment program. Therefore, recognising that most growers are currently receiving low incomes, the Government believes that a way is needed to distribute to growers any such surplus funds generated by the AWRC. In the `One Nation' statement it was indicated that any surplus funds not prudently required by the AWRC may be used as a rebate to growers in the form of a cash payment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the government also gave a commitment to consult with the wool industry on the distribution of such funds to growers. Following those constructive discussions and with the agreement of the Wool Council, I announced in April that I propose to use any surplus funds generated by the AWRC during the current year as a rebate against the wool tax in 1992-93. My intention is that this will enable a reduction in the effective rate of the tax for next season while maintaining the prescribed rate of the tax at the existing 12 per cent. The Wool Council support this position.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments proposed in the Bill will provide the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy with the flexibility to distribute surplus AWRC funds as a rebate of wool tax, as a cash payment to wool tax payers, or to determine that the surplus should remain in the Stockpile Fund to pay off more debt. A determination would be made after the Minister had been advised by the AWRC if it holds surplus funds which are not required for the prudent management of the debt repayment program and the operation of the Stockpile Fund. Before making a decision, the Minister will be required to consult with the Wool Council of Australia about the distribution of the surplus.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, I am optimistic about the future for wool. However, it is difficult to accurately predict what the market might do in the years ahead and therefore whether the AWRC will generate a surplus in future years. I am particularly mindful to also ensure that the objective to prudently manage the debt and stockpile sales must remain clear and uncompromised. To this end I will continue to strongly resist calls for a reduction in the overall prescribed wool tax rate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government does not believe, on the basis of one year's performance, that it would be prudent to lower the prescribed rate of tax at this time. To do that might result in having to put the tax rate up again in a later year if the market suffers a downturn. The Wool Council of Australia endorses this position.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The level of the tax rebate to apply in 1992-93 will be decided in June this year and I will be considering the advice I receive from the AWRC on the size of the surplus when making that decision. I will also be consulting with Wool Council on the matter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, as I mentioned earlier, this Bill also contains a number of other amendments which have been made at the request of the AWC, the AWRC and the Australian Wool Industry Council (AWIC) in the light of experience with the legislation to date. Generally these amendments are intended to fine-tune some of the administrative provisions. Three of them warrant some explanatory comment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The AWC has requested modifications to the way in which the register of wool tax payers entitled to vote at general meetings, is maintained. The proposed amendments will provide for grower registration and voting entitlements to be specified in a 3 year rolling register. Growers will be able to update their details each year if they wish. If they considered that the details previously provided were still relevant, then their entry on the register would be maintained for 3 years. In making these changes, the administration of the register will be simplified, and growers will be relieved of the annual requirement to make a formal application to be registered.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As well, an addition is proposed to the types of motions which can be put and voted on at an AWC annual general meeting. Under the current legislation woolgrowers are unable to put forward motions on general business matters within the AWC's responsibilities. The proposed amendment will mean greater accountability between woolgrowers and the AWC by allowing a wider range of motions to be debated and voted upon.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Amendments to ensure that the AWRC has the appropriate and well defined powers to deal in hedging has been requested by them following discussions with financial institutions and in the light of legal advice. The changes will ensure that the Commission has the commercial flexibility which is consistent with its functions. The proposed changes are similar to recently made provisions for other statutory authorities and in essence, ensure that the AWRC has the power to use hedging contracts to manage risks of variations in the cost of borrowings as well as risks of adverse variations in foreign currency transactions. In addition the AWRC will be able to use hedging to manage returns on investments. Similar amendments have also been made to the AWC legislation at the request of the AWC.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the request of the Australian Wool Industry Council (AWIC) an amendment has been made to the AWC Act to provide additional flexibility in the registration authority for wool sampling sites, testing laboratories and showfloors. Currently the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) is the sole registration authority. The proposed amendment will provide for the possibility that an alternative registration authority to NATA may be prescribed at some time in the future.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some minor amendments have also been made to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 (the PIERD Act). These amendments are required as a consequence of amendments made to the AWC Act regarding the establishment and maintenance of a register of woolgrowers for the purposes of voting at an annual general meeting.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All of the proposed amendments which make up the package of changes to the wool legislation are responsible decisions which fine tune the statutory arrangements and show that the Government is sensitive to ensuring there is an appropriate and flexible framework for the industry.

The basis for setting the threshold is not linked to the actual levy rates but is related to the estimated collection cost per levy return. These provisions will permit different thresholds to be prescribed for future levy years according to changing economic circumstances.

        COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These Bills form an important part of the Government's Coal Industry Reform Package.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        They provide for the amendment and (ultimately) the repeal of the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 which, together with complementary state legislation, establish the present scheme for the funding of long service leave in the black coal mining industry in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current scheme is funded by way of an excise on coal production levied at 20 cents per tonne. Under the proposed arrangements, long service leave will be funded by a levy on payroll.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new scheme has been agreed to by the relevant states and all elements in the industry affected have been consulted in relation to the proposed reforms.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On 2 December 1991 the Government announced a range of initiatives in relation to the coal industry. These were announced in the Government's coal industry policy statement jointly issued by the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The statement presents the most far-reaching changes to coal industry policy since the immediate post-war period. Reform of the industry's long service leave arrangements is part of those initiatives.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The policy statement followed a review of long service leave funding undertaken by Mr L J Willett, then chairperson of the superannuation fund investment trust, and was delivered to the Minister for Industrial Relations in November 1990. The report recommended changes to the present funding scheme. It also proposed that the scheme should be fully funded so as to facilitate the portability of long service leave in the industry and to ensure the preservation of benefits in the event of companies going out of business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government agrees with the general thrust of Mr Willett's report and believes that responsibility for administering the fund should be returned to the industry. It recognises, however, that in the short run this may impose significant cost burdens on sections of the industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Existing arrangements have operated on a "pay as you go" basis, and a substantial unfunded liability for long service leave has accrued. Moreover, large scale, highly productive producers (largely represented by the Queensland Mining Council) raised concerns that they presently cross-subsidise the operations of more labour intensive mines, predominantly the underground coal mining industry in NSW.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In commenting on the Willett report's recommendations, industry parties and State Governments agreed that outstanding liabilities and future accruals should be funded on a more equitable and rational basis related to employment costs. The Government believes that the new arrangements safeguard the public interest in maintaining a viable coal mining industry whilst representing an appropriate balance between the principles of efficiency and equity and the interests of the disparate parties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bills terminate the present excise funding arrangement and implement a new industry-managed fully funded scheme. With the co-operation of the States, it is envisaged that the new funding arrangements will become fully operational from 1 January 1993. The principal features of the scheme are as follows.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is to be a single national scheme under Commonwealth legislation, and its management is to be the responsibility of a board of directors made up of employer and union representatives.

        The legislation will establish a Coal Mining Industry (long service leave funding) Corporation. The corporation will be wholly self financing and will have two functions. The first will be to manage the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Trust Fund for the purpose of reimbursing participating companies for long service leave taken by coal miners and other eligible employees.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In view of the erroneous comments made by the opposition spokesperson on industrial relations in another place, I would also like to make it abundantly clear that the funding arrangements do not discriminate between unionists and non unionists. Union membership is simply not a criteria for determining whether a person is to be regarded as an "eligible employee" for the purposes of the scheme.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For constitutional reasons it has not been possible to cover certain non award-based entitlements payable in certain states or by individual firms by tailoring the rate of levy to the circumstances in each participating state. There is nothing, however, in the scheme to prevent firms paying higher long service leave benefits where they see fit. In such cases they will not be able to claim reimbursement from the fund for payments in excess of normal entitlements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since this Bill was introduced in another place, representations have been received from the New South Wales Coal Association and the Queensland Mining Council about the meaning of the words used in paragraph (b) of the definition of "eligible employee" in clause 4.
       </para>

        The paragraph is co-extensive with five other paragraphs in clause 4 which together provide the basis for determining which employees in the Black Coal Mining Industry are to be covered by the National Scheme for securing funding of long service leave entitlements in the industry. Here, I note in passing, that the legislation does not itself create an entitlement to long service leave. The legislation merely provides for the creation of the fund upon which employers will be able, as the need arises, to draw to obtain reimbursement for payments made to eligible employees in respect of long service leave entitlements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Concern has been expressed that the absence of the words "in the Black Coal Mining Industry" from the definition of eligible employee in paragraph (b) may be construed as having the effect of widening the definition to include persons not presently covered under long standing arrangements within the industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is not the intended effect of the legislation. The words already appearing in paragraph in question, when read together with the objects of the act, which are set out in clause 3 of the legislation, limit the classes of worker who may be regarded as "eligible employees" for the purposes of the act to persons employed in the Black Coal Mining Industry. The addition of the words "in the Black Coal Mining Industry" to paragraph (b) accordingly serves no useful purpose.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government wishes to make it clear it is not its intention to extend the coverage of the scheme beyond persons who are currently regarded as being engaged in the Black Coal Mining Industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What may be described as the "boundaries" of the Black Coal Mining Industry vary within and between states and are to a significant extent determined by custom and practice reflecting a range of considerations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill accordingly provides for a means including or excluding limited numbers of workers from the scheme (but not from entitlements to long service leave) by regulation as is provided for under paragraphs (d) and (f) of clause 4. The Government will, reflecting the provisions of the legislation and the co-operative nature of the scheme, consult with representatives of all interests likely to be affected by the making of any such regulation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This will allow the industry some flexibility in regulating its affairs, whilst safeguards to protect the interests of any individuals who may be affected are retained as regulations made in respect of the coverage of the scheme will, of course, be disallowable.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is envisaged that the scheme is to be fully funded over a period of ten years including the unfunded liability for leave accrued prior 1 January 1993. Presently, it is estimated the initial levy will be in the vicinity of 6 per cent of payroll. The actual rate of levy will be precisely determined by an actuarial review conducted under the auspices of the corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I have already indicated, there are compelling reasons for continuing government involvement through a statutory corporation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, the new arrangements will substantially increase long service leave funding costs for many companies, especially by reason of the requirement to fully fund accrued liabilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The formation of a statutory corporation, rather than a private company, has enabled company income tax deductibility of contributions to the fund. The rates of payroll levy that are required to finance ongoing accruals of long service leave and to fund the accrued liability will impose significantly increased cost burdens on the industry. These rates of levy will, for some companies, equate to a cost of about 60 or 70 cents per tonne compared with the present 20 cents per tonne. The burden will fall most heavily on relatively labour intensive mines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In view of the potential cost impact of the new arrangements on sections of the industry, particularly the requirement to achieve full funding, it is appropriate that the tax treatment of levy contributions to the new scheme should be as favourable as the tax treatment of payments under the current excise funding arrangements. As excise payments are deductible for company income tax purposes it is anticipated that there will be no additional cost to revenue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The provision of tax deductibility for levy contributions also recognises that unlike most other employers, coal companies are being compelled to contribute to a long service leave fund. Other employers who make provision for their long service leave liabilities in the normal way retain the funds so provided as internal working capital. Deductibility of contributions will help offset the cost of replacing that working capital.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, the new long service leave scheme removes the inefficiencies and inequities associated with the present arrangements, and its full funding will ensure the portability and preservation of benefits. It is an important complementary component of the Government's Coal Industry Policy Reforms, which are designed to respond to changed circumstances and help secure the industry's future into the next century.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Thirdly, continuing Commonwealth involvement provides a guarantee of continuity and for a smooth transition to the privately funded scheme (or schemes) with a minimum of industrial friction.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The effect of the Bill is to remove unnecessary duplication of functions between the Board and the State, and to bring to an end the Board's powers, functions and activities in a number of areas, namely :

        Future Board membership will formalise the current arrangement which is, an independent Chairperson, an employees' representative and an employers' representative. However, the terms of appointment will be changed. The Act provides for a maximum term of appointment of seven years on a full-time basis for all Board members. The Bill will amend this to a maximum of three years on either a full-time or part-time basis.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As it stands now, policy direction to the Board can only be issued from the Prime Minister in agreement with the Premier of New South Wales. The Bill will place the Board under the direct control of both Commonwealth and State portfolio Ministers responsible for the coal industry. Provisions have been made in the Bill to improve the Board's standards of accountability in line with contemporary practice.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        From 1992/93, the Board will become largely self-funding for its continuing operations. The workers' compensation insurance, health, and welfare activities will be funded from existing resources accumulated by the Board and from future premium and other income. The other functions will be operated on a cost recovery basis. In 1991/92, the Commonwealth share for the Board's operations is $2.463M. This includes funding for the Coal Industry Tribunal which has previously been provided through the Board. Funding for the Coal Industry Tribunal will continue, and is estimated at $570,000 for 1992/93.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reforms to the Joint Coal Board embodied in this Bill ensure continuation of its high standard of delivery of services to employees in the New South Wales coal industry. The health and welfare of industry employees will in no way be compromised by this reform. Both Governments believe that the elimination of overlap with State activities and bringing the operations of the Board into sharper focus will assist the efficient operation of the State's most important export industry.

        NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1992 is to amend section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to allow the chairman and other members of the Authority to be re-appointed, up to a maximum period of appointment of four years. At present, while all categories of members of the Authority may be initially appointed for up to a maximum period of four years, only a member appointed for the purpose of dealing with a particular reference or references, may be re-appointed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In its report "Who is to Guard the Guards?", the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority recommended, at paragraph 3.89, that the Government should ensure that the terms of appointment of members allow for an overlap of membership and that a complete change of membership of the Authority at one time be avoided. The Government can act to implement this recommendation by taking account of it when making appointments and determining length of appointment. However the current situation facing the Authority shows that there is a need for greater flexibility in the legislation controlling appointments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Justice Phillips resigned his position as Chairman of the National Crime Authority on 17 December 1991 to take up his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Mr Tom Sherman took up the position of Chairman on 26 February 1992. In accordance with section 7 of the Act the Authority has two other members (Mr Greg Cusack QC based in Sydney and Mr Julian Leckie based in Melbourne) and one member specially appointed in relation to particular references (Mr Malcolm Gray QC based in Adelaide). The terms of appointment for Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie end on 30 June 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would create serious problems for the Authority to lose both Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie on 30 June 1992. Both members are heavily involved in current references. Mr Sherman has only recently been appointed as Chairman and Mr Gray QC, although he has been a member for almost twelve months, has necessarily been confined to a limited aspect of the Authority's operations. The further complication is that, as a result of Mr Justice Phillips' unexpected resignation, the Authority (in the absence of Messrs Cusack QC and Leckie) would lack members with any significant tenure and experience.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is Government policy, reflected in the National Crime Authority Act 1984, that no member of the Authority should serve for a period longer than four years. That policy is currently enshrined in section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, and this Bill makes no change to that.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, as the Act presently stands, it is not possible to re-appoint members of the Authority, except for members specially appointed in relation to particular references, even if the initial term was for a period less than four years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fact that one class of member can be re-appointed while others cannot is an anomaly which the Bill will correct.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In spite of best planning, the current circumstances facing the Authority show that it is not possible to give a guarantee that continuity and overlap of membership can be provided for administratively. The Bill provides the Government with additional legislative flexibility to assist it in ensuring continuity and loss of expertise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill has been brought on as a matter of urgency, as the Government wishes to re-appoint both Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie for additional periods as members of the National Crime Authority, and that will have to be done before 30 June. The initial appointments of both members was for a period of three years, and the additional appointments will be such as to ensure that the total period of appointment is no more than four years.

        TERRITORIES LAW REFORM BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, this Bill represents a substantial portion of the legislative action flowing from the Government's response to the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Islands in the Sun—The Legal Regimes of Australia's External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory
        </emphasis>
        .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For Australia's Indian Ocean Territories of Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, this Bill represents a giant step forward in the task the Government began in 1984 of bringing standards and living conditions in these Territories into line with those of comparable communities elsewhere in Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the inadequacy of the existing legal regimes in the Indian Ocean Territories derives from the fact that when the Territories became Australian Territories in the 1950s, their Imperial and Singapore-derived laws were largely left in force. To this base were added local Ordinances and a small number of Commonwealth Acts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is widely recognised that the resulting legal regimes are seriously deficient, unfair and inappropriate. These bodies of law have been severely criticised by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Federal Court, the Territories' Supreme Courts, Human Rights Australia, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The regimes as they stand also obstruct the Government's objectives of extending to Territories' residents the same rights and opportunities as other Australians enjoy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, in 1984 the Government invited the United Nations to supervise an Act of Self-Determination in Cocos. The Cocos Islanders were given three choices—independence, integration with an existing country, or free association with an existing country. They voted overwhelmingly for integration with Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The United Nations definition of integration requires that the people of Cocos receive the same treatment and have the same obligations, rights and benefits as mainland Australians. In the lead-up to the Act of Self-Determination, the Commonwealth promised that living standards would be brought to mainland standards not later than 1994. The Government is well on track to meet that timetable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth Grants Commission has been used as the arbiter over the changes required. In August 1990 the Government generally accepted the Commission's recommendations to bring government programs, works, services and taxes into line with those on mainland Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed changes were discussed in detail in extensive consultations with the Cocos Malay community leaders. They were incorporated in a Memorandum of Understanding, which was formally signed by the then Prime Minister and Cocos community leaders in March 1991. The M.O.U. provides for upgrading of Government works and services, restructuring of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Council and the Cocos Islands Co-operative, financial assistance to the Council, major law reform, extension of taxation and introduction of mainland employment conditions. These changes are being introduced over three years to be completed on 1 July 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the application of a contemporary body of mainland law is fundamental to the changes which are being put in place.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1984 the Government also began the process of bringing conditions on Christmas Island into line with those in mainland Australia. Since then, a form of local government has been extended to the Island and mainland wages and employment conditions have been aligned progressively with mainland standards. Mainland social security benefits and health care arrangements now extend to the Island.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As with Cocos, a Package of Changes has been developed in consultation with the local community to extend to residents of Christmas Island rights, opportunities and obligations equivalent to comparable mainland communities, including similar local and State-type government structures, assistance programs, taxes and charges.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Again, Mr President, the application of a living body of mainland law is fundamental to the changes to be put in place. Not only will it give Island residents the rights and protections under the law enjoyed by their mainland counterparts but it will provide the legal infrastructure necessary for development and economic growth in the Territory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The process of bringing standards and conditions in the Territories into line with those on the mainland has been developed and implemented in close consultation with the Islands communities. A great deal of effort has been devoted to informing the communities about the new legal arrangements and encouraging public debate with the aim of ensuring that the special circumstances of the Islands are accommodated by modifying laws where necessary. Western Australian government departments and agencies are helping with education programs. Information about the new legal regime is being disseminated through newsletters, radio and television broadcasts, visits by experts and public meetings. Independent legal advisers are also being attached to each of the communities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It should be understood that while this Bill will replace the essentially Singapore based regime with a Western Australian based body of law, this regime will still be subject to modification by Ordinance under the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. A number of Ordinances are to come into force in conjunction with commencement of this Bill. The most important will deal with interpretation of Western Australian laws in their application to the Territories, and modification of those laws to suit the particular circumstances of the Territories. A further Ordinance will be introduced for Cocos to abolish the Trust under which land is currently held by the Cocos Council, which will enable mainland-style land dealings to take place. The abolition of the Trust in favour of freehold title has the strong support of the Cocos Community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Additional Ordinances may be required in the future as the consultation process continues and modifications are required to overcome unforeseen problems or situations peculiar to the Territories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill applies Western Australian law, as in force from time to time, as Commonwealth law. That is to say, the laws will be in force by virtue of Acts made by this Parliament, rather than by force of the Western Australian Parliament. As such the political responsibility for the applied law will continue to rest with the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The communities in the Territories will be able to influence these Commonwealth processes through their Members of Parliament. They will also be able to make representations direct to the Commonwealth Minister responsible for the Territories. In addition, mechanisms are being developed to facilitate the Islands communities' awareness of the passage of legislation through the Western Australian Parliament and access to more detailed explanation of the effects of legislation on the Territories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Non-judicial powers and duties under the applied Western Australian laws will be vested in the Commonwealth Minister administering the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. The Minister will be able to direct that particular powers be vested in other persons or authorities, provided they fall within a range of classes specified in this Bill. The Minister will also be able to delegate powers to such persons or authorities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Judicial powers and duties will initially be vested in the existing courts of the Territories. (The Family Court of Western Australia will exercise jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 from 1 July 1992, as a result of extension of that Act to the Territories; it will be the only Western Australian court having jurisdiction in respect of the Territories at that date.) The Government's preferred position, for a series of reasons including consistency, is for all Western Australian courts to have jurisdiction. It is anticipated that the courts of Western Australia will have the jurisdiction of the Territories conferred on them in the near future—that is, when formal agreement with Western Australia has been reached. This Bill sets out provisions, to commence on a date to be proclaimed, to allow the jurisdiction to be transferred to Western Australian courts. This conferral of jurisdiction will allow the abolition of the courts of the Territories other than the Supreme Courts. The Supreme Courts will continue to exist, though with truncated jurisdiction, until there is no longer any serving judge.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, there are some 700 Acts of Western Australia. It is expected that some 350 Western Australian laws can be applied in full from 1 July 1992 without adverse impact. Approximately another 140 laws will have noticeable impacts but the on-Islands changes required can be readily accommodated from 1 July 1992. These two categories include the bulk of criminal law which was the source of much concern in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Islands in the Sun
        </emphasis>
        report.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A small number of Western Australian Acts will be repealed in their application to the Territories, where they are completely inappropriate or contrary to Commonwealth policy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A further body of Western Australian Acts will have their operation suspended by Ordinance. The Bill specifically provides for suspension of applied laws by Ordinance, to enable further assessment and consultation, with either or both the Island communities and the Western Australian authorities, on any modification required. This course of action accords with the thrust of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Islands in the Sun
        </emphasis>
        report that consultation should occur to ensure the particular circumstances of the Indian Ocean Territories and their residents are not adversely affected by the extension of the laws.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is expected that some 120 laws may fall into this category. The intention is that they be suspended in their application until 1 January 1993 to allow individuals and organisations time to consider them in more detail and to prepare themselves for the impact of these laws. However, it will be possible to further suspend these Acts at 1 January 1993, or to repeal or modify them in their application in the Territories.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The remaining Acts will be modified in their application to the Territories by Territories Ordinances. Some are changed permanently in their effect so as to better suit the Territories. Amendment of others is temporary to allow the residents and businesses of the Territories a reasonable opportunity to make adjustments necessary to comply with new requirements under some laws.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The choice of Western Australian law, rather than some other body of State type law, was made as it is clearly the most appropriate to be applied to the Territories. The proximity of Western Australia to the Territories and the existing linkages were key considerations. Shipping and air services originate in Perth. Western Australia is the main source of the Islands food, medical and other supplies. But most importantly Western Australia is now the home of many former Cocos and Christmas Islanders. More people of Cocos and Christmas Island origin have chosen to live in Western Australia than remain on the Islands.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Federal law is also being generally extended to the Indian Ocean Territories by this Bill by reversing the current rule that a Federal Act only extends if it is expressed to extend. From 1 July this year a Federal Act will extend unless it is expressed to not extend.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill will also amend the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 so that `Australia' and `the Commonwealth', when used in the geographic sense, will include the Christmas and Cocos Islands, unless the contrary intention is specified. As part of making this change, this Bill amends a number of Federal Acts, to ensure they extend, or prevent their extension at this time. After 1 July only a small number of Federal Acts will not extend to the Islands.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Apart from the matters relating to the Indian Ocean Territories, another significant recommendation of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Islands in the Sun
        </emphasis>
        report was that Australian citizens resident on Norfolk Island be given the right of optional enrolment for the purposes of representation in the Federal Parliament.

        I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that agreement has been reached with the Norfolk Island Government on implementation of this recommendation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unfortunately, however, it has not been possible within the time available to include the necessary amendments to give effect to the agreement in this Bill. However, I understand that the appropriate legislative amendments are being prepared by the Minister for the Arts and Territories for introduction into the Parliament in the near future.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill will, in Part 4, regularise payments of additional salary received by certain executive members of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly during 1989. The full Federal Court has held that as a result of a technical deficiency in the relevant Remuneration Tribunal Determination, the executive members concerned were paid additional salary over a period of approximately six months which was not authorised. There is no suggestion of personal dishonesty or impropriety by the members involved. They merely accepted the additional remuneration in accordance with what they understood to be their legal entitlement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consistent with the policy of the gradual transfer of further powers to the Norfolk Island Government, schedule 5 to the Bill seeks to remove the requirement that the remuneration and allowances of members of the Legislative Assembly be determined by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal.
       </para>

        The direct cost of changing the legal regimes of Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is negligible. However, indirect costs, especially over the first five years are substantial.

        The costings have two components—recurrent costs and capital works.

        AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1992

        Mr President, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill in the Senate.
       </para>

        PURPOSE OF THE BILL
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill is for an Act to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. These amendments have become necessary due to recent developments overseas and in Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        BACKGROUND
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable senators are no doubt familiar with the recent publicity concerning an Australian cyclist who tested positive for anabolic steroids and subsequently was able to avoid sanctions on a legal technicality. This has made the Government determined to ensure that athletes who cheat on their fellow competitors, their sport and themselves are not able to escape the sanctions they justly deserve. The amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act proposed in this Bill will do just that.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also makes provision for a co-ordinated and national approach to the elimination of drug abuse in sport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Honourable senators may not know that over the past eighteen months there have been extensive discussions on the subject of complementary State and Territory anti-doping legislation. At the meeting of all State and Territory sports Ministers last year, Mrs Kelly was able to achieve unanimous agreement that such complementary legislation is desirable, and each State and Territory sports Minister gave a commitment to introduce such legislation. This Bill enables the Commonwealth to honour its undertaking to provide for that complementary legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, Australia is at the leading edge of international developments in the fight against drugs in sport. Before this year, it had executed international antidoping arrangements with Canada and the United Kingdom. This year New Zealand and Norway have joined Australia. A strategy to expand the list of participating countries is being developed. One of the Australian Sports Drug Agency's functions is to ensure Australia's compliance with these arrangements. This Bill will ensure that the agency has the necessary authority to perform this function.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        MAJOR FEATURES OF THE BILL
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I would like to spend a little time advising honourable senators of the details of the proposed amendments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As I have indicated this Bill makes provision for the Australian States and Territories to confer broader powers on the Australian Sports Drug Agency through complementary antidoping legislation currently proposed by all States and Territories. It will also allow the Agency to work more closely with the States and Territories to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach towards the elimination of prohibited drugs and doping methods in sport.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Sports Drug Agency will now test, both in Australia and overseas, a wider range of athletes for the presence of prohibited drugs. This will include foreign athletes when the test is sought by an overseas anti-doping authority, or when the test is conducted under a contractual arrangement which the Australian Sports Drug Agency may now enter into.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Agency must be able to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf so it can act on the result of those tests. These amendments will enable the procedures followed by such an authority to be recognised for the purposes of the Act, even if these procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. The minimum standard to be adopted and recognised in such cases will now be that provided for in the International Olympic Charter against doping in sport. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with the current regulations; it is merely an amendment which acknowledges that the Australian procedures are stricter and more precise than the internationally accepted standard of the Olympic Charter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the Bill also provides athletes with the opportunity to make a submission to the Agency challenging the validity of a positive test result, if the athlete considers that procedures in the following specified areas were not complied with:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

         evidence of tampering with the sample.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the Agency decides the test was valid, the competitor will be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to have the decision reviewed. If the AAT reverses the Agency's decision, the competitor's name must be removed from the register.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Even if the athlete does not make a submission, the Agency will be required to verify that all procedures relating to these specific matters were followed before validating a positive test result. It will no longer be required to check procedures where noncompliance would not cast doubt on the test result.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Other amendments provide for written notification to approved sporting and anti-doping organisations of a positive test result or a refusal to provide a sample. Where this is not possible, alternative arrangements have been provided so that athletes cannot hinder the process by purposely avoiding the notice.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many international sporting federations require advice of a possible positive test result to satisfy their own doping policy. This Bill will enable the Agency to satisfy such requests in certain specified circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The name of the register will be changed to `Register of Notifiable Events'. This will reduce the misconception that the entry of a person's name on the register implies some finding of `guilt'. The notion of guilt was never intended to be associated with the entry of names on the register. The question of guilt and application of sanctions is and has always been a matter for sporting organisations, not the agency.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, this Bill recognises the need to give minors special consideration, by providing for the removal of a name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by sporting organisations has elapsed, if at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under 18 years of age.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Sports Drug Agency is increasingly being recognised overseas and domestically as having the professional expertise to arrange for the collection and testing of samples to detect the presence of prohibited drugs, and therefore will be called on more and more to arrange such tests overseas and in Australia, at the request of both overseas and Australian authorities and sporting organisations. This Bill includes amendments which will give it the power to enter into contracts or arrangements with overseas governments and other sporting authorities and antidoping authorities to arrange for the collection and testing of samples.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the current international anti-doping arrangements with Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Norway each country has agreed that in another country, their athletes will be subject to the domestic testing regime of the host country. As a result, there will be occasions when, even though the agency has made no request for a test, it will receive information on the results of tests on Australian athletes conducted by overseas anti-doping authorities. It may also receive similar information from other foreign anti-doping bodies. The Bill includes amendments which enable the Agency to pass this information to the same persons or organisations that it would pass similar information to if it had conducted the test. These include the athlete, the sporting organisations of which the athlete is a member and, if Commonwealth funding through the Australian Sports Commission is involved, the Commission. However, it may only pass this information on if it is satisfied that, at the time the sample was requested, the anti-doping body was following procedures which were in accord with the Olympic Charter.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are many anti-doping bodies throughout the world. For example, as international sporting federations arrange for the collection and testing of samples for the purpose of detecting prohibited substances, each could be regarded as an anti-doping body. As more and more countries adopt similar anti-doping regimes to Australia, the number of anti-doping bodies will increase dramatically. Some may not be as meticulous and thorough as the Australian Sports Drug Agency. To ensure the interests of Australian athletes are protected, the Agency will have to screen these anti-doping bodies to ensure that their procedures accord with the international accepted standard, that is, the Olympic Charter. The amendments allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency to approve foreign anti-doping bodies which adopt at least standards provided for in the Olympic Charter and will be required to maintain a list of such bodies. The Agency will also be given the power to request such an approved body to take a sample from a competitor who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident when that competitor is overseas.

        There will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this Bill. Any additional costs arising from the Agency entering into contracts or arrangements with overseas sporting organisations or anti-doping bodies will be fully recovered, while the cost of additional tests, resulting from complementary legislation passed by States and Territories, will be borne by the States and Territories.

       The receipt of the resolution of 14 May from the Western Australian Legislative Assembly squarely points to the dismal record of this Labor Government, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular, in a desperate campaign of bluster and prevarication seeking to deny vital information to the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government in Western Australia. The significance of these actions is not diminished by the enforced retreat of Mr Keating on 15 May, by the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that amendments to the Taxation Administration Act have `accommodated the WA Royal Commission's particular reporting requirements' or the fact that the principal solicitor of the Royal Commission has stated that the commissioners believed that the proposed amendments would satisfy their requirements. One only has to look at exactly what they have had to go through to get these particular amendments.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        What this resolution from the Legislative Assembly calls for, no more and no less, is a repeat of the action taken in December 1987 when the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill amended both the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Taxation Administration Act to enable, as it was stated by the then Attorney-General, the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct to have access to taxation information on the same basis as applies to taxation information disclosed to the Commonwealth royal commissions.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The amendment then also gave the Commissioner authority to disclose the information to State as well as Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The purpose of these amendments was very simple and very direct. Mr Bowen stated on 8 December 1987 that there was `genuine public interest' in the provision of Commonwealth assistance to the Fitzgerald Commission. But we can only ask why, until now, this public interest has not been applied in regard to Western Australia in the mind of the same government. Could the overriding consideration be that, on this occasion, mates are involved?
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The fact remains that until 14 May, the Western Australian Labor Government and the Keating Labor Government were stating falsely that the Royal Commission could have obtained access to tax records under provision for such information to be disclosed to senior law enforcement officers under section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act 1989. It is a fact that this Labor Government sought to enforce one rule for a royal commission that was investigating the misdeeds of its political opponents and another for an inquiry seeking to uncover the incompetence and corruption that occurred under Labor governments in Western Australia.

        It is a fact that the resolution of the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia does more than simply ask the Federal Parliament to facilitate necessary access to Australian Taxation Office records by the Royal Commission. Quite properly the Assembly insists that the Royal Commission be given the same right as was the Fitzgerald Royal Commission through the 1987 Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill. That eventually has been the Labor Government's position in Western Australia, asking the Labor Federal Government to actually do something. But it has taken its time. It has taken the State Labor Government all its time to ask for this and it has taken the Federal Labor Government all its time to deliver. But this is the principle that is at stake—the right of the people and the Parliament of Western Australia to be sure that there is no diminution whatsoever of the rights of access given to another inquiry in a State in 1987. This is a clear signal that the legislation promised by this Government must not in any way be more limited than that carried in 1987 when of course Mr Keating was Treasurer.

        The legislation was supported by the Opposition and during debate it was noted that the same cooperation should be extended to future similar inquiries involving State Government actions. We in the Liberal and National parties supported the Government's action in providing the information to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in Queensland, and yet here we have a situation where this Government simply closed the door, put on the blinkers and tried to blame the Public Service for the lack of access to the information for Western Australia.

      <para>
       Good tax administration indeed! He insultingly stated that a request could be made when related to a specific offence when in fact the information had been sought because of the difficulty encountered by the Commission in determining illegal conduct in relation to the Rothwells saga and money trails were disappearing overseas. We are not talking about $50 or $100 in these money trails going overseas; we are talking about $500m that has disappeared from Rothwells, and this Labor Government prevaricated on whether or not it would give access to Australian Taxation Office records.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        It is also a fact that has been glossed over by Mr Keating that such requests should refer to the availability of tax records after a commission has completed its inquiry and subsequent criminal investigations are being made. Is that not handy? He says that we can have it after the event but not before. The fact is that in section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act 1989 allows only an officer of a law enforcement agency to divulge or communicate taxation information for the purpose of investigation of a serious offence. The Prime Minister and his Government well understand that a royal commission's inquiries go to a far wider sense than this and that that is the royal commission's right and proper role.

        How convenient also for a Government determined to protect its mates to hide behind the advice of public servants who, quite predictably and quite correctly, wish to preserve secrecy. Who was Mr Keating trying to bluff, con or cajole when he stated that people were more likely to disclose information voluntarily when they were satisfied that the use of the information would be limited? That is hardly an attitude that anyone would expect from people desperately seeking to avoid investigation.

        And let us not forget the selective amnesia that Messrs Brian and Terry Burke have had, along with Mr Peter Dowding and Mr David Parker; all either former Premiers or senior Ministers. Who would be silly enough to believe that they would suddenly tell all? They have no recollection of most of the events that have happened about which they have been questioned in the Royal Commission, yet the Prime Minister tries to say that they would be quite happy to voluntarily disclose the information that is required. Clearly, it was the duty of a responsible Federal government to make the decision to ensure that highly comparable inquiries receive the same degree of cooperation from the Australian Taxation Office.

        Who can be fooled by the subsequent letter of the Hon. Ralph Willis as Acting Treasurer, responding to a further request from the Commission of 29 August last year—which I might add was never answered by Treasurer Kerin—that the granting of access to the Fitzgerald Commission should not be seen as a precedent for all State royal commissions? Nothing better illustrates the determination of the Government as a whole in blocking necessary access to information to protect its mates. That is the clarity of the whole matter that we are dealing with. Indeed, it is just as true to state that a new precedent was created by the refusal of this Labor Government to follow the example taken with the Fitzgerald Commission and other Commonwealth royal commissions where access to income tax records has been granted.

        The resolution tabled today from the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seeks the same rights for the Western Australian Royal Commission. It is not asking for anything more; it is simply asking for the same treatment. That can never be considered unreasonable. In turn, the Royal Commission, under section 16(4A) has the right to communicate the information to a special prosecutor. It must be emphasised that this request from the Royal Commission has not arisen through some peripheral question. Investigation into the collapse of Rothwells was one of the most significant tasks of the inquiry, as it is well understood that it is a central matter of WA Inc that directly involved two former Premiers and leading Ministers.

        The stalling by Mr Keating and successive Labor Treasurers last year is every bit as serious as the outburst of the Prime Minister on 14 May, as the time available for the Commission to complete its investigations is now severely limited. I suppose if one can hold off for long enough and hope that no-one twigs to it, then one gets away with it. But, unfortunately, on this occasion the Government has not got away with it.

        It was an insult not only to the Royal Commission but also to the Western Australian Parliament and to the people of Western Australia when Mr Keating poured scorn on the Commission for engaging in a fishing expedition. In some respects, a lot of people in the Labor Government, when it so suits them, would say that that is the real role of a royal commission. It suited them with the Fitzgerald Royal Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct to have a fishing expedition but, of course, on this occasion when it comes to the Western Australian investigation into WA Inc. it does not suit them.

        The Prime Minister made a personal attack on leading counsel assisting the Commission in describing his submission as `offensive and self-serving'. He advanced the spurious excuse that 1989 legislative changes would have allowed police attached to the Commission to seek information from the Tax Commissioner. What rot! He does not understand—and of course the Premier obviously does not understand—that today that is what it is all about.

Here we have a government talking about provoking political controversy. If that is not what this Government is doing about this issue, then I ask what is it doing.

        Again, there was not much respect shown to the Western Australian Parliament when Mr Keating stated that the request of the Premier, Dr Lawrence, for the information was `not worth taking seriously'. The Prime Minister just dismissed out of hand the requests by Dr Lawrence, the Labor Premier of Western Australia. Of course, he also absolutely ignored the Labor member Ron Edwards who himself has admitted that he knew more than he told at the time. He has admitted that to the Royal Commission. Why did he not come clean up-front about what he knew about a lot of the funds?

        While Mr Keating may have bowed to the public pressure the next day, I certainly do not recall any statement of apology for the aspersions cast on the competence and integrity of the Royal Commission. He just cast those aspersions against that Royal Commission, which has been doing a fine job under extremely difficult circumstances—little did we know how difficult until a couple of weeks ago—and he has not had the decency to even apologise. I am certain that that is not just a further case of bad manners but a deliberate hope that some doubt would remain in the public mind as to the authority of the Commission.

        The State Labor Government cannot escape its share of blame when on 13 May the Premier had defended Mr Keating in State Parliament by repeating the Keating line that the Royal Commission could obtain direct access to files through the police. Why did she not check that that was possible before standing up in the Western Australian Parliament and just repeating Mr Keating's lines for the sake of it? If she had bothered to check, she would have found out that those police officers would have faced imprisonment had they done what she and Mr Keating suggested. But that was not significant enough for her either. She suddenly obviously realised the error of her ways the next day but did not bother apologising, did not bother explaining; she just decided that maybe she had better join the public request of making sure that the Federal Labor Government made this information available.

        We are entitled to ask whether Dr Lawrence and Mr Keating knew of the difficulties encountered by the Commission over the previous 12 months and what actions they took in seeking access to tax records. What a difference a day makes, though. Recognising that a government that cannot rely on Assembly numbers must bow to the inevitable, the resolution before the Senate today went forward one day later, on 14 May. It was purely and simply based on the number of Independents now in the Western Australian Parliament. They could not rely on them sticking by them, and they certainly could not rely on the people of Western Australia sticking by them.

        The Premier also stated on 14 May the obvious fact that the interests of the Royal Commission transcend those of the privacy of the tax records. She, of course, has said nothing about the part that the public outrage played in the reversal of her opinion. Quite clearly, that was a pressure that was put on her that she could not ignore. We may question, of course, the commitment of Mr Keating to the cause of privacy when a senior Minister in his Government, the current Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, once belittled privacy as a bourgeois right when he was seeking to impose the horrendous Australia Card.

        The resolution of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly is crystal clear. The Royal Commission may now feel satisfied with the access that it expects to obtain, but it is essential that the Federal legislation gives it no less access than was granted to the Fitzgerald Commission in 1987. I believe that failure to so act will be further confirmation of the bias and cynicism shown by this Labor Government.

         —On a few occasions in the past I have taken the opportunity of the adjournment debate to present to the Senate an account of the use or misuse of chemicals in Australia. Tonight I add to that portfolio with the documentation of an incident of spraying insecticides which has had a devastating effect on a school in Hobart.

         The D'Alton Special School in New Town has 64 students from kindergarten to grade 7, all with a variety of physical disabilities. On Sunday, 4 August 1991, the inside of the school was routinely sprayed for Argentine ants. Two commercial brands of spray were used, Cislin 10, containing deltamethrin, formaldehyde and propylene glycol, and Insectagas D, containing dichlorvus and liquid carbon dioxide. The school had previously been sprayed on two occasions earlier in the school year.

         On the following Monday school began as normal, and at 10.30 a.m. a phone call from the Douglas Parker Rehabilitation Centre, to which the school is annexed, asked that the children not be allowed contact with the floor. At about 11 a.m., after children had been picked up from the floor—remember that most of these children suffer from a variety of physical disabilities—the first toxic reactions began, with some people's throats closing up, severe headaches being suffered and eyes also being affected. Over the next few days these symptoms became progressively worse, until almost all of the staff were affected, some to the point of requiring time off from school duties.

         On 9 August, Neocid 200, containing diazanon in a coarse spray, was sprayed around the outside of the school building, including alongside the walls, with the school windows open. From that point in time the severity and frequency of the reactions began to increase and a few people became quite frighteningly ill. So many people at the school were affected severely that officialdom finally decided to conduct an investigation.

         The Director of Public Health announced to the victims and the media, which had become interested at this stage, that everybody at the school was suffering from some form of the winter virus that was prevalent at the time and that the coincidence of the insecticide spraying had simply produced an emotive reaction. When the problem continued, the school was eventually evacuated, not because of a problem with the environment but to allay peoples' concerns.

         However, what made this virus particularly interesting were the unusual variety of features displayed in the one strain as those features were collated by the Director when interviewing personnel. These features included the symptoms of headache, irritability, disorientation, oedema, incontinence, severe depression, teary, sore eyes and blurred vision, dermatitis, muscular weakness, inflamed larynx, lost voices and premature menstrual haemorrhaging in five of the women staff. Also fascinating was the fact that this so-called virus confined itself to the D'Alton site and D'Alton people. It did not transmit itself to families or associates. The little beast would go away in milder cases shortly after the people left the building, only to ambush them again when they returned to the site, with a renewal of the same symptoms.

         In the course of the Department's investigation, staff were told that there were no tests available in Tasmania to assess the possibility of exposure to insecticides. It was small consolation to the victims when Health Department representatives apologised profusely for this misinformation long after tests would have been of value. Even more disgusting was the fact that in the initial investigation nobody bothered to interview the pupils at this school and the volunteers who were working there.

         After the event, victims were told that advice from the National Health and Medical Research Council was that testing was inappropriate in the absence of individual baseline levels. In fact, they commented that such testing is not only inappropriate but unethical. At this point I would like to say that I am particularly concerned about these comments from the NHMRC. In the absence of any collections of real data about the on-ground real life effects of chemicals, I would have thought that such tests might have proved useful in the long term. If they were requested by the people involved, how on earth could they have been unethical?

         The health authorities now gave the school a clean bill of health. The staff went back and there was a fresh outbreak of the symptoms already described. During the school holidays the school was thoroughly cleaned and the air-conditioning vents wiped, although no air analysis or testing of the system was carried out. The person who did the cleaning got sick. Again staff and students returned to the school and again the symptoms reappeared.

         An inquiry was called for. Visiting VIPs, and even those doing the testing, were affected but still had no clue what to test for. The odds-on favourite was still a virus, but new theories began to emerge like flies on a summer's day. First there was pollen from the wattles—remember that we have reached springtime now—and then mould along the skirting boards was introduced as a theory. Perhaps it was even the urine-soaked carpet tiles combining with chlorine fumes from the swimming pool some distance away at the Douglas Parker Centre. All these theories have been disproved and discounted. The air-conditioning was eventually extensively tested on 19 September 1991, after everything had been cleaned. The subsequent report suggested sick building syndrome as a possible cause of the illnesses suffered by staff and students.

        the school are now bussed to other schools. The problem with the building remains unsolved but active. The toys that have been removed from the building since its closure have caused skin irritations and blisters when handled, and photographs collected by a staff member have caused headaches, rashes and sore eyes. Staff members who were severely affected right back at the beginning of this saga have had recurrent health problems.

         Whilst acknowledging that something is definitely wrong at the D'Alton school, authorities are still refusing to consider the possibility of insecticide poisoning. When public health is affected so severely and so suddenly, surely there is a responsibility to investigate all possible causes of the symptoms without any fear or hesitation. What I have described to the Senate tonight is just another example of the strange attitude we have in this country of `don't want to know' or `too hard to handle'—an attitude that seems to be particularly prevalent when it comes to the use of chemicals.

        It is not possible to respond to the questions asked in the detail sought within the time available for the task. The relevant departmental computer databases have been structured to provide information in the formats required for the department's statistical purposes and for the purposes of other agencies, notably the Public Service Commission which prepares the annual Human Resources Development Survey. To provide the very specific information in the format required by the honourable senator's question would require the development of new computer programs. That exercise would be both expensive and labour intensive and in my view could not be justified.

These are the two-year Graduate Diploma in Foreign Affairs and Trade and the three-year Associate Diploma in Policy Studies (Foreign Affairs and Trade). Both courses are designed to provide Departmental officers with an up-to-date background in Economics, Public Policy, International Relations, International Law and Administrative Law, in order that they may carry

       out their Departmental duties effectively. The Graduate Diploma is a two year part-time course which commenced in 1990. It has a maximum of 50 students in each annual intake. Approximately half the students are Graduate Administrative Assistants, for whom the course is compulsory. The rest of the students are experienced departmental officers, selected on a competitive basis from applicants ranging in rank from ASO 3 to SOG B. The Associate Diploma is a three year part-time course which commenced in 1991. It has a maximum of 30 students per annual intake. These are selected, on a competitive basis, from applicants from all areas of the department, and range in rank from ASO 2 to SOG B. Most have no previous academic qualifications.

        The assessment of  proposed, current and completed training is undertaken as a continuing on-going process. Work performance indicators and objectives are negotiated and agreed upon between each staff member and his/her supervisor. The training needed for immediate and anticipated duties is identified and agreed upon. The supervisor's specific approval is required before any training is undertaken and work performance and revised training needs are jointly reviewed at six monthly intervals. Staff of the Personnel Development Section regularly conduct follow-up evaluation interviews with a randomly selected sample of participants between two and four weeks after the completion of each course. In addition, written evaluation reports are sought from the participants of the majority of formal training courses. In the case of language training, once training has commenced fortnightly report forms are submitted by tutors and proficiency target levels are set to ensure programs are achieved. Regular language proficiency exams are required of officers and the results are maintained on a central data base and monitored for departmental use.

        The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission currently contributes to the annual Human Resources Development Report on the Australian Public Service, and statistics on training are recorded in line with the requirements of that Report. The requested information is significantly different to that required for the Report and, in some cases, not included in the Report.

        In addition, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is a devolved agency, with a significant degree of responsibility for training now with State Offices. Given the unique areas covered by the question, the detailed information sought would require very significant allocations of both time and limited resources by the Commission to research the information. As those devolved offices are already under considerable pressure due to limited resources, such a request is deemed unreasonable.

        In terms of Course Assessment &amp; Evaluation, all courses conducted by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission are assessed in relation to course objectives and performance indicators. Each course in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's Human Resources Development Plan has stated objectives and performance indicators, used as part of the evaluation. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is currently in the process of developing a standard Evaluation Strategy. However, this will not be finalised until a decision is made concerning the amount of training which may be devolved to National Program Managers. Any such standard Evaluation Strategy would draw heavily upon the draft Public Service Commission Human Resource Development Evaluation Resource Kit.

        (1) It is assumed that the term "flight records" means an aircraft's time in service and the keeping of the aircraft maintenance log books.  The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) follows accepted international practice whereby the registered owner, that is, the holder of the certificate of registration of an aircraft, is responsible for the airworthiness of the aircraft.

        The justification for this is that, for the purposes of sending out airworthiness documentation, including Airworthiness Directives, it is essential for the CAA to have one contact point, namely the registered owner. Furthermore, the maintenance of records of flying time against the aircraft itself and its major components, is an important aspect of maintaining its safety.

        (1) No. The distinction between private and commercial operations is set out in the Civil Aviation Regulations (CARs) and CAR 2(7A) (attached) adequately defines the parameters for private cost sharing flights.  The intent of the legislation is clearly set out and allows persons undertaking a private flight, including the operating crew, to share equally in the costs of the flight.  By the very nature of the operation, the people who engage in private cost sharing flights should be either friends or acquaintances of the pilot.
