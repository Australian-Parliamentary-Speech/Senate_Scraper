I ask: given the fact that there are nearly one million Australians unemployed, that our foreign debt stands at $180 billion and that Australia today recorded its worst balance of payments figures for almost three years, how does he justify the failure of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations to condemn the mass industrial action which will only further harm Australia's economic prospects?

         —Certainly one would need something like that in Victoria. In so far as the national stoppage is concerned, I notice that Mr Bob Carr, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, has described it as something which is not in the national interest. I agree with that and I believe that Senator Cook and the Prime Minister also agree with that. The fact remains that this so-called national day of action has taken place largely due to events in Victoria; where a government was elected on the basis that it would do certain things, including ensure that the standard of living and wages of the average Victorian worker would not be lowered as a result. It is not in the national interest that a government breaks that promise within two or three weeks of being elected to office.

         I regret the national day of action having taken place but, of course, one has to look at the causes of it. It is all very well for those opposite to huff and puff about it from the Opposition benches. The fact is that industrial disputes in this country are about half what they were under the coalition's former Government. Before the coalition went out of office we had a national day of action about every fortnight because the former Government had no wages policy and was quite incapable of managing industrial relations in this country—just as those opposite would be if ever elected again.

This morning I attended with the Prime Minister at Mascot Airport when he, metaphorically, turned the first sod in the development of the third runway at Sydney Airport. It was an important ceremony which marked the beginning of the construction of greater capacity at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. This is very important because  Sydney Airport is the main aviation hub for Australia, the main point of entry from overseas, and the main point of intersection for a lot of air travel in this country.

         Sydney Airport has a forecast of demand which runs at very high figures into the next century. This development enables the facility of the airport to be upgraded to meet that demand. That demand will take account of the tourist boom which we are experiencing and which will grow further. It will provide openings for business and will create employment in Sydney and New South Wales. It will particularly help country commuter traffic in New South Wales.

         The Government decided to go ahead with this project in March 1989. We confirmed that in November 1991, following the receipt of the environmental impact statement which, as I have said before in this chamber, was one of the most comprehensive environmental impact statements ever undertaken in Australia. This project will create 200 jobs on average per year in direct employment and a further 200 jobs in the wider Sydney community will depend on those jobs at the coalface of airport construction. When the third runway is completed some 13,000 other jobs will be created in the operation of the expanded airport facility.

         What Mr Kennett has done is set that almost century-long tradition on its head. He has denied people access to fundamental award protection. It is, to me, absolutely unbelievable that one should think that, when people are denied access to their basic entitlement and overnight have their basic entitlement unilaterally reduced, they would not take action to protect themselves. But, if they do, they are branded somehow or other as traitorous. I do not support the stoppage but I certainly understand why it is that people, many of whom have never taken industrial action in their lives, are forced to.

         On the first question, the ACTU, as I understand it, has called for a national day of action which will take the form, in most places, of meetings of protest, and nothing more than that, and work will not be disrupted significantly. But this will be an expression of protest. I know those opposite want to make it out to be a strike so that they can say that the strike has failed. It essentially will be a protest, but in some areas there will be strike action. That is the definitional difference; I thank Senator Parer for his question.

         I do not agree with Bob Carr if what Bob Carr was saying is that industrial relations in Australia have been a contributing factor to the level of unemployment. They have not. The best indicator of that is to look at the inflation rate. There is no wages pressure in the economy to push up inflation and the inflation rate is below the average of the OECD and the lowest rate in Australia for over 25 years. That is the surest indication that our wages policy works, not like the wages policy of those opposite.

The Opposition's policy of changing the Reserve Bank charter to make inflation the only target would increase interest rates and reduce profits and investment. The structurally sound profit share that this Government's policies created is the reason why employment grew strongly out of the last recession and the reason why it will improve as we come out of this recession.

This was not some cynical exercise to take people off the CES list—that could be properly criticised. It was an exercise to take up the willingness of local government throughout Australia to participate in an attempt to generate national recovery by ensuring that activity was undertaken in local government districts with high unemployment in a way which generated the economy and the flow of money around the community, with job consequences and, in some cases, the direct employment of those who were unemployed.

         As to the 13,000 jobs which were to be involved at an average of six months each during the course of this program, the idea was that in many instances those who had part time employment with council gangs or who were working with subcontractors who would be taken on by councils using this scheme would have their employment secured or would be among the extra people taken on by the subcontractors in order to undertake the work. In these ways the 13,000 jobs which will be sustained, secured and in some cases created by this expenditure of money will certainly improve economic activity in the districts concerned.

         I know from going around many areas in Tasmania—the north-west, the south; right across the State—the local councils are very appreciative of the opportunity to receive this assistance, which enables work to be undertaken which could not be supported by ratepayers alone or through other sources of funding available to those local government areas. In so far as they have secured employment and undertaken economic activity in those municipalities, I believe that the program has been worth while and continues to have benefit for the local government areas concerned.

It was for that reason that in March 1990 we adopted the International Labour Organisation convention on work and family responsibilities. It is for that reason that we have set up in my Department, the Department of Industrial Relations, a work and family unit.

As I announced last week, and it was greeted with the kind of media reaction that usually greets good, constructive, helpful initiatives of this kind, Australia will provide a $6.6m package of assistance for displaced people in Mozambique and for Mozambican refugees in Malawi. Although the recent peace accord in Mozambique has brought hope for the five million Mozambicans severely affected by 10 years of civil war, the combined effects of war and drought have created a situation where, unhappily, mass starvation is a real possibility. Our assistance will primarily be made up of Australian food. It will be delivered by non-government organisations from Australia and by the United Nations.

         This most recent package of assistance helps to demonstrate the Government's concern for the tragic situation confronting a number of people in Africa. It comes on top of drought assistance worth $4.8m which we provided to Mozambique earlier this year. It comes on top of the $8 1/2m that we have contributed since the beginning of the year to help the millions of people in desperate need in Somalia, which is also being supplemented by our contribution to the UN military operation there. It comes on top of Australian relief worth more than $15m for the Horn of Africa—that is, Sudan and other countries—announced on 10 November and the Government's continuing program of long term development assistance to Africa, which currently stands at $110m over three years.

         I believe that this response to the crisis in many African countries does reflect the overwhelming concern of the Australian community for the plight of many people in that continent. I think it has to be acknowledged, finally, that making a contribution in this way is an expensive business; it is a major impost on the aid budget. In that respect, in fairness, it has to be acknowledged that the Opposition's plans to slash $209m from the aid program would savagely cut our capacity to respond in this way, particularly, as it has already indicated, with bilateral aid programs to Africa, with a resulting detrimental effect both on assistance to Africa in its present plight and to that continent's sustainable long term development.

I refer him to the release today of the October balance of payments figures, which show the highest current account deficit—$1.8 billion—for almost three years, despite the economy's continuing in the worst recession for 60 years and the highest unemployment rate ever recorded in the postwar period. Given this further clear evidence of the massive failure of the Government's economic policies and the acknowledged collapse of the Government's phoney One Nation package and of the basic Budget figures, when will the Government revise upwards its official balance of payments deficit forecast for 1992-93?

         Senator Spindler asked me whether Australian politicians might be intimidated by this sort of language and any response it does get. Back in November at the Premiers Conference, I think it was in Perth, the leaders of all Australian jurisdictions took a united stand in relation to firearm control measures. This will not strike any fear into the hearts of Australian politicians because, quite irrespective of political allegiance or whichever States and Territories the Premiers and Chief Ministers come from, they were united in saying that in Australia we should have a philosophy which certainly puts the community and its safety as a priority of paramount concern and that we have a perfect right to regulate the use and possession of firearms in the community, in particular the sale of those military style semi-automatics which featured in some of the massacres which Senator Spindler no doubt had in mind.

         I believe that where there is domestic violence there is a very real responsibility on police forces to withdraw any weapons from that household. That, of course, is based on an incident or a report of an allegation concerning such violence. I do not think that we would want to get to a situation where every household would be under some sort of threat of being visited by the police to see whether weapons were being stored. Therefore, at the moment I am not persuaded that the political effort would be worth while to try to encourage the States to, for example, have a central repository in various suburbs and towns for these weapons.

         Each port in Australia where waterside labour is now engaged directly by companies has completed an EBA—an enterprise based agreement—in which management and those employees, protected by the safety net of the award, have worked out the most efficient way of delivering waterfront services in those ports. Hence, it is because of those changes, or in part affected by those changes, that we now have internationally competitive loading rates at Australian ports.

So, in answer to Senator Bjelke-Petersen's question, yes, it is possible to adopt the bonus system. But it is up to the people concerned in each port to decide the way of working that best suits them.

         There are many elements of the Kennett legislation that are absolutely regressive. One of the elements is that it involves retrospective legislation. I know that the Opposition in this place has a proud record—certainly, it would cite it—of opposing retrospective legislation. It has described it as morally and ethically wrong. My question is: would all those in the Opposition who support retrospective legislation in this case please put up their hands? Let the record show that no-one put up a hand to support the Kennett industrial relations legislation in Victoria. So, even among members of the same party in this chamber, there is not unanimous support for the Victorian industrial relations legislation.

They want us to open the doors of the existing Federal legislation wider in order to make that shift. They want to treat their work forces properly and they want to have the recognition and protection of the award. There may be some employers in Victoria who do not feel that way.

It means that one works from 8 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock at night, six days a week. It means that if there is no work one is put aside and stood down and gets no income.

Expenditure has been undertaken which will enable some 13,000 people to benefit from the injection of funding into local government, so that the work gangs or subcontractors can be secure in their employment or may take on persons into those subcontracting organisations which provide services and undertake tasks on behalf of local government.

What is more, the people of Byron Bay will have some good urban infrastructure as a result of the implementation of this program. Overall, I think it is an excellent program which will bring benefits to local government districts and help sustain employment within local government gangs and for subcontractors.

        Today's balance of payments figures for October showing a further deficit of $1.8 billion in Australia's current account deficit in one month are nothing short of disastrous.

         The result has occurred following an 11 per cent fall in exports and a minor fall of 4 per cent in imports, which is largely explained by changes in civil aircraft imports. This deficit comes at a time when Australia is still in the deepest recession it has had in its postwar history—I notice that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) does not even show the Senate the courtesy of staying to listen to this debate or to participate in this discussion—at a time when our unemployment rate is the highest in postwar history, at a time when nothing short of 30,000 bankruptcies have occurred in this country in the last two years alone, and at a time when, as a result of today's balance of payments deficit, there has been a further escalation in our foreign debt to the tune of another $1.8 billion.

         Today, we have a debt to the rest of the world, a foreign debt, of approximately $190,000m in gross terms, and a net debt in excess of $150,000m. That is a figure that compares with about $25,000m when this Government came to office almost 10 years ago. The policies of this Government over the last 10 years, year by year, month by month and day by day, have put this nation and all Australians in debt to the rest of the world. That is a legacy that we will leave future generations, particularly our immediate generation—our children and, beyond that, our grandchildren. That is a legacy that no other generation in Australia has ever left to its children and grandchildren. It is a legacy that will cause great hardship in terms of living standards for this nation for decades to come.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) this day, relating to industrial relations.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        I very briefly want to note that Senator Button referred to this as a national stoppage which, of course, it is. I notice that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) referred to it as not a stoppage, and argued why it was not a stoppage; he said it was, in fact, simply a day of action—or, perhaps more appropriately, a day of inaction. It would be nice if the Government could get its act together on what really its attitude is to whatever today has turned out to be.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I note with concern that one of the areas in which this day of national stoppage has taken effect has been in Port Kembla, particularly in the steel industry. I note in passing that it is curious that the management of the steel industry took the view that it was quite content with the present industrial relations system; I wonder whether it is today.

         I notice in passing that my electorate staff in Wollongong received a fax which purports to come from Colin Hollis MP, a Labor member of the Parliament. The sender is given as `Colin Hollis MP, PO Box 3000, Albion Park Rail' and it is marked, `Attention: all electorate staff'. The subject is `Day of Action, 30 Nov.'. The message is:

        By a majority decision of the P.S.U.E.O. members, a twenty-four hour strike has been called for Monday 30th Nov. All members taking part are asked to join the demonstration at the Show Ground—

        to protest the coalition's IR policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I started off on this matter, I said that the fax purported to come from Colin Hollis. It is a fax on his form. I therefore suggest to the Government that it might find out whether, in fact, Mr Hollis has sent or has allowed his office to send such a fax encouraging—in fact, calling for—electorate staff to join a strike, the fax clearly says, `to protest the coalition's IR policies'.

         Either this Government is in favour of this strike or it is not. It cannot be partly pregnant. If this document did come from Mr Hollis's office and does have his imprimatur, what is the Government going to do about this kind of behaviour if, in fact, it is not a secret supporter behind the scenes of this disgraceful strike which will cost more jobs, make things worse for the economy, lower our standing and status in the world and will, in fact, achieve nothing other than making a political point in trying to protect the power position of some union bosses. It is not in the best interests of workers.

         Australia is going through its worst recession in 60 years, with no end in sight. The unemployment rate is running at 11.3 per cent, with the youth unemployment rate up around 30 per cent. There is a continuing balance of payments crisis and, consequently, we have a net foreign debt approaching $160,000m. Today we find out that the net foreign debt for the last month is $1.8 billion—the highest it has been in three years. It is a debt of Third World proportions.

         A few weeks ago, the people of Victoria threw out a discredited Labor Government, a Labor Government which, hand in glove with John Halfpenny and the unelected Trades Hall, had reduced Victoria from what had been the financial and manufacturing centre of Australia to an absolute basket case. When the Liberal-led coalition applied remedies, for which it was elected and which it must responsibly apply, the industrial arm of the Labor Party—which now finds itself out of government—decided to organise a national strike.

         The waterfront, the Achilles heel of Australian exports, will be on strike. Our coalmining industry, our largest exporter which sells $7 billion worth of exports overseas to oversupplied world markets, will be on strike. Some 200,000 metalworkers in that beleaguered industry, which is desperately trying to increase productivity, will be on strike, notwithstanding the comments made by the Chamber of Manufactures, which has stated quite categorically that what is needed in Australia today is flexibility within the industrial relations system while maintaining minimum standards. It says that forcing employers and employees to involve unions is not the way to go. It says: let them have a choice. That is what the Jobsback policy is all about.

         These are the sorts of things that these people engineering the strike out of Melbourne are revolting about. I ask the question: all for what? The answer is simply because, when it is all boiled down, the trade union movement desperately seeks to hang on to power over little people and will not accept that, in the area of micro-economic reform, there is an urgent imperative to reform our outdated, ramshackle industrial relations system.

         The real concern of the ACTU sheltered workshop is that, with voluntary unionism and genuine enterprise or workplace agreements, it will have to work to retain or obtain members. It will have to convince Australians that there are benefits in paying substantial union dues. I suppose it is understandable as its record over the past 20 years has been that of destroying the very jobs for those whom it was supposed to protect.

         What will this strike achieve? It will be a lose-lose result. I know the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) commonly talks about a win-win result. This will be a lose-lose result. About a quarter of a million workers will lose a day's pay. Companies will lose production. There will be no exports out of Australia today. All exports out of Australia today have been stopped. Companies will still be required to pay interest to financial institutions and pay the rent and other fixed costs. The Government will lose taxation revenue. More importantly, productivity measured on a unit cost of production basis will decline. This is all because of the macho antics of a clique in the ACTU which, hand in hand with its political servants in the Labor Party, is responsible for our massive level of unemployment—the highest it has been in 60 years.

         The Government itself has moved towards enterprise-based agreement, but it has done so in a manner which entrenches its union leader mates. An enterprise-based agreement cannot be recognised under this Government without the imprimatur of a registered union. That is the basic difference. Genuine enterprise-based agreements and voluntary unionism are the reason for this anti-Australian display we are witnessing today. The people who have engineered this strike are traitors to Australia's desperately needed recovery. They will not recognise that the vast majority of private sector employees already work under a free system. They are hell-bent on coercing that majority against their will to become part of the rigid centralised structure which puts enormous power of economic life and death in the hands of a few.

         The Minister, Senator Cook, was quoted at the weekend as saying that the industrial action could place our international reputation as a reliable supplier in jeopardy, but he had no plans to avert the strike. Words without action are dead—a very old saying with a lot of truth in it. All suppliers to our export markets, with ships in port or arriving, are required under their contracts to advise their customers of this strike. That is the real nature of exports in the competitive world in which we live. Another nail is driven into the coffin of reliability. In that respect, Minister Cook is absolutely correct: in a world where commodity demand is at best subdued, another reason is given for our overseas customers to divert supply to our competitors. We hear today of the balance of payments figure, that the current account deficit for the month is a record for the past three years, yet these people have no regard for the consequences on their fellow human beings, their fellow Australians; they are interested only in themselves.

         The embarrassing part is that customers overseas have to be given a reason for strikes—why a ship is delayed, why a ship may not be able to come into port tomorrow, the next day or next week as a result of this strike today. The question I have to ask is: what on earth does the exporter say that he has not said over the years which is different in a valiant effort to retain his customers? Another little bit of the market disappears, a few more jobs are lost, all because of the short-sighted use of industrial muscle aided and abetted by the Labor Government—the political arm of the trade union movement—and all because of a big and protected union which will not accept the fact that, like every group in our society, to survive it must be competitive.

         What is the Labor Government doing about it? Absolutely nothing. It is doing nothing because it is locked into supporting and entrenching a small and powerful interest group which not only pays enormous amounts of other people's money into Labor Party coffers but also determines who gets preselected and becomes the leader of the party, the Prime Minister. All this is determined by the trade union movement. This strike has all the stench of yet another deal between an elected government or supposedly elected government and the unelected power brokers of the ACTU. It is about time that the people of Australia realised just how insidious and destructive is this relationship between a government and a handful of power brokers. Every time this issue or the question of union funding of the Labor Party is raised, anyone who raises it is accused of union-bashing.

         The President of the ACTU has drawn a parallel between the 1890s and the 1990s. It is scandalous, scaremongering stuff. In the 1890s people were prevented from joining trade unions. The coalition is saying that in the 1990s individual Australians should have a choice: the freedom to join or not to join an organisation, whether that organisation be a union or a professional organisation. That freedom of choice does not exist in Australia today where there are union-controlled closed shops.

         The inescapable fact is that, for the comparable period, industrial disputation in Australia under Labor is 62 per cent below the level of industrial disputation under the Fraser Government. The inescapable fact in Victoria is that, under Labor in that State, industrial disputation was off the bottom of the graph of the Australian Bureau of Statistics; it was at the lowest level since statistics were recorded in the history of the Bureau.

Before I go to the cause and effect element, we do not welcome a national day of protest, which will mostly be a day of protest meetings carrying resolutions and of discussing the Victorian legislation but in some places—particularly in Victoria—will be a day of industrial action.

The unpalatable fact is that the actions of Jeff Kennett are the blueprint of John Howard and John Hewson.

Our best practice program is aimed at Australian companies, management and workers identifying which companies in the world in their area of competition perform the best and developing a corporate plan to bridge the gap and put Australia in front. They are working together to be more competitive. Under our best practice program, the companies that have entered and been selected—selected not by the Government but by a commercial board headed by John Prescott, the General Manager of BHP Australia—are predominantly in Victoria, if one looks at the State by State distribution. The sad reality of the events in Victoria is that an industrial cooperation ethic was emerging in that State, a new industrial relations culture was mushrooming, and along came the bull in the china shop, Jeff Kennett, who is now threatening to sweep away the attitudinal change and the change in workplace custom that we were developing.

Many companies such as Sheraton Hotels, Asta Aviation, Olympic Tyres, Dulux Paints, Bendix Mintex—I can keep going on—were developing that positive attitudinal change of creating higher productivity with the certain knowledge that the outcome of that higher productivity is shared fairly with all sides and is not pocketed by one side.

It meant that the pensioner in Coburg paid exactly the same amount on property as the wealthy landowner in Toorak, on the grounds that this was somehow fair: it is flat tax; everyone pays the same. At the same time as the Victorian Government did that—not taxing according to means, but taxing flatly, according to where it could get the money—in the dead of night, without the press in attendance, it put through Victorian Parliament a Bill which increased the salaries of members of parliament; in the case of the Industrial Relations Minister, by $8,000 per annum, when he was already $14,000 per annum ahead of the salary of a Federal Minister.

I can but agree with that part of the assertion that the action today will adversely affect Australia's economy. One would have to be a fool to suggest otherwise.

In order to do that, we need the Government's leadership, intervention and acceptance of its responsibility to recognise initiatives which have the potential to create the sort of employment that I have just described.

         I mentioned in this place last week the success of the Barrett family near Ballarat, which had an enterprise that utilised a previously wasted material—pig manure. I am sure that we are familiar with this stuff; we have disregarded it for almost 200 years. But here we have an enterprise which has now utilised this waste material and produced methane and then electricity from it.

         We have too many examples of wasted resources throughout Australia, especially manure. It is quite a joke. I see that Senator Boswell is amused by it; most of us are. We have invariably disposed of this particular resource—which is typically wasted in Australia—in our waterways. I am a member of a committee which has spent some time examining the phenomenon of blue-green algae. The consensus is that the entry of nutrients into our waterways is largely responsible for the more regular blooms which are now occurring in our major waterways. To reduce that incidence we now know that we should do more to keep sewage, especially, out of our waterways.

         We sit here and bicker about unemployment while both the Government and the coalition increasingly endorse the economic rationalist model that dictates that governments should not get involved; they should not intervene in the market; they should keep well out of it, and abrogate that responsibility to lead, encourage and provide financial incentives. That is where we should be directing our attention today, rather than trying to lay blame for a situation of industrial relations that has evolved in Victoria, and rather than trying to skitter away from accepting responsibility for that and putting it onto the other party.

We have just sat here and watched another tribe of them disappear overseas through the ideological bent that seemed to be the flavour of the 1980s. We have seen it fail. We have seen it produce the sort of economic situation we have in Victoria. For a while we had a bunch of corporate clever dicks who thought that they could copy the style of international speculation, shuffle money around and thereby convince everybody that they were becoming millionaires.

They range from small propositions such as that put forward by the Scamander Council on the east coast of Tasmania to the one I mentioned earlier. The Scamander Council wants to pump the wasted sewage resource of that little settlement onto a timber plantation. It requires some $20,000 to get going on that particular enterprise—an enterprise which would create a capital resource with the potential of providing employment in the future.

The Democrats have a habit on which they pride themselves—they move very juvenile amendments to any urgency motion that is raised in this chamber. It is their major contribution to the Parliament of Australia, to the unemployment problem, to the size of our foreign debt and to the current account deficit. On all these things, the only thing the Democrats can bring themselves to do is move for a suspension of Standing Orders to move an amendment to an urgency motion in an attempt to neutralise it and shift the blame, and, I must say in fairness to the Labor Government on the other side, in an effort to have a foot in both camps and say that both parties are wrong while not offering any positive solutions to fix the most disastrous economic conditions we have had in this country since the Depression.

They feel that if they were to vote for our urgency motion someone in the trade union movement might criticise them. So what do they do? They go down this path of moving an amendment. They do not really care what the amendment says, one way or the other, but in this particular case they criticise Mr Kennett for trying to overcome the problems in his State. They go down that path and are able to say at the end of the day, `Well, we didn't vote for the urgency motion moved by Senator Parer because they didn't accept our amendment'.

The Prime Minister said that he had Mr Kelty in his pocket and that he has the unions in his pocket. The Prime Minister used the left wing leadership of the union movement to defeat Mr Hawke and get leadership of the Government. The Prime Minister needs to display a bit of backbone. He is talking about his vision for Australia and how he is going to help Australia. How will a decision made by the Government of Victoria affect what happens in Queensland or New South Wales? How will a decision made by the Premier of the Victorian Government affect other States? Why should the people in Queensland, Western Australia or New South Wales go on strike because a decision is made in Victoria that the ACTU does not like? There is no point in it at all. The people of Queensland cannot have any effect on the decisions made by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett.

          Senator Cook is hoist with the same petard. He knows only too well that these strikes are futile, that they will not achieve anything, and that they are stupid. They will not achieve anything for Australia other than to swing back support to the conservative forces. Senator Cook has often said—and I have heard him say it a number of times in this chamber—`I do not condone industrial disputation. I am one who has stood on a record of bringing industrial harmony to this country'. That is one of his famous quotes.

During its term in office, the Labor Government got itself into an absolutely disgraceful basket-case position: the State Bank has lost nearly $3 billion; Moody's Investors Service Inc has just delivered a two-notch downgrading to the State's debt rating; it lost the Tricontinental bank; the Pyramid Building Society went broke; and Victoria's public sector debt now stands at nearly $32 billion, which represents $7,130 for every man, woman and child in Victoria. What does this Government expect the Victorian Government to do? It was voted into office to take actions that would bring Victoria back to its great state.

          This Government has got into a coalition with Mr Halfpenny. He is calling the shots. He is the Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council. He ended 27 years membership of the Communist Party of Australia in 1979 to join the ALP in 1982. Mr Halfpenny has been described as an old-style Leninist whose leadership style remains true to the Communist Party traditions in which he was nurtured during the 1950s and 1960s. He attended full time training at a party school in the Soviet Union in 1964. As Victorian leader of the Metal Workers Union during the 1970s, Mr Halfpenny played a key role in the strikes of the time, including an eight-week strike which delayed construction of Melbourne's underground loop in May 1976, a four-week garbage strike in 1978 and a nine-week power strike in 1977. The point I am trying to make is that this is the person calling the shots whom those opposite are bowing their knees to and supporting. He is the person that called the strike that those opposite are condoning, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

          If Mr Halfpenny, Mr Kelty and the others involved in calling this national day of sabotage were really and truly honest and concerned about the Victorian situation and the Australian situation, they would have been speaking up loud and clear a long time ago. They failed to do that. In the last day or two the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Carr, said that the call for this national day of action—as those opposite call it, which in effect means strike—was purely political. That is borne out by the fact that Mr Halfpenny and Mr Kelty failed to take any action prior to this date. It reflects very badly on them.

In Western Australia, with the harvest just starting, Co-operative Bulk Handling workers have gone out in Esperance, Kwinana and Geraldton. If we look further, there is a national 24-hour strike in mining. In Victoria there is a 24-hour meat workers strike. In the wool industry, the shearers, shed hands, wool pressers and cooks are to stop work across Victoria for 24 hours. When one looks at all these things and the current account figures which came out today, all one can see is disaster—action that will make things worse for next month and for this year.

I have had some problems with some of the arrangements that have been made with the accord partners, but I put it to the Minister, who is in the chamber, that if that relationship was so good, strong and effective, the Government could have come out quite clearly and publicly and said, `We have said to our accord partners that this country cannot afford the type of anarchy that we have today'.

The day of action includes a variety of activities; I notice that meetings and rallies are being held. The Opposition has not made it very clear whether it supports or condemns that sort of activity. I notice that a fair took place yesterday in Melbourne. I would hardly describe those sorts of actions as particularly militant or Marxist-Leninist in their approach. From the rhetoric that is being thrown across the chamber, one would have to believe that we were back in the 1950s hearing about some sort of communist plot to undermine the future economic structure of this country.

          I would like to make a few comments about strikes in general. I was a union secretary. I am proud of it and do not apologise for it. From my general experience in industrial relations and with industrial disputes, union secretaries and union officials—who are dealt with in abusive terms by those opposite and referred to as union bosses—cannot get up and simply say, `Look, go on strike'. It just does not work that way. Workers in a dispute have to have a good reason for taking industrial action.

          In all the disputes in which I have been involved in my 10 years, I can say quite honestly that workers who took part in those disputes did so because they wanted to: they were motivated by a desire to either protect or improve their conditions. Unions are made up of workers and workers are not fools; they know what is in their best interests. An individual getting up in front of them simply does not pronounce, `There shalt be a strike'. There has to be, in the overwhelming majority of cases, good reasons for a strike to take place.

          As to strikes in general, the record of this Government is a very good one in terms of the number of strikes that have occurred whilst we have been in office; there has been a significant decline in industrial action in this country. There are a variety of reasons for that and I will be quite frank: it is not just because of the accord. The accord has played a very important role in the very rapid decline in industrial disputes in this country, but certainly the recession has also had an effect. But the very rapid decline in industrial disputation commenced well before this recession occurred. I think that is to the credit of the trade union movement. Indeed, whilst the number of strikes has declined, there has been—except for the last two years—very significant economic growth and very significant employment growth.

          So to draw a connection between industrial disputes and the one million unemployed is a very simplistic analogy and one that is not correct. If we look around the world today we see that the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom is fast overtaking Australia's—and if we think we have some economic problems here, we should look at the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has the so-called free labour market that the Opposition is advocating. It is the same in the United States; its unemployment rate is not quite so high, but it again has the so-called free labour market. This continual claim that so-called free labour markets and free wage negotiations between individual employees and employers means that we do not have unemployment is a total myth. There is no evidence that that is the case. There is no evidence around the world that free labour markets lead to lower unemployment. There is not one clear case study that the Opposition has pointed to.

          Their annual leave loading is being taken away. It does not matter whether we agree with the annual leave loading or not—and I will give honourable senators a frank view again: I think the annual leave loading is unsustainable; I just think it is too easy a target. It is not sustainable in the long term, even though it is a very small proportion of labour on-costs, and keeping that target there is not doing the industrial movement any good. But things like weekend penalty rates and shift payments are made because workers are legitimately disadvantaged for working those very unsocial hours and for suffering those sorts of disadvantages.

It costs more to go to work at weekends because there is no public transport, and child-care centres are usually not open. Honourable senators should work at night on shift work and just see what it is like; it is not a very pleasant lifestyle.

I suggest that most people—including most honourable senators—would not know what an employment contract looks like, let alone what the contents of an employment contract should be.

Those sorts of individual negotiations are cut to suit the employer. I challenge any member of the Opposition to talk to their children, suggest they negotiate their contracts individually and see what comes out of it.

I will give the Tasmanian Government that; they were much more moderate changes.

No wonder people get angry with what is happening in Tasmania and Victoria. In Victoria, we had a promise, a commitment, from Mr Kennett that there would be no reduction in wages. In Tasmania, we had a Tasmanian Liberal Party that was so interested in industrial relations it did not even have a policy on it but said, `If we did have a policy, we will consult with unions and workers first'.

          The blatant hypocrisy of those two Liberal governments is the added reason why workers are so angry in those two communities. So we can understand why when people get angry they take industrial action. I can understand that. I do not like strikes. I was a union official and I do not like them. They are unproductive, bitter and lead to economic losses. But, in a democracy such as we have in this country, there is a price for democracy. I would much rather live in a system where there are strikes—they are inconvenient and there is economic loss—than the type of system that existed in Nazi Germany or in the Stalinist Soviet Union. We have seen what happens in those systems.

          The Opposition is always claiming that the unions are at fault. Bear in mind that unions are workers, not just institutions. They are made up of individuals who do make decisions. Where are the calls for management improvement in this country?  We always hear about productivity from the Opposition. I do not think the Opposition knows what productivity means or, at least, the distinction between efficiency and productivity. I was reading a very interesting article about Australian international competitiveness. Australia ranks sixteenth out of 23 industrial nations. The Opposition is always talking about that. This report by the Swiss based International Institute for Management Development and the World Economic Forum ranked Australia poorly in domestic economic strength, internationalisation and finance.

          Why is Australia in that situation? It attributes the major blame for this performance not to workers but to the quality of management. If we are to criticise unions and workers, where are the positive suggestions? Indeed, where is the legislation in Victoria and Tasmania to assist in improving the quality of management in this country? So let us put industrial action into some perspective. Indeed, in this country, until recently with the dispute in Burnie in Tasmania and the recent disputes in Victoria, there was less production lost from industrial disputes than from sickness and ill-health in the work force.

          —Today will certainly go down as a blot on Australia's political landscape—a day of shame really—when the trade union movement of Australia called a 24-hour strike with one million Australians unemployed and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) making no criticism of the strike. One has only to say it to think: what a terrible situation it is in Australia, without the leadership of a Prime Minister condemning the action of the trade union movement and with this country in a desperate economic situation, when the Prime Minister is not prepared to say to the ACTU, `This is wrong. You have done the wrong thing. Don't do it. The nation cannot afford it'.

         Indeed, Senator Sherry conceded that such a strike creates great economic difficulty for the nation. He also referred to the bitterness and other concerns about such a strike, but he did not condemn the strike. That is what we are saying about Mr Keating. Why did the Government not recognise that political leadership is needed at this stage? Political leadership means going to the trade union movement and persuading it to call the strike off. It does not mean passing some Bill, which is what Senator Sherry implied we were on about, but simply fronting your mates in the ACTU and telling them the country cannot afford it. That is the sort of political leadership that the Government should give us at this stage. But did we get it from the Prime Minister of Australia? Not on your life.

          More than a million Australians are fed up with looking for jobs. Just think of the thousands and thousands of applications for jobs that have been rejected, some of them probably not even responded to. People are desperately looking for jobs. Their lives are falling apart as they try to cope with the situation of being unemployed. Today, the trade union movement called for a 24-hour strike. There can be no reason for it other than it being a political strike. The Prime Minister sits quietly and allows the trade union movement to do it. Of course, the Prime Minister is only interested in one thing: how can he get himself re-elected? If in some way or other this strike persuades some people to fear a future Liberal-National Party Federal government, then the Prime Minister will have achieved his aim today in not criticising the strike. Indeed, one would say that he is welcoming the strike because he sees that it may frighten some people into not voting for us at the next election. The fact that the nation cannot afford the strike is not relevant; the economy has collapsed.

          Today, we have discovered that Australia lost over $2 billion on its current account in October—another month of loss; the ninth loss in a row. I say to the Prime Minister: just think about what this means. Back in the late 1980s, the Prime Minister squeezed the economy by raising interest rates until they were up to 25 per cent. He did that because we were losing so much money every month on the current account. He raised interest rates until he strangled this economy. Certainly, for a short period of time, we stopped losing money on the current account, but the result was over one million people now unemployed. That is the consequence of that policy of the Prime Minister. Having eased interest rates, back we go again: for nine consecutive months there has been a loss on the current account. It has increased until the stage last month where there was a loss of over $2 billion.

We have nothing from him but re-election schemes—and he should be thrown out as soon as possible.

As all of us can easily see, sections of the union movement are acting like a group of Luddites in the face of pending privatisation and industrial relations reform initiatives which are desperately needed right across this country.

The buck stops with Labor. Over the past decade, it has not had the gumption to take the hard decisions because it would have stepped on the toes of too many of its union mates. We have a labour movement in this country which, in recent times, has not had to flex its industrial muscle because it has long had direct representation in the Cabinet room.

We have had disruption not only to the millions of other workers not directly involved in these protests but across the country in numerous industries, slowing productivity and retarding growth.

The saddest feature about these nationwide industrial stoppages and days of protest action, as they are called, is that there will be no winner. The union bosses' strategies to castigate employers outside Victoria for the political reforms of the Victorian Government are nothing short of deranged. All these days of action around the country will have absolutely no effect on Premier Kennett's reform policies, because they will go ahead. Indeed, they must go ahead or Victoria will continue to go right down the drain and unemployment queues will grow larger day by day, as industries close down or move elsewhere.

          It is not simply that the Government in Victoria has tried to remove certain rights from workers, such as the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading; it has, in fact, removed those institutions which were set up to protect people's rights. For example, the Accident Compensation Tribunal was abolished without any word of protest from this chamber, even though the Law Council of Australia was concerned about it, and even though the Bar Council in Victoria and the Law Institute of Victoria were concerned about it.

That is not how contracts are normally enforced. The criminal law is not used to enforce contracts. Does Senator Crane say that the breach of contracts should be visited by criminal penalties? When people protest, who are condemned?

Let us get rid of this vicious attack on our common law rights. Let us get rid of this attack on the great institutions that have underpinned our democracy. Having done that, we might condemn people who protest.

       Mr President, I wish to comment on two of the three statements that you tabled today: the first one,
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Criticism of the Senate by the Prime Minister
       </emphasis>
       and the second,
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Questions relating to Opposition policy
       </emphasis>
       . These are very important statements because they involve what I believe to be significant issues of principle. The first statement relates to the duties of the President and the behaviour of the Prime Minister, and those are the principles which I wish to canvass. The second statement relates to the nature of Question Time and the constraints which are placed on Ministers in answering questions.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Let me preface my remarks by suggesting that the roles of the Presiding Officers—the Speaker and the President—are probably receiving closer scrutiny than at any other time in memory, and possibly since Federation. I believe that this has come about as a result of a number of factors. First, there is the widespread perception that parliamentary standards have declined dramatically in the 1980s, and the community is looking to its parliamentary leaders to take action to raise those standards. You, Mr President, as one of the ranking officers of the Parliament, hold an office which encompasses a very long tradition, and I believe that you are one of those people that the community is looking to.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Secondly, the advent of television broadcasting of Question Time I believe has given further focus to the key role of the Presiding Officer. Thirdly, I think there would be general agreement that the controversial activities of the Speaker in the other place has led to widespread media debate over quite a long period of time. Finally, there is the perception in some quarters at least that Presiding Officers must take some of the responsibility for the decline in parliamentary standards. For example, I draw your attention to a recent paper released by a former Speaker, Dr Ken Coghill, and a former President, Mr Hunt, of the Victorian Parliament, where it was suggested that the decline of Question Time had resulted in part because of the rulings by the Presiding Officers.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Of course, we all have a responsibility for maintaining parliamentary standards. In the context of these remarks I do not pretend to say that you, Mr President, and the Speaker, have the key role, but I think you have an important role to play in ensuring that parliamentary standards are maintained. We have enough examples, which I do not wish to canvass today, of what happens when a Presiding Officer is perhaps not prepared to use the full authority of his office to maintain standards in the Parliament.

        I think the challenge facing Presiding Officers in this Parliament has become particularly significant because of the key role that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself has played in the degeneration of parliamentary standards. Are Presiding Officers going to accept the standards of the Prime Minister? Whatever the decision of the Speaker in the other place may be, there is in my view no reason why the President of the Senate should not stand up to the Prime Minister when the matter relates to the conduct of the Senate, and when we believe that proper parliamentary conduct has not occurred.

      <para first-indent="16">

        I think it is true to say that, unlike any other Prime Minister in Australian history, Mr Keating seems to have an unbridled contempt for the political institutions that have served this nation so well for almost a century. I believe the abuse of Question Time in the other place is the most obvious manifestation of this contempt. In addition, Mr Keating has attacked the role of the head of state and, in his most recent remarks, attacked the Senate. It seems to me that no part of our constitutional arrangements is immune from the Prime Minister's venom.

        The question before this chamber, I believe, is: can the community look towards the Presiding Officers to assist in the improvement of parliamentary standards? Mr President, I believe that this was the challenge you were faced with when the Prime Minister referred to senators as `unrepresentative swill'. I believe that a statement by you would have made a very substantial and important community impact. The statement, I believe, that would have been appropriate—and I put this on the table—would be along these lines: it would be appropriate if the Prime Minister adhered to longstanding tradition and avoided reflection on members of the Senate. Such a statement would have been widely welcomed in the community. It would have affirmed the importance of your office in maintaining parliamentary standards and certainly affirmed in the community the view that parliamentary standards are worth defending and that you see your role in that light, as well as the other duties that you have.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Such a statement by you would have been fully in line with Standing Orders, longstanding traditions and relations between the chambers, and based upon appropriate precedents. There seems little doubt that Mr Keating's reference to senators as `unrepresentative swill' was offensive, both in terms of the Standing Orders of the other place, and contrary to the tradition, outlined in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Senate Practice
        </emphasis>
        , that `members and senators should refrain from reflections on members and proceedings of the other chambers'. In other words, what I am putting to you, Mr President, is that it was not a complex problem that you were faced with; it was a clear breach of the courtesy which should exist between the chambers. I believe that, because of your office, an immediate response from you would have affirmed in the community mind the importance of high standards in parliamentary conduct.

        In your paper you said that you had examined the papers of your predecessors and could find no examples of Presiding Officers responding to such criticisms. That may well be the case, but I suggest that this is probably because this is the first time a Prime Minister has launched such an insulting attack upon senators. I do not pretend that the chamber has not been criticised from time to time by other political leaders, and there may well be examples from my own Party, but I suspect that the disgraceful, insulting terms in which that attack was launched are unprecedented in Australian history. It is not surprising that you could not find precedents. Mr President, I wonder whether you are able to provide the chamber with examples of any other Prime Minister who has indulged in such demeaning language about senators as a whole.

        There are precedents where Presiding Officers have made statements when the Parliament has been attacked. I draw your attention to a statement by the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council. The President criticised a magistrate who, among other things, said:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . maybe the lowest form of life is in the Parliament.

       A magistrate made that comment in sentencing an offender. You will be interested to know that the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council took considerable objection to that statement by a magistrate. He suggested, among other things, that the magistrate should note the comments of Lord Denning, which I propose to incorporate in
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Hansard
       </emphasis>
       , and should avoid making privileged statements offensive to the legislative arm of government and members of the House that invite retaliation resulting in further damage being done to the standing of members of parliament and the reputation of judicial officers. I seek leave to incorporate in
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Hansard

       the remarks of Lord Denning that were quoted by the President of the Legislative Council.

        Senator Terry Aulich, a distinguished senator and more recently a distinguished author, raised an interesting issue in his contribution when he suggested that your actions had been as scrupulously fair as any President can be, given that you are a member of a political party. It seemed to me that what he gave so generously with one hand he took away with the other. The reality is that, unlike the House of Commons, in Australia we have presiding officers who are members of political parties.

It is not clear to many people that you, unlike most other presiding officers, I suspect, preside over a chamber in which a substantial majority of members do not belong to the same political party as yourself. Mr President, you are a well-respected Presiding Officer and well liked on this side of the chamber and, I assume, amongst your own colleagues. That sort of respect provides you with a stronger basis to maintain Standing Orders and to assert parliamentary standards than might be apparent at first sight.

        I happen to agree with Senator Aulich that we should be looking at whether it is possible in our parliamentary system to create a non-party presiding officer, a so-called independent presiding officer. There are complications with that, but it is certainly a challenge which should be taken up. I would like to see more research done on that particular issue. Speaker Snedden canvassed it very extensively before he left office. With my own parliamentary experience and after reading what Speaker Snedden said, I have some sympathy with the views that he expressed. It is interesting that Speaker Rozzoli of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly has said:

       Speaker Snedden held a similar view. Those are the sorts of issues that should be considered by both sides of the Parliament: to what extent we can buttress the office of the Presiding Officer from party influence. For example, to the extent that this happens, it is probably a bad thing for the presiding officers to be present at meetings where parliamentary tactics are discussed. It puts the presiding officers in a very difficult position and leaves them open to attack.

        Mr President, I want to briefly look at the questions which relate to Opposition policy. This is another challenge that you have been faced with in this chamber. It has become a contentious issue, again in part because of the behaviour of the Prime Minister, who generally believes that Question Time should be a launching pad against the Opposition rather than for questions about his administration. The purpose of Question Time as outlined in Odgers'

      <para font-size="-=2">
       Without doubt, to the onlooker the most obvious manifestation of responsible Government, i.e. the direct accountability of the Executive to the Parliament, is question time. For about an hour, Senate Ministers are subjected to the questions of private Senators, both Government members and Opposition members, with respect to the administration of their departments and the departments they represent in the Senate on behalf of Ministers in the House of Representatives. With a variety of questions, the searchlight is thrown on to all aspects of government activities, and Ministers must account for their administration.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suggest that is a somewhat purist view of Question Time. I happen to agree with Senator Robert Ray that Question Time is inevitably a robust period when great clashes of values and ideas occur. I think those clashes are by no means a bad thing, and it is important that they be exposed in a public forum.

        I do not dispute with Senator Ray that questions about Opposition policies have occurred. They have occurred with increasing frequency in the other place and they have occurred in this chamber. Senator Ray brought to our attention four or five examples of where the previous Government asked questions about Opposition policies. I had a cursory glance at all the references that Senator Ray made. My impression is—and, as I say, it was a cursory glance—that the questions appear to be more one-off questions rather than a constant, deliberate strategy to ensure that a significant proportion of the 40 to 50 minutes which is taken up by Government Ministers at Question Time is taken up with attacking the policies of the Opposition.

        It is a problem that we have to face up to in this chamber. It is clear from the previous rulings of the Presiding Officers, including some of your rulings, Mr President, that questions on Opposition policies are out of order. I think it is a pity, on reading the examples given in the paper that you tabled, Mr President, that your 1987 ruling tended to dilute the previous rulings of Presidents which made it pretty clear that, whatever had been the examples in the past—and Senator Ray has brought us those examples—certainly, until 1987, those questions were largely out of order.

        It is inevitable that, in the context of Question Time, there is going to be a very heavy debate in this chamber and, from time to time, this will involve questions on the policies of the Opposition.

        This problem has been highlighted by the fact that the proceedings of this chamber are now televised.

        In my view, this is a major issue.

It is certainly one view that Ministers have to answer for their own policies and administration, but when it tips over so that one-off examples of Ministers attacking Opposition policies become a matter of deliberate strategy, the whole nature of Question Time has changed. Therefore, we have to reflect on what must be done in terms of your rulings, Mr President, to see whether we can attempt to at least bring Question Time back into a position where people have the right to hear what the Government policies are, rather than ceaselessly hear attacks on the policies of the Opposition.

        I have been in this chamber only a few years, but the first matter greatly exploited here was petitions. I remember when one Wednesday—because, of course, that was a broadcast day—we went for 47 minutes, with honourable senators jumping up and reading petitions. In the end, I think we were all sick of it. If anyone started that trend, it was this side of the chamber rather than that side. So one of the great leaks, if you like, in Senate procedure was blocked off and now the Clerk of the Senate reads out petitions. There was then a little variation in procedure. We would get petitions which were not in conformity with Standing Orders and they would be read out on radio broadcast day. But I think an Opposition initiative suggested that those could be read out only on non-broadcast day.

        The second great explosion was in notices of motion, where we had a proliferation not only in numbers but also in length and content. But, again, that has been restricted. Then we had the great noting of answers to questions episode. In the Fraser years, probably five answers were noted after Question Time in seven or eight years. But within a year, I think in excess of 100 to 150 answers to questions were noted. So we have cut that back and introduced Standing Orders that restrict the noting of answers to questions to half an hour, and four minutes per speaker. Of course, today, the new puerile trick is to hold up newspaper headlines in unison around the back of the chamber. That is supposed to be a wonderful innovation in the Senate.

But, if we go back and check the record, we find that a record number of questions were placed on notice. No wonder so many questions were got through. I invite Senator Kemp and those opposite to go back and have a look, as I have in the last week, at the length of some of the answers in that period; it was well and truly equal to anything we have done in the last few years, and sometimes well and truly in excess.

That was fair enough. All parties have done that over the years to get rid of a critic. But he was pretty neutral because he disliked Fraser almost as much as he disliked us. But it did not stop him from interfering in the design of this building to make sure that the Opposition executive party room was as small as possible. We got all sorts of complaints from members of the Opposition over this, but Speaker Snedden did that to punish us long term. All that was wrong with it was that we won the 1983 election and now those opposite have to cop that.

        A question is not allowed to contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, ironical expressions or hypothetical matter. That is done here every day by those in opposition; we do not object to that. And a question should not ask for an expression of opinion. How often does that occur? A question should not ask for a statement of government policy or for a legal opinion. Maybe that is the one that is most knocked out here. Nor should a question refer to debates in the current session or proceedings in committee not reported to the Senate.

        How often have we had an MPI listed and had eight or nine questions at Question Time referring to that MPI? It happens all the time. On the problem of whether Ministers are allowed to refer to Opposition policy, a lot of points have been made by, I think, Senator Kemp and Senator Bishop very selectively quoting rulings on this particular matter. If they care to go back and research it, they will find that nine times out of 10 the Presiding Officer, Labor or Liberal—be it Senator Condor Laucke, Senator Young, Senator Sibraa or Senator McClelland—ruled in favour of the person asking the question.

       Has the Minister representing the Prime Minister seen details of the proposals of the Australian Labor Party to create 100,000 jobs at a cost to revenue of $180m a year? What would be the effects on inflation of such a scheme? Would such a scheme in fact create more jobs?

       That is a direct question on ALP—the then Opposition—policy. It is good enough for the Liberals but it is not good enough for any Labor backbencher to ask such questions. But let us deal with the interjection, `Rubbish!', by Senator Walters. On 10 November 1981, Senator Walters said:

       My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence.

        It should not be that Question Time simply becomes a consideration of Opposition policies at any one time. It is only fundamentally a correct question when the Government is asked whether it would adopt those policies. Some scope has to be allowed for that, but you, Mr President, have been quite consistent in asking the Minister to get back to the point. Therefore, there is a midway, and I believe you have ruled in a particular and correct way.

You have annoyed both sides and you have also appeased both sides in your rulings. That is the way it should be. I often think that sometimes the objections taken by those opposite are meant more to disrupt the proceedings at a particular time. I do not say that that is a consistent pattern, but from time to time I believe that has also occurred. I acknowledge that it occurs on either side of the chamber when either party is in opposition.

The first of two matters which I wish to address is the Prime Minister's criticism. I do not believe it is up to the President of the Senate to publicly defend the role of the Senate.

Mr President, I believe you have allowed them in terms of whether the Government will adopt a particular policy, but you have also occasionally tried to bring a Minister back to the main substance of a question. I think those opposite who object are absolute hypocrites, having done it themselves. Sure, the junior woodchuck class that has come in since the coalition was last in government is allowed far more licence in these matters because it has no track record at which we can point. Three of them thought they could get away with that on another occasion, when they came from the House of Representatives, but we caught them out, too, by looking up their record in that place.

        —Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on these documents. I really rise to speak to the ruling that you put down—`confirmed' might be another way of expressing it—on motions for suspension of Standing Orders. Before commenting on that, I should say that it is still the view of honourable senators on this side that the President does have a responsibility out of his office to uphold the reputation of this place, because the standing of this place is vitally important within the democratic process in Australia. When the institution is attacked, as it was by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we expect a President, no matter which side of the Parliament the President comes from, to take some action. That matter has been debated, and I do not know whether it will progress any further than that.

        The second issue is the abuse of Standing Orders by Ministers in addressing Opposition policy during Question Time. I think the point that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has failed to appreciate is that occasionally when we were in government we asked such questions and occasionally they were objected to, but we did not subject the Opposition to the continual tactic of a whole stream of questions on Opposition policy. This Government and these Ministers have abused the Standing Orders by developing a whole string of questions on Opposition policy as a tactic to be used in literally every Question Time.

        The Minister said that we are soft on taking the debate. The problem is that in Question Time we do not have the opportunity to take the debate. We want to debate policy; there has probably been no Opposition in history which has wanted to make political debate on policy and issues like this one. But the Standing Orders do not protect a Minister who wants to abuse his obligation to answer questions relating to the administration of government policy. That is why we have been continually taking points of order and why we will continue to do so. Mr President, we will ask that you keep Ministers within the Standing Orders and, as you say in your statement, that they are not permitted to use the Question Time procedure to debate Opposition policy.

        The third issue that I want to mention, which has not really been dealt with in this debate, is the use of the contingent notice of motion in relation to suspending Standing Orders. Mr President, I want to raise it because, with respect, I do not agree with your opinion or your ruling. I do not seek to take the matter to formal dissent, but if I do not mention disagreement at this stage and it occurs again you or a future President may mention the fact that we did not rise to dispute it at the relevant time.

        You have said, Mr President, that we have a precedent that, if more than one contingent notice of motion is moved while the Senate is under guillotine, as President you should disallow that because it in effect becomes an abuse of the restraint of the guillotine. I think we accepted that on the last time, somewhat reluctantly. We were even more reluctant, however, to accept it in relation to a senator from a third party because, if you allow one from one side of the chamber to move such a contingent notice, we could not really see any logical argument that would oblige you to disallow it with regard to a third senator.

        On this occasion the Senate was not under the constraint of a guillotine. You have said, however, that, because the proceedings of the Senate had been suspended so that the Senate had returned to continue the same debate, you were under that constraint. But I do not see that constraint in the Standing Orders, provided that the motions were moved before the Senate got back into that debate, as they were in the instance that is in question, which was on 12 November. I do not see any limitation in the Standing Orders at all.

        On that day, I moved a contingent notice of motion to suspend Standing Orders firstly to seek a Question Time, and that was defeated. Then, on a totally separate matter, I moved suspension of Standing Orders in order that we might condemn the Government for the high level of unemployment. It was a different motion and a positive motion—nothing to do with the suspension for Question Time at all. I cannot see any restriction within the Standing Orders on doing that and I do not think the argument you applied, using the precedent of the guillotine, works either.

        It might be that there is a deficiency within the Standing Orders. It might be that this general contingent notice of motion could arguably require some further constraint and I am open to debate and persuasion on those matters, but I do place on record, Mr President, that I think your use of the precedent of the guillotine is an inappropriate precedent because it does not apply to these circumstances. Therefore, there was not the restraint that you believe there was in my moving the second contingent notice of motion in those circumstances.

        The main reason for my rising is that, during his delivery, Senator Ray made a slighting remark about the President of the upper House in Western Australia, Clive Griffiths. He said that the upper House of Western Australia was hardly a democratic House. By way of implication, I took that to mean that the upper House is not elected by a one man, one vote system. If that were true of the upper House of Western Australia, I put it to you, Mr President, that Senator Ray did not tell us the whole story, because that position was arrived at after a bipartisan approach between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party at that time. Senator Ray did not tell the full story once again because a senior Labor Minister made it known in 1987 or thereabouts, and it was before I came to this place, that there could not be a true one man, one vote—or one woman, one vote for that matter—system in Western Australia, otherwise, and these are his words, not mine, `the State will be run by the unions and by the city'.

         Briefly, the Auditor-General, as usual, has done an excellent job, considering his lack of resources. I think one of the outstanding features of the Auditor-General, and what most of us who are interested in the efficient operation of government look forward to, is the efficiency audits of the Auditor-General.

          The Government—and it is something that has generally received bipartisan support—has moved to having a financial management improvement program; in other words, let the managers manage. My overall view—and I say this simply from the experience of having also worked fairly substantially in the private sector in this area—is that one of the most exacting chores of any government or the private sector is the purchasing function. It is something that has basically been underrated in Australia.

          It is not unusual to hear the comment—and I do not say this as any form of denigration; I say it because I believe that the profile of purchasing people should be lifted—`He is only a purchasing officer'. I have heard that said in both the private and public sectors, yet the total purchasing of the Government in Australia is about $10 billion, plus or minus 10 per cent. In other words, an improvement in, or a loss of, efficiency of 10 per cent represents $1 billion. So purchasing should be taken very seriously.

          Purchasing attracts an incredibly high profile in Japan. Over the past 20 or 30 years, Japan has developed from a country that was devastated by war to the leading economic country in the world today. It had no resources to develop, simply its people and its work ethic. Naturally, one of the most important functions in Japan is to be able to purchase materials, commodities and whatever is needed to fuel its industrial machine. There are many lessons to be learned from the Japanese, because they attribute a very high status to those people involved in the purchasing function. I only point out that overview because, having experienced it and learnt from it, I have to say that the rest of the world could take a leaf out of their book.

          With the financial management improvement program and letting the managers manage has come a diversification of the purchasing function to the extent that, as has been pointed out by the Auditor-General, throughout Australia today, within the Commonwealth there are—and apparently the figure is not entirely known—between 13,000 and 20,000 people organising purchasing for the Commonwealth. That is an enormous figure, particularly considering that purchasing is a very specialist function.

          Purchasing is an area that is not only specialist but is also open to corruption because of the large amount of money involved. We have all heard over the years—I am not particularly pointing to recent years—anecdotal stories of people being entertained and specifications being written for a particular product. No doubt the company selling the product would look on that as a selling function, but one wonders about the efficiency of the purchasing process.

          The Auditor-General pointed out that collective purchasing can be harnessed effectively by using what is called common-use contracts, which are estimated to save the Commonwealth about $60m. But offset against that is the cost of the staffing level of the 13,000 to 20,000 people throughout the various departments, which has been estimated by the Auditor-General to be $56m. That is an incredibly high figure for a purchasing function.

          Returning to my earlier comment, it seems to me that, with something as critical as purchasing and with all the requirements of all the various departments, we should have a good look at people such as the Japanese, who are the experts in this field. I believe that there should be a centralised coordination role. I do not mean having a small handful of purchasing officers who turn into little Hitlers—these people must be well aware of what their customers require—but there should be some overview involved with the purchasing function.

          In the past, this was a major part of the Department of Administrative Services, but with the FMIP program it has moved out into the various departments. I suppose it could be argued that this should either be done properly or it should not be done at all. But, again referring to the efficiency of the Japanese, it is worth looking at.

          The other point made by the Auditor-General is that some 13,000 of these people hold Australian government credit cards. Only 35 per cent of them have any purchasing training whatsoever. I think this is fraught with danger. I do not say this in any political sense whatsoever; I say it in a straight management sense. It should be something that is very carefully looked at.

          The Auditor-General makes 19 recommendations in his report. I will not refer to them all; I will just touch on a few. In respect of common-use contracts, the report talks about giving more time to complex common-use contracts and undertaking more detailed planning. On the face of it, common-use contracts have some appeal but, in practice—and from the discussions I have had with suppliers to the Government—it seems to me that there is a lot of avenue for improvement.

          One of the problems with common-use contracts is that, just because a contractor is successful in getting on the list, it does not mean that he will be successful in selling any goods. I believe that the various departments should be more detailed in their specific budget requirements for the items that are purchased under common-use contracts; otherwise there is no incentive for them to be accurate. They can pull a figure out of the air, put it on the list, it gets accumulated, the department goes out for a common-use contract and that then becomes the basis on which departments deal with people who have made the list. That is one side of the coin.

          On the other side of the coin there are those people who in the main try to tender in a way that gets them on the list. In other words, by no means do they offer their lowest price because by doing so they would be giving their opposition the inside running as to what prices they were quoting. I suppose, from the Commonwealth point of view, that has some
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         merit because they know they can bargain down a bit, provided that the people in the other departments doing the purchasing know what they are doing. I think that is the important thing about it.

          I notice that the Audit Office recommends that DAS discuss with the Department of Finance the possibility of obtaining funding under community service obligations for those common-use contracts that appear to come under that category. If the common-use contracts with the 2 per cent commission that is paid are properly done and the various departments purchase under the common-use contracts, there should be no need to go back to the Budget and get the taxpayer to pay. In fact, there should be sufficient profit generated from those items of common-use contracts that do not fall under the category of community service obligations to pay for the running of the purchasing section of DAS.

         That just reinforces what I said earlier. It does not matter where one is, in which sector of the community, good purchasing people are a scarce community. If a department is lucky enough to have them, it should nurture them and encourage them. Not only are they a scarce commodity in any part of society, but also they can be very much involved in saving the government, and thus the taxpayer, an awful lot of money.

          As I said, I did not intend to speak long on this report. There are things that have to be confronted. I know an experiment has occurred within the Government. There have been massive changes. Generally, we have been supportive of them. But a lot more attention should be given to purchasing. As I said earlier, the Auditor-General has done an excellent job. He has highlighted areas that should be addressed by any government that is in control of such a massive purchasing function at the taxpayers' expense.

On 24 November 1992, the President referred to the Committee a letter from Mr D. E. Hennessy relating to remarks made by Senator Watson on 3 November 1992 during the adjournment debate. As Director of the Government Superannuation Office, Mr Hennessy wrote to the President on 20 November 1992, and the matter was referred to the Committee as a submission under Privilege Resolution 5. The Committee has considered the submission and recommends that a response agreed to by Mr Hennessy and the Committee be incorporated in

The situation is clearly set out in my Office's annual report and, indeed, the Third Report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, titled "Super and the Financial System" acknowledged that the funding of the employer component of the Queensland Government's superannuation liabilities is held "in consolidated revenue" (Note (e) to Table 5, p.25).

          I wish to point out that this Senate provides a unique opportunity for people outside this chamber who have been referred to or named by senators to respond. Mr Hennessy has afforded himself the opportunity provided by this Senate Privilege Resolution of so responding and the matter is currently before the Senate. In fact, the statements by the Director and his Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, actually make very interesting reading. In that response he writes:

         By way of background, let me explain: Mr Hennessy was a witness to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and, in his presentation, he indicated that the Queensland superannuation funds were fully funded. It was not a question of whether the funds were a trust fund. But there is an expectation that senior members of the bureaucracy, not only of this Commonwealth Government, but also of the State governments, understand fully the terminology that they use and apply. In his wording and in his presentation, the impression was conveyed that those superannuation moneys were fully funded. In so doing, the Queensland Government—Mr De Lacy, the Treasurer, and indirectly Mr Hennessy—was given a great deal of credit in the media and elsewhere for something that is in fact not quite right. It is true that he may have misunderstood the terminology; that is indeed unfortunate. But in this response he did not seek to make that particular point.

          This ability for members of the public, including public servants, to respond in this manner is a very important privilege. In fact, it is a privilege that not even the House of Commons provides to outside people. It is about time that the Director of the Queensland Government Superannuation Office, Mr Hennessy, and Mr De Lacy, who reported extensively, criticising me in the Queensland Parliament—I note that I do not have the same right of response in the Queensland Parliament as Mr Hennessy has of responding here, so I take this opportunity of furthering the point I wish to make—recognised that Queensland, along with the Commonwealth and other States, has superannuation debt. It is about time the Queensland Government recognised that it has superannuation debt too. The statements acknowledge `the funding of the Crown share of the benefits of certain of the Queensland Government's defined benefits fund being in the Consolidated Fund'—honourable senators should note the words `Consolidated Fund'—and distinguish between this arrangement and having funding through a trust fund.

          It is all very well for Mr Hennessy to say, `I did not say that I had it in a trust fund', but the point is that a consolidated fund is not a trust fund, and that is the point I have been making all the way along the line. This is an important clarification which I have been seeking. It adds in a very significant way to the evidence which was given by the Director when he appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation during its Brisbane hearings earlier this year. The budget practices outlined in the submission to the President are not unusual; in fact, the submission reveals to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that Queensland funds its obligations in employee superannuation on an emerging cost basis—just as the Commonwealth and all the other States do.

          It is interesting that, subsequently, Mr De Lacy actually acknowledged this in a very indirect way in his lengthy rebuttal of my speech in the Queensland Parliament. What concerns me is the fact that they—particularly Mr De Lacy—still continue to believe that this is full funding when it is not. What is full funding? Full funding involves setting assets aside to cover liabilities as they emerge on a regular basis, not as they emerge at the end of a period when a person is about to retire, or something like that.

          I will put it simply, by way of example. If the Queensland Government has 10 employees who are all entitled to 10 per cent employer contribution for one year, and if each had a salary of $30,000, the Government would need to set aside 10 per cent of $30,000 times 10 employees, which would
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         equal $30,000 a year. This is what happens in a number of statutory or quasi government superannuation schemes, for example, Qantas employees, Telecom and the Australian National University, but it does not happen in Queensland, which is fair enough, and it does not happen in the Commonwealth, and we acknowledge that point. But the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation singled them out for special comment because of the misleading evidence they gave to the Committee. What happens in Queensland is a mix of obfuscation and round robin accounting.

According to the 1992 reports, which we have here, the first, the State Public Sector Superannuation Fund, had an opening balance of $142,000 on 30 June 1992, estimated receipts of $203,303,000, and—surprise, surprise—outgoings of $203,303,000. In other words, it has apparently received from the portfolio departments an amount equal to its emerging liability, and transferred to the Queensland Government Superannuation Office an identical amount equal to the emerging cost of retirees both past and present, fully funded. At the year's end, there will be a balance in the fund of $142,000.

          —The total public sector superannuation debt in Queensland for 1992-93, according to the emerging cost principle, would be: for the Government Officers Superannuation Fund, approximately $119m; the Parliamentary Superannuation Fund, $3m; the Police Superannuation Fund—which, incidentally, is $277m in the red—$82m; the State Public Sector Superannuation Fund $203m; and the State Service Superannuation Fund $73m. That is a total of $479m.

          As honourable senators will note from pages 31 and 32 of the document, the total of all cash balances in the five superannuation funds is approximately $2.5m. The question that I ask is: is this sufficient to cover the superannuation debt?  Only an actuary could say, but my hunch is that it falls short—not by thousands or hundreds of thousands, but by millions of dollars of unfunded liabilities.

          However, the superannuation debt provision could have been made in some other section of the account, or a possible parking space for superannuation debt provisions—and it could be, but we do not know. For example, the Queensland Treasury Corporation Fund, I think, has a balance of $12.7m as at 30 June 1992. Unfortunately, this amount is not disaggregated and, in the scheme of things, is small in relation to superannuation debt, so it is unlikely that it covers the emerging debt burden.

          Assuming that Queensland Public Service employee numbers and demographic characteristics remain at a steady rate, if the emerging Consolidated Revenue were of the order of $479m in the next 10 years, then the unfunded liability would be $4.79 billion. For 20 years, it would be more than $9 billion. This is the logic on which the other States, having made a true actuarial assessment, informed the Committee. I must say that it does worry me that the report brings in the words, `the actuary has examined this'. This raises some pretty serious issues. Perhaps we should be having a word with the Commonwealth Actuary.

          —I note the point that is made. The point is that I cannot see any actuary really giving credence to a fully funded superannuation fund. It is a particular quirk of accounting that is adopted in Queensland, but I think it is a quirk that is not satisfactory in the current debate in relation to unfunded superannuation liabilities. It is one that has to be acknowledged and taken note of. I believe that my statements on this matter during the last few weeks have exploded the myth that has been perpetrated and that Queensland, like all the other States, has superannuation funding liabilities, and the sooner the Queensland Government acknowledges this, the better.

         —The Opposition will be supporting the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1992. The Bill amends the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 to include as a schedule to the Act the agreement made on 11 May this year between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and a number of Premiers and Chief Ministers at a conference in Adelaide.

         The National Road Transport Commission was established early this year following legislation passed through the Parliament in December 1991. The present functions of the Commission are related to obtaining uniformity in road transport. It currently applies only to those vehicles over 4.5 tonnes, also known as heavy vehicles. Its functions include seeking uniform legislation, road charges and road user charges, principles for determining road charges and road user charges, and guidelines for the preparation of regulatory impact statements.

         The additional functions that have been conferred on the Commission by the agreement of 11 May include the extension of the Commission's functions to include light vehicles, those being vehicles below 4.5 tonnes. It also includes: the assembly and publication of information on road related charges applying to light vehicles; assistance in developing indicators for assessing the performance of the road system and matters relating to that performance, such as evaluating the efficiency of our road constructions; the assembly and publication of information on road safety; and the monitoring of the use of alternative fuels.

         The functions of the Commission will not, however, be extended to road charges or economic regulation of the transport industry for light vehicles. Clearly, this Labor Government does not want to lose any of its substantial taxing power over motorists. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has said that the Commission has earned a reputation as a fair and independent body through its formal and informal consultation with both government and industry. Its recommendations on heavy vehicle charges have been received and approved by the ministerial council. The charging determinations have received support from a convincing majority of States. They have also received overwhelming support from the road transport industry, the Business Council of Australia and the Transport Workers Union.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         However, the Government does not feel that this fair and independent body's functions should extend to determining road charges and road user charges into this area of the road transport industry. The Government is clearly not serious about getting as close as possible to the ideal charging system. In the Government's drive to achieve a fair and efficient road transport system, it is not prepared to sacrifice its taxing powers over the road users. Because of this, the charging scheme is not the best that it could possibly be, due to the constraints placed on the Commission by the Labor Government. This clearly shows that the Government is not serious about getting the costs of road transport down. These costs continue to be a burden on business. That is why we address that point with the benefits highlighted under the Fightback package.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is worth noting that in its road user charge the Government has highlighted the fact that the 18c a litre excise is a notional charge, which basically means that it does not have anything whatsoever to do with road construction or road funding in general. It is merely another tactic of the Government to use the road users of Australia as milch cows. The Liberal and National parties believe that the road user charges should go to road funding. This is not the case with the Government's 18c a litre notional charge; it is clearly another general revenue tax to go to Consolidated Revenue.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In addition, the Government has said it will continue to index the tax component. That means it could increase the notional charge within a few years and continue to use road users as a source of general revenue. The Labor Government is retaining the option to increase this notional charge at its discretion. This could mean that the 18c could become 24c or could even go to 30c a litre. If current trends are any indicator, only 5c of that would continue to go to road funding. The Government's record on this issue is nothing short of appalling. As long as this continues, an adequate level of road funding cannot be assured, but an unnecessary burden on the road users to fund the Government's other various expenditures can be.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On the subject of road funding, the Government's record has been much less than commendable. The roads are a major infrastructure asset of our country, especially considering the size of our country and its population spread. This asset requires constant maintenance and upgrading, but the Government's commitment has been less than satisfactory. For all the Government's years in office, excepting 1992-93 since it is an election year and the Government needs votes, road funding has fallen dramatically in real terms.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This funding has fallen despite drastic increases of around 150 per cent in the revenue gained from fuel excise. The $2 billion roads funding program for this year only takes it back to where we were 10 years ago. However, fuel excise revenue will be around $7,300m this year. This means only 27 per cent of the fuel excise that road users pay goes to road funding. This compares with 66.6 per cent of the revenue collected from fuel excise that went to road funding in 1983-84, the year before the Labor Government came into office.

         For a decade now the Government has neglected to provide sufficient funds for the maintenance and upgrading of the Australian road network. The motorists of Australia will not be fooled by the latest increase in road funding by the Government. If Labor has the chance, it will again cut funding, as it has in the past. It is quite apparent that this Government does not care much about roads, except when it comes to an election year. It has allowed roads to deteriorate over the last decade. It cares about roads only in an election year—and it does not look as though it will win this election anyway.

         By not extending the functions of the NRTC to include the determination of charges for light vehicles, the Government has assured us that it will continue taxing motorists blind, regardless of whether those revenues go towards road funding. The coalition has made it clear that it will maintain the current level of road funding and that it will be funded from Consolidated Revenue. The whole Fightback package, of course, is totally funded, which cannot be said for the One Nation statement.

         The NRTC has attempted to do its best to work around the constraints that have been put on it by the Government. The Liberal and National parties were concerned when the legislation was first introduced that the Commission was not given a wide enough range of powers to consider existing taxes that road transport pays. The Commission has basically gone ahead and done some of these things, to the vindication of the coalition, and looked at taxation issues anyway. We are pleased to see that the NRTC will have the power to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of road authorities. This was something that the Liberal and National parties were concerned about right from the beginning.

         The other concern was that the Commission be able to assess the taxes and road related charges that have applied to light vehicles. This would allow for a more uniform and ideal charging system to be applied to this area of the industry. However, the Government has continued to withhold this power from the Commission and constrains its effectiveness in this area. Many commentators—in particular, the Australian Automobile Association—have argued with the coalition that light vehicles be included under the Commission's brief because it is difficult to determine a sensible and uniform charging system as long as the light vehicles are excluded. The Automobile Association supports the legislation but again, as with the Liberal and National parties, is disappointed that the constraints on the Commission remain in place. Clearly, the coalition has led the debate on this issue that has brought about the legislation before us today.

         The coalition will take further steps towards providing fair and equitable taxes for Australian motorists. For too long now, the road users of this country have been milked for taxes to pay for the Government's failed economic policies. The coalition intends to abolish seven other taxes on business in addition to the general revenue tax that the Government highlights as a notional charge—in other words, the fuel excise levy goes. Three other taxes that impact directly on the road transport industry and motorists are the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and customs duty. This will save the road transport industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Furthermore, in the first term of a coalition government, there will be no new road user charges.

         This point has to be made clearly, because people such as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) have been running around the place making all sorts of claims about this hidden tax that was to come out. The shadow Minister, Mr Hawker, has made an announcement that there will be no new road user charges in the first term of a coalition government. A typical road transport operator will save about $44,000 a year under the coalition compared with Labor.

         When one considers its impact on the cost of goods, bearing in mind the size of Australia and the fact that we do transport goods and services over vast distances, one can realise the effect this will have on the cost of goods before they reach the retailer or the consumer. A six-axle articulated truck will pay $4,000 per year in registration—and that is all. There will be no federal fuel tax on business and there is no GST on registration.

         I believe that this is the critical difference between the tired, worn out and failed Labor Government which obviously has no policies whatsoever and the coalition with its Fightback plan. The coalition has a policy, as outlined in Fightback, to remove the fuel excise levy of 26c a litre. The reduction of 26c a litre will apply to every business across this nation. It represents a major reduction in business costs which will have profound multiplier effects, making business more competitive and, more importantly, leading to the creation of thousands of jobs.

         Let us take, for example, a simple thing such as a loaf of bread. The fertiliser delivered to the farmer will be in trucks which are sales tax free, driven by petrol which will be excise free. When the farmer's produce is taken to the market, it will be sales tax and fuel excise free. The primary product will be processed in factories where payroll tax will have been removed and by machinery which will not have import duty on it. When the final product is distributed it will be done sales tax and excise tax free to the retail outlet. The cascading effect of these savings will produce goods which are lower in cost, benefiting not only the exporters but, equally as important, those who compete against imports on the domestic market. If anything has driven the importance of that home, it is the figure released today of some $2 billion of current account deficit.

         I believe that there is no-one in society who does not agree that if we are to get this nation back on track, we must address the structural problems that have caused the economic crisis we are in. The only way to do that is to remove those taxes that those who supply goods into the Australian market do not pay but which our manufacturers, our secondary and tertiary processors, do have to pay. It is like putting them in a race with hobbles on to expect them to compete with importers. It is not a matter of goods coming from countries where there is cheap labour; it is a matter of our manufacturers and producers having to pay these input costs, under this Government, which make it impossible for them to compete on the domestic market. That is the major reason and the major basis for the Fightback program, and a major part of it is the total removal of the fuel excise.

         That, briefly, is the coalition policy. If the Government has a policy, I believe that this is an opportunity to spell it out to the people of Australia who have suffered so much under `the recession we had to have'. As I mentioned earlier today in this chamber in the debate on the urgency motion, it appears that the only thing the Government is offering is more of the same, and that is something that cannot be tolerated, as it would be a disaster for this country.

         —In the introduction to my speech on this particular piece of legislation, I might just pick up on two things which Senator Parer has just said. Firstly, he mentioned the taxes which would be reduced under Fightback and, in particular, the payroll tax. Of course, Senator Parer would know very well, just as every other senator knows, that payroll tax is a State tax. I understand that Mr Kennett is already on record as saying that, given the plight of Victoria, he would be very loath to remove the payroll tax; and I would be very surprised if South Australia was interested in removing the payroll tax because of the parlous state of its economy.

         The second issue that Senator Parer was talking about was Australia's lack of competitiveness in relation to other countries because of the excise on petrol. I think Senator Parer should know as well as any other senator that of all the OECD countries, Australia has the third lowest petrol price and pays the second lowest rate of excise. I find it rather difficult to follow Senator Parer's logic if he suggests that that is a cause of our lack of competitiveness with respect to the other OECD countries.

         The National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill, which we are debating tonight, ratifies the Commonwealth-State agreement on light vehicles—not heavy vehicles—made on 11 May this year. The light vehicles agreement complements the heavy vehicles agreement made last year which instigated the development of nationally uniform road laws for vehicles over 4 1/2 tonnes. The light vehicles agreement recognises that there cannot be nationally uniform road laws for some vehicles and not for others. Again, this marks the difference between the Australian Democrats and the Opposition which wants to refer everything back to State legislation. We recognise that in this area it is very useful to have national roads laws, national registration and a single system by which these things are regulated right across the country.

         However, both these agreements—particularly the light vehicles agreement—ratified in this Bill fall far short of a truly national road law system. The heavy vehicles agreement has already demonstrated the inherent flaws in the new federalism process. National uniformity can only be gained by the enactment by the States and the Commonwealth of identical legislation covering their respective jurisdictions. If one government opts out, uniformity is lost. I stress again that that indicates the inherent flaw in the federalism line being pursued by both the Government and the Opposition in this respect.

         We have already seen New South Wales refuse to accept the National Road Transport Commission's recommended heavy vehicle charges and announce that it will charge up to $3,000 extra for registration fees. The light vehicles agreement also requires the enactment of identical legislation in all jurisdictions to achieve national uniformity. However, it is a much less ambitious agreement than its heavy vehicles counterpart. It stops short of establishing a national car registration scheme, and it completely fails to introduce pay-as-you-drive road use charges for car owners, both of which would be absolutely in line with the declared market philosophy of the Opposition, but one which it fails to recognise.

         This is despite the clear recommendations of the Interstate Commission in its 1990 report on road use charges and vehicle registration that there should be a national registration scheme with registration fees paid by way of increased petrol excise. It is despite more recent hints of support for such a system by the Minister for Resources, Mr Alan Griffiths, and also by the NRMA in New South Wales. No doubt the failure of the light vehicles agreement to lay the groundwork for a pay-as-you-drive national car registration scheme is due in no small part to the intransigence of the States and Territories. However, the Commonwealth is also responsible. It has failed totally to make a strong and public case for a measure which is squarely in the interests of Australia and Australians.

         The Democrats, in our Getting to Work program of economic reform, have costed a pay-as-you-drive—I stress that—national car registration scheme. Under our scheme the States would scrap car registration fees and compulsory third party insurance premiums. The same revenue—and I stress that, because it has been misrepresented repeatedly by the Opposition—which relates to car registration and third party insurance, of about $2.9 billion per year would be collected instead through the petrol pump.

         We estimate that petrol excise would need to rise by 16.5c per litre to provide this $2.9 billion, which would then be channelled back to the States according to the agreed formula. In other words, it would be a completely revenue neutral procedure to do what the Opposition declares is the fundamental basis of its philosophy, namely, user pays—the proper and appropriate allocation of resources, which is at the basis of the market system.

         A formula would have to be found to accommodate private insurers in those States, such as New South Wales, in which they are allowed to offer compulsory third party policies. This could take the form of a rebate to those motorists wishing to take out a private policy. Preferably, it would allow private firms to receive a proportional amount of the petrol excise revenue for each motorist that they insure.

         The advantages of such a scheme are obvious: drivers would pay road charges which were closely related to their actual road use, unlike the present system where one pays full charges even if one's car stays in the garage all year. Of course, many people buy a relatively larger car than they need because of the occasional use they make of that larger vehicle and are then forced to drive that vehicle all the time for purposes for which a much smaller car would be quite adequate, simply because they cannot afford to have a second smaller car and pay something like $600 to $800 per year in registration and third party insurance and simply leave that car in the garage. Under our proposal, the car which stayed in the garage would cost nothing while it was there; it would only cost something while it was being used.

         It would also be impossible to evade registration and compulsory third party insurance charges. Every time one fills the tank, one pays. There would be no financial incentive to leave one's car unregistered. There would no longer be any point registering one's car in another State to avoid charges in one's own State because one would save precisely nothing. Instead of being hit with a bill amounting to several hundred dollars once a year, one's payments would be spread out, avoiding the household cash flow crisis which must affect many people who do not have large incomes, such as pensioners and other people who are in less pecunious circumstances.

One must observe that the Opposition is already on record as saying that the abolition of petrol excise under its Fightback proposal would make the adoption of LPG completely uneconomical. In that connection one can only observe that Australia is very deficient in fuels from which we make petrol but has large amounts of LPG available.

Those who buy larger cars and drive greater distances would have to pay for their greater use of fossil fuel, for the pollution that it causes and for the damage occasioned to the roads. In other words, people on low incomes would generally pay less than people on higher incomes and less than they now pay under the fixed fee systems. For example, a pensioner driving a small car 2,000 kilometres per year would pay the equivalent of around $35 through the petrol pump for registration and compulsory third party insurance.

The coalition has made a great play of its proposal to abolish petrol excise and reduce prices by around 19c per litre and has contrasted its policy with ours in the usual irresponsible vote-buying fashion. However, as usual, it has deliberately and cynically misled the public about the true impact of its Fightback proposals. First, the coalition continually fails to acknowledge that we are the only party proposing to abolish all fixed car charges. Our scheme does not impose an additional impost; it replaces two old charges with a more responsible and equitable system.

Thirdly, the coalition refuses to admit that its policy would cause a massive increase in petrol use, leading in turn to a blow-out in our oil import bill, increased greenhouse gas emissions and even greater health problems in our cities—a burden which is predominantly carried by Australian children.

It is quietly sitting on the fence waiting for disaster to strike. I draw attention to Senator Button's replies to two of my questions last week. In one question I pointed out that 1,500 scientists, including 99 out of 198 living Nobel prize winning scientists, warned that we needed to address as a matter of urgency the problem of greenhouse. Senator Button said in answer to my question that the Government would not change its policy as a result of the urging by those scientists. On the very next day, when I pointed out the rising insurance costs, Senator Button again said that the Government would not change its policy because of rising insurance costs as a consequence of storm damage brought about by greenhouse climate change.

It has also asked for increased frequency, probably for safety of road worthiness checks. Some States, including Western Australia, do not have checks on safety and road worthiness regularly.

I know that the former Prime Minister was prone to saying things off the top of his head, but I do not think even he would have made such an incorrect statement if it were not somewhere near correct. I wish that the NRTC and the Government would stop using as a red herring the fact that there is no database to say that that information is not available.

         Under the proposal of the coalition, on coming into government, an inquiry will be conducted into the taxes paid by the road industry, and that will be reflected in the road user charge coming in in 1996. The shadow Minister, Mr David Hawker, is on record as having said this.

         We are supporting this legislation. The coalition will lessen the load on the road transport sector before 1996 which is when uniform charges, as recommended by the new committee, will be introduced. Many of the taxes will come off on 1 October 1994, such as the 26c per litre. I believe that the big winners will then be road transport and, of course, those people that use its services.

Mr Keating was most intent on introducing a consumption tax in 1985. Of course he was captured and imprisoned by the left wing of his Party; he was not allowed to do it. He now has to suffer the hypocrisy of speaking against the proposal for a consumption tax which he so roundly supported just a few years ago.

It is very unfair and discriminatory against country dwellers that they have to pay 20c a litre for the general revenue—a 20c a litre tax—just for the privilege of living in those areas. Senator Coulter would have them pay an extra 16.5c a litre on top of that.

In spite of the continuing campaign of misinformation being carried on by the Labor Party, particularly the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in this case, we will not be introducing a road user charge in the first term of the Hewson government. We will be slashing transport costs completely. The Liberal and National parties have no new road user charges. A typical road transport operator will save about $44,000 per year under the coalition compared with what is currently paid. This will feed into cheaper prices.

         In my role as the Liberal-National coalition spokesman for local government, I must say that that is a factor that local governments are very keen on. They understand that all of their trucking contractors, and there are a lot of those in local government, will be able to provide councils with much cheaper tender costs because all of those taxes that the truckie-type contractors currently pay—the fuel tax and the sales tax at 20 per cent on their trucks, tyres, windscreens and spare parts—will go. For the big fellows, the payroll tax will go, the training guarantee levy will go, and the superannuation guarantee will be pegged. So contractors will have substantially reduced costs: in the instance I cited, $44,000 for a 500 horsepower articulated rig. With that sort of saving, they can make real reductions in the cost of their businesses and a reduction in the tenders that they offer to councils and other people.

Those benefits and cost reductions will of course flow on to our exports and our means of production. It is a great policy and something that will give a much needed boost to the trucking industry and to those sectors of the Australian economy which produce. In contrast, the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats want only to penalise the trucking industry and the productive sector and use them as a milch cow. The coalition is doing something about it. I am very pleased to be part of a team which has put forward such a far-sighted policy. I support the Bill.

         —As my colleague Senator Macdonald has explained in detail in the last few moments, this evening we have seen the Australian Democrats in their true colours as far as their policies are concerned. Over the last few months we have seen various Democrat senators running around rural South Australia feigning sympathy for rural people; feigning sympathy for farmers who currently find themselves in a disastrous plight because of a combination of dreadful policies from the present Labor Government, a downturn in commodity prices and, in some respects, because of poor seasons.

         That combination of factors, which as I said is, in part, the direct responsibility of this Labor Government, has seen many rural people left in a parlous situation. The Democrats have been running around feigning sympathy for these people and saying that Democrat policies will be of support to them. Yet tonight—and in fact earlier than that—we heard the Democrats, on the other hand, advocating a massive increase in fuel tax. They advocate an additional tax of 16c or so a litre. So the Democrats are telling people out in the electorate one thing and they come into this chamber, where they think people are not listening—as the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) acknowledges too—and say something completely different.

         Of course, in the advocacy of this policy, they fail to recognise that Australia is a country of extremely long distances. Australia is a very large country with a relatively small population, separated by long distances. It is a country in which transport makes up a much higher proportion of the costs of goods in general than is the case in most other countries. That is because, in part, we have an excessive amount of taxation on the road transport industry, including fuel tax. Yet, as we have seen tonight, the Democrats are advocating an additional tax of 16c a litre, which would be an absolute disaster for people living in rural and isolated parts of Australia.

They will have no support whatsoever. They would not be welcome in most of the other larger States with this sort of policy. I think it is incumbent on our side of politics—and it is even incumbent on the Government side of politics—to make the community at large aware of this ridiculous approach to taxation, and to road transport in particular, advocated by the Democrats. As I have said, if they come to Grey—which covers some 87 per cent of South Australia—and spout that nonsense we need have no fear of their winning any votes in that electorate because it is particularly dependent on road transport.

         These comments have been made in the context of the debate this evening on the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1992, which the Opposition will not oppose. It seeks to provide a number of minor amendments to the Road Transport Commission Bill that was passed about a year ago. The major purpose of this legislation is to insert as a schedule to the Act an agreement which was reached earlier this year between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and a number of State Premiers. That agreement, signed by all States and Territories except Western Australia and Tasmania, arose from the urgent need to establish uniform standards for heavy vehicles to replace the differing rules that had existed in the various jurisdictions throughout Australia. This action has been long overdue.

         The coalition strongly opposed the initial National Road Transport Commission legislation which was passed at about this time last year, because we believed that legislation did not give the newly established Road Transport Commission sufficiently wide reference powers to consider the existing taxes that road transport pays. We believe that, under this legislation, some of those reservations which we previously had have been in part, although not completely, addressed. Again, of course, the prevalence of those existing taxes on road transport simply brings into focus the idiocy of the Australian Democrats in proposing that yet another 16.5c a litre be added to the already heavy taxes that exist on fuel.

It is unfortunate that, at a time of deep recession when we need to reform our cost structures, the present Labor Government will not act to slash the cost of road transport as the Liberal and National parties will do when we come into government through the initiatives in our Fightback proposals.

         Under a Hewson coalition government, there will be no new road user charges beyond those that are in the process of being implemented. As a result, a typical road transport operator will save nearly $44,000 per year under a coalition government compared with the cost of operating under the present government. That is largely due to our commitment to completely abolish fuel excise. That will save road transport users 26c a litre. That is an enormous saving when one considers the quantity of fuel which is used by major transport operators. By comparison, the Government is proposing road user charges of $4,000 for a typical truck, plus the continuation of those massive fuel charges of 26c a litre.

This is certainly something that is long overdue. It is a shame that this present Government did not have the fortitude to go all the way and benefit the entire industry as a Hewson-led Liberal-National Party government will, in fact, do. The coalition will certainly not tax to death the road transport industry and, unlike the present Government, it will significantly cut costs with regard to the road transport industry, which even the Prime Minister has admitted has for long paid 3 1/2 times more tax than other industries. The Government's own Inter-State Commission recommended a reduction in the tax burden but, again, the present Government failed to implement that.

         In addition to ensuring that the costs of road transport are substantially reduced, a Hewson government will maintain existing levels of road funding provided from Consolidated Revenue. So there are a number of initiatives which the coalition will take which will improve the operation of road transport in this country. We will reduce significantly the cost of road transport. We will maintain road funding to ensure that there is adequate provision of roads and we will certainly overcome a decade of neglect under this present Government. They are initiatives which Australia desperately needs because, as I said at the outset, road transport in particular makes up a major cost of production in Australia, a major share of the cost of goods, and, if we are going to be internationally competitive, we certainly need to reduce those costs. Although, as I said, we support this legislation, we do so with those caveats and reservations on the lack of initiative on the part of the present Government, which will be addressed by the next government elected, a coalition government.

It also has the greatest task in terms of transport, particularly when it comes to the grain industry, the wool industry and the mining industry. Transport, whether by road or its competitor, rail,  is of enormous significance to Western Australia.

         Much of what I wish to say tonight has already been said by my colleagues, but some of it bears repeating. As I have already mentioned, the major problem with our transport industry in Western Australia, and our road transport industry in particular, is excessive taxing. The principal taxes are payroll tax, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax. Under this Government, these charges have increased consistently, particularly fuel excise and wholesale sales tax. Whether it be carting minerals, stock, grain or anything else that is required, we find that those industries are significantly disadvantaged.

         We saw some of the most ludicrous things being done with stock carting in the amendments to the Sales Tax Act. If a stock crate was fastened to either a truck or a trailer that was being towed, it was exempt from sales tax. But if that stock crate was not part of the truck or trailer, sales tax is paid. It is really incomprehensible that a government could have such anomalies in charging a tax; namely, the wholesale sales tax.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The coalition, when in government, will adopt a very different position. We will remove that anomaly by virtue of the fact that wholesale sales tax will go completely. In addition, fuel excise will go completely, as will payroll tax. I recently discussed the matter of transport with three companies which operate in the road transport area in Western Australia. Their payroll tax bill was in excess of $500,000, which gives us some idea of the impact this tax has on them.

         I will now refer to the taxing of this industry. I am personally involved in grain growing and producing wool and meat for market, whether it be cattle or mutton. Under the coalition policy the saving will be in the order of $1.20 to $1.30 per tonne. When that is added up, there are many thousands of dollars of savings for a typical Western Australian farm. One of the most important things about our ability to compete—some of our ability to compete was blown out of the water today by the irresponsible national strike, which was led by the ACTU—is to keep our costs down so that, when we sell our product internationally, we have an opportunity to maximise our penetration of various markets.

         Under the coalition's plan, which is to change the taxing arrangements which apply to our road transport industry, there will be a direct flow-off to the rail system in Western Australia: payroll tax, fuel excise and wholesale sales tax will go. In addition to that, setting grain freights in Western Australia is done by what is known as a grain freights contract. That is established because Westrail in Western Australian is in a monopoly position in many of the transport areas. It is a fact that there is competition between the two as a defacto result of this contract.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The impact of the Liberal and National parties' transport policies and the removal of these taxes will flow through directly into the rail system. It will also create a reduction in costs of $1.20 to $1.40 per tonne. That will flow directly back to the producers of the various products which are carted on Westrail, giving them the same advantages. While this Bill is about the National Road Transport Commission, it has a much broader impact and effect than on just the transport industry.

          In the remaining few minutes I have to address this Bill, I would like to comment on what Senator Coulter, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, said tonight about increasing fuel excise by 16.5c per litre. If that were put into place—if the Democrats could ever possibly attain power in this country, and heaven forbid that particular occurrence—it would mean that fuel excise, the direct tax by the Federal government, would increase to in excess of 40c per litre. That would put much of Western Australia right out of business. It would certainly mean that our iron ore industry could not compete with Brazil and countries such as that. It would certainly mean that our grain industry, in particular, and our livestock industry, in addition, would almost cease to exist, if that sort of cost burden were put on them.

        He was, of course, referring to the tyranny of distance which then, as now, was one of the greatest challenges faced by Australians seeking to explore and expand into the inland portions of our continent. In the time that has elapsed, that problem has changed very little. It is the enormous difficulty of transporting produce from the areas of regional Australia where it is produced and the cost and the difficulty of bringing consumer items out to regional Australia which are the major impediments to the further development of regional Australia and the further improvement of the  opportunities of people who live in those areas.

         The National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill, addressing, as it does, the issues of national road regulations and national road user charges, is a perfect opportunity to discuss those very important issues and the impact that they have on the lives of the people who live outside our capital cities. As I have said before in this chamber—and it is no news to honourable senators on this side of the chamber—80 per cent of this nation's merchandised export earnings are produced by the one in six Australians who live outside the capital cities.

         If we are to get regional development, if we are to expand industry outside those few cities that scatter the eastern shores of this country, it is absolutely critical that we are able to make genuine improvements in the cost of transport. The cost of transport is a major problem for industries wishing to start up in regional Australia because it means that every single item, every single business input, that gets transported there is hit with the cost of road transport. The more the cost of road transport increases, the more difficult it becomes to generate new industries outside the cities.

         For these reasons, those of us on this side of the chamber in the National and Liberal parties are firmly committed to the abolition of fuel tax. That means a reduction in the operating costs for road transport users of some 26.2c a litre on every single litre of fuel that they use, diesel or petrol. It means an end to the burden of enormous transport costs on developing industries in regional Australia. It means a start to the end of the enormous differences that currently exist between those who live within the cities and those who do not. This is some 2 1/2 years after the first report of the Inter-State Commission came out, the so-called Butcher committee, which recommended massive increases in road user charges. The Government was initially quite willing to support that recommendation.

         It was the National Party, my colleague Senator Boswell and I, who first took up the issue of the Inter-State Commission's report and who first went around regional Australia and said, `Look what will happen to industry in regional Australia if this report is allowed to be put into place'. That is why we were committed then, and we are committed now, to reducing road transport charges throughout this country. I am very pleased to see that the Government recognised the sense of what we were saying and recognised—to the credit of some of the people who sit on the other side of the chamber—that if we are to even out the inequalities that currently exist between people who live in different parts of this country we have to reduce the cost of road transport.

         I ask honourable senators: why is it that in this country industry is concentrated in a few centres whereas in other countries—for example, the United States—industry exists in small towns from one end of the country to the other? The reason for that disparity, of course, is the enormous cost of road transport in Australia which penalises industries that wish to set up outside the major capital cities. Therefore, what we must do, if we are to achieve the full potential of this nation, is to reduce the cost of road transport. That is why we in the National Party are particularly pleased to see that the Fightback package picked up our initiative of the abolition of fuel tax and, on top of that, the abolition of the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax which is currently on the transport industry.

         I recognise the entry into the chamber of my Senate leader, Senator Ron Boswell, who, as I said, was so instrumental in getting the commitment of the coalition to keep road user charges down. It is particularly important because that is a commitment that we will take to the electorate in this election campaign—that after the election there will be no increase in road user charges for heavy vehicles. That is a commitment that those who sit opposite us in this chamber cannot make and have refused to make time and time again. It is not that they have not been challenged to; it is that they cannot make that commitment because they do not have the necessary commitment to developing regional Australia.

         So what we are saying on this side is that we offer an alternative to the continued decline of regional Australia; we offer an alternative to the decline of primary industry which has been massively hit by enormous road user charges—and that is an alternative which will reduce the cost of transport and make feasible again processing and value-adding industries in regional Australia. Most importantly, it is a policy that recognises that a road that goes from the coast to somewhere in inland Queensland does not exist just for the benefit of the people in inland Queensland on one end of it, but that it is of benefit to all Queenslanders, especially when it is used to get our important exports to the coast where they can be shipped overseas to turn around this nation's balance of payments problem. That is why we have a commitment to fund the road system out of the Consolidated Revenue.

         But what we propose on this side of the chamber is an era of development, an opportunity to take the industries out of the cities and back into regional Australia, to take the jobs and the opportunities back into regional Australia. At a time when this Government's failed economic policies have delivered to regional Australia enormously high levels of unemployment—levels that approach 20 per cent, for example, in the seat of Richmond in northern New South Wales—how can this Parliament refuse to do something about the abolition of fuel tax and the reduction of wholesale sales tax on the transport industry? How can we, as senators who represent our States, face our constituents with clear consciences when we go into regional Australia if we allow policies to continue that penalise the people who live outside the capital cities?

         The first point is that the coalition in a statement issued by its shadow Minister, the honourable member for Wannon, on Thursday 29 October, made it very clear indeed that the road user charges it is talking about agreeing to will in fact apply only in the first term of a coalition government, leaving wide open the question as to what happens after that. The reason why that is a matter of concern for those who have some interest in the broad philosophical approach of the coalition is the full cost recovery as enunciated in the Fightback document.

         The coalition has been pursued for some time by the peak bodies which represent the light aircraft industry and the general aviation industry. It took the coalition a very considerable time—about six months—to realise that more than 90 per cent of the fuel excise which is collected on avgas is remitted immediately to the Civil Aviation Authority in direct payment for the services it provides to the general aviation industry. Of course, the coalition was blissfully unaware of that. Having been pursued by the light aircraft peak bodies, the coalition has recently replied to them and told them, in direct contradiction of the policy statement in the Fightback document, that it will be funding the safety regulatory costs to the light aircraft industry from general revenue.

Interestingly, less than a month before, the Leader of the Opposition made it clear that the road user charges, which were then being finally considered by the coalition and announced by the honourable member for Wannon, `will free up that money and have that money available for further cuts in taxation in other areas'.

The first Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992, will bring significant changes to and introduce the concept of offshore banking regulations. There will be changes to the capital gains tax regime, particularly to the notorious terrible twins M6 and M7, and there will be changes to the penalties for late payment of tax and changes to the disability support pension, bereavement payments and changes to the textile clothing and footwear special allowance.

         The new term is `offshore banking'. This refers broadly to the intermediation by a resident institution of financial transactions between non-residents and non-resident lenders. An offshore banking unit or an OBU, as it is more commonly referred to, is the unit within the bank that manages these transactions. Under existing Australian law, an OBU may also borrow from residents in foreign countries but its lending is restricted to non-residents and other OBUs—and this is the significant feature of an OBU transaction. We might recall that in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement earlier this year the Government announced its intention to tax income derived by offshore banking units from borrowing and lending to non-residents at the concessional company income tax rate of only 10 per cent.

         Further, it was decided after extensive consultation with the banking and finance industry to extend the scope of these activities, the income of which would attract the concessional rate. When this Bill was first released, it caused a number of submissions from the industry pointing out the anomalies and inadequacies especially with a number of stated objectives. The Government believes that this Bill will promote the development of a viable offshore banking centre in Australia at a time when activities are likely to be shifted from Hong Kong to elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region as well as helping to integrate Australia more closely with the Asia-Pacific growth economies by becoming the expanded financial centre of the region. The Opposition supports this.

I am also pleased that the Government consulted with several sections of the industry. The Australian Taxation Office and the banking industry met on several occasions to discuss the proposed overseas banking unit legislation.

         However, it has been brought to my attention that in order for an OBU to operate in the most efficient manner a number of small issues still need attention. In order to manage foreign currency trading positions, it is vital that the overseas banking units be allowed to deal with a domestic banking unit or DBU at market rates. The industry has informed me that without this ability to deal between the OBU and the domestic banking unit it is unlikely that the banking industry will be inclined to place significant amounts of business within the OBU. For example, the domestic banking unit would be allowed to trade US dollars and Japanese yen with the overseas banking unit. For this purpose, the bank's treasury division must be considered separate from the overseas banking unit and allowed to trade with the overseas banking unit.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A potential for tax avoidance could arise; however I believe that the case for separation is substantial. The explanatory memorandum clearly states that an OBU is to be treated as if it is a separate bank. Further, section 121C of the legislation allows internal deals between the overseas banking unit and a foreign branch of the same bank. Therefore, to allow the OBU to deal with the domestic banking unit would merely be an extension of the principle to allow for internal deals between the overseas banking unit and the Australian branch of the same bank.

         The coalition intends to move an amendment at the committee stage. We apologise that the initial amendment that was issued related to the second printing and since that time a third printing has been presented to the other chamber. The Opposition will be pursuing only the first amendment, to enable this offset to be made. Without the amendment, the overseas banking unit would not be in a position to offset a currency exposure on a transaction with a non-resident with a hedge taken locally to offset that risk. It is, therefore, an incentive to transact that business in Australia. The Tax Office could be at an auditing disadvantage, particularly if that sort of business were conducted in Singapore, because the secrecy provisions in the banking legislation preclude the passing on of information in respect of a transaction in and out of Singapore.

         Ultimately, the Australian bank must hedge its position back to Australian dollars. A bank could suffer currency risks where it is unable to efficiently manage because of differing tax rules for the OBU versus the domestic banking unit. Therefore, the final Australian dollar hedge will have to be undertaken within the main bank where the OBU has the underlying currency exposure and the main bank has the matching hedge. Each has an exposed position. The logical solution is to permit the overseas banking unit to enter into a hedge with the main bank, the result of the hedge being to close out the exposed position of each of the OBUs and the main bank and to return them both to a fully hedged position. Profit shifting or avoidance schemes will not result. I think this is the fear that the Tax Office had.

         The explanatory memorandum states that the level of penalties associated with the new self-assessment provision will apply where profit shifting has occurred between classes of income with different taxing rights. Under this regime, the maximum penalty will be 90 per cent—quite a deterrent. If the level of penalty is reached, the penalty may include the loss of licence to operate as an OBU. So the loss of an OBU involves the whole of the branch, not just a particular segment.

         The OBU must deal at market rates with its foreign associate companies, foreign branches and, if permitted, the domestic banking unit. If deals between the overseas banking unit and the domestic banking unit are done at off-market rates to shift profits, the penalty that I referred to can be applied where an OBU deals with a foreign branch or a foreign associate at off-market rates. So it is no easier for the overseas banking unit to deal at off-market rates with a domestic bank than it would be for an offshore branch or a subsidiary. Therefore, the Tax Office will be able to audit more easily the deals between the overseas banking units and the domestic banking units than deals in which a counter party is located offshore, because the Tax Office merely has to walk into the local office and examine all the records per se.

         It has also been brought to my attention that, although the Government has had extensive consultations with the banking industry, one other part of the general business community has been ignored.

         The life insurance industry believes that this Bill should have allowed life companies and other relevant funds and management institutions to have some access to the proposed new overseas banking units arrangements on the same basis as banks and foreign exchange dealers. This approach would ensure neutral treatment of different financial institutions and consistency with the Government's objective of promoting Australia as an expanded financial centre for the Asia-Pacific region.

         The rationale for the LIFA approach is based on the following reasons. Firstly, life companies and fund managers generally provide a full range of financial services to non-residents with a particular emphasis on funds management, which is their core business activity. Secondly, the discriminatory application of the proposed tax concession between different institutions will immediately place life offices and other relevant institutions at a competitive disadvantage in the provision of international financial services.

         Thirdly, in the medium term there could be an adverse impact on the competitiveness of life companies in the domestic funds management market. Fourthly, the proposed legislation will encourage the excluded institution to continue to provide international financial services for offshore centres to the detriment of the Australian revenue. Fifthly, a more even-handed approach in this area would enable life companies to compete effectively with both domestic and foreign banks while achieving the Government's objectives of establishing a viable regional financial services sector in Australia.

         The second major issue which is covered by this Bill is the new capital gains tax provisions contained in amendments to those two sections of the Income Tax Act known as the terrible twins, sections 160M(6) and (7). These two sections have been described as unworkable, difficult if not impossible to understand, and unduly complicated, by many tax experts including various High Court judges. It was as a result of the Hepples case decision that the Government was forced to redesign the provisions of sections 160M(6) and M(7). I have raised the difficulties associated with these two sections several times in this chamber and I urge any interested readers or listeners to this debate to pursue this issue because I do not believe the Government has yet got it right.

         The changes before us today can be described as perhaps the most important capital gains tax changes since part IIIA, the capital gains provisions, was introduced. The changes are meant to clarify these two sections, 160M(6) and (7), after the High Court could not agree in the noted Hepples case decision that applied particularly in the area of restrictive covenant payments. The amendments will provide that where a person creates a right in another person, the capital gains provisions can now apply to tax any consideration the person receives for creating that right. For example, the amendments make it clear that a payment received by a person for entering into a restrictive covenant, exclusive trade tie or similar agreement, will now be taxable under the capital gains provisions.

         In June, the Government introduced capital gains tax amendments which are still before Parliament. There has been a surprising silence about their true implications. The explanatory memorandum circulated by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said the amendments "are not expected to have any significant impact on revenue".

         The reason for this extraordinary situation is that the amendments create phantom capital gains. They have a legitimate objective. In past years, a favourite tax ploy was for employees to receive a large lump sum from their employer for an agreement or restrictive covenant not to compete. Such payments are not taxable as ordinary income as they are capital.

         These purported to tax fictional disposals of assets transferred on their creation. The legislative words were fuzzy and mysterious, but they conformed with the verbal formula of the Treasurer's 1985 announcement which referred to disposals of assets.

         There were protests about the retrospective aspect and the obscurity of the legislation. So, after initial intransigence, the law was changed to tax gains on asset creations only from when the legislation was introduced. Then, in the past 12 months, the High Court could not agree which of the terrible twins taxed restrictive covenants. So an employee, Mr Hepples, escaped tax-free. In the meantime, other smart employees jumped into the gap and got tax-free amounts under restrictive covenants.

        The Tax Institute also takes up the theme as to whether or not double taxation is prevented in relation to the disposal of an asset where the disposal gives rise to rights which in themselves are assets for the purposes of part IIIA. The most common example is in the case where a taxpayer has received compensation in relation to the loss or destruction of assets otherwise subject to capital gains liability. The concern is that the legislation is asset specific, not transactions specific.

         With regard to the amended definition of an asset, the Tax Institute further notes that the extension of the amendments to encompass non-proprietary rights is unwarranted and adds a considerable degree of uncertainty to the law.

         This question was dealt with by Parliament in 1986. The measure was passed to impose a tax from that time, but the High Court ruled in the Mutual Pools case in February this year that the original tax had been improperly passed. Consequently, the tax, which had been improperly collected, had to be refunded. This was an extraordinary situation. Special legislation was required to ensure that the person who bore the tax—either the pool builder, the pool purchaser or both jointly—actually received the refund. I do not want to revisit that debate; I simply want to put this legislation in context.

I wonder whether it was not also politically inspired by the leak of the draft document from the Cole committee which canvassed imposing a GST on these and other items. Whatever the reason, we welcome it.

         Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1992 contains a range of income tax measures. A massive reduction in interest rates has meant that the statutory rate of penalty for the late payment of tax and other related penalties, which stands at 20 per cent, is deemed to be too high. This rate is reduced to 16 per cent from 1 October. The 16 per cent rate is high enough to discourage the non-payment of tax but also recognises that the 20 per cent rate is punitive, given current interest rate levels. We also have some technical amendments to the Bill to ensure that when recipients of a disability support pension or other similar benefits reach the age pension age, they will be taxable but will be eligible to receive a pensioner rebate.

         The so-called terrible twins of the capital gains tax, sections 160M(6) and (7), are completely rewritten to overcome what is to many an incredible decision of the High Court—another one—in the Hepples case. The capital gains tax is structured so as to tax assets when they are disposed of. Such a disposal test necessarily contemplates a prior acquisition of the asset. The difference in value between the acquisition and disposal, suitably discounted for inflation during the holding period, is then subject to tax.

         The terrible twins were introduced to cover respectively the situations where, firstly, an asset is created by the act of its disposal, and hence cannot be caught by the general provisions—examples are where a person creates an asset by granting a lease or an option—and, secondly, where certain capital payments are received which would not otherwise be taxed. This applies where an act or transaction takes place in relation to an asset or an event affecting an asset.

         The explanatory memorandum to the original Bill clearly stated the intention that restrictive covenants would be caught, although the Hepples decision means that the provisions have to be amended. The incredible thing about the Hepples case—I think it is unique in Australian tax law history—was that a majority of the High Court judges thought that the amounts in question were properly taxable but they could not agree unanimously on why the amounts were taxable and under which provisions. It sounds like a case of deja vu. Hence, no tax was paid. I will not force the Senate to endure a technical explanation of the new provisions; I merely hope that the new legislation is successful in reaching its target.

         The major matter in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is an initiative from the One Nation statement. This is to provide a concessional income tax regime for offshore banking in Australia. This measure, unlike another one in the news at the moment—the matter of tax deductibility of personal superannuation—has not come out of the blue. Mr Keating looked at it in 1986 when the interest withholding tax was abolished for offshore banking transactions. He rejected it at that time. It has been on the agenda of the banks ever since.

         The actual measures before us are very different from those announced in February. Senator Watson has already explained these in some detail, so I will spare the Senate any repetition. But I do think it is important to get on the record that the original proposals were to be revenue positive to the tune of $5m per year, yet through consultation the range of transactions covered by the concession has been expanded and this Bill is now estimated to cost $30m per annum.

         The proposals relate to offshore banking units or OBUs. I will give honourable senators a piece of historical trivia. In times gone by, it would have been inconceivable that the conservative parties would be supporting legislation introduced by a Labor government to provide a tax preferred status to an OBU. As many honourable senators might be aware, especially those from New South Wales Labor, OBU was a huge issue in the early decades of this century. It referred to the proposal to create one big union which would unite all the workers of the nation and eventually the world. They would then overthrow the evil capitalists and everybody would live happily ever after.

         That OBU was not successful and, unfortunately, the financial OBUs with which this legislation deals have not been successful either. The reason that the Australian OBUs have not been successful is that they are not competing on a level international playing field. Our main regional competitors in this field are Hong Kong and Singapore. Singapore has had a concessional income tax regime for many industries, including financial services, for many years, and they are a shining example of government guidance of successful economic development policies. Hong Kong has always been a low tax jurisdiction. So to compete in the industry we have to have a competitive tax system. Clearly, this Bill will achieve this. The States have also played their part, with the New South Wales Government abolishing some stamp duties and the Victorian Government announcing its intention to do the same.

         In approaching this legislation, the Democrats have had to balance what we see as the disastrous consequences of financial deregulation generally—and speculation—and our opposition to those decisions, with the need to legitimise government intervention in the pursuit of industry policy objectives.

         The Bill deliberately introduces a distortion which is designed to attract financial transactions to Australia which would not otherwise occur here. The reason is to generate employment in the provision of financial services—something Australians are very good at—and to build Australia, most probably Sydney, into an international financial centre. The rapidly approaching reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China creates a great opportunity to poach business and investment, irrespective of the stated intentions of the Chinese Government.

In the course of so doing, I make it clear now that the Government will be moving an amendment, which has been circulated, to the offshore banking units section of the legislation when we get to the committee stage, but first I will deal with the provisions of the legislation.

         The Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill 1992, which is being discussed in conjunction with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), is fundamentally about reimposing the 20 per cent tax on pools constructed in situ. Senator Kernot outlined the history and the rationale. Fundamentally, she did so accurately, and I have nothing to add. It also makes some other changes. I note with amusement her adoption of my bowerbird analogy, and I hope that I never need to use it again. I welcome the support for the Bills, and at this stage there is no need to go further with them. I hope that they get a speedy passage.

         There are, however, some important issues with regard to the capital gains tax section and the offshore banking unit section. I will refer to the capital gains tax section first. It falls into two parts, and I will come back to Mr Lehmann's concerns in a moment. In general, there is some concern that in the course of clarifying the meaning of subsections 160M(6) and 160M(7) we have not made some of the policy changes people would like to have seen made. We had no intention of so doing. It was in no way the intention of these changes; they are intended not to change policy but to clarify the operation of the section as it was always intended to operate prior to the decision of the High Court.

         The object of the original subsections 160M(6) and (7) was to assess capital payments not received as a result of the disposal of an asset. That is really what drives our difference with Mr Lehmann's article. He is sometimes a little iconoclastic, but I understand the problems with people having to write interesting newspaper articles about matters that are arcane and, for most, dry as dust.

         I want to make three points in response. Firstly, it was not intended that the sorts of capital payments that the section was to deal with should be restricted to those mentioned in the original explanatory memorandum. They were examples. The present amendments are designed to clarify the means by which such payments will be assessed. It is a restatement of the general principle in a way that is intended to be, and I think is, clearer. But it is not appropriate—and certainly the Government was not, and is not, attracted to the proposition—that we should move to adopt a list system; that is, we list the payments that are to be covered. The concern would be that that might constitute an invitation to design transactions that are not covered by the list.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problem with purporting to list all that which is covered is that it therefore means that, if something can be developed that does not fit that description, by definition, it is not covered, although the principle may be the same. If we look at the broad question of the way in which the modernisation of the tax Act will develop, as a general approach it is better to go to the principles, rather than to try to cover all the possible examples in the legislation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With regard to the offshore banking units, there has been a lot of discussion in the public and in the Parliament in response to One Nation and, in the nine months subsequently, about the provision. I will not reiterate all that. I strongly support the proposal. I have strongly supported the proposal for six years. Senator Kernot may have touched upon a subliminal reason, some sort of hankering for the international workers of the world to remerge, but I doubt it very much. It is a proposal that I supported when Neville Wran, Nick Whitlam and others were trying to get the proposal up in the early 1980s, without success, and I am pleased that it has succeeded now.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With all such proposals, which I strongly support, there is a question of balance. It does not just mean that, because we wish to see an internationally competitive tax regime in Australia for offshore banking, every change that might be beneficial to offshore banking ought to be done; a balance needs to be struck. The industry has strongly argued that viability of an Australian offshore banking regime depends on Australia's ability to compete on an even footing with other countries in our region that already provide a broad range of concessions. That is broadly true. The Government shares that view, but it is also concerned to balance that by ensuring that Australia's domestic revenue base is protected; that is, we do not go to changes which endanger the revenue beyond that which is necessary to encourage offshore banking. It is a difficult balance to strike. We are moving into a new area and we need to proceed very cautiously and in a very considered way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That essentially underpins the Government's concern about the Opposition's amendment. If I speak on it now, it will save time in the committee stage, when I can be brief. The Government does not accept the proposed amendment. It thinks that there is an unacceptable level of risk that income can be shifted from the 39 per cent tax category to the 10 per cent tax category and, similarly, that losses could be created and applied against the 39 per cent tax category. If this form of internal dealing were allowed, it would be impossible for the Tax Office auditors to check whether transactions were properly booked.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Reserve Bank has given advice that this sort of internal dealing is not necessary in order to enable a bank to effectively manage its currency risk. It has also advised that it would be impracticable to try to monitor whether such transactions were done at market value because normal trade volumes, which are very significant, would make such transactions very difficult to identify. Experienced Tax Office auditors have confirmed that advice. To save some time in the committee stage—although I am sure that I will be able to say some of that again—I just put that on the record now. Senator Watson will still, of course, proceed with his amendment, but that is why the Government is not supporting it.

         I will say something very briefly about the second reading amendment, without taking much time. It seemed to me at first reaction to be a very strange time to be moving it. Apart from the fact that it is a strange time to be moving it at 11 o'clock at night, I rather meant that it is a strange time in the evolution of Australian tax policy. We have before us an example of the approach to which Senator Kernot is referring. In her speech in support of the amendment, she did say, `If you have made this small step, why not take a giant leap?'. That is why the second reading amendment flows from the offshore banking provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4).

         The problem is that there is no necessary correlation between being more interventionist and achieving economic improvement. I have said many times in this Senate—and I repeat now—that I am a long way from being one of the Senate's purists about the interrelationship between tax and industry policy. As with matters of environmental and social policy, when the cost benefit is right I am prepared to look at using the tax system for those other purposes. I have made it clear, and One Nation makes it clear, that the Government is prepared to look at those sorts of initiatives. It has done so with regard to a number of matters flowing from One Nation, most of which have passed this Senate, and once we conclude tonight the offshore banking will have done the same.

         The problem in Australia is that too often we look at the tax system as the first and easiest way to achieve those objectives because, firstly, there is a fascination with tax exemption and, secondly, it is often seen as costless. We make this incentive and there is no government outlay, but there is a cost to revenue. The difficulty is that it is often a cost to revenue that cannot be accurately predicted, as with the assistance to the film industry. So there are cases for being interventionist—whether one would say more or less is a value judgment—and there are cases when the Government should use the tax system or other measures to achieve its economic, environmental and social objectives. I do not think it is a question of saying that it should have general or blanket application. We should make a cost benefit and decide.

         We do not accept the second reading amendment. I think the Government should continue to strike a balance on a rational cost benefit basis about when and if we should use tax policy. I will not refer to whether we should be using industry policy. It is hardly what we should do under a second reading amendment about the tax laws. Whether we should use taxation policy more or less will depend on the circumstances as they arise from time to time. We should continue to give practical application to the cost benefit principles that ought to be applied to deciding whether we will amend the tax policy on any particular occasion. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

It is no easier for the OBU to deal at off market rates with the DBU than it would be with an offshore branch or subsidiary. Furthermore, the ATO will be able to more easily audit deals between the OBU and the DBU than deals where a counterparty is located offshore

         The logical proposition, and this is implied in the explanatory memorandum, is that the DBU can deal with the OBU. From the point of view of anti-avoidance, the explanatory memorandum states that the level of penalties associated with the new provisions are quite severe.

         We pointed out that it is much easier to check those transactions even though they will be technical and voluminous. But there will be very little to check if the Singapore banking legislation forbids the exchange of such information. We believe that such transactions would be more expeditiously carried out here in Australia where the Taxation Office can check the transactions. True, there might be a lot of them, but I venture to say that the transaction would be recorded when the transaction initially takes place and any subsequent creative accounting would be picked up. The penalties for such creative accounting would be very severe. I regret that the Government has taken this, what I call over-cautious approach.

         While I am on my feet I will also refer to the problems of 160M(6) and (7). I did not indicate in my contribution to the second reading debate that I hope that before this Bill receives royal assent the Government will refer these revised provisions to an expert, such as Professor Arnold, in view of the comments from the Tax Institute and Geoffrey Lehmann's article. We have had criticism enough of this Parliament enacting legislation that does not stand up in court. As this is our second attempt at this legislation, and given the fact that there has been severe criticism of it, I believe it is not unreasonable for us to ask for an independent review before this matter receives royal assent.

We believe it is incumbent on the Government—it has been given due warning—to get it right. In view of the provisions of 160M(7) particularly, I call on the Government to issue rulings and determinations immediately to clarify this catch-all provision. I point out that subsections 160M(6) and (7) are the catch-all provisions relating to assessability in the capital gains area. Therefore, it is necessary for these rulings and determinations to be issued.

         I will refer briefly to the reasons why we did not support the Democrats' second reading amendment about a more interventionist approach to taxation policy. Again, we disagree with both the Government and the Democrats. We believe that so many of the problems within the Income Tax Assessment Act—its volume, complexity and its difficulties—have arisen through using the taxation legislation as a vehicle for so many desirable causes of the time. This applies not only to social policy but also to industry policy. Quite often, specific legislation is a much better vehicle for handling such problems. On behalf of the Opposition, I say that we regret that neither the Government nor the Democrats will be supporting our amendment.

         The hardest thing in introducing and explaining new clauses, particularly in complex areas—in this instance tax law, but also in other areas of the law—is to persuade people what will not happen. One can never prove what will not happen and people of imagination are always capable of finding horrors that might flow if certain interpretations were to be taken. In response to that, on the basis of the advice the Government has received, it thinks most of the worst fears that people have about what might happen under 160M(6) and 160M(7) will not eventuate.

         I think that artificially changing the transactions to create a profit shifting on artificial tax loss is not on. The Australian banks have a good record of not being in the practice of tax avoidance. The penalties in this area of profit shifting from the 10 per cent for losses artificially to the 39 per cent regime are very high—90 per cent—and can ultimately lead to the loss of the licence itself, which no bank would be prepared to forgo.

         All these things do involve an element of risk. Senator Kernot indicated how much this would actually cost. I would foresee that the additional business and the revenue derived from it would ultimately offset that loss. Banks, of course, do not enter transactions in the knowledge initially of losing money. Any subsequent bookkeeping entries that might transfer at that loss-profit shifting exercise is simply not on, because of the punitive provisions that are there for so-called profit shifting. The banks would be very remiss if they started to engage in this sort of activity and would be wide open in an audit. If any of these sorts of issues are to be raised, I believe it is a lot easier for the transactions to be carried out in Australia rather than overseas.

        Mr. President, on behalf of the Government I move the amendments being circulated.

        To protect the revenue, the proposed OBU concessional tax regime contains certain interest deeming provisions which relate to the use of borrowed funds to buy shares in a subsidiary.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Their purpose is to prevent tax benefits arising where an Australian parent company gets tax deductions with a tax effect of 39% when it borrows funds and then uses the funds to capitalise a subsidiary, thereby enabling it to derive income taxable at 10% by carrying on offshore banking activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If an OBU subsidiary engages in both domestic activities and offshore banking activities, however, the deeming provision could have an unintended consequence of resulting in a stream of interest being imputed on the funds used in the domestic part of the business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These amendments will ensure that deemed interest income can arise only where paid up capital provided by an Australian parent company is used by the subsidiary in the performance of offshore banking activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr. President, I would make the general comment that the Government's decision to introduce a concessional offshore banking regime in Australia has been applauded by the banking and finance industry.

        These amendments are another example of the Government's willingness to swiftly respond to legitimate industry concerns which are brought to its notice so that we can all get on with the job of establishing Australia as a viable offshore banking centre.
