I am advised that with regard to the effects on State governments, the Federal Government will be discussing this issue with State, Territory and local governments in the context of general purpose funding and the next Premiers Conference.

That is pretty typical of what is happening all around Australia. The question of what separates us from the Opposition is how fairly they are being dealt with. We have a system of supports for people who have been unfairly dismissed. Mr Hannaford, to his credit, in New South Wales is talking now about introducing a legal advice centre to help workers in that State where they have been unfairly dismissed.

         What applies in New South Wales is, unfortunately, typical of what applies everywhere where employment contracts operate. It is certainly typical of New Zealand. The legacy of the Thatcher Government in the United Kingdom is that workers who are unfairly dismissed are thrown upon the common law—law, I might say, that is archaic. In Victoria we now have the spectacle of the Victorian Opposition proposing to dispense with access to the Commission for workers who have been unfairly dismissed. That Opposition's policy provides that a worker will have to pay a $50 filing fee and then prima facie establish an entitlement to be dealt with by the new structure.

         If a worker is not dealt with in that way, he or she will have to go to common law, and we all know that common law is a feast for lawyers. The price of justice at law is excessive and beyond the reach of most ordinary people. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we will not go down that route. We will maintain the awards management branch of our Department, which helps workers in dire straits such as these.

         Mr Howard said that he would stab the Industrial Relations Commission in the stomach. His words were, `I intend to stab them in the stomach'. That is true. As well, if he gets the chance, he will stab in the stomach ordinary Australian workers who have been unfairly dismissed and victimised in their employment. He will do so by cutting the services available to them from the Commonwealth, aimed at helping them to get justice at law. I think that is a shameful circumstance.

         If one looks at the Victorian situation, one sees archaic common law in which workers are regarded as servants or as chattels. At that law they have essentially no rights, but they are enjoined to go to that forum to uphold twentieth century rights of entitlement in order to be respected as employees and have entitlements. If one goes to the common law one is dealing with law which has been overtaken by statute law, which is archaic, which is not applicable to a modern society and for which the odds are stacked against one anyway—unless one is wealthy enough to be able to afford lawyers or QCs to match the fire power of companies able to employ high priced silks or high priced lawyers to protect their interests.

They will continue to be subject to a concessional formula and that is referred to in Mr Dawkins' statement. I am not saying that the motor vehicle industry fleet sales will not be affected but it will still be a concessionally treated fringe benefit. In the next two years companies will have plenty of time to consider this in terms of remuneration packages. The proposals announced yesterday are about introducing further equity and fairness into the tax system; that was the purpose of the fringe benefits change and also the purpose of the new compliance provisions which were introduced.

That difficulty has been overcome by this Parliament, only last week, by its passing a particular measure. We will be reinforcing that by passing in the next few weeks a law dealing with piracy on the high seas and ensuring that there are very high penalties enforceable in Australian courts in relation to that offence. Not only can this offence cause loss of life in waters to our north; it can also disrupt commercial shipping—for example, through the Malacca Straits—which can have a very severe impact on the commercial and trading life of this region.

Does he consider that the tax cuts announced by the Treasurer yesterday are in line with the call for greater equity and fairness made by the Catholic bishops, or with a continuation of economic Darwinism?

I share the general concern and compassion which are expressed in that statement. A lot of the difficulties to which I suspect the bishops were referring have been occasioned by levels of unemployment.

         The honourable senator asked whether the tax cuts are in line with greater equity and so on. The tax cuts which are available to high income earners, those above $50,000, under the Labor Government are equitable right through. Whether you are on $50,000 or $100,000, you will receive the same amount.  In respect of people at the lower end of the income scale, this Government has targeted a whole range of social benefits to assist them.

Those on lower incomes are the beneficiaries of a wide range of other supportive government programs, and that is the reason for the tax scale that was published in the newspapers this morning.

I am disappointed because not only is it profoundly short-sighted; it is also profoundly ignorant. I have given public credit before, and I do so again, to the role the Northern Territory Government has played in spearheading a lot of the emphasis that is now placed on Australia's real place in the world—that is, in the Asia-Pacific region. The Northern Territory Government has done a lot, which is why I am disappointed in the Chief Minister's response.

         His suggestion that we should spend this money on putting SBS into Darwin is also ignorant. Why would we want to spend it twice? The money for SBS in Darwin is fully committed. The transmitters have been ordered from NEC and the antennae have been ordered. The only thing that remains for SBS to be established in Darwin is the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Defence Department that we are having at the moment for the location of the transmission facilities. I really do not see the public benefit in spending the money twice.

         Senator Parer might laugh, but the Government has rejected these suggestions for three fundamental reasons. First, the Opposition's Fightback proposals, when it comes to Administrative Services, are based on a theory espoused by a couple of people whom it cites in the Fightback package—they are a Professor Domberger and a Mr Rimmer. The Opposition claims in the Fightback package that it will achieve savings of some 20 per cent from—as it cites Domberger and Rimmer—commercialisation from competitive tendering. Domberger and Rimmer have said that, but the Opposition takes that one step further. Domberger and Rimmer say the savings are there from competitive tendering.

        The Opposition then goes on to say, `We will privatise; we will sell and we will make bigger savings'. There is a quantum leap which is not supported by the theory on which the Opposition bases its savings. As I say, Domberger and Rimmer cite commercialisation and competitive tendering as being the impetus to savings. The Opposition does not acknowledge that. To reinforce that position, it was only last week that Professor Domberger, in speaking at a conference of managers in Sydney, said:

We have also rejected it because the application of the Opposition policy is dated. If the Opposition were to be honest in its application of its policy to DAS, it would appreciate that by the start of the next financial year 95 per cent of services provided by this Department will be competitively based—they will be commercialised, and they will have to compete with outside tenderers. At the moment 70 per cent are untied. So the Opposition's second fundamental flaw is in the dated application of its philosophy.

She will be the first Australian member ever elected to that Committee. The Committee, which has 18 members, was established in 1976 as the supervisory body for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and it is regarded as the most influential international human rights body. The Committee is empowered to consider reports by the states parties on measures adopted and progress made in observance of the various rights set out in the Covenant. It also issues general recommendations interpreting the contents of the Covenant and, in the case of those states parties, like Australia, which have acceded to the first optional protocol to the Covenant, considers communications from individuals who claim that their rights under the Covenant have been violated and have exhausted all domestic remedies.

         The Committee members are recognised for their competence and experience in the field of human rights and serve as independent experts. Of the 109 states parties which took part in the voting on 10 September, 82 voted for Justice Evatt. This was the most votes received by any of the 19 candidates for the nine vacancies on the Committee. The level of support her candidature received—not only in the vote on that day, but also in the very positive responses to the representations that were made on her behalf by my Department and our missions overseas—was really pretty extraordinary. I think it is fair to say that the result reflects credit not only on Australia's excellent record as a country, and the respect and reputation which we have in human rights matters, but more particularly, on Justice Evatt's own very high personal standing in the international community, not least as a result of her record as one of the most influential members of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women during the last eight years. That record and her election to the Human Rights Committee bring great credit to Justice Evatt and to Australia.

No doubt it has been an exercise of discretion by a departmental officer—certainly not under any political influence—and of course it is exactly the same discretion that was exercised in favour of National Party Ministers who were convicted and imprisoned as a result of corruption charges relating to their term of office as Ministers in the National Party Government of Queensland. So, if what Senator Parer has said is correct, I believe that what we have is an exercise by a departmental officer of a discretion that was properly vested in him; it should not be subject to political influence; and manifestly, because it has been exercised in the way it has in relation to people on all sides of politics, that has been the case in this situation and ought to remain the case.

Secondly, can the Minister explain how funds donated for aid programs operating in countries such as Thailand, which is a country regarded as one of Asia's economic tigers, can be tax deductible whereas funds donated for programs in Russia and the Ukraine, nations in severe decline, are not? Thirdly, would the Minister be prepared to review the tax deductible status for donations to the Aid for Chernobyl Children's Fund and perhaps reassess the classification of the Ukraine as a developing country given its state of economic collapse?

         —The situation is this: tax deductibility for aid purposes in Australia depends on my being able to certify, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, that the country in question is a developing country. The practice has been to treat for this purpose as the definition of `developing country' that adopted by the OECD and the Development Assistance Committee. There has been a long argument going on—for two or three years now—in that committee about whether the countries of eastern Europe, including Ukraine, should be regarded as having developing status. Australia has taken the view that they should not, notwithstanding some obvious arguments that can be put for that status. We believe that to do so would result in a fairly quick and substantial diversion of aid from countries in Africa, Latin America and some parts of Asia, which arguably are in even greater need.

         The reason for that is that a number of western aid donors are, for a whole variety of reasons, rather keen to channel aid into eastern European countries and would do so if these had the developing country status. The donor countries could then claim it as aid and increase their ratio as a result, or have it counted in the aid to GNP ratio, which is the measure of a country's development assistance performance. We have had very strong representations from just about the whole of the developing world against such a re-characterisation.

If not, will the Government consider changing the rules to correct a situation where Mr Keating's purchase in May 1991 for $430,000 of a half ownership of what in six weeks became an $8.4m equity in a piggery group—in which Mr C.

         Government support for that industry has been a vital factor in its growth. That support has been to its export marketing activities, through funds to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and through EMDG grants—$1.13m and $21.6m respectively in the five years to 1990-91. That support has been to research and development by providing over one million dollars a year in research and development grants. Supports consisted of other grants to the industry under the marketing skills program, the innovative agricultural marketing program, and through government-to-government negotiations to improve access for our wine to European and North American markets.

         Industry expectations are that exports will continue to grow. They have set a goal, in fact, for those exports of $1 billion per annum by the year 2000. That will obviously represent an even more dramatic contribution by the industry to our export trade. I think it is also fair to point out in response to the last part of the question that, clearly, the Government's macro-economic policies, including low inflation and low interest rates, have provided a boost to the competitiveness of value-added manufactures generally—which are Australia's fastest growing category of merchandise exports—expanding by 19 per cent during 1991.

         —The question of the taxation treatment of limited partnerships was dealt with at the time of the Budget. It was dealt with because there were, in the view of the Taxation Office and others, substantial opportunities for significant tax evasion inherent in the propositions in terms of limited liability partnerships which were developing. I suppose that that conclusion was reached on the basis of both analysis and theory.

         In so far as any remarks I made in 1990 about the importance of infrastructure spending are concerned, I do not resile from those at all. The One Nation statement devotes very significant amounts of Commonwealth outlays to infrastructure building in road and rail and so on in Australia. True, in the context of Senator Campbell's question, that is public sector expenditure; but public sector expenditure as a proportion of GDP in Australia is low by comparison with many other countries.

With the treatment of limited partnerships with a new tax, what will this Government do to encourage private sector investment, not only in infrastructure but also in research and development and other major developments, at a time of fiscal crisis for State governments and the Federal Government with their not being able to put enough money into infrastructure, which the Minister has already said is running down? Is the Minister really not saying, `We do not want a rundown in the revenue in the next three years, but we are prepared to put up with a rundown in infrastructure in the next 10 years'?

I do not think there is any argument about that. However, I think these days, expecting to place a test, a standard, on commercial television, particularly of raising the community standard of programs, is not a reasonable test. A lot of people want, reasonably enough, from commercial television not to have their standards raised but simply to be entertained. I do not think that is unreasonable.

I ask the Minister: will he categorically deny that this proposal includes a medical `smart card' which would contain the personal medical details of individual Australians? Will the Government take heed of the Privacy Commissioner's call for an investigation into the proposal, as well as his warning that the Health Department should properly inform the Australian public about this proposal? Unlike with the Australia Card and the pharmacy black box proposals, which were shrouded in secrecy and dumped on the laps of an unsuspecting Australian public, will the Government ensure that there is a full and open debate about the need for and the desirability of this computer network.

In order to pay the additional fringe benefits tax, the Queensland Government will now have to look at a further price increase for cigarettes in the State of Queensland. That is a real impost on the ordinary, average person in Queensland. Although, Mr Deputy President, you and I do not smoke, that price increase will affect the working man—all strata of society.

In the Budget which was introduced only four weeks ago, which I thought was supposed to set the financial parameters for the year, an amount of $250m was given to local government, with a lot of fanfare and trumpeting on what marvellous projects that will provide for selected areas, that is, those in marginal Labor seats or in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

So the Government gives with one hand but with the other takes most of that back from local authorities and other levels of government by this new measure.

The only revenue source that government has of its own is rates. So local government will have to increase rates.

They already pay fringe benefits tax on those items and it is a real impost on people living in remote and rural Australia; it is an additional tax for them. This Government's action in increasing the fringe benefits tax on those people is going to be an even greater slug on people in remote and rural Australia. I would hope that every Labor member who represents those people—Mr Hulls, Mr Gayler, Mr Wright in Capricornia—would do something immediately, today, to ensure that this invidious tax on remote Australians is not allowed to proceed.

I am equally concerned with Senator Short in that he identified a great, gaping hole in the amount of revenue that the so-called initiatives announced by Mr Dawkins yesterday are going to raise.

In other words, how did Mr Keating come to be a such a rich man? Does phase 2 of the TFN legislation envisage that it will capture him?

        I asked Senator Button about both the Catholic bishops conference release yesterday and the announcement yesterday of the Government's tax revenue raising measures and the way in which it would spend the money. I share with Senator Macdonald a concern about the fringe benefits tax to the extent that it applies to these remote areas. There does seem to be an anomaly there. In many cases I believe these should not be regarded as benefits. They are necessary—as he says—for people to work in those areas. But having said that, nonetheless the proposal by the Government, to bring the fringe benefits tax into line with the tax rates that would apply if that benefit was given by way of income, is something with which we would not disagree.

         If there is so much revenue to be had in this area, why is the Government waiting until 1994 to introduce these proposals and not introducing them on 1 April next year, which is the commencement of the year for fringe benefits tax? Clearly, there are ways in which this money can be much better spent. There are desperate needs in the community. If revenue can be raised, the Government should set about raising that revenue as quickly as possible. But our principal concern is the way in which the Government, having raised that revenue, is targeting it specifically at those who have incomes between $20,700 and $50,000. It is clearly a vote-buying exercise. It is more blatant than what was going on in Thailand, where people went out and physically bought votes.

         That is what the Government is doing. It does not in any way address the desperate needs of people in the community who are without work; the large numbers of people, probably two million of them, who are in part time work; the large numbers of women in part time work—I think Senator Newman mentioned the number—who are often receiving incomes of less than $20,000; many people in small business, and the many farming families who would fall into that category. There is no benefit whatsoever to those people. That is a further indication that the Government has no interest in addressing the problem of inequity.

         Child-care is another way in which the Government could distribute that money far more equitably. Carers of children are not able to claim as a tax deduction the high costs of child-care. Money could be directed into that area. To encourage people to save, money could be directed into giving tax concessions perhaps on the first $1000 of interest earned on savings. So there are many ways in which the Government could have better and more fairly directed this money. It has not done so. This is clearly a vote-buying exercise, and we totally disagree with it.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) to a question asked by Senator Aulich on 17 September 1992 relating to the Department of Administrative Services.

You hit it with a ball, it falls over, and when it gets up it is ready to be knocked over again. The line that he ran today in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         Let me give the background to why he ran that article. In the Estimates Committee last week I asked the Minister a series of simple questions. One was whether a workshop had been held at Thredbo, one of the good resorts, for senior executives of the Department of Administrative Services, at taxpayers' expense. The answer was yes. I asked why that workshop was held, and I was told, `Because we were reviewing what we did last year and our plans for the future'. I asked whether any aspects of the workshop were devoted to the coalition's Fightback package, and the answer was no.

         My response then was: `If that is the case, how do I have in my possession a document entitled "Thredbo workshop, Fightback, Report to the Minister"?'. When I asked who organised it, the final admission was that it was between the Minister and the Secretary. Here we have taxpayers' money being used to send a group of senior executives in the Public Service to a resort to discuss the coalition's Fightback package. That is the background to this matter. It is yet another effort to come up with these phoney figures.

         I will touch yet again on where the Minister is amiss. He claims that the savings, as outlined by the coalition, of $220m cannot be met. He then makes the bizarre claim that it will, in fact, cost $1 billion. Let us just analyse that very briefly. When it was first mooted that the saving would be about $220m a year, the Minister came in and said, `You cannot do that'. We used the 1990-91 figures because they were actual figures. As anyone would know, with this Government you cannot use Forward Estimates because they have not been accurate for the last 10 years; they are decidedly rubbery. I am glad we did use 1990-91 figures. On the basis of those figures, we talked about downsizing in the Department so that we could get some of the featherbedding out of it. The Minister's immediate reaction was to come back and say, `You cannot claim those savings; we are going to that ourselves'. In fact, in Estimates the other day he said that the Government had saved some $200m.

         Being a responsible Opposition, we have taken the view all the way through that, if the Government does something we approve of, we will support it. That is the view of John Hewson; it is my view, and the view of everyone on this side, and we did support it. The Minister also said that he has cut out 1,700 jobs, and he is right. The Public Sector Union put out a press release yesterday which said that he is going to fire another 2,300. The Minister's actions are costing jobs. Fightback is all about creating jobs.

In fact, Coopers and Lybrand has produced a report, the details of which were given last week in the Estimates Committee hearing, which indicates that the rate of productivity increase in the Department of Administrative Services has been some 5.6 per cent over recent years, as opposed to half that in the public sector, in general, and as opposed to some quarter of that in the private sector.

         Let us go to the substantive point—the analysis of Fightback. It was rather interesting, actually. Senator Lewis was at the Estimates Committee hearing last week. As people would know, we had a whole army of officers there ready to answer questions and they were quite prepared to do so. I was asked whether I had looked at Fightback and whether I had found anything useful in Fightback. I said that I had had a close look at it and that the Department had had a close look at it. There was no idea that we picked up in total. There was one idea that we worked on and that was, of course, the financing of FLEET.

I said, `If you get the answer no, you will be really embarrassed'. To that question, I must say that not one person in the room put a hand up and said, `Yes, I found a gem' or, `I found a beauty'—not one person. The basic difference between the Government's approach to this area and the Opposition's is that we have actually commercialised. We have brought in competition and we have entrenched it to the extent that 75 per cent of services now provided by the Department are on a competitive basis. By 1 July next year that will go to 90 per cent. We have done that. We have reduced by 30 per cent or more the level of staffing in the Department. Does the honourable senator support that?

I found it an exercise in stunning hypocrisy. Like everybody around here, I have been an avid viewer, via the in-house monitor, of the Estimates process. Dozens and dozens of times I have heard Opposition members ask public servants to investigate aspects of the Fightback package. I assume those government employees will be paid by taxpayers' money in doing so. I am not necessarily criticising that as a process, but if it is good enough for Opposition senators as part of the Estimates process to engage in that exercise, then I do not really see any valid basis for Senator Parer's criticism of the process if it is undertaken via a Minister.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in response to a question asked by Senator Michael Baume on 16 September 1992 relating to ministerial disclosure of interests.

        Mr Deputy President, I noted the refusal by Senator Button to indicate that the Government would consider changing the rules to force Mr Keating to come clean on the real nature of his $4.2m equity in his piggery group, all the details of which have emerged only because of my detailed and lengthy searches of company records, which the group was extraordinarily reluctant to lodge with the Australian Securities Commission.

         I have raised this matter of the incredible delays many times in this chamber.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We now know why those delays took place. Many reports from the group are still outstanding in a clear flouting of the ASC's legal requirements. The key point is, though, that Mr Keating simply cannot distance himself from what his half-owned companies do. Yet this basically was his response last night to my comments in the Senate. He tried to distance himself by saying, once again, that he has no links with these companies themselves. He was purporting not to be related to them, although he half-owns them and he has a nominee as a director.

         Instead of dealing with the substance of what I said last night, he limited himself, naturally, to personal abuse. It is really significant. He refused to deal at all with the facts eventually revealed by the Keating companies through the Securities Commission. He did not even try to explain the $1.5m profit shuffle when one of his half-owned companies in the group appears to have earned a profit of $1.5m at the cost of another half-owned company in the group. As my press release said last night, not only has he decided not to deal in any way with the substance of what I raised yesterday, he chose, in fact, to try to attack Dr Hewson through me.

I want to state here, with great vigour: firstly, I stand by all the facts I revealed yesterday, as eventually revealed by the ASC; secondly, I have been pursuing my inquiries into Mr Keating's piggery investment for months, on my own initiative. Not only were my comments and questions yesterday not on Dr Hewson's instructions, but he was totally unaware of them. I suggest that Mr Keating might like to start addressing the substance of these matters, which are very significant indeed.

         Mr Keating may also like to address the incredible situation that Rincraft Pty Ltd—one of his half-owned companies in his piggery group—has net tangible assets of only $175,000 but has been able to borrow $24.8m under the terms of an equitable mortgage from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which has a floating charge over all of its assets. How is it possible that the Keating piggery group has been able to borrow so hugely, at a time when so many farmers are having enormous difficulties getting banks to tide them over in the present economic disaster under this disastrous Keating Government? Perhaps they should all change their names to Keating.

         The Catholic bishops yesterday expressed great concern about wealth disparity in Australia. Cardinal Clancy made a particular point of acknowledging that it is not a crime to be wealthy. There are indeed many generous philanthropists. But I think the essential point is that the community must have confidence in the decision makers, is entitled to know the source of their wealth, and is entitled to know how it comes about that someone can have the capacity to put $400,000-odd into an investment when people in Parliament in most instances are struggling to make ends meet. How on earth can one multiply that by 10 within six weeks? That is a very important public policy issue, which has been totally ignored. I am appalled at the ferocity of Mr Keating's attack on Senator Baume. He displays acute sensitivity and manic determination to intimidate and possibly crucify anyone who disagrees with him.

         The Democrats are absolutely outraged once again at the actions of this Government to use its Commonwealth powers to override, once again, State planning and environment laws. We saw this happen on 18 June this year, when the Government attempted successfully, with the support of the Opposition, to exempt ANSTO from the State planning and environment laws in respect of radioactive waste at Lucas Heights. At that time we were told that this was in the national interest, that it was a special case and that these powers were necessary to ensure that ANSTO was able to fulfil its obligations under the ANSTO Act.

         Now, once again, less than three months later, we see the Government doing exactly the same thing in respect of the Federal Airports Corporation and the requirement of the FAC to potentially produce another environmental impact statement in respect of the third runway. The local community is very concerned about this because they believe that the issue of the dredging of Botany Bay, whereby some 15 million cubic metres of material will be dredged from Botany Bay, was not adequately dealt with by the initial environmental impact statement, and so they have taken action against the FAC at the Land and Environment Court to compel the FAC to fulfil its obligations under the relevant State legislation.

It is just another symptom of this Government's desperation to fast-track projects against community will and against community concern that it has felt the need to bring on these regulations to exempt the FAC from State planning and environment laws that it would otherwise have to adhere to.

I might say that, during that time, there was a constant refrain about the outrage of the States at the Commonwealth overriding their laws. We did that because we upheld the virtues of environmental protection. We did that in Tasmania, at some points against the will of the Tasmanian Government. The dams case is a key example.

         —That may be a slightly more arguable example, but I do not think it can be said that, when wider issues of principle are involved, the Commonwealth should not override those laws of States where the Commonwealth has constitutional authority to do so. Indeed, the Democrats have supported us in doing that on a number of occasions when the Opposition has opposed us in doing that. This is one of those occasions when I think the shoe is on the other foot. It is not appropriate for us in this circumstance to put at risk a Federal project by a Commonwealth authority, given that the environmental assessment of this project has probably been the most complete, the most painstaking and the most thorough environmental assessment ever undertaken in Australia. It was done through the Commonwealth mechanism and not through the State mechanism. However, it should be said that it was done after very close consultation with the State of New South Wales and its relevant department. So in doing it we took into account what would be the outcome and procedures of a State environmental assessment and folded them into our own, in an overarching, one-stop, complete and thorough environmental assessment.

         When it is said that there may be some community concerns about dredging in Botany Bay, it should also be said that all of those concerns have been met, all of those concerns have been analysed and considered, and all of those concerns have been answered in the environmental impact statement that has been provided and following upon the study that has been so completely undertaken. While it may be that, even in the face of the most compelling scientific evidence, some people still harbour doubts, nonetheless governments have to make decisions. We make decisions based on the evidence rather than on dark suspicions or harboured doubts that appear to us to be without foundation or indeed without scientific support.

         So, on the basis of a very thorough and complete environmental assessment, the Commonwealth feels that it is able to proceed to construct the third runway at Sydney airport. This will provide work that will benefit New South Wales citizens and ensure that the most commonly accessed gateway to Australia has modern airport facilities and the bottleneck that is there now is removed, with a concomitant improvement to our tourist industry. In all of these circumstances, while it is the case that Senator Sowada has made a plea to the Government to reconsider our position—and I might say, made an eloquent one—eloquence and plea making on this occasion should not succeed and rationality and commonsense should. This motion should fail.

         —Senator Cook has used a very oblique argument in putting his case and has not really addressed the two central issues raised by Senator Sowada. First, if the Federal Government is going to override the State environmental and planning law it has a responsibility first of all to put in place alternative legislation which adequately guarantees the protection of the environment. As we have seen on other occasions—occasions to which Senator Sowada has referred—that has not happened. I well recall the mess that the Government got into over its telecommunications package of legislation. It sought to override the State planning and environment law and in fact it had not put in place adequate provision and it had to renege on a section of its own legislation because those provisions were not in place. Senator Cook says that, we have often supported the use of Commonwealth powers; that of course is absolutely true. But we support the use of those powers in the protection of the environment. We do not support the use of those powers to override the protection of the environment which is what is happening in this case because the alternative Federal legislation, with respect specifically to the FAC, is not in place.

         The second point which I think lay at the heart of what Senator Sowada was saying was that there is an imminent court case. This is yet another example of the Federal Government seeking to change the rules midstream, to put in place regulations which would do certain things while the court was actually considering a matter. As Senator Sowada quite correctly said, `Let the court decide'. The citizens—with good intention, with honest intention, with a great concern for the environment—have sought to take this matter to court to have it litigated. In the meantime the Federal Government is seeking to overturn that process by changing the rules. That again is quite unconscionable.

Of course, if the Government continues simply to ignore the pleas of the people that are legitimately expressed at great expense through the courts, if it simply overrides those without putting in place alternative environmental protection measures—which, after all, is what the citizens in that area are seeking—the Government will bear the odium of that sort of behaviour. I do not think Senator Cook, in his response to Senator Sowada, adequately addressed either of those issues.

         As I say, we are very much in favour of comprehensive, national legislation to protect the environment; we do not have enough of it. However, in this case, we do not see the national legislation in place and the citizens have sought to use the legislation which was available to them. They have taken the matter to court and the matter should be properly litigated. These attempts to put regulations in the way of that process should not be allowed. The suspension of Standing Orders to debate this matter is an appropriate course to be taken at this time, and not when we resume after a fortnight's break.

        The Social Security Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to changes in the area of Education Leavers Waiting Periods.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill modifies the Education Leavers Waiting Period provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 applicable to education leavers who claim Job Search Allowance or Sickness Allowance. These waiting periods are required to be served before a person can become eligible for those payments from the Department of Social Security.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There has been some concern that young people leaving school must normally serve a 13 week waiting period (or 6 weeks if they are over 21, are partnered or have a dependant child) from the date of claiming income support, the day after they cease studies or the date of registration with the CES (depending on the date of claim). Some ex-students might be disadvantaged if they fail to claim income support as soon as they should, perhaps because they are unaware of available assistance or because they are unsure of their future education plans. The amendments in the Bill will ensure that people claiming Job Search Allowance or Sickness Allowance who have recently left secondary education would be eligible for payment 13 or 6 weeks (whichever period is applicable to the person) from the date of leaving education or from 15 February in the following year, whichever is the earlier.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is considered that the current Education Leavers Waiting Period provisions should also be modified in relation to people who undertake longer term education. Under current arrangements, those who undertake courses of six months or longer face a waiting period if they need to return to DSS income support at the end of the course. The second amendment I propose will waive the waiting period for those who return to income support within 12 months of leaving it. The Government is anxious to encourage young people, particularly secondary school students, to remain in education. This initiative is consistent with that objective.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under current arrangements, those subject to the waiting period can have only full-time employment taken into account in the assessment of a reduction in the waiting period. For each full-time week of work, the waiting period is reduced by a week. It is recognised that young people have reduced opportunities for full-time work especially under current economic conditions. The third element of this package of measures addresses this problem by reducing the waiting period for periods of paid part-time and/or casual work. If the amount of part-time and/or casual work amounts to 35 hours (regarded as one week's full-time work) the employment would be taken into account in reducing the waiting period by one week. If more than 35 hours is worked a further pro-rata reduction in the waiting period will be allowed. If the amount of part-time and casual work amounts to less than 35 hours then the waiting period would not be reduced. It is considered that this initiative will remove any perceived disincentives and encourage young school leavers to test their workforce potential by taking up casual and part-time opportunities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The last element of the waiting period measures affects hardship cases. At present special benefit may be paid in a deferment period to young people in hardship. This involves, among other things, an application and grant for Special Benefit and a subsequent transfer to another payment at the end of the waiting period. The amendment in this Bill would effectively waive the waiting period in such cases. If the young person qualified for Special Benefit in what would otherwise be a waiting period, the waiting period would not apply and the primary allowance would be paid.
       </para>

        The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 will give effect to a change in the payment arrangements for Family Allowance. Family Allowance will be called Family Payment from 1 January 1993.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Following the outstanding success of the Family Allowance bonus paid earlier this year the Government has decided that payments of Family Allowance should be more flexible. The Family Allowance proposal contained in this Bill will enable recipients of that payment as at 1 January next year to request an advance of the payment covering a period of up to six months. The person requesting the advance would be able to receive up to half of the amount that would be paid in respect of what is known as the "first child rate" ($20.90 per fortnight as from 1 January 1993) as a lump sum. The remaining half of the Family Allowance entitlement would continue to be paid fortnightly. The advance is not to be paid in respect of a particular child, rather as an advance of an amount otherwise payable to a family in receipt of Family Allowance. One advance only would be allowed for each six month period.

         If a request for the advance was received, say, in December this year, the person would be able to receive 6 months of half of the Family Allowance first child rate that would have been paid up to 30 June 1993, which will be valued next year at $135.85. At the time of the request the person can opt to have the lump sum advance paid only in respect of the following six months period or on an ongoing basis. If the ongoing option were chosen the person could still contact the Department of Social Security at any time to resume full fortnightly payments which would then recommence at the beginning of the next six months Family Payment advance period.

         This Bill expands the concepts of project schemes in the Principal Act to allow the aggregation of new productive facilities with the expansion, improvement or upgrading of existing productive facilities. This is achieved by introducing two new types of scheme, an "individual project scheme" and a "joint venture project scheme". These schemes allow projects involving new productive facilities to be added to projects involving for example the expansion of existing productive facilities to qualify overall for the development allowance and, in particular, to meet the $50 million threshold test. Projects in such schemes must meet the vertical integration test.

         As a result of the amendments involving single entity project schemes, joint venture project schemes, and projects involving a mixture of acquired and leased assets, a number of consequential changes to other parts of the Act have been necessary, in particular to the "competitiveness test", and the "$50 million threshold test". In addition, consequent upon the amendments allowing a mixture of purchased and leased plant, this Bill permits proposals to incur plant expenditure to count even if the entity has not decided at the relevant time whether to acquire, construct or lease the plant.

         NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL BILL 1992
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health and Medical Research Council is Australia's peak advisory body on public health, health care, health and medical research and health ethics.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Council is one of Australia's great public institutions with a long history. In 1926, following the report of a Royal Commission on Health, a Federal Health Council was established to promote co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States on matters of health.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health and Medical Research Council was established in 1936 by Executive Order and replaced the Federal Health Council. The functions of the first Council, as described by Billy Hughes in his opening address in 1937, were `to promote the health of the people of Australia, to protect them from disease; and to advise, co-ordinate and direct research into the cause of, and cure for those diseases, which levy so heavy a toll upon the community, and which have hitherto baffled medical science.'
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While in essence the functions of Council have changed little, they have been refined over time to reflect the changing nature of the health issues facing Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since its inception in 1936, the advice of the NHMRC has been treated with the highest regard, and a situation exists today where its recommendations and guidelines are adopted nearly automatically in a range of public health areas and it plays a highly influential role in advising on health care practice matters. For example, recently, the NHMRC has provided guidance on matters as diverse as drugs and poisons, child health, communicable diseases, environmental health, ethics, medical and nursing practices, radiation, women's health, public health and psychiatry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1937, Billy Hughes noted that the NHMRC is `national in the broadest sense,' and indeed this remains the case. The States have a high degree of interest and involvement in the Council's public health functions, and NHMRC recommendations are often adopted in State law.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In these circumstances, it becomes increasingly anomalous that the Council is not established by legislation. There can be little doubt that if we were creating such a body today, it would be set up by legislation in the Parliament—to clearly establish its role, its independence and its accountability. During 1990, when the Council was undertaking its regular triennial review, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services had the question of legislation examined and was convinced that the anomalous position of the Council, where it could have been abolished by any Government of the day at the stroke of a pen, needed to be remedied.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health and Medical Research Council should be a creation of the Parliament of Australia, not simply of the executive government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill will provide the NHMRC with a level of power and accountability in keeping with the status it has now achieved. The Council deals with issues that are of direct concern to all Australians in one way or another—from the food we eat to the air we breathe. These issues should continue to be dealt with expertly and impartially and all citizens should be comfortable in the knowledge that the peak body for advising on these matters is beyond interference. Only statutory independence can assure that degree of comfort and confidence for the community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of equal importance, the community is entitled to be confident that such a vital body will operate in a public and open manner and be accountable for its actions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation will enshrine the independence of the Council and define its relationship with the Parliament and the Minister and with the States and Territories.

        The Bill details the role NHMRC will play in advising the Commonwealth and State Governments and the Australian community on health and medical research, public health, health care and health ethics. The principal functions given to the Council in the Bill are:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         (a) to inquire into, to advise and issue guidelines and to make recommendations on the improvement of health; and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease; the provision of health care; public health research and medical research; and ethical issues relating to health; and
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         (b) to make recommendations to the Commonwealth on expenditure on public health research and medical research.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The composition of NHMRC is covered in the Bill. Over the years, in keeping with the changing nature of community interest, and expectations of participation, in health matters, the Council and its committees have been expanded beyond solely an expert group. That health was too important to be left entirely to the professions was recognised at the time of the creation of the Council as its membership then included `an eminent layman and laywoman.'
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Included on Council as defined in the Bill are members with stipulated backgrounds and knowledge in the fields of medical standards and post-graduate medical training; health care training; the medical profession; the nursing profession; the trade union movement; business; consumer issues; social welfare services; and environment issues. Also included are representatives from each State or Territory, and a nominee of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The wide range of professions and expertise on Council reflects what the community sees as being of importance in health and medical issues. Further, no appointment to the Council can be made without adherence to consultative arrangements detailed in the Bill. The Minister is required to call for nominees from appropriate peak bodies or organisations, the nature of which is to be in keeping with the background and knowledge expected of the appointee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Until 1988, the Council was chaired by the Secretary to the Commonwealth Department. Since that time, independent chairs have been appointed—first Professor John Chalmers and at present Dr Diana Horvath. I expect that this new tradition of having independent and highly distinguished chairs will continue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the Bill allows for the Minister to give general directions to the Council and to refer matters to it, the Minister is expressly prevented from directing the Council in its allocation of research funding to particular persons or organisations or from directing it on scientific, technical or ethical issues. The Council has an unfettered power to publish reports on matters within its functions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also requires the NHMRC to prepare a triennial strategic plan in consultation with the Minister, for tabling in Parliament. The strategic plan sets out the Council's assessment of the major national health issues and describes how it proposes to perform its functions in dealing with those issues. The plan will also include a strategy for health and medical research. I hope that the occasion of tabling the Council's strategic plan each three years will enable the Parliament to have an informed debate on health in Australia.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Much of the work of the Council is first carried out within its principal committees. The Bill allows for the creation of principal committees by the Minister on the advice of the Council and it preserves for the present the existing principal committees: the Public Health Committee; the Health Care Committee; the Medical Research and Public Health Research and Development Committees and the Australian Health Ethics Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Increasingly over recent years, the Council has been opening up its processes and procedures to public participation. For example, the twice yearly sessions of the Council are open to the media. The Bill states the intention of the Parliament that the Council, as far as practicable, adopt a policy of public consultation in relation to matters being considered by it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, the Bill details a comprehensive consultative process for the Council to abide by when it is considering the issuing of guidelines or the making of recommendations on matters which will be implemented in State legislation. This process of public consultation reflects the highly authoritative nature of the Council's work in such areas. It will first be required to publish the fact that it is proposing to issue guidelines or make regulatory recommendations and to seek submissions and then to publish and seek comment on the draft guidelines or recommendations. The Council must produce and publish procedures to assist persons or bodies to present submissions regarding proposed recommendations or guidelines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This approach to public consultation reflects the advice of the Administrative Review Council which examined the work of the NHMRC in 1990. It is also consistent with the present practice of the Council.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Also arising from the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council, the Bill prescribes that a position of Commissioner of Complaints is to be established to consider grievances relating to the disbursement of medical and health research grants. The Commissioner will not be reviewing cases on their scientific merits—it will always be the case that some good science will not be able to be funded. Rather the Commissioner will examine the process adopted to see if any fault of process resulted in the aggrieved decision. I do not expect the Commissioner to be a particularly busy position—at present there are only a few complaints a year and these are usually well dealt with by the research committees of the Council. Nevertheless, the position of Commissioner will be a guarantee of the fairness and integrity of the system.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill details the relationship between the NHMRC and the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The Bill provides for the staff and running costs of NHMRC to be provided by arrangement between the chair of Council and the Secretary to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Although the NHMRC will become a statutory authority, there will be no implications for its administrative and secretariat staff. The NHMRC will continue to rely on the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services for its staffing support.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also includes arrangements for funding research, and in doing so replaces the provisions of the Medical Research Endowment Act 1937, which is to be repealed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Establishing the NHMRC as a statutory body is, of itself, cost-neutral. Any additional minor expenditure arising from the formal operations of the public consultative functions and the operations of the Commissioner will be absorbed within existing budget levels.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Health and Medical Research Council is a vital working asset for the Australian people and one of the most effective examples of working federalism. It has relied on, and will continue to rely on, the efforts of a great many dedicated and professional men and women who bring an astonishing array of expertise and background to the Council and its committees. Australia derives great benefits from their services—given for very little personal return. I believe that this Bill at last recognises their efforts by putting the Council in its right place—as a creation of the Parliament of Australia.

         —In my six years in this place—it was six years yesterday—I have risen to speak on the adjournment no more than two or three times. I do so today because I have had brought before me a matter of great concern to me and a matter, I believe, of some urgency. It relates to the Women's Refuges and Associated Domestic Violence Services in my home State of Victoria. Victorian refuges are funded as part of the supported assistance accommodation program, or SAAP, which is a joint Commonwealth-State initiative, and thus this issue is of relevance to us here in the Federal Parliament.

         Members of the Victorian Women's Refuges and Associated Domestic Violence Services visited my office in Melbourne last week, expressing deep concern about the future of refuges in Victoria. At present in Victoria and, I have no doubt, in all other States the number of refuges and places in those refuges falls far short of the real and, regrettably, increasing needs. The women who visited me were expressing deep concern in particular about the fate of refuges and the associated services should a Kennett coalition government be elected in Victoria on 3 October.

        BY DEFINITION, "a victim of Domestic Violence is an individual who, at the hands of a partner, has suffered persistent verbal, economic, social, sexual or physical abuse which has sustained emotional and/or psychological effects.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Major studies of Domestic Violence have indicated that this individual is much more likely to be female than male. In fact from a mid-80's paper entitled "Police Response To Domestic Violence" we see that 75% of murdered women are killed by a husband or partner. Family violence has not decreased and a woman is far more likely to be a victim of serious assault in her own home than anywhere else.

        Quite obviously, the children involved in these situations are equally affected but in a manner over which they have no control. These effects are long term and can result in learned behaviour which can perpetuate the violence from the point of view of both inappropriate submission or domination.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Research shows that women and children in these situations go through a number of "stages of fear", each stage increasing the domination and reducing their self-esteem to the point where it requires considerable effort and a great deal of courage to leave. When such a decision is taken it is imperative that they have a safe and neutral place with informed support in which to consider their options.

        HISTORY OF REFUGES.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was the prevalence of situations such as those above that led to the establishment of womens refuges in the mid-1970's. Brenda House has operated in this field since 1978 and has been able to assist many families to explore their options and determine new directions. Principally, the purpose of a refuge is to provide support and short-term accommodation for single women and women with children from critical domestic violence situations. Often, it is not a good idea for these people to move in with family or friends, however supportive, as in many cases this only compounds the problem and widens the circle of abuse. A refuge provides a neutral point where the woman concerned can try to be objective about her situation and that of her family.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many refuges were set up independently from a variety of directions to meet these needs in their own communities. Since that time refuges have grouped together under one funding umbrella and with the support of both political parties have formed a statewide network to support women and children in family trauma. We are currently funded as part of the Supported Assistance Accommodation Program (SAAP) which is a Commonwealth/State initiative and look forward to future well informed support from the next Government.

        FINDING A REFUGE

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Women escaping from violence and requiring refuge support can telephone the Womens Refuge Referral Service which has a number listed in the emergency pages—329 8433. Refuge Referrals keep a record of room available in refuges and the criteria for entry—basically, women must be escaping an abusive partner and have need of the high security of address offered by refuges. They are not able to be accommodated in areas which are considered "unsafe" (i.e. areas near their home, relatives or workplaces) and are best supported when the fear of being followed and further abused is decreased. Such fear is incredibly debilitating and can lessen the ability to consider options rationally to the benefit of all. Refuge Referrals accept calls from women with a wide variety of concerns including family violence, the law, housing, health and others. They are a service that will speak to each woman as needed, offer them information and options and allow them to make up their own minds—it is often critical to positive outcomes that a woman really "owns" the decision to leave. If the woman decides to leave Refuge Referrals will attempt to find refuge or at least temporary emergency accommodation. As the public contact point for refuges they also take calls from and liaise with Police, social workers, community workers etc. The task of Refuge Referrals is becoming increasingly difficult with family violence on the increase and women staying in refuge longer due to the shortage of public and affordable private rental.

        Refuges can be found in ordinary suburban homes where children can attend our supportive local schools and kindergartens. Our property has four bedrooms and can accommodate up to 18 people. Families have their own bedrooms and share the care of the common areas. They are encouraged to treat the refuge as just that—an escape from danger with space to think, re-establish links with their children and the opportunity to consider options for a stable future. Refuge workers are on the premises from 9-5 to listen, provide information and support and accompany women to doctors, Social Security, CES, solicitors, courts and housing options. We encourage renewed trust in the children, are aware of and provide for their emotional and physical needs, provide cultural support to the many ethnic residents, encourage independence of spirit and emotional support to increase self-esteem. After hours workers rotate to carry an emergency pager and respond to crises. Most women come to refuge with no financial resources. We are able to provide them with basic food and, where necessary, clothing during their time in refuge. Refuge workers are not in the business of breaking up partnerships. Domestic Violence is a criminal act and workers strive to assist women and children involved to the best possible outcomes within the bounds of personal wishes and legal and wider community parameters.

        REFUGES AS A STATEWIDE SERVICE/ SECURITY OF ADDRESS

        As stated previously and for their safety, it is aimed to physically and geographically separate women and children from their violent situations as much as possible. Thus women within your area and electorate will be best served and protected by refuges in other areas. Recognition of the refuge program as a statewide network is essential to the ongoing success of the program and the best provision of service to our service users. This must be viewed in conjunction with and as complimentary to our associated services who can operate regionally. Thus, we urgently request your support for the statewide nature of our service and for the continued security of address i.e. the address of high security refuges is not made public. The security of address of refuge services has had advantages and disadvantages. The main and most obvious advantage is the safety of the families we support and the safety of the workers. This is absolutely paramount as many partners are violent to the point where they will pull many strings to find their families in retaliation following family crises—women have been killed in other states where this security is not provided. A disadvantage of security of address is the fact that the public is not aware of the real need and purposes of refuge and the level of success of improving quality of life for these families. It is this lack of knowledge that we are currently trying to address

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The umbrella of Domestic Violence support was increased with the introduction of outreach services in the late 1980's. These services were submitted for and associated with existing refuges. Workers in these services have a public address and actually work with women and children in difficult situations in their own homes but not with the same need of escape. The introduction of Intervention Orders has given women such as these added protection but does not provide for all situations. These orders are easily abused and do not recognise family violence as a criminal act. Should the need arise to escape outreach workers will seek refuge support. Possible situations such as these also emphasise the need for two-worker outreach services for their workers' protection. Refuge services, outreach services and resource centres all meet different needs within the overall framework of Domestic Violence and liaise with each other for the benefit of the program and its users.

        STATISTICS DEMONSTRATING CURRENT PROVISION OF REFUGE.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Data recently provided by Refuge Referrals demonstrates that the need for Domestic Violence services is ever-increasing and must be sustained. It is a sad indictment on our society that times of economic crisis show a real increase in family violence. In 1991, Refuge Referrals received 4128 requests for accommodation. 2789 of these calls were requests for refuge accommodation. Of these, 524 women were able to be accommodated mainly in metropolitan services. In addition to this country refuges may also take referrals from other rural services. A high percentage of women accommodated were families of ethnic origin also requiring cultural support. Recent statistics demonstrate the numbers of women placed and not placed 1984-1991. In 1984, 50 per cent of women requesting refuge were placed. In 1991 the families placed had reduced to 15 per cent. These figures reflect two aspects: (a) community education has raised awareness of Domestic Violence and more women are requesting support and (b) the reasons for not placing a family are varied—mainly the refuges are full, other families do no have the need of security of address and are more suited to Outreach intervention and others are simply too scared to leave. It must also be recognised that shortage of affordable housing keeps families in refuge longer and so reduces the numbers supported.

        Our vision for the future for the decrease of Domestic Violence lies with Community Education on all fronts—the Police, community and health workers, legal entities, general public and most important, the children. As women pass through the Domestic Violence network they become more aware of what can be considered acceptable behaviour and what they will tolerate. However it is in the ongoing education of the next generation that important differences can be made. We are funded as Community Development Workers and we are striving to support the women and children who so desperately need refuge and at the same time networking with the community, particularly the schools. We have had a very positive response to a number of talks given to date and will aim to increase our profile in the future to provide avenues for positive interaction.

         I do not want to see the situation arise here in Australia which has arisen in New Zealand whereby a public appeal for funds has become necessary and has been undertaken. That appeal is using graphic pictures of battered women and crying children—victims of the domestic violence which the refuges seek to remove women and children from. The dignity of these women is one of the things that is so quickly lost. Victims of violence suffer in this area sufficiently without this kind of demeaning campaign being made necessary. That dignity is regained only through the sort of work that goes on in refuges and their associated services by the very women who visited me.

It is something that must not happen here. I appeal to my parliamentary colleagues—State and Federal—to acquaint themselves with the way that refuges work and with the processes and to understand their enormous value to our society and to the individual women and children concerned.

        That statement, obviously issued by the Prime Minister, is in direct conflict with an answer to a question that I asked Senator Button on 17 June. Senator Button said:

         Senator Button is a straight shooter. Everyone here would acknowledge that. I do not think that he would mislead the Senate. That leads me to the inescapable conclusion that Mr Keating is in error. I will read from a document that I have obtained under freedom of information. It is a briefing note to Senator Button. It says:

        I understand these two gentleman are also associated with Danpork and it is because of this association that I stated yesterday that there had been discussions between AQIS and Danpork.

       <para>
        So if there is any further proof required, it is in the briefing note that Senator Button, I suspect, obtained from the Prime Minister's office. In the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Age
        </emphasis>
        article it also says that Mr Keating said that the joint venture had not been subject to any ministerial talks. We have evidence of a letter from AQIS which said that there were ministerial discussions. That letter was withdrawn six or eight weeks later. It was stated that there had been a mistake and that there had been no ministerial discussions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other point that Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, raised is that the joint venture had not involved the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, and that it had not applied to bring in pig breeding material or live pigs. Yesterday, Senator O'Chee tabled a paper which said, in effect, that AQIS had been required to investigate breeding material and live pigs to be imported into Australia. The outward cablegram is dated 7 July 1992. I will read the relevant passage:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        AQIS has been approached by the Danish Government and the Confederation of Danish industries to undertake assessment of imports for live pigs and pig semen. Higher priority was, until recently, being placed on these tasks as imports of genetic material were linked to a joint venture proposal between Australia and Danish industry that was being forged during 1991/92.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am only aware of one joint proposal between the Danes and Australia, that is, the proposal by Danpork which the Prime Minister has significant interest in. On 5 March there was a telex from an officer of the Department of Primary Industries, whose name has been blanked out. The telex or telegram of 5 March 1991 was about the animal quarantine imports protocols in AQIS Bulletin No. 3, Volume 1, of February 1991. On page 6, in reference to pigs from Denmark, he said, `Could you please tell me why does this have priority?'. So on 5 March 1991 there was pressure being applied to officers to give the importation of live pigs priority.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator O'Chee and I, in June 1992, started to pursue in the Senate the question of the importation of live pigs, breeding material, embryos and semen. On 19 June we made a request under the freedom of information legislation. Now we have a cable dated 7 July, saying, in effect, `Don't worry about the high priority. It is off now'.

         I want to say very conclusively that there is a discrepancy between what the Prime Minister has said, what Senator Button has said, what Senator Button's briefing note has said and the cablegram that has been directed to Canberra from Brussels. There is a discrepancy in that it is stated that there was high priority to bring in live pig semen, embryos and live pigs from Denmark. Mr Keating's explanation to the

The papers have been tabled to show where he is in conflict. Senator Button has given an answer to a question that does not square with what the Prime Minister has said. This deserves a full explanation and I hope that we will see one.

         This Government did not even have the courtesy to contact the owner of the quarry, Mr Ray Bender, personally, with a closure notice.

         However, four years later this official and conclusive assurance has been repudiated. A promise which seemed so secure has now been broken.

         However, I would like to highlight one particular sentence which I have already stated. The Cook-Groom agreement provides that the quarry should continue within acceptable limits. That is the area I wish to emphasise:

        Mrs Kelly now says the Commonwealth has no legal obligation to pay compensation, only a political obligation. No explanation has been given of what is meant by a `political obligation', unless it means vote buying. Further, the quarry has been closed with Mrs Kelly's statement:

         To add insult to injury, the Government has stated that the five workers are to receive full redundancy entitlements, which all sounds very well when reported by the media throughout Australia. For example, the

On first reading of these articles the indication is that the Federal Government would provide the compensation even though it is not stated. The irony of the whole affair is that the owner of the quarry, Mr Ray Bender, has had to pay the redundancy payments costing over $68,000. So is it any wonder that Mr Bender perceives that the whole event is a means of ushering into Australia an era of eco-fascism.

        The Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association has written to me specifically outlining the direct consequences of this quarry on its industry. A supply of high quality crushed limestone at an economic cost to these growers has now been denied to this industry as a result of the closure. The increased use of lime to optimise soil pH levels has enabled this group of growers gradually to reduce the use of broad range fertilisers and chemicals.

         Therefore I feel it is urgent that this Government re-examine its decision of lack of compensation to date for the closure of this quarry. Only by paying an adequate compensation will justice be served. I welcome contributions from both Senator Cook and Senator Tate about this important issue and this unprecedented move.

I know through talking to my State colleagues over the years I have been in this place that they have a fair amount of respect for Senator Cook and some of the arrangements and agreements he made on other matters down there and on forestry in particular.

         I too have received much correspondence from orchardists, horticulturalists and graziers who are very concerned about the extra costs of bringing limestone from the nearest place, Lilydale, which is over 200 kilometres away. Pasminco EZ, which relies on it most strongly, is one of our major industries in the south of the State. Senator Tate would know that anything that affects Pasminco EZ certainly has a detrimental effect on Hobart. It has severe ramifications, not only for one of our major secondary industries, but also for quite a few primary industries.

         There is an extra cost involved in bringing limestone from Lilydale and it is not even known yet whether that limestone will be of high enough quality to be of use to Pasminco EZ. So one has to ask the question, `What if it is not suitable? Where is the high grade limestone going to come from?'. It has been suggested that it may come from Maydena. That is a town that has very high unemployment, as Senator Tate would know. There have been propositions mooted from that area. If I were Ray Bender, there is no way I would even consider speculating one dollar in trying to go anywhere else given the uncertainty of the Federal Government's attitude, not only to forestry, but also to mining and all other resource based industries in Tasmania.

         We have already heard this morning from Senator Bell of the Democrats' attitude to mining in some of the National Estate areas down there. He has come out very strongly in condemning what I think is a great agreement which was reached with the Tasmanian Government and the mining people only yesterday. The worst thing out of this whole deal—if one can call it a deal; it was an agreement that Senator Cook and Ray Groom had back in 1988—was that Mrs Kelly continued to have negotiations with the State Government. I know this because I have had conversations with the Minister down there. Three weeks before she pulled the pin on the whole issue on 20 August she was having discussions. She had arranged with the Governor-General to have the proclamation closing the quarry signed three weeks beforehand. So she never had any intention of negotiating; the discussions she had with the State Government down there were all just window dressing. The Minister knows that three weeks is right. Three weeks beforehand she had a proclamation signed by the Governor-General to close that quarry. That is absolutely disgraceful.

        End of story. Where are the inaccuracies in this story? The inaccuracies in this story are multitudinous and I intend to address just some of them. First, the final comment in there was that this company has not been in contact with AQIS. That is quite simply not the case. The cablegram that I tabled in the Senate the other day makes it very clear that the reason why the review of the protocols regarding the importation of live pigs and genetic material had been made a priority issue was because of the Danish-Australian joint venture company in which Mr Keating had an interest. Danpork, of course, was the other half of the joint venture company. Incidentally, Danpork is tied up with the Federation of Danish Industries; Danpork is a consortium company made up of a number of Danish players in the pork industry.

         It is very clearly the case, from the cablegram dated 7 July 1992, that it was that joint venture company—unless of course Senator Cook wishes to tell me about some other joint venture company between Danish interests and Australian interests—which was involved in the discussions with AQIS, and it is the one in which the Prime Minister has a substantial interest. Quite clearly, on the basis of that, either the Prime Minister has misled the newspaper or this cablegram is wrong, and the statements made in this chamber by Senator Button are wrong. And I would prefer to give Senator Button the benefit of the doubt.

         The inference from this newspaper statement or rather the statement that the Prime Minister forced on the newspaper, in saying that the company is not intending to import any pigs or breeding material and has not applied to do so, is that it never intended to do so. That is quite clearly garbage. We have already seen from this cablegram that immense pressure was being placed on AQIS to review the protocols. In the answer that he gave to Senator Boswell on 17 June, Senator Button said:

        This has led to the quarantine service telling the company that appropriate protocols would have to be developed if such imports were to take place. I understand that the Danpork company has now advised the quarantine service that it intends utilising the breeding qualities of Australian pigs, realising that it may not be appropriate to use its own stock.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was only after we started raising this issue in the Senate and trying to make this Government accountable, and only after the political heat got too much, that Danpork and its joint venture partners—one of whom happens to indirectly be the Prime Minister—decided that they were not going to attempt to import any breeding material. It is technically correct, of course, that at no point did the joint venture make the application. But there were certainly numerous strong expressions of interest. There were numerous discussions between Danpork and AQIS that made it quite clear that that was its intention—to import the breeding material.

         I am going to go into that a little bit. I have a little story to tell here—a very interesting story. It is worth noting that even when we went to the Department—I was very appreciative of the opportunity to go there—we were able to point out some mistakes that should have been obvious to Blind Freddy. We pointed them out to the Department. But that was not all.

         It required the calling in of Price Waterhouse because people within the Minister's responsibility could not add up. I am going to be generous and give them the benefit of the doubt, but when that original statement was put down here it was done in such a way as to make it appear that the Department owed the BLF money. In fact, what the Department did was to overclaim. As well as the other mistakes that were there, there was an overclaim on the moneys it called back from the WA branch of the BLF. That appeared in the press and elsewhere in association with the name of Senator Peter Cook, Minister for Industrial Relations. As I have said, I am going to give the departmental people the benefit of the doubt, taking it that they could not add up, but it makes me wonder.

         Not only has it been revealed that they could not add up but also an air fare from Perth to Sydney is reimbursed when the meeting is held in Melbourne. An air fare from Perth to Sydney is reimbursed when the meeting is held in Canberra. I have the minutes here and I want to deal with them in a moment. They have been tabled here or before an Estimates committee. Those minutes state quite clearly that the claims were to be paid on the basis of economy air fares, not business class air fares. The Minister is now leaving the Chamber. That is worth noting. As one works through this sad and sorry episode and the incompetence that has occurred, one has to ask how far this extends into the operations of the Department of Industrial Relations.

No mistakes there.

         Then we look at the first minute, that of 13 February 1991. It states quite clearly that reimbursement is only for air fares. There is no written instruction—the Department could not deliver one at Estimates the other night—by which that was changed. Yet we find that accommodation was paid for until we get to 29 October 1991, and then we find in the minute of that date that it also includes accommodation costs in the case of Western Australian members.

When we look at the situation which exists with WABAG and WATUAG—I will come back to my original question in a moment—we find that there are quite clear definite guidelines which spell out what will be paid and what will not be paid.

         Let us look a little further, because it is all very instructive and interesting, at where I got the basis for the original question. This highlights to me that somebody in the Minister's Department or in his office had had enough of what was going on, because on or about 14 June these documents from which I asked the question were left in my office. I believe they were deliberately left there because there was somebody in the Department or in his office who wanted to do the decent and honest thing and have what was going on exposed. The people who work in these departments and in his office are not stupid people; they would have recognised—

They would have recognised that airfares are not paid to Sydney when the meeting was held in Melbourne or Canberra, or business class airfares are not paid when the minute states absolutely clearly that they are economy fares. This is not an argument, as the Minister tried to elicit in the Estimates the other night, as to whether or not Western Australians, because of the distance they have to travel and the fact that they have to stay overnight, should have their accommodation paid. I would certainly support that proposition. The proposition that I put here is that, when a Minister delivers a minute to his Department, it is not only up to the Department to carry out that instruction, unless it is changed in writing, but it is also up to him to be aware of what is going on in terms of these things, particularly as I raised this question as far back as 25 June or thereabouts. So it throws up a whole host of additional questions.

         I want to go to one other subject matter. These documents have been tabled, so I am not going to go through each of them one by one. We see, as was said at Estimates the other night, that in the final part of the minute—because the program was finished—the instructions were quite clearly that it would then be extended to accommodation for the Western Australian delegates. In fact, I should quote from it. This is the second minute I quote from, dated 29 October 1991. It says:

        I believe that the Minister will have to come back and make another correction to the statements he has put down, because even he should have been able to pick this one up: the accommodation costs have been paid for Mr Wayne Misdale. Mr Wayne Misdale, as I understand it, is contracted to the Department of Industrial Relations and operates out of Sydney. He was invited down here as a guest speaker. Under these minutes and the guidelines, why has Mr Wayne Misdale's accommodation been paid?

         I believe that the Audit Office should go right through the Department of Industrial Relations and check all these particular accounts, because this looks like a very cosy, sweet little deal. We are not talking about an enormous amount of money, but we are talking about a principle. We are now talking about a position where the Western Australian BLF will have to be billed again to pay back the money that it has been overpaid. The Department should have been aware of that.

         In the Estimates Committee the other night, when I asked why no guidelines had been given to the various delegates, as in WABAG and WATUAG, the answer was that they were told verbally what the arrangements were. So why are they claiming business class air fares when they have been briefed on what they are entitled to? Why is the Department paying—or overpaying, except in the case of Wayne Misdale—only the Western Australian branch of the Building Labourers Federation?

         Not only did the Minister know, his advisers advised him, in documents that have been tabled in the Senate, that there were some question marks about the legitimacy of those claims. Yet, instead of going back to Mr Reynolds and saying, `Hold on. These expenses are not legitimate', or, as he tried to claim here, that the money had run out—the money may well have run out; I am not disputing that—he sought to pay these expenses under another program. Mr Reynolds did not seek to do that. The Minister did it, in his discussions with Mr Gary Quinlan, as is borne out by what is in this letter. Far from my having to withdraw anything in this place, the reverse applies.

         I will wind up my comments on this by saying that it is indeed unfortunate that what has happened has happened. It is particularly unfortunate in view of the blight it has put on Western Australia. These things should not happen. Had there been proper administration, proper instruction from the Minister, clear guidelines, it would not have happened. As I said before the Minister left this chamber, the buck has to stop with him and not with anybody else. In this process of extracting teeth very slowly one must ask why, when it was pointed out, the Minister could not have come in and cleaned it up in one fell swoop. I do not believe, and I do not think anybodyelse in this place believes, that the people who work in the Department of Industrial Relations and in the Minister's office cannot add up.

        In relation to consultants, compensation for early termination is based on service forgone. As Dr Summers is engaged on a short-term basis, no early termination benefit has been provided in her case. Professor Slatyer retired on 31 August 1992 and so did not receive compensation for early termination. Dr Pitman, if his contract were terminated early in circumstances covered by his contract, would receive compensation at the rate of $109,000 pa until 30 June 1993 or until the date (if earlier) he commences other Commonwealth employment. Cut-off provisions would apply in the event that an offer of such employment were made and not accepted by Dr Pitman. Dr Watson, if his contract were terminated early in circumstances covered by his contract, would receive 2 months salary for each 6 month period or part thereof of service forgone, with a minimum payment of 4 months salary and a maximum payment of 12 months salary. Were the Prime Minister to cease to hold office as a result of an election, 1 months salary would be paid. If Mr Turnbull's engagement were terminated early, he would be eligible for compensation of 1 months salary.
