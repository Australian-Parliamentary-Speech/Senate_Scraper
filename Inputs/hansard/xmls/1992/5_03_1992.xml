        INTRODUCTION
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the 9th September 1991, I introduced a draft of a Bill to establish mechanisms to protect endangered species and to redress the processes in the bush that are threatening the extinction of a large number of our uniquely Australian plants and animals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The intent of introducing the Bill in draft form was to give the parliament and the community sufficient time to consider the contents of the proposed legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This legislation and the necessary government and community support structures are absolutely vital if we are to begin the long process of protecting and restoring the great biological diversity on this continent which has contributed greatly to our material, spiritual and cultural well being.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The draft Bill has been circulating in the community for some 6 months.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During that time, over 3,000 copies of my accompanying speech and over 2,000 copies of the draft Bill have been distributed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am heartened and gratified at the level of interest expressed in what this Bill hopes to achieve. We have received over one hundred submissions from conservation and farmer organisations, and many letters of support.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As a result of this consultation I have made a number of substantial amendments to the draft Bill. These changes will be discussed later in this address.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But first, I think it is important to reiterate some of the reasons for introducing such legislation into the parliament at this time, and to remind Senators of the context in which the Australian Democrats see such legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
         THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        According to the United Nations Environment Program, "Estimates of the number of living species on Earth vary from 5 million to 30 million, of which only 1.4 million have been identified and classified. . .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        They state that "though there is no precise estimate of the number of species that have been lost,. . . experts believe that 25 percent of the Earth's total biological diversity is at risk of extinction during the next 20 to 30 years. . .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This current problem applies as much to Australia as anywhere else. In the past 200 years, since the settlement of this continent by Europeans, Australia is known to have lost 30 large and visible animals and 100 plants.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Professor Harry Recher from the University of New England notes that
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         "Most Australians view the continent as vast, unspoiled and underpopulated. Yet in historical times, no other continent has experienced the massive changes in the distribution and abundance of such a large proportion of its vertebrate fauna as has Australia.
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many people think that the great extinctions of our wildlife and their habitats occurred in the very early days of European settlement and that damage has all but stopped.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This view could not be further from the truth. The rates of extinction on this continent are as rapid now as they were at any time in the past.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The historical evidence is that most extinctions occurred in Australia within 20 or 30 years of an area being settled. We are still colonising areas, and this same pattern is set to be repeated, particularly in the south-west and north-west of the continent as settlement of these regions intensifies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Traditional conservation methods have not dealt with the problem of species and habitat loss adequately. This has been recognised by the IUCN when it states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        "The best way to slow the loss of biodiversity is through diverse, coordinated, and participatory programs that attack the problem at its roots, builds support among wide-ranging institutions and individuals, draws on the best modern science, and establishes biodiversity conservation in its rightful place as a basic prerequisite of development policy.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

         This statement provided the thinking on which the structure of this Bill is based.
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What we have in this Bill is not just legislation to protect an endangered species, but wide ranging programs to protect species, populations of threatened species, and the ecological communities on which they depend for their continued survival and evolutionary development.

         A 5 STEP PLAN TO SAVE OUR BIODIVERSITY

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In my speech introduced with the draft Bill, I announced a 5 point plan that I believe can and should be adopted to reverse the threatening processes in our natural and rural environments. The Threatened Species Bill is one important part of this plan.

        What we had in Australia 200 years ago was an ecological balance. That balance has been disrupted by the massive modifications brought about by European Australians since then.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The more we move away from that balance, the less stable our environment and the greater the chance of major environmental problems occurring. This suggested five point plan is about beginning to redress the causes of the disruption of that original balance and to help the continent to establish a new balance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Extinction occurs at the level of populations and not at the level of species. It is a symptom of larger problems with the way we manage our environment in an unsustainable manner.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because of this, conservation strategies must focus on managing for population viability. Fragmented, one off solutions to environmental management have failed. We need a new approach.

        Therefore, we have developed structures and processes in this Bill which facilitate community co-operation and involvement, not only in the listing of threatened species, but also in the management of plans to protect them.

        A Commonwealth Threatened Species Management Committee is established which is to have a major influence in the management of threatened species.

        The responsibilities of the Management Committee include overseeing the preparation of a Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy, managing the Threatened Species Conservation Fund, and recommending to the Minister the signing of Species Recovery Plans and Threatening Process Action Plans.

        In recognition of the role Australia should play in maintaining global biodiversity this Bill establishes an Australian International Threatened Species Advisory Committee.

It will not play a role in the protection of Australia's threatened species, which is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Threatened Species Management Committee.

        As I discussed earlier, funding for threatened species conservation is abysmally low. The Democrats have developed a 10 year budget for the funding of the Commonwealth Threatened Species Conservation Strategy which we believe will provide funding levels commensurate with the importance of conserving our unique biodiversity. According to this budget, in 1992-93 a total of $50 million should be allocated to the Strategy. By 1994-95 the total amount should be upgraded to $100 million.

        The draft Bill made provision for compensation to landholders where Interim and Permanent Conservation Orders are established. However, the limited extent of this compensation was strongly criticised by landholder groups, such as the National Farmers Federation, the United Farmers &amp; Stockowners of South Australia, and the Tasmanian Farmers &amp; Graziers Association.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have given serious consideration to their criticisms and have, on balance, found them to be valid.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have therefore, substantially amended the draft and now include provisions for full compensation to landholders where any action taken under this Bill would have an adverse financial impact on the legitimate existing use of a landholders property.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For example, if a landholder was asked to destock a portion of the property to protect a threatened habitat, then the landholder could legitimately claim compensation for the loss of productive capacity from that part of the property, even though the land would still remain in his or her ownership and management.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It was put to me strongly, and I fully respect the argument, that if a landholder's property happens to include threatened species, it is not exclusively that landholder's responsibility that the species is now threatened.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is therefore a breach of natural justice to require that landholder to suffer a financial loss to preserve a species on behalf of the entire Australian community. It is a national responsibility to protect threatened species, and landholders who are asked or required to assist in their protection should receive full compensation for interference with their economic production.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Landholders will be compensated for any financial loss suffered as a natural, direct and reasonable consequence of the making of an Interim or Permanent Conservation Order. The amount by which the value of the land will be increased or decreased will be taken into account by the Minister in deciding the landholder's entitlement. The compensation may be given in the form of a payment of money or provision of labour, goods or other services. In addition, any costs associated with a claim for compensation will be met.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, landholders who enter into voluntary Habitat Management Agreements will be eligible for financial or other assistance in three areas:

        The Bill recognises that there will inevitably be situations where actions need to be taken which have a minor impact on threatened species. It therefore provides for a `permit to interfere' with threatened species. The Director of the Threatened Species Unit will only issue permits if he or she is satisfied that the proposed action will not impede the recovery, threaten the extinction, or significantly affect the habitat of Australia's threatened species, populations or ecological communities.
       </para>

        If a person breaches the permit or if the Director has not rejected an application for a permit outright, the Bill requires the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. The intent of this section is to require an EIS for new developments that might have a major impact on a species. Where the Minister finds the EIS acceptable, he or she may issue a `licence to interfere'. The developer must enter into an assurity or bond arrangement whereby the impacts of any approved interference must be properly rehabilitated.

        CONCLUSION
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Species extinction is irreversible. Our present generation is witnessing an alarming rate of species extinction and habitat loss both in Australia and overseas. Determined and enlightened government and community action is required to stem and reverse this loss, both for the sake of future generations and for the preservation of ecological integrity on which we all depend.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current system of conservation reserves in Australia is inadequate to conserve the full range of species existing in Australia today. Management for conservation and development, that is ecologically sustainable development, must be adopted across all industry sectors in order to provide full protection to threatened species. This Bill recognises that, as an island continent, Australia is one interconnected system. It also recognises that the processes that threaten native species do not respect institutional jurisdictions. It therefore provides mechanisms to protect all threatened species, populations and ecological communities across the continent.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Global warming poses new and unprecedented threats to biodiversity. The diversity of life on our planet is a result of highly complex interactions between biological, physical and climatic processes. Over many tens of thousands of years, climates have changed quite dramatically, however, the pace of change has been sufficiently slow to allow species to adapt. We are now faced with the prospect of an accelerated greenhouse effect. Uncertainty exists only about the speed and scale of change. Scientists have warned that the rate may be too fast to allow species to adapt. Climate zones are likely to move, leaving whole ecological communities to the mercy of weather patterns to which they have not adapted. Without the adoption of effective precautionary action, massive increases in species extinction are likely. To hedge against this alarming prospect, the government must act now to set in train processes which protect our most threatened species.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Future generations of Australians are relying on this government to take a bold step and to conserve a part of our heritage that once lost can never be replaced. The loss of any species due to human action or inaction diminishes our humanness. I urge you all to give your serious consideration to this Bill which we, the Democrats, believe will provide a strong and effective role for the Commonwealth in the protection of Australia's threatened species. Future generations will thank you for doing so.

This payment will be $125 for families with one child, $175 for families with two children, $200 for families with three children, $225 for those with four children, and $250 for those with five or more children.

        Second, the rate of family allowance supplement and the family allowance supplement component of pensions and benefits will increase by $6 a fortnight. This increase will be implemented on 3 April for pensioner and beneficiary families and 16 April for low income working families. The increase will be indexed for inflation when the Government introduces legislation to integrate family payments.

There are 920,000 people who are officially unemployed in Australia, while another half a million people are unable to get the hours of work that they want. One in three young people cannot find work. Over the past year, the number of families where the chief breadwinner is unemployed has risen by 40 per cent to 262,000. There are now 218,000 Australian children living in families in which no-one has a job. I should repeat the figure because it is alarming—218,000 Australian children living in families in which no-one has a job. That is a 40 per cent increase on the figure just a year ago. They are damning figures for this Government.

        This one-off payment could never be described as an efficient means of targeting government assistance to the most needy in the community. It is quite the opposite, in fact. Families who will remain virtually unaffected by the current recession and enjoy a relatively high standard of living will receive a one-off windfall from the Government in early April. Those families who have been able to shield themselves, relatively, from the effects of this recession will get this as well. Whether these families will spend the windfall payment on necessities and not luxuries is highly debatable. The question must be asked: how much of this $317m of taxpayer's money will be spent by higher income families on luxury purchases and entertainment?

        A significant proportion of this handout will go to families that do not have a dire need for it. Analysis of the 1986 ABS income distribution survey, with subsequent income updates in line with the CPI, reveals that there are some 700,000 Australian families with incomes over $40,000 a year receiving family allowance. This includes some 100,000 families with incomes over $60,000 a year. The survey reveals that some 530,000 families have incomes under $20,000 a year, while 790,000 families have incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 a year.

        It must be pointed out that the Department of Social Security does not release its own figures on family allowance recipients broken down according to income. The figures from which I have quoted show that 35 per cent, or over one-third, of families receiving family allowance have incomes in excess of $40,000 a year. A significant amount of money could have been saved by targeting this payment to families in greatest financial need. Even in the case of lower income families, who in the main will be able to put this payment to very good use, such as paying off bills and buying necessities for their children, it will not mean an ongoing improvement in their standard of living. To an extent it may minimally alleviate the hardship for a short time. However, once the one-off payment has been spent, these lower income families will again face the harrowing task of paying bills and dealing with a constant flow of demands on their limited resources.

        With the $317m the Government is spending on this initiative it could have given over $5 to every family allowance family for a full year; better still, it could have targeted this assistance to lower income families and provided them with a substantial and sustained increase in their overall standard of living. Only last November the Government introduced an assets test for family allowance, claiming the need to target assistance to families who are most in need. But now, in the run-up to both the Wills by-election and a Victorian State election, and with the knowledge that Fightback has captured the support of what is called middle Australia, the Government has opted for a one-off across the board payment to all family allowance recipients. Mr Keating's self-styled prescription for social justice, which is evident in his decision, is most identifiable in the One Nation decision to exclude four million people, or nearly half of Australia's taxpayers, with incomes under $20,700 a year from the Government's tax cuts.

        A final point needs to be made about this one-off family allowance payment. Because of its arbitrary nature, it discriminates against needy families who are not eligible for family allowance on 2 April 1992. For example, in the 1990-91 Budget the Government announced that from 1 January 1993 the family allowance would not automatically stop when a child turned 16 but would be paid until the completion of the student's secondary schooling. As this initiative will not commence until 1 January 1993, these families will not benefit from the one-off payment on 2 April 1992, even though they have already been earmarked for family allowance in the 1990-91 Budget and are just as needy as those families who will benefit. Presumably the Government's 1990-91 Budget decision to extend family allowance to school students aged 16 to 18 is based upon its own recognition of the large increase in school retention rates. However, by arbitrarily applying this one-off payment to eligible families at 2 April and not applying it to secondary school Austudy recipients, the Government is in effect choosing to ignore the increased costs being borne by families due to the large rise in school retention rates during the current recession.

        The Government's one-off payment, irrespective of income, has to be compared with the targeted increase in family allowance outlined in Fightback. Rather than a one-off payment of between $125 and $250, a coalition government will double family allowance for families with incomes under $30,000—not a one-off payment; a doubling of family allowance to enable a sustained increased in standard of living.

        A couple of points need to be made about the abolition of rent assistance waiting periods. It needs to be remembered that only in the last Budget the Government decided to reduce these waiting periods from 26 weeks to 18 weeks. That was only in the last Budget. By now abolishing waiting periods altogether, the Government is in effect admitting that at the time of the last Budget it underestimated the financial hardship faced by people caught up in the recession. I suppose that some people in the bureaucracy believed Mr Keating's repeated promise that we would somehow come out of this recession; the J-curve would come into effect; that he would bring home the bacon; that there was just a bit of effervescence in the glass and everything would be okay. Even Mr Keating's own bureaucrats began to believe the myths that he was putting forward.

        Secondly, it must be pointed out that the relaxation of rent assistance waiting periods proposed in this Bill does not appear to be a temporary initiative to alleviate the extra hardship resulting from the recession. This is a disturbing phenomenon. For a number of years both the Government and the Opposition have considered it appropriate for rent assistance to be available as soon as a person became eligible for a benefit. This thinking has been based on a common concern that making rental assistance a de facto benefit would merely increase the incentive for people to rely on welfare.

        In a deep recession such as this, I do not believe that such an argument is as relevant because it is virtually impossible for people to switch back and forth between employment and welfare benefits at will. In fact, it is very difficult for people to get employment at all. However, the apparent permanency of this decision to abolish rent assistance waiting periods does indicate a significant change-around in the Government's policy. I think that the Minister should confirm or deny that the Government intends to return to its previous policy once this long running recession is over.

The Government proposes to pay a one-off bonus to every family eligible for family allowance on 2 April. The bonus payment ranges from $125 for a family with one child up to $250 for a family with five or more children. Although the bonus will undoubtedly be welcomed by the families receiving it, this is really a somewhat bizarre move by the Government. It comes wrapped up in the guise of a social justice measure, but one can only ask: what is the real purpose? Is it a bribe? Is it a bit of pork-barrelling? Does it have anything to do with a by-election that seems to be rapidly approaching? Is it tokenism of the worst kind, or maybe an off-beat attempt to stimulate the economy?

        I believe that the way in which this payment is being made demonstrates very clearly this Government's inability to come to grips with the structural problems of poverty. Yes, families are going to be assisted, but where is the help for those families on very low incomes who have no children? Where is the help for the single people trying to survive on minimal incomes? We certainly welcome the increases in family allowance supplement, the boost for funding for welfare agencies and a reduction in rent assistance waiting periods. We have been calling for such measures for some time. But these are somewhat hollow gestures in the context of a package that accepts around 8 per cent unemployment for at least the next four years.

        With that long term prospect in mind, what does the package do by way of addressing the structural problems of poverty? The short answer is absolutely nothing. Here was a chance to tackle some of those structural problems. For example, the Government could have increased the amount people on pensions and benefits are permitted to earn before losing their entitlement to payment. It could have reinstated young people's incomes back up to the adult level to help them survive. It could have reduced or removed all existing waiting periods for income support, which are constantly causing so much poverty and putting so much pressure on welfare agencies. But the Government has not gone for genuine social justice for the victims of its recession; instead, it has gone for the easy option, the social justice gimmick—the money, not the structural box.

        Before I move on to rent assistance waiting periods, I refer to farm families. There are two ways that we can now make sure that this package will go to those needy farm families. We can either look again at removing the tools of trade from the family allowance assets test or—and this will help only some of those children in need, but at least it will help some—we can link the payment not only to the family allowance but also to those children who are currently being assisted under the isolated children's scheme. They are two amendments that we will be pursuing when this Bill moves into the committee stage.

        Turning to rent assistance, the move by the Government to abolish the waiting period for rent assistance for most pensioners and beneficiaries is a most welcome one. It is long overdue, but it is gratifying to see the Government finally acknowledging the hardship and suffering that these waiting periods have been causing. The Democrats are particularly pleased to see this move because we have been calling for the abolition or substantial reduction of social security waiting periods for many years. Over the past two years we have continually moved amendments to social security legislation to give effect to the reductions in waiting periods, only to see those amendments opposed by both the Government and the Opposition. It is quite clear that waiting periods cause considerable and unnecessary hardship and that the sole rationale for their existence is to cut costs rather than relieve the suffering of those people who are forced, through no fault of their own, to turn to the Government for income support.

        I am very pleased to hear Senator Patterson also supporting this measure. It has been most unfortunate that in the past the Liberals seemed determined to see these reductions as some sort of subsidy to the private rental market. I find this quite strange once I look through the Fightback package. The Opposition's desire is actually to reduce the public housing sector, and I wonder where it thinks low income earners are going to live. This view also very conveniently ignores the fact that housing costs consume the highest proportion of low income earners' incomes, especially if they are renting in the private rental market.

        Data collected by the national housing strategy clearly pinpoints the enormous stresses that housing costs place on many low income families, particularly in times of recession when the breadwinner is unemployed. The strategy's data indicates that about 10 per cent of all households in this country are suffering from very severe housing related stress and that many people are paying out up to 50 per cent of their income on rent. I highlight one big problem with rent assistance, and that is that it is not going to be available to those under 18; they have been left out yet again. I ask the Government why, when this age group has been one of the hardest hit sectors of the community, with one in three unemployed.

This legislation implements that part of the Prime Minister's statement designed to help families kick-start the economy. It contains three elements. The first is a one-off family allowance payment of $125 per child; the second is a $3 increase in the family allowance supplement and the third is the abolition of all rental assistance waiting periods for social security recipients except those waiting periods which apply to single beneficiaries without dependent children who are aged below 18 years.

If that is the answer to the Fightback package in relation to families, it certainly is not enough.

        Firstly, the Government does nothing in relation to tax cuts for people who are on $20,700. A person on that income is paying over $49 and does not get 1c back. The poorest in the community do not get a tax cut; they get not a cent back under this Prime Minister's package. Under the Opposition, someone on $20,000 a year would get $814 back. Taxpayers would not be paying the present 20c in the dollar; they would be paying 16.2c above the initial tax-free amount. Secondly, petrol excise would be abolished and the 15 per cent GST would be applied. So there would be a saving of 18c or 19c for every litre of petrol a family used. There is nothing about a reduction in the price of petrol in the Prime Minister's statement.

There is nothing comparable in the Prime Minister's statement except a one-off payment. Senator Lees is quite right; that one-off payment, no doubt, will be used to pay off the odd debt. Under the Opposition, there will be a 6 per cent increase in the family allowance supplement. Under the Government, it will increase by $3 a week. Under the Opposition the increased family allowance will not only be paid to the poor; part of it will be paid to families on incomes of up to $40,000. The Government does nothing for the poor.

        The Bill before us will increase the add-on payable to a service pensioner in respect of each child by $6 a fortnight. This increase will take effect from 16 April 1992. While I welcome such an increase for those who will benefit, it is interesting to look at how many are affected. As at 30 June last year, approximately 2,100 veterans were receiving an additional pension for children. In a veteran population of several hundred thousand, a little more than 2,000 gain an increase in pension of $6 a fortnight as part of a measure not devised to benefit veterans, in particular, being more a consequence of a general increase in family allowance supplement.

         Australia is currently experiencing the worst recession in 60 years. The impact is being felt in all areas of the community, including the veteran community. For example, in 1990-91 the number of veterans applying for a service pension actually increased over the previous year for the first time since 1983-84. This reflects the increasingly difficult circumstances faced by self-funded retired veterans in a time of national recession.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Fightback!
        </emphasis>
        document that the cost of living increase due to the introduction of a 15 per cent goods and services tax will be a one-off 4.4 per cent.

        But the important question for repatriation pensioners is: do the compensation proposals put forward by the coalition package ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of a goods and services tax? The answer is yes. When we were framing our package, a particular concern of the coalition was to ensure that veteran pensioners be more than compensated for the one-off increase in the cost of living. Thus, rather than simply increasing all allowances and pensions by 4.4 per cent, we will be increasing them by 6 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. This means that all service pensions, disability pensions and war widow pensions will be increased by 8 per cent.

War widows will have their pensions increased by $678 a year. Veterans on part service pensions and earning non-pension incomes will have their part pension indexed by 8 per cent and will receive a GST tax credit.

One has only to look at the extraordinarily high percentages of Repatriation Commission decisions overturned by the Veterans' Review Board. In Western Australia, for instance, the Veterans' Review Board in 1990-91 overturned 72 per cent of Repatriation Commission's disability assessment decisions—obviously totally unacceptable.

Mr Acting Deputy President, bear in mind the fact that when the family allowance was introduced in 1976 it was done with money which the Government saved from abolishing the tax rebate system. In other words, in most families, it was simply out of the hip pocket and into the purse.

        Since then, successive governments have been purloining, stealing, from the purses of Australian mothers. Currently, from the purse of a mother of four, the Government is stealing $50 per fortnight which was put in there in 1976 because of the abolition of the tax rebate scheme.

        Fact two is that the weighted average minimum award rate of pay for full time adult employees has fallen in real terms by $60 per week in the last six years. Fact three is that two-thirds of those forced out of the paid labour force recently have been women, many of whom were there because of financial pressure on the family. Now, because of the recession, they are being forced out. My State alone has had a drop in the labour force of 8,100 people in the last three months; 5,300 of them have been women.

Now the percentage is only 48 per cent. Fact nine is that the family allowance supplement is touted as a help to families, but only one in eight Tasmanian families who receive family allowances are eligible to receive this payment. Fact 10 is that the latest ABS figures show that since September 1991 the recession, as I indicated before, has put 8,100 people out of work, out of the labour force, 1,800 of them in the last month.

        That is the background to this Bill. If we are talking about social justice, should those facts not have been considered?  The Government is not talking about social justice; it is talking about kick-starting the economy. I am not criticising the Government for that; that is important. I agree with the Government that getting the money into the hands of families will mean money being expended.

        —This table shows that, were the Government to have allocated a one-off payment on the basis of social justice rather than necessarily kick-starting the economy, those with more children would not have been so unfairly treated. For example, under the provisions of this Bill the mother of two children will get $175 whereas, based on existing proportions, the payment should have been $250; for three children, instead of $200 the payment should have been $375; and for four children, instead of $225 the payment should have been $542, on the basis of existing proportions. If one is talking about justice and equity, one must remember that it is not the Government's money but somebody else's, on the basis of the tax rebate for children being abolished; that is, it is money belonging to the families.

        So I say that the fight for the recognition of the rights of the Australian family must continue, until full economic and social justice is achieved and there has been an official recognition of the economic value of the work of the home-maker. We have seen that many of the mothers who have been forced into the paid work force have, because of the recession, been forced out of the paid work force. Where is the net to catch the problems there? Who is going to pay the bills? I accept, acknowledge and agree with the increase in the family allowance supplement. But, as I indicated, only one in eight Tasmanian families is eligible for that. And there are a whole range of families, particularly one-income families, who are finding the struggle almost impossible. That is an issue which must be faced up to by the Government and by the Opposition.

        It is all very well to say that the majority of families now are not one-income families. That may or may not be the case at any given time. But at some time most families go through a period when they have to rely on one income. That is what we have to have a look at. That is of concern not only to those families but to every family now. It is of concern to my shop assistants union members. The older ones know that their sons and daughters will go through a period in which their families will have to rely on one income. The younger members of my union in the shops know that they at some stage, although they are now working, will have to go through a period when their family will have to rely on one income.

I have commissioned other research on this matter. But I will now show honourable senators what has happened in terms of the percentage change in real disposable income between 1982-83 and 1989-90 for different family types on a family taxable income of $30,000 per annum on one income and on two incomes.

Is it not of concern to the Government that, when families go through a period when they have to be on one income, they will suffer a substantial decline in real disposable income? Is that fair? Is that equitable? Is it indeed sensible in the circumstances when there are more people in and seeking paid work than there are jobs available? That will always be the case. We can have all the rhetoric we like. The Government can say how many spare time jobs it has created. But it does not look at the number of full time jobs it has knocked off. One can say what one likes; but unless we look at this problem we will have further pressure on the labour force.

        All we know is that the Government in the area of family allowances is throwing $125 at most families. If that is not an election gimmick, I do not know what is. The timing is exquisite, being in the lead-up to the Wills by-election. It goes completely against what the Government is always talking about in the area of social security, namely targeting. What  shows the height of cynicism is that, when we look at the people who are most in need, as reflected by the demands placed on the voluntary agencies, we see that they are being given a derisory $2m to tide them over during this financial year. That is probably not much more than the cost of postage when this cold, heartless, callous Prime Minister starts sending off cheques in the lead-up to the by-election.

        To put it in perspective, $317m is going in a one-off electoral bribe and $2m is going to the agencies which are by far best placed to target assistance to the families requiring it. There is simply nothing in this payment to indicate that it will be directed in any way towards demand stimulus, or paying off debts, or consumer spending. As Senator Lees said, it will probably go first towards paying off debts. However, if it is available to people with incomes of around $65,000 to $75,000—as it is; people with five children and an income of $74,000 are entitled to this payment of $250—what do they do with it? At that level they really do not need it. It does not make a great difference to someone on $74,000. Maybe they could buy another hub-cap for Paul's Mercedes, but other than that it is a purely token and unnecessary payment at that level.

        For those people at the bottom end it could make a much greater difference but, again, it is not going to do much more than tide them over for a week or two. So it is utterly regressive, which of course goes against all the rhetoric of the Labor Party. It is a one-off gimmick which does not address the ongoing financial difficulties of something like 1.9 million families who currently receive family allowance, nor does it target those who are most in need—those who require emergency relief and various other forms of emergency assistance, as identified by the voluntary agencies. Instead, they get the ultimate in tokenism, not even enough, I would have thought, to tide them over for a week. That is really the calibre of this sort of bribe. I think it is little more than a disgrace.

        Having said all that, I want to make it clear that we are certainly in the business of providing substantial and permanent increases in family allowances. That is why the Fightback package specifically provides a doubling of family allowance payments to families with incomes below $30,000 and, for those families with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000, a 50 per cent increase. Above that figure, the increase will be 6 per cent, which will be more than the inflationary impact of 4.4 per cent.

        Therefore, in every respect we have targeted increases in family assistance to those people who most need them. On the other hand, the Labor Party has gone precisely in the opposite direction. I would hope that when members of the Labor Party are alone with their consciences and wonder what their Party philosophy is all about, they will at least have some second thoughts about how they ought to approach this in the next Budget and beyond and look at what market they are really into. The polls might tell us one thing, but I can assure honourable senators that even middle to high income earners expect some compassion from government and do recognise that the most vulnerable are those on low incomes. Those people will not comprehend why the Government is throwing its money around in this fashion.

        An amount of $317m, which could have been more effective if spent in almost any other way in the social security system, is instead simply going to be thrown up in the air in effect—the ultimate in non-targeting, the ultimate in transience. As a result, of course, this will be long forgotten beyond the by-election in Wills. But, no doubt, the Government hopes that it will have some sort of psychological effect there; that people getting a cheque in the mail in the lead-up to the by-election will somehow be grateful.

        In terms of the $3 per week increase, again no-one would gainsay the proposition that people on low incomes are in need of assistance through the social security system. Of course, we could make it $3, $6 or $9 a week; it really would not matter. If the Government is not going to fund it, at the end of the day it has to come from somewhere, so there will be increased taxes paid by those people as well, no doubt, or there will be a blow-out in inflation or the Government will simply have to print money to cover the cost of it. On that basis, it is a Mickey Mouse arrangement. Unless these things are funded, it is really rather meaningless. So $3 is fine, but unless it comes from somewhere it is nothing more than a short term palliative; it does nothing about longer term assistance for those groups.

        If I might refer to something of a diversion from Senator Lees, it is also why it is unlikely to flow into imports. Of course, any expenditure has a propensity in some part to flow into imports. That is inevitable. But the sorts of expenditures that are likely by people who are getting the money are much less likely to flow into imports than are many other sorts of stimuli—including,  I  might say, tax cuts. Even if the money goes to pay off debts, it changes the capacity of those people subsequently to enter into other commitments. The money, when it goes to pay off debts, does not disappear. It stays in the economy as a stimulus applying a little more indirectly.

       I also have great problems with Senator Alston's amendment. I worry sometimes when I agree with Senator Alston on issues, but I also have great problems with the targeting of this legislation. I think we really do have to look very carefully at the motives behind it. For example, if there were $300m going, we could have looked at more than the welfare agencies, which, in many cases, are not able to give relief on anything more frequent than a three-monthly basis. They turn people away and those people have to wait three months before they can get any further assistance even if it is only a food voucher that they are seeking. If the money were not going to the welfare agencies, it could go to the rural sector, to single parents or to a number of other areas that I mentioned in my speech. Therefore, if we take out any reference to the Fightback proposal, which I also have considerable reservations about, the Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment.

The Government wants to set up a new bureaucratic structure, and I have already heavily criticised this approach to solving the problems. I think the amendments Senator Bell has put forward really flow from the fact that we are doing this exercise. The Opposition is not going to oppose these amendments. I noticed that Senator McMullan, representing the Minister, was pretty lukewarm about them. Perhaps the only thing to be said for this Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill 1991 is that the agency has a short life; there is a sunset clause that will bring it to a close in two and a half years or something like that. It is not as though it is a structure that is going to be there for very long for Parliament to give detailed concern to, as it might do if it were setting up an agency for some length of time. Maybe that says something about the fact that the Government omitted to deal with these matters.

         Certainly, in an ideal world with a long-standing bureaucratic structure, the amendments are highly desirable. I point out to the Democrats that the consequences of setting up new statutory bodies are that we will increase the bureaucratic system and add to the paperwork that has to be done and the time of the many people who are checking on these things. These amendments simply emphasise the case the Opposition has put against the whole of this exercise by the Government.

        —The Senate has before it the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991. This is an omnibus Bill covering, once again, a wide range of taxation measures, some highly technical and, consequently, quite complicated. Before I go into that, the March 1991 statement, especially the depreciation provisions, was designed—over 12 months ago now—to kick start the economy. Unfortunately, because of the problems in framing legislation, procrastination and delays, we are only today seeing the legislation to cover some of the outstanding issues of the March 1991 statement.

        Again, measures which were designed to kick-start the economy will not have the effect that was intended because there is going to be no legislative base. Mr Deputy President, you will recall that this morning I put before this chamber a notice of motion calling on the Government to bring forward its legislative program, particularly in relation to depreciation, in order that companies can have some certainty and encouragement to bring forward, rather than delay, their investment programs. Unfortunately, the changes are just seen as another delaying technique.

With all the changes announced in the One Nation package, the coalition is concerned that there will also be a resultant legislative bottleneck later on in this session and we can only hope that there will be appropriate time allowed for discussing, in this chamber, some of the difficult provisions that arise from the February One Nation statement and that will have to be brought before the chamber.

        For a government to bring to fruition legislation announced 12 months ago and then announce changes again is a tragedy. Some time ago the Australian Taxation Office developed the slogan—and I complimented the Office on it—`A service orientated office'. Again, it is unfortunate that this Government, which administers the Australian Taxation Office, does not show the same commitment to its taxpayers or to its constituents as does the Australian Taxation Office.

In an environment of self-assessment which demands a regime of certainty, the Australian Government is simply taking the Australian taxpayers far too cheaply. Already most parliamentarians' phones and fax machines have been running hot with requests from accountants for knowledge about the starting dates and the implications of the new depreciation arrangements, particularly in relation to the effect these arrangements will have on the Bill now before us. There is confusion and uncertainty. This seems to be the outcome of most things the Government touches, especially in the taxation field at the moment.

       People should have a look at the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 and see whether it brings about more simplicity. The industry does not have simplicity, certainty and more discretion. In the present economic situation and the announcement once again of the country's imports rising and exports declining in this month's balance of payments figures, businesses are looking towards the Government for incentives to encourage Australia's export performance. We are getting these things on paper and in press releases but we are not getting them into legislation sufficiently quickly to give businesses the certainty to go ahead with these so-called programs. This is because the statements are phrased in such a way as to lack clarity.

        Australian companies, therefore, are choosing not to enter the export markets. Why? Because Australia's inhibiting tax laws are destroying investment potential.

        I intend to use the committee stage of this Bill later this month for a deeper and more meaningful explanation of the technical aspects. I think it is unfortunate that we have this Bill before us without any amendments. I believe that amendments could be introduced at the committee stage and I look forward to them. If the Government cannot produce the amendments to cover a number of deficiencies, the Opposition certainly will.

        The proposed meaning of `effective life' leads the list. Last March, the new definition of effective life under a system of self-assessment was introduced. By September, the newspaper headlines were crying, `No significant changes to depreciation rate'.

        The present arrangements, as outlined in this Bill, will only add uncertainty to a taxpayer's calculation of effective life. Every taxpayer will be expected to determine effective life objectively by reference to the use of the item of plant and equipment, not only by himself, but also by future owners. The limiting aspect of the definition is the property's use for income producing purposes by any person—a great qualification which is put on the initial person who acquires that plant.

        Thus, the life of second-hand plant restricts the value of the amendment to the first purchaser of the plant. This is regardless of the fact that, on a subjective test, the item may no longer by utilised by a particular taxpayer. The concept of economic obsolescence is not recognised in the proposed definition of effective life.

        I therefore urge the Government to consider a more appropriate definition, such as a reference to the estimated life of a item of plant or equipment which it will have in the ordinary course of the proposed income producing activities, taking into account such factors as expected circumstances of use of the item by the taxpayer, whether the expected life of the item is restricted by the duration of a particular project in which it is to be used, and predictable obsolescence.

        A definition along these lines will permit a taxpayer, electing to make a determination as to effective life, to write off in whole the cost of the plant over the period ascertained. For example, a taxpayer permitted to depreciate an item over a five-year period under the existing depreciation rates might determine that the effective life of the plant in his or her own circumstances is perhaps four years. A taxpayer under such a system would not be required to have regard to the possibility that the item might have some alternative income producing capacity beyond the period that the taxpayer regarded as unproductive.

        Problems also occur with the transitional rules dealing with the introduction of effective life rates of depreciation as they are unnecessarily complex, especially for companies with substituted accounting periods. Companies with substituted accounting periods have simply put off their investment programs because of the uncertainty and complication. The effective life rates apply to property acquired after 1 March but not applicable until 1 July 1991. A company with a substituted accounting period is not able to use the broadbanded depreciation rates until the start of its 1991-92 year of income. Clearly, the record keeping requirements in such a case are overly onerous for a change in the law that was designed to simplify the depreciation regime. They are counterproductive.

        Again, problems occur with the new pooling arrangements. Proposed new section 62AAC requires a taxpayer to give a written notice of the creation of a depreciation pool within six months of the end of the year of income. This six-month period is at odds with the general requirement that corporate income tax returns must be lodged within 8 1/2 months of the end of the year of income. There is no reason why the written notice is required any earlier, especially as it appears that, under self-assessment, there is not a requirement to lodge it with the Commissioner of Taxation.

        Another problem which has surfaced is that industry feels confused as to whether it should use the Australian Taxation Office depreciation schedules. Clause 16 repeals section 55 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which currently sets out the basis of depreciation, including how effective life is to be calculated with, in particular, a recognition of the fact that the Commissioner is currently authorised under that section to determine the effective life of units of property.

Consequently, regardless of what is said in the explanatory memorandum, a taxpayer may in fact be open to penalties under the law for adopting such a rate—how ridiculous—in the absence of any evidence to support effective life being adopted, because proposed subsection 54A(1), does not contain any words authorising the taxpayer to adopt the rates set out by the Commissioner.

        As I stated at the outset of this speech, the legislation before us has been produced to overcome anomalies in the present taxation Act. However, in doing so, more problems have been created. This is especially so with the legislation that has been designed to clarify a major area of uncertainty in corporate tax laws. The terms of the proposed section 45Z in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) throw into doubt the availability of rebates of tax under section 46 in respect of dividends received through unit trusts by unit-holders which are resident companies. Proposed section 45Z applies only where the beneficiary is `absolutely entitled' to the relevant shares, and therefore may deny a rebate where the dividends are received through discretionary or unit trusts. That is an impossible situation.

        If the proposed section is not amended to secure the dividend rebate to corporate unit-holders, multiple taxation of company profits distributed as dividends will be imposed on this class of investors. Consequently, existing corporate unit-holders may need to sell their units, and prospective corporate unit-holders will not in future invest in the unit trusts which acquire equities. The coalition urges the Government to take immediate steps to expand proposed section 45Z to make it clear that corporate unit-holders in a trust are entitled to a section 46 rebate to the extent that distributions represent dividends received by the unit trust from exempt companies.

        Consequently, it effectively removes any personal liability on the officers of the Tax Office for not technically enforcing the law for the last 25 years. I ask Senator Tate what sort of legislation that is. Treating taxpayers equally and protecting officers of the Tax Office who apply commercially sensible practice should be axiomatic in any system. But the question arises as to why it was thought necessary in the Bill to exclude from the benefit of this retrospective legitimisation those few taxpayers to whom the Tax Office had not applied the practice. Why should they be discriminated against? I mention one name which I think is relevant. Why was Adelaide Steamship selected while everybody else was let off the hook? With this legislation we retrospectively let everybody else off the hook. This discrimination is just intolerable in any system, and I note that Senator Tate is nodding.

        In respect of the amendment for anti-avoidance deduction recoupment—that is, for roll-over relief—the measures in this Bill effectively force companies that want to transfer assets within a corporate group to adopt market value where those assets are subject to deduction recoupment provisions. There appears to be an overemphasis on the claim that the amendments are required to deal with tax avoidance arising out of these provisions. That is just a nonsense. In effect, with the advent of capital gains tax—save in respect of motor vehicles, pre-CGT assets and assets which may not constitute separate assets, under section 160P, for the purpose of capital gains tax—many of the opportunities no longer exist. There may still be some deferral advantage available. In these circumstances, to justify the amendment solely on the basis of anti-avoidance measures must be questioned.

        The combined effect of these measures is to add considerable further complexity to corporate group reorganisations where there appears to be little scope for avoidance. For example, for the vast majority of items of depreciable plant, the market value is not significantly different from the tax written down value. For administrative convenience, assets have normally been treated intra-group at book or tax written down values. This practice has had wide acceptance. In situations where the market value of assets may be greater than their written down value, companies will now be called upon to undertake a separate review to determine the tax impact, or ensure that capital gains roll-over tax is elected, if available. This is just a nonsense—and extra work for corporations.

Taxation and business commentators have warned time and time again that the practice is fraught with danger, as so often happens when legislation does not use the words of the press release or the press release is ambiguous. In this case we have a press release proclaiming balancing adjustment roll-over relief of which the tax profession was generally unaware. The explanatory memorandum advises that the measure was announced on 8 December 1990. But on investigation we find this did not occur. Apparently the press release involved, No. 119, was withheld from circulation on the planned 6 December issue as a mark of respect for the sudden death of Chris Higgins, Secretary to the Treasury.

        Finally, I would like to point out some of the  technical problems, which I shall also raise during the committee stage, associated with several other amendments within this Bill. I am pleased to see that the Commissioner is being granted a discretion when applying the substantiation rules in the fringe benefits tax legislation. This is a further extension of my private member's Bill several years ago, which was subsequently adopted by the Government. At the time it only moved so far as income tax was concerned, although the second leg did relate to the fringe benefits tax.

The requirement of proposed section 123B(1)(a) is that the Commissioner be satisfied that `a benefit has been provided in, or in respect of, a year of tax in respect of the employment of an employee of an employer'. It is difficult to understand why the Commissioner needs to reach a state of satisfaction as to the provision of a benefit. If no benefit has been provided there will be no need to consider the application of the substantiation rules and therefore no need to ameliorate their impact. That is quite obvious.

People contemplating the purchase of mining machinery—the mining industry is the one with the most to gain from this Bill—were all wondering when this was coming into effect, because the 12 March statement put no starting date on it—although I stand to be corrected on that.

        Then 1 July arrived but still nothing had been done. Senator Watson and I were screaming in this place asking when the legislation would be introduced. But the Bill did not arrive. Between 12 March and July and beyond there was pressure from the earthmoving industry and the people who sell the gear to make the new definition effective from 12 March. The Government agreed to it. I do not know when the Government agreed to do that. I never saw it in writing.I only found out about it when I got the memorandum. Let us say, for example, that the Government agreed to that in October—I certainly do not know when it happened—then there would have been a resultant 12 months loss of production due to new machines sitting in yards at, for example, South Guildford in Western Australia, where the Caterpillar gear is.

        We then get back to the other story: one set of rules applying from 12 March 1991 to 30 June 1991 and another set of rules applying from now on. Equipment will be written off under two different systems. Who wins out of this? I believe that the only winners are the accounting firms. The present Government, with its amendments to taxation legislation—we have about four changes a year—has created more work for the accountants and more work and costs for people using the accountants.

        I now turn to the finer points of the Bill. I would firstly like to address the depreciation provisions in the Bill. They can briefly be described as the re-definition of `effective life'—which Senator Watson has already spoken about—and the broadbanding and pooling of equipment. `Effective life' means the time over which an item of equipment can reasonably be expected to be used for income generating purposes by any person. My experience in regard to buying equipment—especially equipment with motors—is that such equipment can be expected to have an effective life of five years. It is written off in a straight line over five years. Although I suppose that, really, with diminishing value it would be written off in about four and a half years.

        I believe that depreciation measures will be far worse as a result of this Bill than they have been before. We need to look at total effective life. I can see no real incentive in this Bill for industry, whether the earthmoving industry, the farming industry or the mining industry, to spend more on new equipment to increase production. There may be incentives by way of an upturn in the economy—if that is ever going to happen under this Government—or an upturn in iron ore or gold prices or an upturn in rural production to encourage people to reinvest in equipment. But I can see no reason why business should invest in new machinery more quickly than they had expected because of the measures in this Bill.

It has only taken the Government from last March to February to work out that the` effective life' provisions and new depreciation schedules were hopeless.

        Broadbanding has been covered very well by Senator Watson so I will not go into it in detail. The idea is to reduce the number of scales by which one can depreciate to seven: 33 1/3, 20, 15, 10, 7 1/2, 5 and 2 1/2. Anything over 33 per cent is written off in one year.

        The Bill provides that anything up to $300 can be fully deducted in the first year. In the earthmoving game, one starts off at about $500,000 for the first item, and then one goes to the other end of the scale where one can write off immediately in one year anything up to $300. I think this is a nonsense. Having had experience in the game of depreciation and those sorts of things in business, I believe—to throw a figure into the air—that anything under $2,000 should be written off immediately rather than setting up a schedule with accounting fees that will go on it. It costs just as much to set up a depreciation schedule for $301 as it does for $33,000 or $300,000. So I believe that the figure of $300 is ridiculously low. It only causes book work for nothing. I believe that a starting figure should be at least $2,000, if not more.

        I turn to something that this Government is very fazed about, that causes it to jump at every shadow. It has to dangle it in front of everyone to pick up the few idle votes around that it may still be getting. I refer to the anti-avoidance measures. The Minister's second reading speech states:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       In some instances, the existing law allows taxpayers to nominate as the selling price of an asset the lesser of its market value and its tax written down value. This rule can result in tax avoidance where an asset with a high market value and a low written down value is disposed of by a taxpayer to a related entity at the lower value. If the related entity then sells the property at its true market value, the proceeds cannot be treated as a recoupment of the previous owner's deductions.

       Senator Button, in reply to a question, made quite a bit of noise about this last year. However, the Minister in his second reading speech left out a very important aspect; that is, that anyone doing that would have been picked up by the capital gains tax provisions.

        If I can briefly indicate how this comes about: a machine or an item of plant is written off completely over five years, and on the books it is worth $10 or $100. If that machine or item of plant is sold for $2,000, the difference between those amounts is a profit because the owner has to allow for what he has recouped through his taxation deduction. Of course, that has to be accounted for. The explanatory memorandum shows us how the Government has gone overboard:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . .the plant depreciation provisions require a reconciliation to be made between the consideration for a disposal of depreciated property with its depreciated value (ie. the cost of the property less the amount of deductions allowed).

       It is here in the explanatory memorandum for the Government to read. Yet in his second reading speech the Minister very conveniently left it out. I suppose that, for political purposes, if people think there is wholesale taxation evasion around Australia, it sounds good. However, the explanatory memorandum says that it does fall under the capital gains tax provision. It continues:

       2.6. To prevent tax avoidance where property is transferred at less than true value between persons who are not dealing with each other at arm's length, some of the capital allowance provisions required balancing adjustments calculated as if the disposal was at market value. However, others (most notably, plant depreciation allowances) treat such non-arm's length disposals as made for consideration equal to the lesser of market value or depreciated value.

       The explanatory memorandum is confusing. Under that last paragraph, section 25A of the Income Tax Act would pick it up and it would then go through as a capital gain. Is any taxpayer going to deliberately put himself onto capital gains tax rather than normal income tax? I just cannot see any reason for it; perhaps Senator Tate can tell me. I believe there would be very minimal advantage in doing that because under capital gains the rate is not taken to be the top tax rate, it is taken to be the taxpayer's rate.
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       For capital gains tax his income is increased by 25 per cent to get a tax value that the Tax Office can charge him and it applies that over the whole lot. Having done an exercise on it, I can say that it works out to make very little difference.

         —It has been recently drawn to my attention that the Department of Defence has circulated a defence economic brief to the senior hierarchy of the Department which I understand numbers about 60 people. I intend to read some of what it says onto the public record. It is a very short item—it is short but not sweet. The heading is `Goods and Services Tax (GST)'. The body of the message, as it comes from the Department of Defence, is this:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The GST as proposed in the Coalition's "Fightback" package would be levied at 15% and charged on the supply of goods and services in Australia and on the importation of goods into Australia. In essence it is a value added tax where the full brunt of the tax falls on the final consumer of goods and services. The possible impact on Defence could be considerable. If exemptions were not provided, the impact on Defence, based on 1990-91 outlay could be of the order of $740m.
       </para>
       <para>
        That went out to the senior hierarchy of the Department of Defence with a covering note dated 19 February, 1992. First of all, the material in that brief is quite untrue and it shows that the Fightback package has not been read by the officials who compiled that brief, or it suggests that they are prepared to misrepresent the true state of affairs. I am concerned that there may be an element of misrepresentation in this because the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, came into this chamber on 11 December last and made a similar allegation. There and then, my colleague the shadow Minister for Finance, Senator Short, jumped up in this place. I now wish to read some of what he said. He said:

        . If he or some of his acolytes had taken the time to read this document; if he had used some of the resources of the Public Service, which were at his unlimited disposal at taxpayers' expense to try to knock holes in this thing; and if they had half a brain and had read the technical manual on the GST, they would have read section 5.4.3 which deals with supplies by public sector bodies. It says:

        `The public sector is taxable if the goods or services are provided in the course of commercial activity.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That means that they pay no GST on their input and no GST on their output—`if they comprise a regulatory activity or are non-commercial in nature, for example'

        I refer Senator Ray to page 16 of supplementary paper No.5 of the Fightback package. I hope that he will have the courtesy and the decency to come back into this chamber at some stage, admit that he set up the greatest straw man of all time and apologise to everyone who heard him make that absolute furphy.

        Senator Ray did not come back to this chamber and make such an apology. I am disappointed that when the inaccuracy of his claim was pointed out to him he did not do so.

He went so far as to suggest that he was "scared for my life". This demonstrates the lack of credibility which any fair minded person would find in his evidence. I never at any time told Mr Sherry that I would "fix him". Nor did I threaten his life. Nor did I intend that he should have any such perception. Nor do I believe that he had any such perception.

        In relation to his accusations of money collected to support Sacked SEQEB Workers being used to financially support political candidates, which some people have interpreted to infer that some of the money in the so called "ETU Fund" was used for such a purpose, I can confirm after discussing this matter with Sacked Workers who were involved in managing and running that fund (which was not controlled by the ETU but by the Sacked Workers themselves), that to the best of my knowledge absolutely none of that fund was used to support any candidate or any political office.

        I am very conscious of the importance of my position. I am proud of that position with the ETU and of my achievements as a member of the Executive. I certainly made it clear to Mr Sherry that I would be most upset if he used information he had obtained from me to malign that Union or its members. There may have been some words said in heat but in fact I was consciously restrained, as far as I was then able, in my conversations with him.

        Mr Sherry has demonstrated to your Committee that he is prepared to break the law for his own purposes. In my opinion one of those purposes is to malign this Union and its members. I have no doubt that he is prepared to further break the law to achieve that end. When he was carrying out his research with my approval at the offices of the ETU he arrogantly abused the privileges I had given him. On one occasion I observed his going through confidential records of the Union which were irrelevant to his stated purposes and which he had no authority from me or any Officer of the Union to inspect. When I approached him about that he immediately left the Union's office. He made no explanation and gave no excuse and I took that to mean an admission by him that he knew his actions in that regard were improper. Relations between us became somewhat strained but I assert that the fault was his. I believe that his present evidence so far as it concerns me is false and malicious.

        The accusations made by Mr Sherry at page 388 of the Transcript are simply untrue. I emphatically deny that I ever offered Mr Neville $50,000 to opt out of the SEQEB dispute. Additionally there was only one fund with which I had any involvement. It was established to assist the striking SEQEB workers and their families. That Fund was administered by the striking workers of whom I was one. The proceeds of the Fund were used to provide financial relief. The administration of this Fund was intensively investigated by the Cooke inquiry. Commissioner Cooke, whilst making some minor criticisms, was obviously satisfied that the Fund complied with the purposes for which it was established.

        Mr Sherry clearly fails as a researcher. His evidence from my knowledge is tainted with information which is clearly untrue. The reference to the ATEA on page 388 totally misrepresents the true position. The case there was simply that members of the ATEA allowed payroll deductions to two accounts, one at the Sunstate Credit Union and the other at Credit Union Australia. Those monies were at practical intervals remitted to the SEQEB Strike Fund, administered by myself and several others. A receipt was issued for those monies on each occasion. Mr Sherry is attempting to infer that some clandestine relationship existed between Messrs Kane and McLean. This simply was not the case. In fact Mr Kane had nothing whatsoever to do with the administration of the Fund. Whilst the Executive of ETU assisted in the raising of funds they had no involvement in the administration of the Fund.

He joined up, together with thousands of other Australians, after war was declared because Germany invaded Poland. Perhaps he remembered that General Monash was of part Polish Jewish heritage. I do not know. But I do know that he believed that the general was a great Australian. I know he believed himself that he was fighting against evil—the evil of Nazi Germany, of Hitler, of Mussolini. He knew all of that before Japan entered the war. He joined before he knew that his theatre of war was to be his own backyard. He and thousands like him believed in the dignity of the freedom of man and that it was worth fighting for in any part of the world. It was, if you like, an internationalist attitude. It was the sort of attitude we have when we negotiate in the GATT round—where we call for free and fair trade—when we appreciate the support of Britain with her attitude to the common agricultural policy and the need to bring down the subsidising of European trade in agriculture.

        To tear the monarch from our Constitution would mean that we get an elected head of state, and an elected President—and elected he or she would be, because no matter what method were used the party which wins the election would control the President.

         I will make two predictions about this debate. First, it will do nothing for jobs and the reform of the economy. Worse, it is an attempt to distract the nation from these issues. Secondly, the debate will be very divisive. It has been instituted not because of any upsurge in community feeling, but principally because of the internal problems of the Australian Labor Party; a party which we have seen over the last nine years or so is without any clear beliefs or ideology; a party which, in its desperation, has decided to attempt to beat the nationalistic drum.

         There are a number of aspects of this debate on which I wish to comment today. The first relates to Mr Keating's call for an independent Australia. There is no argument from this side of the chamber about the need for Australia to remain an independent and sovereign country. The question I ask myself is whether, by focusing on our independent Constitution, Mr Keating is focusing on the wrong issue regarding the national independence of this country.

         We have long been an independent country. Indeed, all Prime Ministers of this nation for 40 or 50 years have strongly believed in the independence of Australia, whether they be Labor or Liberal. I suggest that Mr Keating is the first Prime Minister for a long time who seems to have some doubts about this. When I was looking at the debates on the Australia Act which passed into law in 1985, I noticed that the former Labor Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen—a former colleague of Senator Robert Ray, who is in the chamber—told us that this Act reflected the fact that Australia had long been an independent and sovereign nation.

         So I think there was consensus that Australia was an independent country. But as far as Mr Keating is concerned, this is apparently not the case. I suggest to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are major threats to the independence of Australia. These are the sorts of issues that Mr Keating may care to focus on
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         if he has some genuine concern about this country, as distinct from a genuine concern about his need to get back into the job after the next election.

         The first major threat to Australia's independence is the massive build-up of foreign debt in this country, which has risen from about $23 billion when this Government came into office to over $160 billion today. In short, this Labor Government has put us in hock to foreigners. No doubt a number of people will realise the massive irony involved—that the man who speaks about the independence of this country has, in fact, through his policies put us in hock to foreigners.

         Labor members of parliament might ask themselves—if they have not already seen examples of how having a massive foreign debt effects the independence of this country—why Mr Keating brought about the recession that we had to have. Why did Mr Keating engineer this recession when he was Treasurer? It was because of the very fear that Australia, if it did not try to slow down the growth of foreign debt and deal with the balance of payments crisis, would have its credit rating downgraded. Foreign debt is a huge problem regarding the independence of this nation.

         I suggest that a second threat to the independence of this nation relates to the sell-off of Australian assets which is occurring. When a company goes broke and is forced to sell its assets, most of us have seen how cheaply they are sold. When a country goes down the road to economic ruin it, too, has to sell off its assets. It has to sell them off cheaply to foreigners to raise money.

         There are real threats to the independence of Australia but they do not relate to our Constitution. As Senator Bishop has so well demonstrated, our Constitution is arguably the world's oldest democratic constitution. It has maintained our national unity for almost 100 years. It is not the Constitution which is our problem. Indeed, our Constitution is our great pride. The independence of Australia is threatened by other factors, principally in the current period by the destruction of the economic standing of this nation.

         I conclude my remarks by drawing on a brief comment I made earlier in response to an interjection by Senator Ray. When one looks at the Labor Party logo, one basically sees the Australian flag. A central feature of the Liberal Party logo, the big `L', is also the Australian flag. The great political battles in this country are fought between two major political parties. Yet in the symbols of this fight there is also the symbol, at present, of our unity. Both our parties fly our great flag in their logos. This is going to change. This symbol of unity is going to be dropped. It is going to become a symbol of divisive debate between the parties. It will cause great division in the community. The responsibility may not be Senator Ray's, because he has told us that he supports our great flag; it will rest firmly with the most divisive Prime Minister we have had in our history—Paul Keating.

         —In Australia we sometimes express our incredulity by saying, `Pigs might fly'. I intend to inform the Senate of some flying pigs that left me incredulous. It was on a recent flight from London to Sydney, Qantas flight 2. Between Bangkok and Sydney, the breakfast menu in business class included `Canadian bacon and pineapple'. It is quite extraordinary that our national carrier, Qantas—which makes a big play of what a great national company it is—should see fit to serve Canadian bacon on its international flights. But worse than that, it sees fit to promote it as Canadian bacon.

         The point I make is simply this: Qantas may, for very good business reasons, see it as necessary to purchase Canadian bacon. It may find it to be cheaper in the port that it flies out of. But, whether it is cheaper or not, we should not be describing it on the menu as` Canadian bacon'. It makes people believe that Canadian bacon is somehow better than Australian bacon, whereas the opposite is true—Australian bacon is a better product.

         Senator Ray may not be particularly interested in the future of the Australian pork industry but we in the National Party and our Liberal Party colleagues certainly are. What Senator Ray and the Government forget is that Canadian bacon is flooding into this country because it is subsidised overseas. It receives enormous Canadian government subsidies.

         The Opposition says that if a product is subsidised it should cop a countervailing duty. For Senator Ray's benefit and the Government's benefit, I note that in the last six months of last year $5.8m worth of Canadian pork flooded into this country—that works out at 243 tonnes of Canadian pork a day—not because it is a better product or because Australians want to buy Canadian pork, but because it is subsidised. It is part of the corrupt international trade scene and we let it go on.

         A very serious point to all this that Senator Ray may not have appreciated is simply that we have to stand up to these subsidised products that are coming in from overseas. At the moment, this moribund Government has no interest at all in stopping the flood of dumped produce in this country for one simple reason: it disguises the fact that the Government has no anti-inflation policy. It does not matter if the product is cheaper and puts Australian workers out of the jobs. Provided it helps the Government hold down the CPI, that is fine by it. It is not fine by the people of the National Party or the Liberal Party who are on this side of the chamber. I hasten to add that we will not be on this side of the chamber for terribly long, because the Australian populous is sick and tired of this Government.

As I say, this whole affair has left me incredulous. I conclude by saying that pigs may fly but, if they do, let us have Australian bacon please.

          In the Prime Minister's statement last week, he handed these industries on a platter yet another $51m of taxpayers' money over the next three years. Advocates of such assistance for these industries justify it partly on the grounds of Australia being a small domestic market for products. I put it to the sports shoe manufacturers that three-quarters of a million netball players offer a very significant domestic market for one product line. Beyond that is the opportunity to develop a product with a real export potential, given the millions of players internationally to whom I have already referred who are crying out for a specific purpose-built netball shoe.

         It is not unreasonable that the desire of the Port Authority—not its Chairman, but the Port Authority—to assist in enhancing the commercial opportunities for the Townsville port may not necessarily be completely in accord with the interests of the nickel refinery which, of course, has its own interests. It has a cheaper option. It is perfectly appropriate for the Port Authority to say, `As part of assisting the nickel refinery, we should take the opportunity to construct an outer berth in the harbour because it will significantly enhance'—and there is no question about it—`the commercial opportunities for the port of Townsville'.

         , Senator Alston in fact displays his total lack of understanding not only of Australia's aid program but also of the development process overall. In the latter respect, for example, he cites early on in the article South Korea and Taiwan as examples of countries which have developed, as he says, without significant foreign aid programs. He talks about the need for us to get real on foreign aid.

         He seems utterly oblivious to the fact that both countries in question, South Korea and Taiwan, have, as everyone knows, received absolutely massive assistance from the United States over many years. Most of Senator Alston's claims about the Australian aid program are equally spurious. He claims, for a start, that Australia should concentrate on the quality of its aid program and ensure that it measures up to strict performance criteria. In fact, Australia has an enviable international reputation as a deliverer of quality aid programs. Of course, individual programs have gone wrong occasionally over the years, as they have for every aid delivering country, and the most spectacular example to cite—and he does cite it, of course—is the Margarini project in Africa some decade ago.

Through a whole variety of appraisal, audit and review activities, it is continually assessing its assistance to countries, to sectors, to particular target groups. In fact, AIDAB devotes some $10m each year to various quality control initiatives. Again, Senator Alston, who is speaking not for himself but for the Opposition in this respect, displays a total lack of understanding when he moves on to criticise continuing budget support for Papua New Guinea as being anachronistic and counterproductive.

         Again, although the idea has apparently only recently occurred to him, Australia's aid program has for many years targeted its assistance on areas of our specific expertise, including agriculture and soil conservation—claims again that are totally misconstrued and misunderstood in the article.

         The Opposition would reduce the aid budget by $209m over the next two years and, in addition, increase its costs by some $70m by introducing the goods and services tax.

It will cease to be a draft when it is considered and approved by members of the Japanese investment survey mission.

I am aware that Leigh Purnell of the Metal Trades Industry Association responded to the remarks that were made at a seminar by Mr Ian McLachlan, the shadow Minister for industry and commerce. Mr McLachlan chanted on, as the members of the Opposition are wont to do, that only total labour market reform is the answer to our economic problems. The continuous chant seems to be that total labour market reform is the only answer to our problems.

The Association said that a total Rambo, total labour market deregulation, deregulation at all costs approach—the sort of chanting mantra that comes from the Opposition—is not the answer.

In view of the Minister's excellent progress while Minister responsible in ensuring that unpackaged imported food now bears 4.5 millimetre labels, with  imported fruit juice now being clearly labelled as such, has a National Food Authority review and survey of the rules relating to labelling been commenced? Has he requested the Minister for Health to include a review of country of origin label size?

         —Senator Boswell, along with Arch Bevis in Queensland, has taken a particular interest in the question of the size of labels which indicate whether a particular product is a food product of Australia rather than from overseas. It has been very gratifying to see in the last week that in relation to unpackaged food—nuts, fish, fruit and vegetables—there is now a requirement that those unpackaged foods should carry a label of 4.5 millimetres indicating whether they come from overseas. I think that will enable Australians in the marketplace to make choices that aid our farmers and our fisherpeople in their occupations.

         It is also worth noting that only last week controversy arose in Queensland where a particular supermarket chain was forced to withdraw some 9,000 packets of nuts from its shelves after it was accused of misleading consumers about the origin of the nuts. Apparently the chain had a label which in large print said `Produce of Australia', and below that in very much smaller print was a message that read `or China'. That was thought by many to be misleading. I have referred it to the Trade Practices Commission for its investigation of whether this was a practice that could be regarded as deceptive and misleading in the marketplace and therefore contrary to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act.

         The application will be dealt with by the National Food Authority under the public procedures laid down in the National Food Authority Act.

If it decides to prepare a draft standard of variation of the standard, again it will need to seek the input of interested parties. It has a statutory obligation to make a recommendation in respect of an application within 12 months of receiving that application. In other words, I believe that it should be able to complete this task by the end of the year or a little after that.

First, the Opposition is trying to make one pot of money—I said this yesterday—do two things: compensate for the effects of the GST part of the package and compensate for bracket creep with the same amount of money. Secondly, the Opposition has not attempted to fully analyse the distributional effects of the welter of taxing and spending changes it suggests.

         One very important thing which has emerged in the last day or two is that the Opposition package shows that it does not understand bracket creep. Honourable senators opposite show that they do not understand bracket creep by the questions they ask. They did understand bracket creep when they purported to introduce tax indexation during the last Liberal Government. They introduced tax indexation in response to an election promise and it lasted one year. When they introduced it at the time of the last Liberal Government and it lasted one year, they assessed it on the basis of the CPI, not on the basis of wage movements, which is what the present Fightback proposal purports to do.

         The Opposition shows that it does not understand that wage growth and inflation are different things. Senator Hill frowns because these are concepts that he, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, has never grappled with. Indexation of the income tax scales requires that they be adjusted by the rate of inflation rather than the growth in average earnings. The Opposition has used the wrong figures to calculate the necessary indexation adjustment of the tax scales.

The Minister will recall speeches he made to the legal fraternity in Tasmania and other States at functions marking the official opening of the legal year, in which he said that the coalition's Fightback package would reduce the amount of Federal funding for legal aid and result in an increase of 15 per cent in costs to legal aid work referred to private lawyers. As the shadow Treasurer has directly refuted this statement, does the Minister now admit that he was wrong and that he misled the legal fraternity at the most important event in its calendar? If so, will he now publicly apologise to the Australian legal fraternity? Also, was the Minister aware at the time he made those speeches that his Government intended to impose by regulation gigantic fee increases for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Family, Federal and High courts?

         However, it is absolutely uncontestable that there is a warning, a direct assertion, in the Fightback package that $10m will be slashed from the legal aid budget as funded by the Commonwealth Government. When that is apportioned amongst the legal aid commissions throughout Australia, that must translate to many thousands of cases which will be unable to be funded. This means that when clients approach legal aid commissions for assistance—for example, in the Magistrates Court when facing a criminal charge, or in relation to Family Court matters—those legal aid commissions will be $10m less able to provide those particular services. That is absolutely uncontestable.

         I think the third part of the question related to alternative ways of handling algal bloom. The preferred method of controlling algal bloom is to address the underlying cause, which is nutrient accession to receiving waters. Reducing nutrient input is a matter of minimising nutrient outflows from point sources such as sewerage plants, and from diffuse sources such as animal manure from agricultural lands. Those issues can only be addressed in the long term.

         In the short term the most practical approach is to manage river flow regimes to minimise conditions suitable for algal growth. I understand that under several of the Commonwealth Government programs—the Australian Water Resources Council and their programs, the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council and the management of the Murray-Darling system, and the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation—measures are in place to attempt to manage the problem in both the immediate and the long term.

         In particular, it is important to note that the University of Tasmania is minded to establish a new chair in general practice and rural health matters based at the University of Tasmania's Launceston campus; in fact, I think at the Launceston General Hospital. This is entirely in line with the Federal Government's strategy in relation to the provision of primary health care, particularly in rural areas throughout Australia. We know that the question of the oversupply of doctors is not a crude question of numbers; it is also a question of their distribution and their concentration in urban, as opposed to rural, communities. That, of course, has a major impact in Tasmania, which is so decentralised and is perhaps Australia's most rural State.

Why was the delegation not given regulations and evidence from other provinces which show that such gross violations of human rights are widespread and are systemic to the Chinese population control program, which would have enabled the delegation to challenge the assurances given to it?

Under Mr Keating's proposals, there will be no tax relief for low income earners by adjustment to the tax free threshold and no tax cuts at all for the four million people who earn less than $20,700 a year, which is more than 40 per cent of total income tax payers.

         (1) Yes. Where a race horse is owned for personal use or enjoyment and not for the purpose of income production then such a horse is classified under the capital gains tax provisions of the tax law as a non-listed personal use asset. Taxation Ruling IT 2585 explains the operation of the capital gains provisions to non-listed personal use assets, particularly in relation to horses raced as a hobby. Where the cost base or indexed cost base of a non-listed personal-use asset would otherwise be less than $5,000, the cost base or indexed cost base is taken to be $5,000. The effect is that a taxpayer will accrue a capital gain calculated under the normal rules, or calculated as though the cost base or indexed cost base was $5,000, whichever gives the lesser gain.

         (2) The disposal of a non-listed personal use asset does not give rise to an allowable capital loss. As such assets are primarily for personal use, if these losses were to be deductible against capital gains generally the tax system would be effectively subsidising the related personal consumption expenditures since the stream of services provided by the asset remains untaxed.

        Point 1: the impact of bracket creep on any particular household is calculated by comparing the tax payable under the legislated tax scales with what would be payable if the tax thresholds had been indexed for inflation since some base period.

        In the Treasury analysis, the relevant comparison then is between the tax payable under the Opposition's proposed tax scales and that which would have been paid had the legislated rate scale been indexed for inflation between the June quarter 1993 and the March quarter 1996.

        The Opposition claimed that the tax cuts it was proposing would return $3 billion of bracket creep. In fact, the Treasury analysis shows that the true amount that should be returned is $4.2 billion.

        This $4.2 billion reflects the difference between the tax that would be paid under the Opposition's scales and what would be paid if the legislated scales were indexed for inflation between the June quarter 1993 and the March quarter 1996.

        Just make sure you understand this—that does not mean that there is an additional $1.2 billion floating around.

       Senator Collins in his answer to me today said that the reason for the expenditure of $20m in the Port of Townsville was to secure the prospects of 900 workers at Yabulu. Senator Collins was clearly wrong in that remark. I do not know the reason for it. Greenvale Nickel, which is the company to which Senator Collins referred, ran out of viable ore and was required to import ore from New Caledonia to refine at Yabulu. The most cost efficient way to do so and to avoid double handling was to build a jetty at Halifax Bay.

        To build a monument to himself, however, the Chairman, Mike Reynolds, thought that it would be a good idea to build an outer harbour. The major users of the port—and there are only two: Mount Isa Mines and Greenvale Nickel—quickly distanced themselves from this fantasy which had an estimated cost of $80m. Naturally, a company such as MIM, which already had berths in the port of Townsville and already had sufficient capacity to include the import of 200,000 tonnes of ore, to which Senator Collins referred in his answer, publicly distanced itself from this fantasy.

Senator Collins told Senator Reynolds and me that it would be spent on a rail loop. As I indicated in my question, there is already a rail loop at the Port of Townsville. The rail loop cost the Port Authority nothing because it was installed by the owners of the Duchess phosphate deposit some years ago. Honourable senators may or may not be aware that that project never got off the ground. But the rail loop remains. The question is: why build another rail loop?

        I want to clarify a misleading remark made by Senator Collins in his answer. The Opposition clearly supports infrastructure spending where it has clear cost benefits and contributes to productivity and efficiency and where it means more exports or real job creation. We do not disagree with that. I, as a Queenslander, support the building of the rail link from Acacia Ridge to Fishermans Island. I think it should have been done years ago. However, the expenditure on what appears to be—on my own investigations and on discussions with the users; they are the people who count—a white elephant is nothing more than abuse of the taxpayer.

        —The Labor Party in Townsville, and in Queensland generally, is in absolute turmoil over what to do with the Yabulu nickel treatment plant, how to service it and how to save the 1,000 jobs that are so important in that area. Senator Collins has tried to get some kudos and brownie points for the Labor Party by making smart announcements in the north—in the Townsville region. He even wasted some $300,000 worth of taxpayers' money to establish an office for himself in that particular town that he has used only once this year. He had to do something to try to bail out his mates in the Labor Party controlled Townsville City Council and the Queensland State Government over the nickel treatment plant which is about to close down. With the tacit encouragement of the Labor Party, the Green movement took some action which prevented Queensland Nickel's first preference—to have a long jetty out into Halifax Bay.

It was until recently chaired by a colleague of mine on the Burdekin Shire Council, who with his predecessors did a marvellous job in that port. He had a very good board which did a lot of work there.

        So we have to address these important issues and apparently conflicting information that has been presented to the Senate—whether in answer to questions that have been tabled or not. Certainly I anticipate that in the Senate Estimates this year we will put the Government on notice that Senator Macdonald and I will be pursuing a whole range of these issues very properly with the departmental officials at that particular time.

          —The interim statement of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) finishes with the comment that there will be a delay of about two months before the response can be tabled. It is most unusual that a Minister does not present a report personally; that the Minister on duty does it when it is a Government response to a major report made by a committee of this Parliament, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.

          The second thing that is quite unusual about this is the delay. We are talking about a report that was tabled in the Senate on 2 December 1991, which happens to be three months ago. The convention of the Parliament is that the government of the day responds to major reports within three months. Yet today we are given something that is called an interim report, and it is not a report in any sense at all; it is just advice that perhaps in two months time we will get a response. That is five months after a major report has been tabled in the Parliament.

          The report is very important because it relates to the place of the Defence Force Reserves in Australia. We all know that the Government is in great difficulty with the subject of defence as a result of its consistent cost-cutting exercises. With the very great rundown in the number of uniformed personnel in the three Services, the place of reserves to flesh out the Australian Defence Force has become even more critical. That is why it is important that the Government take notice of the report and make a response to the Parliament and account for its stewardship.

          Clearly, what the Government is on about is moving to extend the time as long as it can and hope that the Committee's report will be buried. As the deputy chairman of the Committee that presented this report, I was more than interested to see how the report would be received in the Defence community. The response from Canberra was very interesting. If I may use a word that infuriates the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and refer to those uniformed members of the Defence Force who love to live in air-conditioned offices, as careerists, as opposed to the warriors in the Defence Force—

I think I have spent more time sleeping on the ground with Army units in recent years than some of the people I am referring to.

          While our report was on the Reserves, it also inevitably involved some of the readiness and the capability of the permanent forces. There is no way we can dissect one part of the defence forces from the other. Our report showed up all the things the Government had been hiding with its talk about readiness and all the rest of it. Shortcomings were shown up in the Gulf war, when we found we had no forces at all that we could dispatch. It was only after the expenditure of about $100m that we got two ships we could send to the Gulf for a patrolling task. We had no unit in the Army we could dispatch onto the battlefield for conventional land warfare. We had nothing in the Air Force because we lack any electronic warfare capability to operate in a hostile situation.

          The reaction from the senior officers who have been responsible for this situation has been to maintain silence. I am advised that when the Government's response to the Committee's report comes down, we will be attacked for writing a report which claims, in essence, that the corrective measures we have proposed of increasing readiness for the defence forces are quite unreal. That is rather ironic, given the way the interdepartmental committee responded to Mr Alan Wrigley's report of about 18 months ago. The Government attacked the Wrigley report and said that the readiness standards were far too long to be practical in any way at all. The word is now that it is going to attack our report on the basis that our readiness standards are too short to be attainable.

          The fact of the matter is that at present we have readiness standards for the Australian Defence Force Reserves of 90 days, 180 days and 360 days. We devote quite a bit of our report to explaining how impractical those levels of readiness are. If we have a unit on 360 days readiness before it can go on active service, we might just as well recruit off the street, as we did in the Vietnam era. A soldier can certainly be trained in 360 days, and there is no point meeting the expense and all the other overheads involved in keeping them on the Reserve.

          The Committee was very conscious of the high cost of readiness. In no sense at all are we saying that the whole of the Defence Force has to be ready to go in 30 days or 60 days or anything like that. Such a move would be quite nonsensical. There is a very high cost involved in maintaining high standards of readiness, but at the same time we have to recognise that it is a very different world we live in in 1992 from what we lived in 1932 or 1922, when long lead times and long training periods were quite possible. The facts of life are now that we need a Defence Force with a high degree of capability that is seen by other people and we need to have some of those parts of the Defence Force at a reasonably high standard of readiness. We also have to be able to bring the rest of the Defence Force up in a reasonable time.

          Apart from the careerists at Russell Hill to whom I have referred, the rest of the uniformed services have been extremely enthusiastic and laudatory of the contents of the report. I have had many letters from all over Australia congratulating the Committee on bringing down a report of this nature. A difficulty we had in writing the report was that it was tightly written to a set of requirements laid down by the Minister. The No.1 requirement on the list of requirements we were given was that we had to write about the readiness for the reservists in relation to DOA87. That, of course, as everyone knows, is now hopelessly outdated. We are in the post-Cold War era and that document is utterly irrelevant to the needs of Australia. We did show that in the light of the standards set by the Government, as a consequence of DOA87, the Government had failed miserably to attain even those minimal standards that were defined in DOA87.

          That is not surprising, because the history of Labor governments in Australia is one of total neglect of defence. History is a subject that might as well be written in Urdu or Sanskrit for the Labor Party. I do not think anyone in the Labor Party has any idea of history whatsoever. People such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should be barred by statute from ever speaking in public on matters of historical significance. The attack on Britain earlier this week relating to the defence of Australia in 1942 was a scandalous travesty, a misstatement of historical facts. The charge that Britain did nothing to defend Malaya has been dealt with by notable historians in the Australian press, and I do not wish to debate that here.

Prime Minister Curtin failed to take the obvious step of marshalling Australian resources. In the period from 1939 to 1945 over one million Australians were in the Army alone, and that from a population of only seven million at the time—quite an astonishing performance. Because the Labor Party was committed to its ancient pacifist philosophies, despite the fact that we were in the gravest danger ever, it would not introduce conscription; it would not commit Australian forces to attack the enemy. We had something like half a million people in the Army in uniform at the time. Poor old Curtin was bleating to the Americans and the British to send troops to die for Australia, yet we were not prepared to use our own resources.

          We have been reduced to the tragic circumstance where we have only four Regular Army battalions. This is quite extraordinary for a country of 17 million. But putting all of that aside, two of those battalions are in the operational deployment force in Townsville with 3 Brigade. It is very unlikely that the Government will commit one of those two battalions to service in Cambodia. It will probably send a battalion out of 1 Brigade at Holsworthy since it got rid of 6 Brigade as part of the Ready Reserve scheme.

If it follows the same practice it used in the Gulf with the ships, it will probably nominate a six-month period. In that case, there is an opportunity for a reserve unit to go to Cambodia and replace one of the two regular battalions that could go up there.

          The beauty of the Cambodian deployment is that it allows time to call for volunteers from the Reserves and to train them beforehand. We could send a battalion like 49 RQR up there. To do something like that would have enormous benefits with respect to morale in the Army Reserve which, under both Liberal and Labor governments, has never been committed since the end of the Second World War.

          As I was saying, there is apparently a $300m reduction in the budgeting that appears in the One Nation statement and the Minister has been quite unable to explain that. The accompanying qualification to the force structure review statement that was tabled in March last year was that there had to be zero real growth to maintain the capital equipment program. A reduction in the agreed zero regrowth program will mean that the capital equipment program cannot be funded.

         The current guidelines for the assessment of the genuine and continuing nature of a marriage or de facto relationship already provide that decision makers should have regard to all the circumstances of a relationship and in particular the range of factors listed in the guidelines. Further, it is made clear to Departmental officers that the factors detailed in the guidelines are not exhaustive, but indicia as to the genuine and continuing nature of the relationship to be taken into account in a full assessment of the circumstances of a relationship. While the guidelines do not specifically mention cultural factors, the focus of the assessment is on the genuineness of the relationship, rather than whether the relationship conforms to a particular stereotype. These guidelines are consistent with guidelines used by other portfolios, such as the Department of Social Security, and as such conform to the Commonwealth position on such matters.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, it is my view (supported by legal advice from my Department) that to prescribe these in the regulations is not the most appropriate course of action. The current wording of regulations 17(1)(o) and 28(1)(m) allows each to be used as conditions for any entry permit or visa. To amend these paragraphs to include spouse specific material would confine their use to the Spouse category.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Delegated officers are aware of what constitutes "material change" through the Department's instructional material. The applicant will be advised of the nature of the material change in initial information/advice letters sent to him/her after application. The letter(s) will include detailed information on all conditions attached to the entry permit (or visa as appropriate) and advice to the applicant of the consequences of breaching those conditions.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A "material change" is a change that goes to the basis of the application. The basis of an application on marriage or de facto grounds is the relationship. A "material change" in this is, therefore, a change in the genuine and continuing nature of the marriage or de facto marriage.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The condition that there be "no material change in circumstance" in regard to the relationship, is a mandatory condition. Breach of such a condition does not automatically lead to cancellation of the visa or entry permit—it is simply a ground for cancellation. Instructional material to delegated officers (PC 1771) reinforces this point, advising that officers have consideration for prescribed circumstances in which permanent residency may still be available before making any decision on cancellation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The prescribed circumstances are where the applicant's Australian spouse dies, where the relationship breaks down due to domestic violence or where the relationship breaks down and there are access to children or maintenance of children considerations.

          —The second report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on change of status on grounds of marriage and de facto relationships dealt with a complex and certainly emotional subject. It involved myriad different sham marriage deals; the cultural differences in marriages of different cultures; what is and what is not a true de facto relationship; and, through all that, the lack of decent departmental statistics on the problems that the Committee reviewed. In other words, it was not a simple inquiry.

          If I were asked the best way to describe the Government's response in a sentence, I would say that it had touches of realism and a large dose of half-heartedness. The Government has agreed to act on the recommendation that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs must provide far better statistical data. This is not before time, for there seems little point in attempting to run a successful immigration program without the data to indicate what is and is not a problem. If a problem is to be analysed accurately so that its remedies can be considered, there needs to be a good statistical database upon which to make judgments. That is a good foundation for looking at the problem, reviewing it, making an assessment and proposing alternatives. For example, we do not know how many illegals we have.

          The Government has also agreed to establish training programs for officers in the marriage requirements of other cultures. We welcome that. We had a number of examples where officers in many different locations simply did not appreciate the different cultural attitudes to marriage and therefore were making judgments and decisions based on a lack of knowledge of those cultural differences. It is imperative that arranged marriages of many Asian cultures are not taken for sham marriages. Clearly, the basis of any good immigration program is fairness.

In other words, the Government is making perhaps more band-aid measures and appears unwilling to deal with some of the hard issues of the many couples who use the guise of a de facto relationship to gain the status of marriage and, as a result of that, entry and permanent citizenship in Australia.

In the short time that the report has been available, it has been nigh on impossible to digest the Government's response in detail to those 31 recommendations. The way it is framed, with many of the Committee's recommendations given half answers or half refusals—that is, `accepted in principle, but', and then about four paragraphs of response to the `but'—it is going to be a matter of some time to digest and assess the Government's response to the recommendations. It will need greater assessment and, therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks.

          —The pig industry has become very important in most of Australia and, in fact, it is one of the rural industries that operates in every State. When we think of the traditional method of pig keeping of years ago and the sorts of animals they were, we can only give great credit to the industry for the magnificent progress it has made. The animal now is an entirely different shape and constituency than it used to be. The keeping of them is so different. The product, as I have said, is now totally different from what it used to be 30 or 40 years ago. This has been done by good research. The high density pig growing that is done now in various places is the result of treating the animals differently now.

          This report takes quite a lot of trouble to go over the question of quarantine, particularly transmittable gastroenteritis and the importation of uncooked pig meat from Canada. The Government has to make up its mind on these subjects very soon. We hear officers of the quarantine service talking about `acceptable levels of risk'. They are not talking about an acceptable level of risk as far as the Government and the exporter are concerned, but they certainly are about the industry in Australia. If the Government determines that there is an acceptable level of risk, there can be no alternative to the fact that it must stand the risk. It is not reasonable that the Government should take actions contrary to what has been requested by the industry without being responsible. Whether the pig producers are in Tasmania, Queensland or wherever, this has to be the case.

          Australian pork producers are vitally concerned that the importation of subsidised Canadian pig meat is undercutting prices and introducing disease into our market. It is producing a situation which gravely threatens to undermine the financial viability of the industry. Earlier today colleagues would have heard Senator O'Chee point out that, in the last six months alone, $5.8m worth of Canadian pork has flooded into Australia. In light of this, it is fascinating to read on page 13 that the Council resolved that:

        <para>
         However, it was sad to read that maybe no action will ever be taken when further on it reports:

         While accepting the Governments view that the best recourse for the Australian pig industry was to seek protection from unfair trading practices via the existing Anti-Dumping and Countervailing legislation, Council considered at the time that the legislation and the interpretation thereof by the Australian Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority combined to create a situation, which not only resulted in protracted and very costly cases, but in appearing to favour the exporting country over the importing country, indicated that the chances of a successful application were very remote.

         Currently the quality of Australian pork is the highest in the world. We have no disease in it and we want to keep it that way. Only three countries have pork of comparable quality to Australia's—Denmark, New Zealand and Northern Ireland—and Australia is the clear leader. If we continue to import Canadian pig meat, it will be open slather on the Australian market. As far as this Government is concerned, there will be no health inspection except for document checks. It is the same as the strawberry industry. I think we all remember when Californian strawberries were imported, and they turned out to be riddled with disease.

          When the Government had these concerns raised by pork producers right across the country, all that the Government said was that a limitation would be put on imports. A limitation of 17,000 tonnes was mentioned, but as far as many in the industry are concerned that figure was plucked from the air. That figure would represent imports of select cuts, but what it would really represent is a loss to Australian producers of much more than 17,000 tonnes of pig meat. Traditionally, a processor would have to buy a whole pig in order to obtain select cuts.

          Australia has a healthy and viable pig industry which should not be jeopardised by this sort of threat. Indeed, it is already bad enough on the land just trying to make ends meet in the current economic climate. Producers do not need to have their livelihoods threatened with the possibility of increased demand from inferior quality and disease ridden products from overseas. Indeed, Australia exports pork in limited quantities to New Zealand, Japan, the Pacific nations and the United States. However, the major problem the industry faces is that most other overseas pig-producing industries receive the benefit of government subsidies.

          Senator O'Chee raised this issue during the matters of public interest discussion earlier. He drew the Senate's attention to the alarming fact that Qantas serves on its menu, printed for every overseas tourist to read, Canadian bacon. I want to know what is wrong with Australian bacon. It is bad enough that Qantas chooses to use it, but it is worse that it promotes it. Qantas is our national carrier and should be supporting our national industries.

          As I have said, many other pork-producing nations subsidise their industries. We have seen the situation where the Danes, for example, were landing legs of pork in Singapore for a cheaper price than we could produce pigs here. Even though the United States has proven the Canadian product to be subsidised, the Australian Government chooses to ignore this. Senator Archer told us a little about diseases that pig meat could suffer.

        The Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account is a very important document which details the various mining royalty equivalents that are paid into the account each year. I note that in the financial year under consideration it is in the order of $33m. The report addresses the manner in which disbursements are made from that trust account. Some 40 per cent of the annual allocation is made available to the land councils for their administrative purposes, and then there are various other  distributions.

         I address two points. I note that for the first time for a number of years no grants have been made under section 64(7) which, in effect, are the Minister's discretionary grants for additional administrative costs of the land councils. It is pleasing to note that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has not under this report made those additional grants which for many years his predecessor, the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, made from this account direct to the land councils. Under Minister Hand those disbursements were many, many millions of dollars which went in administrative services and not in direct assistance or grants to Aboriginal organisations or for the benefit of Aboriginal people. The disbursements for administration are still very high—$14m in this financial year.

         Secondly, an issue about the report that concerns me relates to applications for grant approvals, particularly as they relate to the purchase of pastoral properties. In various tables attached to the report I note significant numbers of applications. The number of applications and from where received are fully detailed on page 8. Only a very small number subsequently eventuated into approved applications for grant funding. They are detailed on page 9. The most significant area that is detailed is that $17m of a total grant funding approval of $20m is for the purchase of pastoral properties.

         The report clearly states that in this financial year settlement took place in respect of only one of the four stations acquired, set out on page 10. Fitzroy Station was financed for $2.6m, Muckaty Station for $730,000, Elsey Station for $4.8m and Mistake Creek Station for just over $5m, yet the only settlement was with regard to the $730,000 grant approval for Muckaty. Therefore, some $12m has been transferred into the next financial year for the purchase of the other three Aboriginal pastoral properties.

         Such significant grants from this trust account need to be read alongside the other moneys that are made available through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission for the purchase of pastoral properties elsewhere. The land councils have access out of other trust accounts. I have no objection to Aboriginal people owning, running and operating pastoral properties. However, the long term operation and viability of a pastoral property depend on the continuing management plan.

        I have not noticed any reports having yet been tabled for the Northern or Central Land Councils, and I hope that they will be forthcoming in the near future. The Tiwi Land Council is based on Melville and Bathurst Islands to the north of Darwin. It is an important land council and has attracted the commendation and praise of a number of senators for a number of years because of the competent manner in which it conducts its activities. This report goes a long way in setting out the success of the various business enterprises and community activities that are conducted on behalf of the Tiwi people on both Melville and Bathurst Islands. I commend the report to all senators as illustrating success stories on the manner of conducting Aboriginal businesses and community lifestyles.

We were very pleased at the response of the people we met and the courtesies that were extended to us by members of the Tiwi Land Council in explaining their various activities.

The report draws our attention to those plans for mineral explorations and where they are proceeding. I am aware that since the end of the financial year under consideration in the report the Tiwi Land Council has endorsed and written up agreements with Renison which have been approved and endorsed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, Barry Coulter.

         This is an important future long term initiative. When these projects are up and running successfully, there will be employment, investment opportunities and a considerable cash flow. Any major project development always seems to draw the immediate reaction of the radical environmental movements and similar people. This project is now engendering, as have so many other projects on Aboriginal land, controversy in the media. From reading this report and from the discussions I have had with executives of the Tiwi Land Council and the residents of both Melville Island and Bathurst Island, I do not believe it is of the major concern that has been purported and reported in the media.

It will enhance the lifestyle; it will enhance investment; it will enhance the employment opportunities of the Tiwi people to ensure that those major resource projects are not hindered by policies of this Federal Government, as has been evident in so many other Aboriginal projects, such as Coronation Hill. I wish the Tiwi Islanders well in their continuing pursuits.

          . At the outset, the Committee notes that there is an urgent need for change in the perception of education in this country. We need to recognise that at present our education system is not addressing the real issues in education today; that is, how to produce the multi-skilled, creative and adaptive work force that is necessary for Australia to progress towards the twenty-first century.

          International comparisons show that it is vital in our future that we overcome our thinking of education and training as separate concepts in order to achieve this multi-skilling. For many years Germany has given technical education a higher status, particularly emphasising the service sector as opposed to the more traditional trades. This has contributed to the strength of the German economy and made its work force one of the most efficient and productive.

          In order to achieve this objective of both a general and vocational education for young people in Australia, both schools in general and the TAFE colleges in particular will have to change the what, the how and the why of what they teach. Schools will have to become concerned with issues of broad future employment prospects and the provision of broad vocational education. TAFE colleges will have to recognise that vocational courses must be more concerned with generalised competencies than the traditional craft-based apprenticeship courses.

          The report proposes an entirely different future for young people. It proposes that all young people should undergo sufficient post-compulsory education and training to complete year 12 or some equivalent post-secondary qualification and that at least half should go on to higher levels of education. The report has a very clear set of guidelines to achieve this target. All young people would be guaranteed a place in school or TAFE institutions after year 10 for two years of full time education or three years part time. Next, consideration is given to the essential studies required by all young people in preparation for employment. These key competencies include a range of skills, including not only the traditional disciplines but also cultural, interpersonal and problem solving skills.

          Industry is crying out for a more efficient, skilled and knowledgeable work force that will maintain and enhance productivity in the workplace. Young people today are becoming more and more disillusioned with the education system. The relevance of Australia's education system and its ability to satisfy the requirements for the future of this country is addressed in this report and its findings should be very carefully considered by the Senate. Implementation of the report's recommendations will ensure that, whatever educational training is being undertaken, young people will develop these key competencies. Speed and urgency are needed for the implementation of these changes to our education system. It is through our education system that we produce an efficient multi-skilled work force that can lead Australia into the future with a more competitive economy.

          Also addressed in this report is the issue of how to fund these changes to the education system. Unless the issue of funding is properly addressed, 100,000 students will continue to be turned away from TAFE colleges. This is yet another report which urgently recommends that the Government rethink the funding procedures for TAFE so that the sector can expand rapidly. The Committee gives the Government of this country a clear choice—educate or perish: ensure the proper education of our young people or let this country slip even further behind the rest of the world in it's people's quality and quantity of knowledge and skills provided.

          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Export of Educational Services
          </emphasis>
          . The area has already been considered very carefully by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its own inquiry into education exports. This examination played a very important part in achieving a large number of amendments to an extremely sloppy piece of legislation which the Government attempted to steamroll through the Parliament last year. It is not ideal, even in its current form, but it is, fortunately, vastly improved because of the result of Senate scrutiny.

          The legislation and this Industry Commission report are a response by the Government to a rapidly growing export market. The number of international students coming to Australia has grown rapidly since 1986. That was the time when public institutions were first permitted to enrol foreign students and to charge fees. Student arrivals more than doubled between 1986 and 1989. The report states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Government regulation of this industry since its beginning in 1986 has been characterised by sudden shifts in policy direction, the effects of which have been made more serious by the way in which decisions were reached and subsequently communicated to those directly affected, in Australia and overseas.
        </para>
        <para>
         The result of these simplistic knee-jerk reactions by the Government to complex problems has been a significant loss to Australia of large parts of its export education industry as the number of students coming to Australia for English language intensive courses and other short courses fell significantly because of tightened procedures. For instance, there was a dramatic reduction in the number of students from China from 22,000 in 1989 to less than 1,200 in 1990. Under the priority entry requirements, about 5 per cent of applications from China have been rejected, but the rejection rate increased to 95 per cent during 1990.

          Every effort must now be made to restore our education export industry. There has been an alarming number of closures of private colleges which have previously offered English and business courses for students from overseas. This is extremely damaging to our reputation as an exporter of educational services and is seriously affecting the number of bona fide students coming to Australia to study. Five English language colleges collapsed in Sydney last year, leaving overseas students who had paid their fees in advance without funds and without the means to finish their courses. Last year a private college in Canberra also closed down when staff and students were locked out as a result of the owners failing to pay the rent. Students had already paid their fees for their courses, but they had no prospect of completing the courses or obtaining any qualifications. In this instance, the University of Canberra, fortunately, was able to accommodate all the students without additional cost.

          Clearly, the export industry is of cultural and economic importance to Australia. It is important to the international students and it is important to our educational institutions. For some institutions, overseas students have become a significant revenue source. Increased financial returns from education exports can advantage the domestic economy and it can improve the facilities and staff student ratios in institutions. Development of education as an export industry also brings less tangible benefits from the links established with people in geographical regions closest to Australia.

          The report itemises the benefits of overseas students to Australia. As in the case of all exports, there are benefits to the balance of payments and, given the present economic situation in Australia, every effort needs to be made to increase exports and remove obstacles which discourage students from seeking educational services.

          The Industry Commission notes that many benefits from education exports occur when students return home. The education export industry is valuable, it is important and it must stay. I commend this report to the Senate and I recommend vigilance by the Senate to prevent the uncertainty and embarrassment which result from the closure of colleges experiencing financial difficulties and inappropriate responses such as those attempted by this Labor Government in recent times.

          It is surely self-evident that these developments should have a profound effect on Australia's defence doctrine. Yet the impression gained from this report is that it is business as usual. One exception, which is in tune with our times, is Australia's contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. I commend those now serving in the force, and others yet to join them, for their valuable contribution to regional security and human rights.

          However, in most respects, the report looks embarrassingly out of date. We read that the Australian Defence Force promotes `strategic stability and security in our region'. Australian diplomacy surely plays a far more important role, yet the huge imbalance in resources—under which the foreign affairs budget is 5 per cent of the defence vote—is not even questioned. Our security depends much more on economic vitality than military strength, yet huge sums are being poured into increasingly irrelevant capital projects—$4.6 billion for new submarines and $4.3 billion for the Anzac frigates—when our national infrastructure remains run down and under-funded. A dollar invested in upgrading our rail network to fast freight train status would create far more jobs than investing the same dollar in submarine construction, thus strengthening another pillar of our national security—social cohesion.

          I now want to raise a specific matter in the report, namely the proposed relocation of Newington armament depot from Sydney to Jervis Bay. The long awaited review of alternative sites to Jervis Bay mentioned in the report remains under wraps, despite Senator Richardson's earlier commitment to release it. I understand that the Minister has no intention of honouring that commitment. This cynicism is compounded by an outrageous piece of Navy disinformation aimed at winning local acceptance of the move. It is a colour map on which the Jervis Bay ammunitioning pipeline is depicted as an innocuous 15 kilometre journey between the proposed depot and the wharf—conveniently omitting the 200 kilometre section between Jervis Bay and the Kingswood armament depot in Penrith, over which 450 truckloads of high explosive missiles and torpedoes would be shipped each year over busy highways and through numerous towns, against the opposition of several local councils.

          —In October last year, the Senate agreed to a package of fisheries legislation after a major review by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and many—80—amendments. The new legislation came in response to what can only be described as a disastrous record of Commonwealth fisheries management.

          In response to the many misgivings expressed about the adequacy of the legislation to improve matters, the Minister agreed that the legislation be referred to the Committee again in a year; that is, in October of this year. By then, AFMA—that is, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority—would be up and running and we would be able to assess the legal framework about which there was much controversy. We would also have the benefit of the Industry Commission's final report on cost recovery for fisheries management. This report is before us today.

          I turn now to the state of Australian fisheries. We are all used to the dismal science of the economists at the Industry Commission but the picture painted by this report is more dismal than usual. Most Commonwealth fisheries are over-fished, some to the point of total collapse—for example, the Bass Strait scallops. Others are getting close. The gemfish population has been so depleted that there is real concern as to whether it will recover. The southern shark fishery, the source of flake, is threatened with closure or, at a minimum, drastic reductions in catches until it recovers.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We are all aware of the problems in the south-east trawl fishery, where again huge reductions in catches are necessary. But the report says that it will take an extra $21m in research over the next five years to work out what sustainable catches should be for all the major species involved. Of all the major Commonwealth fisheries, only the northern banana resource is in good shape. It is some consolation, I suppose, to know that our two most valuable export fisheries—prawns and lobsters—are the most robust. The report gives the credit for this to the integration of research and management, putting management of the resource before management of the fishing industry, and close communication and trust between the fishing industry, researchers and managers.

          But even in these fisheries, there is substantial over-capacity in the fishing industry. The problem of too many fishermen chasing too few fish is even bigger for those fisheries where catches are plummeting. This problem has actually been exacerbated by inept Commonwealth management in the past. This has spilled over to State managed fisheries as well. Recently, fishermen have been adjusting out of the northern prawn and south-east trawl fisheries into adjacent State fisheries, where the level of effort was already excessive. The result is that fisheries resources throughout the AFZ are being hammered to death, regardless of political boundaries. Urgent reform of Commonwealth-State roles is imperative.

          The report highlights the folly of Commonwealth-State jurisdictional divisions within marine ecosystems. I agree with the Commission that urgent action is required by the Commonwealth and the States to rationalise management to ensure that a single agency manages a fishery. Unless this parochialism is overcome, the alternative will be to teach the fish to read the lines painted on the water, but I am afraid there will not be any fish left to teach.

          The poor results of past management are made even worse by their high cost. In 1990-91 about $28m was spent by all agencies involved in the management of Commonwealth fisheries. About $15m of this was for research, and about $8m for regulations, administration, licensing and surveillance of the fishing industry. Another $1m or so was spent on management of the commercial fishing industry itself for things like restructuring.

The report describes the role of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, which includes policy development and planning. The One Nation statement is relevant in this regard because it states new policy concerning the integration of economic and environmental considerations in the process of establishing national parks. The One Nation statement says that `when considering proposals to establish new national parks or marine parks and reserves, and where such action would constrain future access to resources within them, a prior assessment of the economic values and potential of the area will be routinely carried out'.

          The Democrats totally reject such an approach for reasons which have also been stated clearly as the view of conservation groups at page 146 of the report of the Ecologically Sustainable Development—Mining Working Group. That view is that it is inappropriate to engage in a trade-off between economic and ecological values because, firstly, there is an increasing scarcity of relatively unmodified, natural ecosystems in Australia; secondly, there are always environmental risks associated with resource surveys; thirdly, that if circumstances arise where a protected area contains the only remaining accessible mineral resource, then fundamental questions need to be asked about the sustainability of a society which has, in less than 200 years, driven us to that situation; and finally, the same minerals can often be found and exploited elsewhere.

As an island continent, Australia's ecosystems and biodiversity need to be managed as a whole.

          Another matter which is discussed in this report which I wish to raise relates to the Australian biological resources study. ABRS identifies what kinds of plants and animals there are in Australia and where these plants and animals can be found. It has been estimated that, because of the very paltry funding that ABRS receives, at present rates the ABRS will not complete its task of identifying the animals and plants, their relationships and where they are found until the year 3000. By that time, at the rate we are going, most of them will no longer exist.

          It is critical to the management of our natural environment that we know what is there and how these species interact. It is important that we discover these things as quickly as possible. The ABRS must therefore be expanded. It must incorporate a program to survey the type and location of all major Australian flora and fauna; incorporate a national land capability assessment program of the Australian continent, Australian ocean, fisheries and all territories; and establish an environmental resource library that provides access to data and modelling capabilities to interested non-government organisations on the same principle as a public library. We believe, therefore, that funding for the ABRS should be substantially upgraded to at least $24m per year.

        I congratulate the Honeybee and Research Development Council on its annual report for 1991 and for the work it does in helping to increase and promote the honey and beekeeping industries in Australia. I believe that this is a very important matter because in the year 1991 the honey industry, like so many others, experienced many challenges and changes. Indeed, the Chairman of the Council noted in the report that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Like many other rural industries, the honey industry has experienced challenges to its viability, ranging from resource security through to a sensible price for honey and other bee products on the domestic and international markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        These challenges include not only the domestic and international environment, but also the legislative changes made by the Government. On page 3 of the report, the Chairman noted:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Council is in discussion with the industry over the ramifications of the decision by Mr Kerin (when he was Minister for Primary Industry) to terminate the Australian Honey Board.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further reading of this report identifies that the key to successful beekeeping is effective hive and business management. However, the degree of success varies significantly as there is a wide range in the yield per hive which apiarists achieve within the same area. This difference indicates that there are benefits to be gained from extension which promotes more efficient beekeeping practices.

         I note on page 16 of the report that one means by which the Council is promoting more efficient beekeeping practices is by recording and disseminating the sound beekeeping practices of successful beekeepers. This has been brought about by the recognition that many successful beekeepers throughout Australia have acquired a wealth of knowledge and understanding of beekeeping practices that lead to profitable enterprise. With the retirement of some of the older beekeepers, there is considerable danger that much of this valuable information will be lost unless it is documented. The Council believes that efforts should be made to capture this knowledge for the benefit of other beekeepers who are presently in the industry and for the benefit of those who enter the profession in years to come.

         One successful company which should be used as a fine example in this industry is one from my home State of Queensland. The Brisbane-based Honey Corporation of Australia, producer of the Capilano brand, is a low-profile company with high-profile brands. This 43-year-old company's products sit on the shelves of virtually every supermarket and grocery store in Australia and are significantly represented overseas.

          —At the risk of seeming to speak too much in the Senate this afternoon, I wish to speak to the motion concerning the Family Court of Australia annual report 1990-91. The Family Court of Australia exists because, increasingly, Australian men and women do not hesitate to tear up marital commitments, to shirk marital obligations and to abuse their former spouses and, in particular, their children either by neglect or by physical abuse.

          This situation is best illustrated when we read that approximately one marriage in three ends in divorce and that each year there are 2.5 divorces for every 1,000 people. Each year, the Family Court deals with over 100,000 adult litigants, more than 150,000 children and many more people who are involved without being litigants. No other court has anything like this volume of business or contact with the Australian public.

         A total of 42,635 divorces were granted by the Family Courts of Australia and Western Australia in 1990.

        <para>
         It is 16 years since the Family Law Act came onto the Australian legal landscape. Divorce is a dreadfully sad thing, but what we have to remember is that when there is a divorce it represents the breakdown of another family unit. Ultimately, the health of society depends on the stability, well-being and harmonious functioning of the family.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">

          It was once said that civilisation can be lost in a single generation if the value systems are not preserved and passed on through the family. The Family Law Act in its entirety has led to a disintegration of many of those value systems. It was one of the most discriminatory, ill-considered and badly drafted Bills to be ever introduced into the Australian Parliament. It discriminated against those who do not want their marriages to be dissolved at the whim of the other party.

          It is a fact of life that in marriage the longer it lasts, the woman's independence and her main economic ability to fend for herself become less. Women are not given the protection and support to which they are entitled as wives and mothers of the future generations of Australians. It takes away from women security and legal safeguards and, in the guise of enabling marriages to be dissolved with dignity, enables all marriages to be dissolved on the unilateral decision of either party on short notice. In other words, it reduces marriage to a purely temporary union with little or no protection for women and children.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It turns marriage into a cheap, temporary union which may be dissolved on the unilateral decision of one party. It creates a climate which leads to a light-hearted approach to marriage. Frank Stewart, who was a Minister in the Whitlam Government at the time the legislation was introduced, was a fierce opponent of it. He said:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Under the cloak of removing injustice, humiliation and indignity from divorce, new injustices, new humiliations and new indignities are created.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What could be more humiliating, more unjust, or cause greater distress and hurt to a spouse than to be abandoned without cause by his or her partner merely at the whim of such partner as a matter of convenience on 12 months notice?
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This is not divorce because the marriage has irretrievably or otherwise broken down; it is the destruction of marriage by abandonment.
        </para>
        <para>
         Another speaker, Kevin Cairns, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The powerhouse clauses (of the Act). . . concern the nature of the marriage itself, and make it clear that the package no fault is not a package that has any truth; that the so-called relegation of indignity and bitterness is not relegated.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         All that is done is that it is swept under the carpet and allowed to fester in the hearts, minds, activities and feelings of those who have been wronged, which in most cases is the dependent partner in a marriage. It certainly is not a Bill which has anything to do with the rights or equality of women in that situation.

         Many honourable senators would be aware of the high number of constituents who have come to them with complaints. Let us ask ourselves: what have been the social and economic consequences for the community of this Act? As I said earlier, it has been an increase in the number of divorces in the community. That is one of the problems. Children have suffered the psychological damage of family collapse, the loss of security, torn affections and both emotional and material disturbance. The Bishop of Toowoomba wrote to the

         Briefly, dealing with the chronology of the matters in Western Australia, it is worth noting that the Western Australian Government was advised in November 1991 that the then senator Jo Vallentine would resign on 31 January 1992 and that the Greens in Western Australia had nominated Christabel Chamarette as her replacement. So there was plenty of foreknowledge by the Government of Western Australia—indeed, by this chamber and everybody else—as to what was intended.

On Wednesday, 5 February, the Western Australia Parliament began a special sitting to pass the juvenile justice legislation and both Houses were notified of the vacancy in the Senate.

         On Thursday, 6 February, the Legislative Assembly adjourned without any joint sitting being held or asked for to appoint Christabel Chamarette to the vacant position, and on 7 February the Legislative Council adjourned. On Tuesday, 11 February, the Western Australian Premier advised Ms Chamarette that the Solicitor-General had confirmed that the appointment must be made by a joint sitting of the Western Australian Parliament. The Premier also stated that this would be done when Parliament resumed on or after 12 March. In other words, in that brief chronology we see that notification was received in time for the joint sitting, which was held on 5 February, to adequately discharge its responsibility with respect to making the appointment.

         The only other points I wish to make have adequately been made in the past in relation to similar situations which have arisen where vacancies have occurred either by death or resignation.

         of 17 June 1970—Senator Greenwood said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . upon the death of Senator McKellar on 13th April, a letter was forwarded in the usual form to the Governor of New South Wales by the President of the Senate on 14th April. On 16th April a reply from the Governor of New South Wales indicated his acknowledgment of receipt of that letter and his indication that he would bring it to the attention of his Ministers. Nothing has occurred since 16th April.

        He went on to say:

        . . . I believe that this is a matter that affects the Senate and that a situation such as has developed ought not to be allowed to develop without something being said about it in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then drew attention to the Constitution. Senator Greenwood, quoted Quick and Garran:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is a principle of the Constitution that the representation of States in the Senate should be maintained, as far as possible, with unbroken continuity, and that no State should be, for any time longer than absolutely necessary, short in its representation and consequently deficient in its political strength in the Council of States.
       </para>
       <para>
        That really only needs to be put into the record again because I wholeheartedly agree with those sentiments. In the same debate, Senator Murphy supported the concern being expressed at the lack of alacrity, or the slowness, with which the New South Wales Government had discharged its responsibility in filling the vacancy. He said, amongst other things:

        That seems to me to sum up the matter. Here we have an opportunity by the Western Australian Government to fill this casual vacancy; the opportunity was there and it was not taken.

         —The Western Australian Government received legal advice from the Solicitor-General that it would be improper for the Governor-General in Council to appoint a replacement senator for Western Australia. The State Government decided to act in accordance with that advice. It is true that there was a one-day sitting of the State Parliament. That was a sitting called for a special purpose; it was not the joint sitting which is required for the purpose of replacing a senator.

         However, if people think that Western Australia is being unjustly or unnecessarily deprived of its full Senate representation in the Federal Parliament, the finger should be pointed not at the State Government but at Senator Vallentine, who resigned her position on 31 January. As she left the Senate, she gave three reasons, one of which was ill health. No doubt she was tired, having travelled incessantly around the country delivering sanctimonious sermons on the professional protest circuit and seeing how often she could get herself arrested within range of a television camera. People do not usually give six months notice of health enforced retirement, as Senator Vallentine did, let alone forecast the precise day on which their health would deteriorate to the point where there was no option other than retirement, even though she had still been playing on the protest circuit a week or two before.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The second reason Senator Vallentine gave was a desire to spend more time with her family—a common enough desire but not highly developed enough in March of 1990, less than two years before her retirement, when she sought re-election to the Senate. The third reason—and we are getting into the nitty-gritty here—was that she retired, to use her own words, `in accordance with the Green principle of rotating jobs'. For four years, Senator Vallentine—ex-Country Party, ex-Nuclear Disarmament Party, ex-Independent—sat in the Senate as a Western Australian Green senator. She preached the abstemious Green doctrine of self-denial and forgone consumption, lower real incomes and lower levels of material consumption. She then, with breathtaking hypocrisy, tried to pull the big financial scam to convert the $85,000 lump sum superannuation payment—to which she was, by the relevant Act of Parliament, entitled—into a $165,000 lump sum payment, plus a lifetime indexed pension of $16,500. I think the hypocrisy of that is so great that I do not really need to say any more about it.

         However, I make one related observation. More than 30.4 per cent of the Green candidates in the recent Tasmanian election were school teachers, who therefore, as Greens, preach the same doctrine of self-denial, forgone material consumption and so on. I have not noticed any resistance within the teachers union to the demands for continuing increases in teachers' real incomes. While they preach the doctrine of self-denial in public fora and in the Parliament, they obviously do not preach it within the teachers union, otherwise some countervailing power would have developed.

Does she too subscribe to the Green principle of rotating jobs and, if so, will she after serving six years in the Parliament also resign and then follow the precedent established by Senator Vallentine of trying to pull the big financial scam?

I came into this place late in the last sitting to listen to Senator Vallentine's valedictory speech for light entertainment.

         One of the issues that this motion raises is the history of replacing casual vacancies in the Senate and, as was referred to briefly by Senator Coulter, it has been politicised by both sides of politics in Australia's history. It is something that should not be politicised; it is something that brings the role of the Senate into sharp focus. That is an issue always close to my heart. No matter what happens in Australian politics, no matter what political observers say about the Senate, it should have a role in sticking up for States interests and States rights. It is no longer politically popular to talk about States rights, but we have seen here in Canberra in the past week a very good example of how honourable senators can make a difference for their State and their States interests. At the Labor Party's caucus meeting, none other than Senator Colston ensured that the Bill on daylight saving put forward by the honourable member for Stirling, Ronald Edwards, was defeated in the Caucus.

But even if the Solicitor-General and the Premier are right in accepting that advice, there was no reason why, when the Western Australian Parliament got together for a two-day special sitting to debate the juvenile justice legislation, it could not have called the two Houses together for two or three minutes to confirm the nomination of Senator-elect Chamarette to represent Western Australia.

         I put Senator Vallentine's record in front of both the chamber and the Western Australian electorate. Indeed, I encourage Ms Chamarette to take great notice of it because it is truly an appalling record. Certainly the attendance of the former senator in the chamber was not quite so bad. Out of a total of 530 days over that six years and seven months that she was a senator for the State of Western Australia, Senator Vallentine came to this place on 471 occasions.

         However, the work of the chamber is a different matter. The work of the chamber can be measured by divisions which are held within the chamber. In Senator Vallentine's first six months as a member of this place she participated in seven out of 53 divisions. In the next 12 months—January to December 1986—there were 189 divisions. The bells rang 189 times and the then Senator Vallentine attended here on one occasion.

        It is the first part of that standing order that is of note. There has been publicity in Western Australia about the fact that the State Government knew well in advance when Senator Vallentine was going to retire—and I am not going to resile from that. Notice was given in September last year that Senator Vallentine was going to get a headache on 31 January and would not be able to continue in this place as a representative of the people of Western Australia. That is certainly on the record.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         However, the rules of the Parliament of Western Australia state that it is not the retiring senator who has to give notice. The senator gives notice to the Governor of the State, or the Governor of the State is informed, and then the machinery of the Western Australian legislature turns into action after the Governor advises the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council and the Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. That could not happen until after Senator Vallentine had presented her resignation to the President of this place, Senator Sibraa. That happened on 31 January this year.

         The machinery started, and I understand that notice was given by the Governor of Western Australia to the Parliamentary Officers in Western Australia in the first week in February. I understand that because of the unique situation in Western Australia, the Parliament is technically still in session—it has not been prorogued—and that no date for a joint sitting of that Parliament could be arranged until, as I understand is going to happen, on the seventeenth day of this month. That is Saint Patrick's Day, and it is probably appropriate that a Green senator should be elected in the State of Western Australia on St Patrick's Day.

         I want to move on to another constitutional difficulty which arises out of the imbroglio that we are part of. Section 15 of the Australian Constitution, a constitution which we in this place are governed by, states how the State Houses have to go about electing their representatives. I will not take the time of the Senate by quoting the matter in full, but it gives the option for the Executive Council to appoint a senator if the Parliament is not in session—and, indeed, it is not at the moment in Western Australia.

         This has happened on three occasions in the past: in 1952, Senator Cooke; in 1966, Senator Withers; and in 1974, Senator Reid. Appointment was made by the Governor to fill the vacancy in each case. The Parliament was merely adjourned but not prorogued at the time the vacancy was notified. In 1952 and 1966 a joint sitting of the Parliament later purported to confirm the appointments, but in 1974 there was no joint sitting to confirm that appointment. However, no challenge was made to any of the three appointments. There is advice from the Solicitor-General in Western Australia that if the State Government had had to proceed with the appointment through Executive Council, it was open to legal challenge. Constitutional lawyers would be much better and much more able to address this point than I am. I understand Senator Walsh made some reference to the fact that the Western Australian Solicitor-General did make some comment on that.

         I put these things on the record because Senator Campbell referred to the fact that Western Australians are perhaps seen to be a little disadvantaged. I know that there were some colleagues on the Opposition benches who felt that not only was this side disadvantaged by Senator Devereux's long absence from this place, but that the Senate chamber itself was disadvantaged because it did not have its full quota of senators to call upon.

         I conclude by saying that the situation is unfortunate, but these circumstances could have been overcome if the previous incumbent, Senator Vallentine as she was, had given notice of the fact that she was too ill to continue in this place. I wish her very good health for the future and my wishes are extended to her family, but if she knew that she was too ill to continue, she could have taken steps—between September, through October, November and the early part of December—to ensure that her resignation was received in this place so that the message could have been conveyed to the authorities in Western Australia. That should have been done in plenty of time to ensure that the State was in no way disadvantaged by the fact that at the moment we do not have our full quota of senators. The timing of the resignation was not in the hands of the Government of Western Australia, and I believe that the State Government is not in any way manipulating the system to disadvantage the elected person who will succeed Senator Vallentine.

I want to address that issue in my remarks. The Labor Government of Western Australia has shown no respect for the Senate and the Federal Parliament in its delay in appointing a twelfth senator from my State in succession to Senator Vallentine. As a convinced federalist, it is my firm belief that our system can endure only if there is mutual respect between the two different levels of government.

         There are firm precedents for the appointment of senators to such casual vacancies by the State Governor in Council on occasions when State Parliaments are not sitting. I am aware that some of the cases have been referred to today by previous speakers. This is an essential practice, given the long recesses that occur at State level. It would have assisted had Senator McKiernan mentioned actual incidents and the way in which these replacements have taken place in the past. In Western Australia the Parliament does not normally sit between the first week in December and the middle of March.

         Senator Bell's name was mentioned earlier. I point out that on 7 March 1990 Senator Bell was appointed by the Executive Council in Tasmania. More particularly, in Western Australia on 11 March 1981 former Senator Martyr was appointed by the Governor in succession to former Senator Rocher to represent the Liberal Party, and was confirmed when State Parliament met on 25 March. Therefore, I believe that the precedent is obvious.

         On 16 January 1974 there is an even more telling precedent because, under the Tonkin Labor Government of Western Australia, Senator David Reid was appointed by the Governor on the resignation of Country Party Senator Prowse.

         Furthermore, former Senator Reg Withers was appointed by the Governor of Western Australia to succeed former Senator Sir Shane Paltridge on 17 February 1966, and that was not confirmed by the State Parliament until 9 August that year. That was a period from February to August, and it makes a mockery of statements to the effect that the Government has not had an opportunity to put senator-elect Chamarette into the Senate. I could quote further precedents, but the point has been squarely made that the Lawrence Labor Government has defied convention, and that is the sad part about the matter. Surely if that Government had been troubled by genuine legal doubt, the proper course would have been to make the appointment, as appointments have been made in the past, and deal with any challenge later.

         Since 1977 there has been a very clear imperative for all State governments to honour the wishes of the electors of their State and to fill any Senate vacancy without delay. This was the effect of one of the few successful amendments to the Constitution in recent years, namely, section 15. That  move won overwhelming support from Australian electors, who insisted that Senate vacancies be filled by a nominee of the same party. Although that amendment was sponsored by the coalition Government, it had the fervent support of the ALP, whose members waxed indignant over the actions of the Askin and Bjelke-Petersen State governments in refusing to replace resigning and deceased Labor senators with Labor nominees. The fact that those members performed like trained seals at that time highlights the fact that they should come to grips with the situation and act according to the spirit of those amendments as well as the letter to ensure that they are carried out.

         The electors of Western Australia who voted for an independent Green in 1990 are fully entitled to continued representation. Every Western Australian, whoever we voted for, is entitled to be represented by 12 rather than 11 senators. It is a long bow for Senator McKiernan to draw in seeking to compare what Senator Vallentine did with what it is hoped senator-elect Chamarette will or will not be doing. It is sad that a State is being denied that representation purely based on the fact that Senator Vallentine was a poor attendee in this place.

         The Lawrence Labor Government can hardly claim to have been taken by surprise in this matter, as has been clearly outlined here today. Former Senator Vallentine announced her resignation in September and said that it would take effect on 31 January. I agree with Senator McKiernan that the Western Australian Government could not have taken any initiative in making a formal replacement until after that date, until the letter had been received by the President of the Senate, but that does not alter the fact that there is another course which can be taken and, on this occasion, should be taken.

         While I was certainly not impressed at the casual and leisurely pace of former Senator Vallentine's departure, particularly as health reasons were given, the point remains that the State Government knew precisely what the situation would be and when it would arise. In January the State Government decided to have a special sitting of Parliament in February. It could at least have said, `Here is an opportunity where we can agree to this and have a joint sitting', so that Senator-elect Chamarette could take her place here when the Senate resumed later that month. Seldom has a State government been given more notice of a Senate vacancy, and I think it should have acted accordingly.

         The precedent that the Carmen Lawrence Labor Government has created not only is an insult to the Senate and the electors of Western Australia but also has very dangerous implications. The next time there is a Senate vacancy may well not be a time that is chosen by a retiring senator—it could be due to ill health, death or a number of other reasons. On that occasion, it may be politically convenient for a State government to leave a Federal Government or, in fact, a Federal Opposition short of a senator for as long as possible when contentious legislation is before the Senate.

         Senator McKiernan mentioned the problem we had with respect to Senator Devereux. In that case, the Opposition extended a pair so that the balance in the Senate remained the same. On this occasion, particularly with an independent to whom pairs are not granted, that position does not apply. It shows that at a time when there may be highly contentious legislation before the Senate a State government could take the Lawrence Government lead and manipulate it to the point that it could have very serious implications for a government or an opposition.

         While I am sure that I would disagree profoundly with the views Christabel Chamarette may put forward—for example, with respect to the Forests Protection Bill—I consider it grossly wrong and unfair that her Party should be unrepresented in such a debate that has been scheduled for the Senate this week. Okay, it has not come up this week, but it was scheduled by the Government for debate this week. I believe that the State Government should not have denied Christabel Chamarette the right to put her position, and the position of the people whom she represents, in that debate. It is ironic that a prospective senator who may take a greater interest in the work of the Senate than did her predecessor—it is certainly hoped that she does—is denied her seat because of the actions of a State Labor Government.

This Government had to be pushed into every action about all of the grubby little deals that it has done, yet here it is now trying to take the high moral road and saying, `We have to approve Senator-elect Chamarette to come to the Federal Senate'. That is not so. It can be done; it has been done. Why is it not being done on this occasion? The improprieties of a scandal-ridden Labor Government are a matter of shame for the people of Western Australia. Now this habitual impropriety has spilled over to an insult to the Senate, a denial of representation to all Western Australians, injustice to certain individuals and a sinister precedent in defiance of the Constitution. I think this motion deserves support for the variety of reasons that I have outlined to the Senate this afternoon.

I wish to pick up a point which was made by a speaker on the other side without getting into a debate about precedent. In my mind there is a clear distinction between a State government which ultimately has the right in respect of an appointment, which chooses not to make a certain appointment, and a State government which simply delays the appointment. One is an overt deliberate act, in the sense of making a determination in respect of candidates, and the other is in many respects more Machiavellian and political. The Constitution is now substantially changed so the activities that took place in the past are no longer available to State governments.

         We now have the circumstance where Senator Vallentine resigned from the Senate on 31 January having notified the Western Australian Government and the Premier of that State on 1 November of her intention to do so, as I understand it. Thirty-four days after her official formal resignation, Ms Chamarette has not yet been sworn in. It is not as if the State Government has not been meeting. The Parliament of Western Australia met on both 5 and 6 February. It met for political reasons, granted, but it was consequential enough for Premier Carmen Lawrence to come scurrying back from Italy to Perth. It seems to me that that would have been an ideal and practical opportunity to have addressed the matter of the appointment of Ms Chamarette. However, it seemed that the Government was more interested in locking up 14-year-old Aboriginal children—children who had not yet reached the period of wisdom and knowledge—than it was in appointing a representative of that State to this chamber. There seems to be no reason that I can detect why that appointment could not have been made on that occasion.

         When it comes to political stunts, political grandstanding, political populism and the hard reality of politics, the State Labor Government can very quickly call the Parliament together for the purpose it chooses. On that occasion it considered one piece of legislation that was so serious that it brought back various members of parliament from their junkets around the world. Having done that, it did not have the commonsense or the decency or the integrity to make the appointment it should have made at that time. It took no more than a rally, an uprising from the people of Western Australia about the abysmal record of that Government in law and order for the Government to decide overnight that the legislation was a matter of urgency and that it would recall the Parliament to jam through legislation designed to placate the vocal members of the Western Australian public.

         Senator Knowles made the point that there is a clear distinction between denying a voice to an independent and denying a voice to a member of a major political party. The Labor Government of Western Australia is denying all Western Australians a voice in this chamber. More particularly, I remind the Senate that there were 14,521 first votes—that is not very many in a Senate election—for Senator Vallentine. In other words, 14,521 people put their No. 1 vote alongside Senator Vallentine's name. It was their intention that she be their representative. In total votes, the Greens in Western Australian attracted 60,923 votes—6.7 per cent of the vote. That group of people whose intention it was to be represented by Senator Vallentine, whatever shade of politics she was embracing at that time—whether it be anti-nuclear, Greens or whatever—chose her as their duly elected representative.

In the case of independents, it is a greater aberration than if the senator happens to be from either the Labor Party or the Liberal Party because there are others there who can articulate and express and represent the point of view of the people of Western Australia. There is no substitute voice in this chamber for the Green party.

In fact, the correspondence I have seen confirms that. Senator Vallentine was informally told on the telephone that it was a five-minute exercise, a formality, and there would be no problem.

        of 19 March 1987 concerning a motion similar to the one moved by the Democrats today. On that occasion it was moved by Senator Haines, who was the then Democrat leader. The motion was in two parts, the first part confirming that a replacement senator should be the person duly nominated by the political party. Of course, no-one opposed that. The second part, which was similar to the motion we have here tonight, condemned the conservative Gray Government of Tasmania for not appointing the appointee—that is, Senator Devereux as he now is—of the Labor Party.

         These two senators who spoke just before dinner, these confirmed federalists who said that this should not be a partisan matter and that we should not perform as trained seals and vote on party lines, voted on that issue. Of course, I expected to find the motion fully supported. But, in the

Naturally, one would expect to find that Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Knowles, consistent with what they said earlier this evening—and Senator McKiernan will attest to this; he was here—voted with the Labor Party on this non-partisan issue to oppose the deletion of any criticism of the conservative Government.

         —As Senator Collins has pointed out, this is not the first time such an issue has come before the Senate. In fact, to my knowledge this issue has been floating around for 20 or 30 years. I refer to the situation of different State governments getting different legal opinions as to their entitlement. We have seen two practices, of course, in the replacement of senators. The first one, and the most normal one, is where a combined meeting—if the State has two houses—chooses a candidate. That is very inconvenient when a candidate resigns and the State parliament is not in session. I guess on this occasion I am not sure what influenced the timing of the resignation. It is somewhat regrettable that the resignation did not coincide with the sittings of the State Parliament of Western Australia—other than, as I understand it, one extraordinary sitting to pass the very controversial Juveniles Act. I do not think this was a case where another month or two either side would have hurt in terms of the resignation. We all knew from November at least about Senator Vallentine's impending resignation.

         There is, of course, an alternative method, which I think has been used on several occasions, whereby an appointment can be made by the Executive Council, I think it is, of whatever State it is and, in turn, that appointment is later confirmed by State parliament. But it also has to be said, in some defence of the Western Australian Government, that it has to act on the legal advice that it has been given, and I understand that that is what is really motivating this agenda. There are no political agendas in this case. There is no advantage to be derived for the Labor Party generally from not having the senator-designate here at the moment. I think it is not surprising that the Western Australian Government, having obtained that legal advice, is now abiding by it.

         I am not saying, however, that that legal advice is valid, and I do not know that it can be tested.

We could well have taken this particular issue to the High Court for an advisory opinion, without a large and expensive legal case, and got a view on it which would clean it up once and for all. But, not only in this case but also in every other case like this, we run the danger of a State Attorney-General's office coming forward with advice that this matter is not without doubt, and that is the problem in this case.

         Like Senator Collins, I also want to note for the record what is a growing hypocrisy in the Opposition. This Opposition is starting to act like an entrenched Opposition—like it has been there forever and will be there forever. Its previous actions in government are constantly now forgotten and buried in the mists of time. As Senator Collins pointed out, the Liberal Party on other occasions has not supported these sorts of motions but rather has voted in the opposite manner. And that is just becoming replicated right throughout the procedures of this place.

Yet, when one went back through the record, all the recidivists there had voted for similar motions; not only for guillotines, but for gagging the guillotine debate as well. We are seeing another example of that here today; we are seeing it time and time again. The Opposition here does not fully understand the role of an opposition. It is not to oppose everything. It is not to be political on everything. But, if honourable senators opposite are going to do that, at least let us see some consistency from them. Senator Collins, I understand, praised the Democrats for being consistent on this. That is fair enough. Apparently, they are the only ones who have been consistent in this particular case.

         In summary, it is regrettable that our seventy-sixth senator is not with us today. I do not believe the Western Australian Government acted maliciously on this particular point. I think, having got the legal advice from the Attorney-General, it would have had some problems with proceeding on another course. On the question of whether this chamber has been bitterly deprived of a senator, I will reserve judgment until I see that honourable senator's ability. I do not think there has been a division in this chamber that has been as close as one vote—honourable senators may correct me if I am wrong. But this is a matter that should be dispatched as quickly as possible. Again, I do not know the date when the State Parliament is resuming. I assume it is within a week or two.

         —in reply—I will just take a few minutes to express my appreciation to Senator Knowles and Senator Campbell for their remarks in relation to this motion, and to deprecate the remarks of Senator Walsh, most of which were quite irrelevant. I can understand Senator Walsh not particularly liking Senator Vallentine or what she stood for, but the fact is that she was elected by the people of Western Australia and she had a legitimate place in this chamber. That is really the point; that her replacement, equally, has a legitimate place in this chamber, irrespective of what Senator Walsh might think of her views.

         The other point I would make in this connection—and this was picked up by Senator McKiernan—is that she was elected by the electors of Western Australia to fill a particular role as they saw it. That is the democratic principle. It does not matter what we think of our fellow senators in terms of how many times they come into the chamber or what issues they vote upon. That is not the point. The point is that with her particular views, she was elected to represent the electors of Western Australia and to express those views in this chamber. If she chose to express those views on a limited range of issues because they were the issues that concerned the electors who put her here, she was in fact fulfilling her proper function.

         we find that Senator Vallentine spoke on 259 occasions, whereas Senator McKiernan spoke on 128 occasions. In the Historic Senate

         we find that Senator Vallentine spoke on 180 occasions and Senator McKiernan on 98 occasions. So, in terms of the actual issues that she chose to take up—presumably because she was elected to take up those issues—she clearly performed her function. I think that is further indicated by the fact that she was not elected only once—the electors of Western Australia elected her again.

         I think the real point is this: that the Western Australian Parliament met on 5 February. It was a sitting at which both Houses were present. A joint sitting could have been arranged, quite contrary to what Senator Walsh seemed to imply. It probably would have taken a little longer than the two or three minutes that some senators have suggested, but certainly no more than 10 minutes. I seem to recall that Senator Lees was processed through the South Australian Parliament in about 10 minutes from beginning to end. I believe, therefore, that this motion should be supported and that the Western Australian Government has been lax in simply not taking the opportunity presented to it to fill that vacancy.

       The motion now before us is one which I believe the Senate can also support because it expresses a view which has been widely endorsed, both by the Government and also by the Opposition, that the Australian economy, in moving towards an ecologically sustainable pattern of development can, at the same time, substantially address the problem of unemployment and make a substantial attack on foreign debt.

        The definition of `sustainable development' which is often used—I know that former Senator Chaney, now Mr Chaney, has quoted it in the House of Representatives—is that contained in the Brundtland Report entitled `

         Our Common Future

        Quite clearly, what one has here is a definition which accepts not only the principle of equity within a particular generation, but also takes as quite fundamental that there should be equity between the generations. In other words, the present generation should not so use or abuse the resources which are available to it that succeeding generations do not have available to them at least the resources of an equivalent nature to meet their own needs.

        We are all aware that the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, introduced a number of committees to research the ESD program, and those committees have now reported. However, in speaking to the three chairs of the ESD working groups, he outlined four fundamental goals. The first was the improvement of individual and community well-being and welfare by following the path of economic progress that did not impair the welfare of future generations. There again one has an expression of the principle of inter-generational equity. The second was the provision of equity within and between generations, and there it is made quite explicit. The third was the recognition of the global dimension, and there one has a broader recognition of equity within the present generation. The final goal was the protection of biological diversity and the maintenance of ecological processes and systems. One has a recognition there of the fundamental nature of ecological systems and the role which those systems play in maintaining an on-going, viable economy in this or any other country.

        It seems rather strange that when one looks at many of the debates which have arisen around this general theme, one finds that the protection of the environment and job growth are often seen as mutually exclusive or even as contradictory goals. Despite the fact that industry was involved in the Hawke Government's ESD process, and contributed very extensively to the reports of those various committees, some parts of industry in Australia have quite strongly expressed the view that it is either the environment and sustainability or jobs and economic prosperity.

        The Government's definition directly links employment and the improvement of individual and community well-being and welfare, and the provision of equity within and between generations with the principle of sustainability. High levels of unemployment contravene this principle of equity. I think we all believe in inter-generational equity because we all believe in a fair go. This principle says that a fair go, a level playing field, should be extended beyond the present generation to future generations. It is based on the general idea of equality of opportunity and extending that idea to later generations.

        For example, there is no way in which one can use coal in a renewable way. It is a non-renewable resource. But a society which is committed to sustainability must quite clearly devote sufficient of the resources which come from the economic benefit of burning the coal so that the next generation will have at least the same amount of energy available to it. In other words, there must be the actualisation of technologies which will provide the energy for the future generation if this present generation chooses to use coal. Similarly, in relation to so-called renewable resources, a society cannot be said to be sustainable if indeed it uses those non-renewable resources in non-sustainable ways. The rate at which renewable resources are used must clearly be in strict proportion to the rate at which those resources such as forests or other natural systems can renew themselves.

        Much has been given in recent times to the notion of the market and the fundamental nature which the market should play in a modern industrial society. Great emphasis is given to this by both the Government and the Opposition. One of the fundamental principles which underlies the market and is linked to the idea of fairness—fairness between individuals in the present generation and future generations—is the idea of a level playing field; that those who operate in the market are indeed given equal opportunities to participate in that market system. Of course, when one starts looking at markets, one finds that very often those playing fields are anything but level. The area in which they are most unlevel is in relation to internalising what economists call externalities.

        One of the principal externalities is the idea of bringing into present prices a representation which future generations may make on those markets if they were present here to make those demands.

        As I mentioned earlier, coal is principally burnt for the making of electricity. In Australia coal is the principal source of our electricity. Since 1983 the Labor Government has devoted certain funds to energy research. But one finds that only one-tenth of the amount of money put into energy research has actually gone into providing those alternatives which will address the problems of the next generation, while in California one has seen the development of a number of technologies which are currently competitive—even if one does not internalise those externalities.

        One finds among those technologies the development of wind generation of electricity and solar thermal generation of electricity in which the costs, even without the internalisation of those externalities, are still reasonably competitive. So a sensible development in this country of sustainability would be to move towards those technologies, recognising that they move us towards greater sustainability.

        At the same time—and here I make very strongly the point which lies at the heart of this motion—we must realise that those technologies will provide a great deal more employment than the use of coal burning technology in large central power stations. Moreover, because we do not make any heavy generating equipment in this country, the use of those technologies also involves the use of equipment which can be totally manufactured in this country. Therefore, the use of this technology can at the same time address this very serious and growing problem of the large foreign debt. So in the area of electricity and energy use through the use of electricity we have a key example of the way in which the problems of unemployment, the problems of foreign debt and the problems of moving towards a sustainable pattern of development can be married together.

        As I say, one finds that the Government has not pursued that sort of path. Indeed, in the One Nation statement, one finds that the Government is to reduce the sales tax on cars—not in any way which would move us towards greater sustainability but simply across the board. If the Government—and I make this criticism in that the Government has passed up a marvellous opportunity here—had chosen to remove the sales tax on a sliding scale which related to the fuel efficiency of the car, then indeed employment in the car industry may have been stimulated at the same time as moving towards sustainability.

        One of our principal criticisms of the Opposition in relation to its goods and services tax bears precisely on this point. When a 15 per cent single tax is fixed and the sales tax regime is removed the opportunity is denied through the tax system of internalising those externalities which relate to the use of non-renewable resources and the need to address the problem of making those resources available to the next generation.

        One could develop other alternatives in relation to other industries in Australia. One of those industries, of course, is the paper industry which is very much to the fore in debates at the present time in relation to northern Tasmania. There are other ways of meeting the $1.6 billion worth of paper imports into this country—again addressing the problem of the foreign debt—without building large pulp mills based on old growth forests and causing the non-sustainable environmental damage that that involves. The alternatives depend upon annual crops, which again can be grown much more effectively, can produce much greater amounts of fibre per hectare and can provide much greater local employment, thus stimulating and supporting local industry. At the same time it addresses the problem of foreign indebtedness.

        The points that really stand out in this debate, with which I hope both the old parties will agree, is that ecologically sustainable development is about Australia becoming a clever country. To be clever, we have to expand and create value added industries in rural and manufacturing sectors, and that cleverness also requires the protection of our environment.

        Ecologically sustainable development will become the mainstream economic approach of our future. It is already becoming the mainstream approach of many other nations. In those nations there is a growing recognition with many of our trading partners that sustainable development makes good economic sense. We will be left behind unless we work seriously at moving towards ecologically sustainable development. To put ESD on the back-burner—which seems to be the practice, if not the preferred attitude, of both Labor and the coalition parties—is not very clever. It will not produce a clever country; nor will it provide a viable future for our children.

        If the number of pages of reports under the heading of ecologically sustainable development is any measure, the Government is certainly serious. More important is a united front in moving to make ESD very much a central part of the Government's program. I have no trouble at all in saying that, at least for a large part of the sentiment expressed in the motion, I am happy to stand up and support it. That is because, amongst other reasons, however we want to emphasise questions of ecologically sustainable development; they are vitally important. If it takes that set of words and a series of inquiries to make our governments and business and industry leaders in this country, to say nothing of other planners, take seriously questions of the contribution of this generation's production to the next, then we would have to say, `Hear, hear'.

        I make a couple of comments on the specifics about the ESD argument. Earlier, when some of the draft documents on the ESD debate were proposed and circulated, it was drawn to my attention by a colleague in South Australia that the word `health' had never been mentioned in the whole debate. I was very pleased on his behalf to put his letter of concern into the pipeline so that health considerations could get onto the ESD agenda. Indeed, those considerations are now on both the agenda and in this intersectoral issues report. In that report there is a page of recommendations addressing health questions through occupational health and safety and the impact of environmental concerns on health.

        One of the reasons I am principally concerned about this is because of the economics. What is the point of trying to cure people downstream at a considerable outlay of health dollars when, with some appropriate thinking and planning, those diseases could be avoided? The example that springs to mind most readily is that of the Wittenoom asbestos mine in Western Australia. As early as 1946, one of the duties of Dr—later Professor—Saint from the Western Australian Department of Health was to visit and inspect that mine. He made recommendations about the amount of dust and the way that dust should have been dampened down. Those recommendations were ignored.

        Now, nearly 50 years later, we are seeing very high pay-outs in the courts to people who have been found to have mesothelioma, which is judged to have been caused by their life in the mine or nearby; that is, the families of miners were also at risk and indeed suffered mesothelioma. Millions of dollars in compensation are being paid when a large amount of that illness, and certainly that pay-out, could have been avoided by practising the appropriate ecologically sustainable course way back then. So even in straight efficiencies the economies of good practice and prevention in the outlay of introducing dust absorption or dampening down equipment would have played a large part in preventing the illness. In this instance we can actually put a figure on how much it will cost this many years later. That, of course, is a dollar cost and it does not measure the cost of human misery, pain and suffering and the loss to families of the breadwinner or other members who have died as a result of that disease.

In industry there are many examples over the years of the extraordinary cost, damage and death as a result of very poor industrial practice.

The intersectoral report and the reports from each of the subsets on specific areas provide considerable beneficial information.

Many of these arguments or debates, whether it is called ESD, managing the environment or being a clever country, as Senator Coulter puts it, are running more or less in tandem.

I thank the Senate for its indulgence in that respect. I will be moving two sets of amendments, both dealing with the same problem. That is, in the targeting of this one-off payment, we have managed to miss out on a number of farming families. These are the families who, when changes were made to the family allowance last year, found that their assets and a small income removed them from eligibility for the family allowance. Indeed, they no longer received the family allowance.

         The exact number of people so affected is rather difficult to ascertain. Some have put the figure in the area of a few hundred and some have put it in the thousands. There was some suggestion today that it could be up to 50,000, depending on how we count those who have dropped out. It is a matter of whether we take into consideration those who simply do not apply again, in other words, those who were receiving family allowance prior to the assets testing; or whether we just count those who have now applied for the family allowance but have been refused, even under the hardship provisions.

         The second set of amendments is far more specific. If passed, they will ensure that those young people covered by the assistance for isolated children's bonus scheme are covered by this one-off payment. It does not mean that they will actually be able to get family allowance in the long term. They will not get onto the family allowance list. However, when it comes to this one-off payment, we believe that it is essential that these children be included.

         One of the criticisms that has already been made is that we have not had this proposal fully costed. As I said previously, it is extremely difficult to know exactly how many young people are now missing out on family allowance. Even if every child under the isolated children's assistance scheme—and there are some 100,000—received it, it would amount to a sum of $12m. It seems far more likely that there are only a handful of children—in the thousands, or even in the tens of thousands—who are going to be able to get this. As I said, the numbers are not certain, and I apologise for the lack of costing. I would imagine that the absolute maximum figure is around $6m. When we consider that over $300m is being given out in this one-off payment, an additional $6m is not excessive.

         —I have to indicate that we are not in a position to support these amendments. As I understand it, what Senator Lees has in mind is that the provision of the one-off bonus to family allowance recipients should also be extended to cover isolated children. That would seem to be without regard to assets or means test and to cost something of the order of $5m. Whilst we certainly have a great deal of sympathy for isolated children and the parents who have to maintain them, in view of the fact that we regard this whole exercise as gimmickry, throwing money at one particular group, we do not think it solves any more problems to throw money at another group. There may well be other ways and means of providing effective assistance for parents of isolated children, but we do not think that one-off handouts—especially to people who do not live in Wills—make any great sense. Therefore, I indicate that we will not be supporting these amendments.

I would argue very strongly that isolated children are far more in need than some of the families in suburbia that will get it, who have houses with a value perhaps as high as half a million dollars plus the other $600,000-odd in assets and a $62,000 income.

We have heard stories from them of their having to withdraw their children from school, and boarding facilities closing in a number of Australian cities. Surely everyone would realise that this is a quite reasonable measure. If I wish to agree with Senator Alston, we can settle on $5m.

         I am a little surprised—and I keep hearing it from those opposite in the debate—that they now seem to have distanced themselves from the principle upon which family allowances were established. It is a principle which was accepted by the then Minister in the Fraser Government and the then Opposition spokesman on social security, Senator the Hon. Don Grimes. The principle is that family allowances are really part of the tax transfer system and part of the taxation system, recognising that at any level of income a family with children has greater expenditure on necessities and other things and greater tax burdens than a family without children. That was the principle upon which family allowances were established. I can recall persons getting up in this chamber at that time saying that that was the principle. Indeed, Senator Grimes made a point of it at the economic summit, and it is mentioned in the documents of the economic summit.

         I do not know what Opposition senators are doing, but I hear them continually complaining that the Government is not targeting family allowances to those in need. It is part of the tax system. The Government is targeting certain measures to poorer families by way of a family assistance supplement. I am often critical of the Government because it did not ensure that family allowances kept pace with inflation. Two years ago the Government introduced and passed legislation, which we all supported, for the indexation of family allowances, but it was from a low base and that was one of the problems.

No-one could seriously contest that we do not regard family allowances with the utmost importance and accord them a very high priority by virtue of the fact that we have undertaken to double them for families earning under $30,000, and to increase them by 50 per cent for families with incomes up to $40,000 and 6 per cent above that.

         We have also always stood for the notion of means testing transfer payments under the social security system. That is not to say for one moment that we regard family allowances as welfare, or that they are not to be seen as a recognition of the additional cost burdens on families. Indeed, if they are not seen in that light, there is no justification for paying them at all, unless families just happen to be group that is passing by that you want to throw some money at.

         The whole purpose of paying extra money to families with children is an explicit recognition that it costs more to raise children than to do without them. That is a different thing altogether from talking about un-means tested payments and it is a different thing again from talking about the effectiveness of a one-off payment. I do not recall, certainly not in my time, a government ever proposing a one-off payment of this or any other order. I have the gravest doubts about the effectiveness of it.

         Senator McMullan justified it in terms of demand stimulation and quarrelled with the proposition that tax cuts might do the job, presumably because they are permanent and therefore cost a lot more; I suspect that that is really why he was quibbling about it. He did not for a moment try to say that this is being done because there is now a recognition that at this point in time, 2 April 1992, families suddenly need another $125, or even $250 if they have five children or more; he did not put it forward in those terms. This is just a one-off payment. I have the greatest difficulty in appreciating its virtues, but that is not for one moment to derogate from the principle that underlies family allowances.

         It does not seem that that will do anything at all to alleviate poverty or provide tangible assistance other than in the most transient manner. I do not regard that as targeting. Targeting is to look at who is suffering and find out who needs the assistance. It is a different proposition altogether to argue that families per se, because one has children, entitles one to have a higher ongoing permanent payment. What Senator Harradine presumably would argue for is that we ought to give more recognition than we do at the moment to the additional costs borne by families.

But when it comes to family allowances, all it has done is spray around a bit of confetti. We might not like the proposition that it has been done for the benefit of those in the electorate of Wills. I do not know why it has been done. I suppose the Government thinks it has some merit, but it certainly escapes me and I just do not think it meets any of those objectives that we are concerned about—and certainly not what Senator Harradine would argue for.

If Senator Alston is saying, as he appears to be saying, that they are not targeted properly, that they should be means tested, then he is ignoring what occurred in 1976. In 1976, as Senator Alston knows, the tax rebate system was abolished for children and this was then cashed up and paid to the parent of the children, normally the mother. That was not means tested. The tax rebate system actually applied to everybody.

         One of the difficulties with the tax rebate system, and particularly the difficulty with the tax concession for children, was that it was not obtainable by a significant group of families on low income. That was another reason to welcome the abolition of the rebate system and the transfer of the money directly to the mother. There were a number of reasons. That had been argued by Albert Monk back in 1943, if Senator Alston wants to go back that far.

I said this afternoon—and I draw Senator Alston's attention to the speech I made this afternoon—that I welcomed the decision of the Government because it was an acknowledgment of the fact that the burden of the recession was being borne very heavily by families. But I also indicated and quoted from the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) that he regarded this as being a kick-start to the economy. I indicated with the assistance of tables that really what should be done—and I invite the Minister at some stage to look at what I said—is to give a permanent and appropriate increase to family allowances. I also welcomed the permanent weekly increase given in the family assistance supplement. That is simply what I wished to say.

A lot of them will have delayed small purchases for their children, and I think they will be delighted to receive that payment, get on with those purchases, and in so doing help out the economy. In fact, this is a highly targeted way of helping with one part of an overall package in getting the economy moving.

         In regard to Senator Harradine's comments about a permanent increase in family allowance, it is a matter that I will certainly take up with the Minister. I shall happily lend whatever voice I can in government to such a cause. This legislation also involves a substantial increase in family allowance supplement for low income families, which I hope everyone in the chamber will support. The rent assistance measures are ones that Senator Lees has raised in the chamber on a number of occasions in the past few years. I am sure that she realises they are worthy of support as well. In fact, this legislation does exactly what she asks should have been done well over a year ago. I hope the Australian Democrats in particular can consider that position and contribute to this legislation's passing as quickly as possible.

        I noted with interest that Senator Alston did not support the previous amendment because it was not sufficiently targeted. This amendment, which we have run on a number of other occasions, is certainly targeted. The income test remains. There is simply an adjustment to the assets test, leaving on the assets test for luxuries but removing it when it comes to the tools of trade; that is, the actual items that the farm family requires to ensure that it can make a living.

          —This report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory proposes that the name of the Committee be changed. I have already spoken to this report briefly—as I always seem to do on ACT reports. In order to change the name of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory to something that is more appropriate, we have to define the actual area in which the Commonwealth has an interest now that the Australian Capital Territory has self-government. There has been a delay of three years. Until the plan is settled, and areas which were clearly the responsibility of the Federal Government and the Territory Government are defined, there is reason for the Committee to continue under its present name.

          The Committee is still working under its old name. It is now inquiring into the open spaces which are still the Commonwealth's responsibility. There will be work for the Committee to do in the future. I suggest that there may be a time when it will be appropriate for the Committee and the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Zone to be incorporated into one committee.

          I mention the demise of the Australian Capital Territory Committee because it is, if not the oldest, one of the oldest joint committees of this Parliament. The Committee was established in 1957 at a time when, following the Menzies decision that Australia should have a national capital of which the nation would be proud, it was clearly appropriate and necessary for the Parliament to take a more active role. It was not sufficient to merely leave it to government to run the national capital.

          Indeed, over the years the Parliament has shown very clearly that it is interested in the national capital. One might say that it has been ambivalent: on the one hand, Federal parliamentarians are inclined to knock Canberra and, on the other hand, when there are issues about its planning they have always taken a great interest. For the most part, the work of the Committee over the years has related to variations of the city plan, changes in the roads and the lay out of Canberra and approving the subdivisions of the new suburbs as they were built.

          Honourable senators will recall that the ACT was represented in the House of Representatives for a number of years by Mr Jim Fraser, a Labor member who had voting rights only in respect of issues directly affecting the ACT. Subsequently, the ACT gained full representation. It had one Federal member, then two Federal members and then two senators. Who knows where it will end—around about there I should imagine for some time. After senators for the Territory were first elected at the end of 1975, the Committee undertook more work in the nature of normal committee inquiries into matters affecting the Territory.

          My predecessor, John Knight, was the Chairman of that Committee. I became the Chairman after he died—which was 11 years ago yesterday. John Knight prepared a document on the history of the Committee from 1957 until 1980. That document contains a very valuable history not only of a parliamentary committee but the Committee's relationship with the Territory which it served.

          With the ACT having its own government, the scope of the previous Committee is no longer appropriate. More than 100 senators and members served on it over its lifetime. I think there were 12 different chairmen. For a long time the chairman was always a member of the Senate. A lot of people have taken an active part in the work of the Committee. I certainly support the change of name because it reflects what has happened in the Australian Capital Territory.

          I shall be pleased to continue to be on the Committee which remains to look after the Parliament's interests in this Territory, as I have an interest from both points of view. It is a time to mark the passing of that Committee and to recognise the work done by those who have been on it over the years. We will continue to get on with the job of looking after what is left of the Territory as a Commonwealth issue. I hope that the Commonwealth will always continue to fund that portion of its interest in a proper and appropriate manner befitting the status of the national capital.

          —Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank you for making your time available to allow me to make a few comments on the Government response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. As you would realise, the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee came into being as a result of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, which selectively reported for eight years. Through our actions and those of the Government and the Democrats, we realised that there was not a Senate standing committee that reflected the portfolio of primary industry. I believe there had not been one in existence since about 1945.

          This Committee came into being late in December last year. Because of the horrific drought problem around Australia, our first reference was to look at the effects of the national drought policy, the drought task force recommendations, and the practical effect they would have on the farmers of Australia, who were trying to come to terms with probably the most horrific drought since 1983. As you would remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, the drought broke in 1983 at about the time our former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, came to power.

As a farmer, I have never before experienced so much devastation and hopelessness among the farmers we met. The only other time I had experienced this sort of feeling was in 1967, after the horrific bushfires in Tasmania, when farmers were burnt out and left with nothing. Some of the people the Committee spoke to were fourth and fifth generation farmers—from the western region of New South Wales, from the Eyre Peninsula and from places such as Jerdacuttup or Ravensthorpe, where my colleague Senator Crane comes from. They have never before experienced such conditions. They have had to cope with droughts and dry spells and all the rest of it, but they have never had this combination of drought, recession, banks screwing them to the floor, and all the other things that go with it.

          In a baptism of fire, our Committee had to experience the traumas and dramas of what is happening around the rural communities of Australia. Whilst members of the Government have taken some note of what is happening in rural Australia—in fact, this applies to people on our side of politics too—I do not think they fully understand what goes on. People such as Senator Panizza, Senator Crane and Senator Brownhill and I know because we actually live this sort of life and mix with people who have to put up with these things.

          The Committee had to front up to third and fourth generation farmers who had had 20,000 sheep and ask, `How is the drought affecting you?'  We would be told, `We might have 2,000 sheep left but we cannot tell because we are too frightened to start looking for them. They are in such poor condition that if we stir them up they might fall over and die anyway'. Those were the sorts of comments made to us during our public hearings.

I have to ask: if Mr Keating and the Government feel that there is a need for rural counsellors through to 1995, what sort of projections do they have for the rural community?  The only reason we have rural counsellors is to counsel rural people. It was apparent from evidence given to the Committee that there has been a huge increase in suicides, particularly among young people. We had evidence that even bank managers were committing suicide. They were obviously involved with their clients and the desperation of the rural community has forced them into taking their own lives, which is unbelievable in this day and age.

          One thing that was apparent to me and to other Committee members is how serious this matter is. The drought, the recession, the high interest rates, the low commodity prices and so on are catastrophic and have compounded to force our once proud rural community into despair. Governments of whatever political persuasion used to say that Australia rides on the sheep's back. The people who in the past have been such big producers of wealth for Australia have been badly affected by the drought. We had the opportunity of seeing the sorts of things they are concerned about. They do not want to rely on handouts; they believe that the IED scheme put forward by the Government was reasonably successful, but the changes made were not successful. In other words, they would like to go back to the old IED scheme or an IED scheme that they would be interested in investing in.

          According to our evidence, there is no doubt that the assistance given by the New South Wales and Queensland governments in the form of transport subsidies has been most effective, and this goes back to previous droughts. Some of the most effective things on the ground have been transport subsidies that allow farmers to move stock out or move fodder in. They are the sorts of subsidies that farmers look for. Repeatedly, the farmers said, `We are not looking for handouts; we are looking for the most effective way of coping with what to us are natural disasters'.

          That brings me to my main point. The Government and the task force have said that droughts should not be considered natural disasters. No matter where one lives or farms, when one gets conditions severe enough to create problems that one has not experienced for 20, 30 or 40 years, if that is not a natural disaster, I do not know what is. When one has a flood, immediately the Government says it is a natural disaster. That is a point that has been put to us in just about every place we went; that the Government should think again about changing its position on the question of droughts not being considered natural disasters.

          I am also particularly pleased to see Senator Cook here tonight in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. We have a major task in terms of bringing about an attitudinal change with respect to extreme drought, not only as far as the Government is concerned but also in respect of some members of the Opposition. I have to say that I have a personal vested interest in the outcome of this report because my own property, which my son is on now, is probably in the worst hit drought area in Western Australia. Certainly the situation is equal to that in the pastoral areas up in the Pilbara, Ashburton and Murchison.

          On that matter, when we went to the Jerdacuttup-Munglinup district, evidence was given to us by a number of people that the properties, over the last 2 1/2 years, had been destocked by over 70 per cent, which has an enormous impact on people's ability to cope in these particular circumstances. Even if we were in good times, which we are not, it would make it very difficult. One of the tasks we have in terms of defining drought and looking at its impact is to recognise that, in terms of extreme drought, there must come a time—for example, I suggest when one starts getting into one's third year, particularly in those districts that have not experienced continuous drought—when there is a role for the Federal Government alongside the State governments.

          The point that I particularly want to raise with regard to this inquiry is that we have effectively been without a drought policy in this country since prior to May 1990. In fact, it goes back some six or nine months before that, before the National Drought Policy Review Committee made its report. That report has been with us since May 1990. It is now March 1992, and we still do not have a drought policy.

          Very few people argued with us about the principle or the philosophy behind people preparing themselves for drought or, for that matter, any natural disaster. They did not have a problem, in principle, with the term `self-reliance' which has become, I guess, the vogue term as far as drought is concerned. But they were highly critical of the situation that has developed here; firstly, because of the inconsistency between States in terms of what was being done, and, secondly, in terms of that movement to self-reliance. People have not been given a period in which to do that.

I believe that the decision of the Federal Government some time ago to change very significantly the IED scheme that we have in place and, in effect, render it useless was a very poor policy decision.

          I will not argue against the fact that some people abused it. But what I would say to the Government—in fact, to all people in the House of Representatives and the Senate—is that the policy position should not be, because some people abuse something, to remove it; it should be to fix up the abuses that were occurring. Of course, now, in terms of a drought policy, we find that there is not an effective IED scheme; there is no way that individual producers can protect themselves against the ravages of drought and the subsequent drop in income. I would urge the Government very strongly, and the various State agriculture Ministers who are dealing with this, to act on this aspect of the matter very quickly.

          One thing we saw was that the effects of drought differ very significantly from district to district and from State to State. In some areas of Australia the problem was water. In other areas one of the biggest single factors which exacerbated the drought situation was feral animals and kangaroos, particularly goats and rabbits. In other areas we found that the impacts on the grain industry were quite different from the impacts on the stock industry. In some areas we found the problem of woody weeds and we also ran into the situation of wind erosion, which creates another set of problems. So we cannot have just a single mechanism or way of dealing with the particular problem. In terms of the definition, I think that it is very important that a clear indication of what constitutes an extreme drought be given to the industry. Of course, tied in with this is rainfall distribution.

          I have already mentioned the IEDs. The other matter that I must raise is the taxation arrangements that need to be in place to assist, encourage and provide an incentive for individual producers to drought-proof themselves in terms of water measures and protection against a drop-off in feed in terms of the storage of hay and grain. In one particular area we saw—I think it was Bourke—a particular producer had puts oats under the ground. The oats had been there for nine years before he pulled them out. Yet that particular producer at that particular time could get no technical advice in terms of what to do and where to store the oats. So there is much that can be done in terms of providing incentives and information to assist the producers.

          The question is—and my colleague, Senator Calvert, touched on this—whether or not drought should be included as part of the natural disaster relief arrangements. I quote one witness who said, `It is totally illogical to include flood—too much rain—under natural disaster relief arrangements and exclude drought—too little rain.' I find it very difficult to mount a sustainable argument against that, just as I find it very difficult to mount a sustainable argument against severe cyclone damage qualifying as a natural disaster.

          I think this report shows that there is need for a reassessment by Parliament of what constitutes `drought' and what role Commonwealth and States should play in drought relief. Further, the Commonwealth and State Ministers for agriculture should spell out clearly and quickly—because, after all, they have had nearly two years to consider it—what the drought policy in this country is to be. I also reiterate the point that Senator Calvert made in relation to rural counsellors.

          One concern which came up quite consistently in a number of areas was the role of the Rural Adjustment Authority, how it operated and how it was administered. It is a reflection on government policy that producer after producer said to us, `The last thing we need at this time is to have more money thrown at us. We have no income. We have no capacity to meet our current debt. To give us more money is to throw good money after bad.' There needs to be a reassessment of the transitional assistance that has been given in the past with respect to the cartage of stock and fodder, and more consideration must be given to taxation arrangements, such as IEDs and taxation incentives to invest in drought-proofing measures, such as water and fodder conservation.

           We should be looking very closely at the role of tax credits and how they can impact on the overall capacity of producers to make themselves self reliant.

         The Committee which you and Senator Crane were part of was set the task of looking at some 58 recommendations of the National Drought Policy Review Task Force.

Two of those people are, I believe, quite eminent members of the rural community who understand what happens out in the real world, out in the bush, where people have to battle Dorothea Mackellar-type `droughts and flooding rains'.

          As a Committee we looked at the 58 recommendations to see whether they were relevant and whether they were couched in the right terms. The first recommendation concerned the natural disaster relief arrangements. The Drought Policy Review Task Force was opposed to the reinstatement of drought within those arrangements. When speaking on this matter the other day, I said that it did not really matter whether drought fell within the natural disaster relief arrangements or not, as long as the Commonwealth Government realised that it had to give some assistance once the economic capabilities of individuals and the State were unable to cope with a drought.

          We also looked at the recommendation of the Policy Review Task Force relating to self-reliance. From the 67 submissions that we received, and from the nearly 170 witnesses who appeared before the Committee, it was overwhelmingly clear that the farming community wants to be self-reliant in times of drought, but that they cannot become self-reliant unless the Government of the day sets the parameters for them to be so.

          I think it is interesting that one of the first references to self-reliance was made by the National Farmers Federation when it said that we should encourage self-reliance in managing drought, facilitate the early recovery of industry from drought, ensure adequate protection of livestock and other resources, and minimise the loss of high-value international markets. As a Committee, we agreed with that because that is basically what the farming community is on about.

         In general—and this includes right down to the hardest battler and one who is leaving his property—I have not found a farmer who would say that the philosophy of self reliance is wrong. I think farmers are basically looking to be self reliant. They are not looking for any handouts. However, in reality, in Australia's climate, drought hits hard, and without some form of assistance, of whatever kind, they feel they are not going to be able to make it through.

          In this report the Committee definitely endorsed the concept of self reliance in relation to drought management. However, the Committee also subscribed to the view that there is a need for effective depreciation and other tax measures to provide incentive to farmers and graziers to become self reliant. We advised farmers at the time that we had yet to prepare a further report on this matter, but even at this stage it is clear that we must devise a way of helping people to look after themselves. Surely, that is what life is about. Take IEDs as an example. As Senator Cook would know, since he represents the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in this place, there are no big cash flows at the moment to enable people to make use of income equalisation deposits.

          I say to the people on the Government side of the chamber, the people who took away the value of income equalisation deposits, the people who actually castrated—that would be a good description, because they have made them impotent—the way they handle the income equalisation deposits, that income equalisation deposits now are not serving the purpose they served leading up to the 1982-83 drought period. There is no doubt that if we can get back income equalisation deposits whereby people have the incentive to put money away in good times, get the carrot given to them to put money away so that when the bad periods come they can withdraw that money and pay tax at the ruling rate at that time on the amount of income they receive in that bad year, we will achieve something for the communities.

          I reckon a fair go for people in the rural communities is what everyone is on about in this place. I think even people on the other side of the chamber would agree. Unless people in the farming communities who are out there earning export income can receive assistance, help, support and incentive in the good times so that when the bad times come they can look after themselves, we will not have those export industries producing the income that gives the people that are sitting at the table here, the people that are sitting on the other side, the standard of living that we all have had in the past. This inquiry is basically about trying to get a decent national drought policy so that when we have a drought we do not find the farmers falling off the twig.

Not only can I not find the notes but I cannot find the report. However, there are many people in this chamber that know what drought is all about. Senator Brownhill is of the opinion that maybe there are not quite enough people who know about drought, but I think, for the times that Senator Crane, myself, Senator Brownhill and the National Party of Australia have told the Senate about drought, people should understand what it is to experience it.

          Drought is like death; it is almost as certain as death. One can expect a drought every four to five years in New South Wales; in Western Australia we expect a drought every six to seven years. The east has not had a drought since that disastrous drought of 1982. That is the drought that elected this Government. This Government ran its election campaign on the recession that came out of that drought. That is how it got elected. When the rain came the next year it claimed credit for having broken the drought and for having turned the recession around.

          The only way to beat drought is to conserve three things. In addition to conserving one's energy, people should conserve fodder, water and cash. To conserve fodder, people should not really need any incentive, although they should know that they can lose stock very quickly once drought comes in and the feed runs out. I think that governments of all colours and persuasions should provide a certain amount of incentive for fodder by depreciation of plant—maybe accelerated depreciation—and of course of the buildings into which the hay or whatever they use for fodder is put. At present, I understand that people write off hay sheds over 30 years; so there is not much incentive there. Plant for haymaking does not have a motor, so people probably write that plant off over about 10 years. More incentive has to be put their way.

          The conservation of water is very important, especially in the vast areas of the eastern States as well as in Western Australia which does not have scheme water. Even if one has scheme water on one's property, it is very costly. The way to get over this problem for stock is to build bigger dams.

          As generations pass, the dams seem to get bigger. I can remember when I was young a water dam of, say, 3,000 cubic metres being large. Ten or 15 years down the track anything of that size was very minimal and the going rate was 6,000 or 7,000 cubic metres. The dams have now been enlarged to about 10,000 cubic metres. If we have dams of that size, when these floods come such as the recent ones in the east—we also get them in the west—or when the normal winter rains fall and the dams fill up, we will be able to last for at least four years before water becomes scarce. Surely, we have good rains every four years with which to fill the dams. Unfortunately, for those who need an incentive to build earth dams, the depreciation is not enough. The time during which it is written off is far too long. In the good seasons, when farmers and pastoral people could be encouraged to put money back into dams, not enough is done.

          The third area is the conservation of cash in good years. It all depends where one is in the farming game. People in areas on which nature smiles kindly such as New Zealand, Tasmania and certain parts of Victoria know that they will get a good season every year. But where I come from, a 13-inch rainfall district, people are always looking over their shoulders at drought. Mr Acting Deputy President, you were there many years ago when we were both young fellows. People in that area tend to conserve a little more than they do in the areas that the good Lord looks after every year.

          It is in this situation that the IEDs come in. IEDs have been laboured a fair bit in this chamber, but I do not think it hurts to run through the history of IEDs again. We used to have a good system, probably kicked off by Doug Anthony, who was an honourable member in the other place many years ago. I do not give much credit very often to the National Party, but Doug Anthony was a great fellow who represented the bush of Australia. IEDs were introduced while he was Minister and we had a pretty good system for quite a few years. But when my friend from Doodlakine in Western Australia, Senator Walsh, came along—and I tell him this every day—he said, `There is a rort in them. There has to be a rort. There is too much money in them. It is a rort for taxation'. Senator Walsh fiddled with IEDs and the Government threw them out. He then fiddled with them again, and we now have a system that does not work.

          The other day I read out to the Senate a table to illustrate that IEDs almost disappeared when these measures were applied. I do not know how many millions of dollars were in the deposits—I think $168m at its height—but within two or three years they had disappeared. At that time we had a very poor season and a downturn in wheat and wool prices and the deposits disappeared altogether. Of course, in government, we will restore the IEDs to the sorts of levels that existed previously; it is very important.

          The rural adjustment scheme has played its part in Australia. Unfortunately, the Federal Government distributes finance to the various State organisations and that is where the whole scheme falls down. The assistance comes in three parts: farm build-up, carry on finance and household support. However, even though a lot of these officers are farmers or ex-farmers, they turn into bureaucrats overnight.

          Senator West will know how it goes because even in New South Wales the money does not go out too fast, especially when it is needed to plant crops. It is pointless getting that money when the opportune time for planting the crop has gone. In my own farming situation the ideal time to plant a crop is between 1 May—if the good Lord sends us rain—and 10 June. If farmers do not start to plant crops until the last week in June or early July, they will be locked in and will not get a very good season at all. In that situation, if they have borrowed money and are paying interest, it puts them further behind the black ball and they would be better off not planting the crop.

          This scheme has been going in Western Australia and, no doubt, in all of Australia, for many years, but it does not matter, they have not learned how to get on. The reason is that it is too centralised. If the decisions for loaning money were left with the bank branches out in the country, it would be far better. That is how money should be distributed. In the One Nation package a certain amount of money is allocated to wheat planting. I hope that decisions on that will be left to the bank managers out in the bush who know their customers on a one-to-one basis. They will be able to make quick decisions and if farmers want to borrow money to plant crops, it can be done nice and early to get the best sorts of crops.

          I also saw a report that wheat planting should go up by 35 per cent in Australia this year, which will make up for the big downturn we had last year, especially on this side of the country. The downturn in Western Australia was nowhere as bad because we had a one-off GMP put in place by Premier Lawrence which gave people who were thinking of cropping the confidence to plant their crops. We had a fantastic season in Western Australia and a lot of farmers have done better than they would have done, so I have always commended Premier Lawrence for that, although I do not commend her for very much else. All in all, this report is a fair one that reflects—

It is important to remind people that last week the One Nation policy was handed down. There are a couple of things in it that answer the demands and requests of many of the people that the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs heard evidence from. As Senator Panizza said, it includes the acceleration of depreciation allowances for plant and machinery. It might not be to the extent that some people would wish, but it is certainly a significant acceleration of the depreciation allowance, and that needs to be remembered.

          The other thing is that the rural adjustment scheme part B has been extended. The Commonwealth Government will be expending $20m on that purely for financing of crops, which is another issue that came before the Committee. Once the drought has broken and there has been some rain, people who are in dire financial straits and unable to borrow from other sources would not be able to get money to put their crops in and start their cash flow. It is the actual harvesting of the crop that starts the cash flow, but they have to be able to afford to buy seed. This $20m for RAS Part B will help these people.

          We have also had the Australian Agricultural Council. The Ministers have at least reached an agreement to work towards a national drought policy, and that has to be commended. For once we are getting this group of Ministers to agree to a national policy. It has never been very easy in this country to get Ministers from the States and Territories to agree that we are one country and need national policies. I have been through it with education and transport in other areas. It is very pleasing to see that, in the agricultural area, the State, Federal and Territorial Ministers now agree that they need a national policy. They are working towards that and will, hopefully, be able to bring down a national policy when they meet in July.

          —Queensland has experienced very severe and quite wide-ranging droughts in recent times. Some people have failed to understand the scope and the enormity of the droughts which we have suffered in my home State of Queensland. The following example illustrates the point very clearly. In some areas of the Burnett around Proston even in the bad droughts of the 1970s and 1980s they managed to keep the stock alive and in vaguely decent condition. We have had stock in those areas dying in massive numbers, which is an indication that even in the better rainfall areas of our State, over the last six to 12 months we have suffered incredibly severe conditions and it has been extremely hard for many farmers to remain viable.

          Some people might be tempted to say,`What does it matter that we lose one or two farmers here or there? They will be replaced'. The problem is that they will not be replaced. When these people leave the industry we not only lose farmers and a commitment to the maintenance of those farms and the earning of export dollars for this nation, but, more importantly, we also lose the skills of those farmers; sometimes skills that have taken 20 or 30 years to build up. These are things that are not easily replaced.

           Bill Bonthrone, who is the head of the UGA, is a tireless worker for farming families and communities throughout Queensland, and the UGA does a great deal of good work. He noted in the submission the workings of the RAS scheme at the moment and he pointed out the obligation of the States to help administer RAS and the money that is made available. He talked about RAS Part B and said that a lot of the money has gone into fodder and water freight subsidies and restocking subsidies. That is quite good for those who are involved principally in the grazing industries.

          Without any disrespect to Mr Bonthrone or the UGA, I say to the Government that the number of people who are affected by drought is far greater than those who are merely graziers. For example, on the Darling Downs in Queensland during this recent drought we had a major problem. Many of the grain crops failed and, as a consequence, not only was income lost there but it added a higher cost to other primary industries, for example, the feedlot industry. The feedlot industry in the Darling Downs had to go as far as South Australia to find fodder. It cost farmers $60 per tonne to bring that fodder up to Brisbane and then they had to meet the additional cost of transport from Brisbane to the Darling Downs.

          That affects the viability of the feedlot industry. It also affects the viability of industries such as the pork industry, which is very important. I have touched on that industry a number of times in this place and probably do not need to go any further. We need a comprehensive solution to drought. It is a major problem that faces this nation. I believe very strongly that self-reliance is the best policy but people must have the ability to become self-reliant.

          One of the problems at the moment is that when farmers make provision for storage of fodder or storage of water they cannot write off the cost in the same year in which they expend the money. If they had a reasonably stable environment and an assured income, it would be fine to say, `We will depreciate this over 20 or 30 years', or whatever it is. But, of course, the problem is that they make this expenditure and they set aside this plant and equipment because they cannot rely on next year's income.

          So it seems totally ludicrous to say to farmers, `Go and become self-reliant, go and store fodder or make water storage facilities available on your farm, but you are going to have to write off the cost over a protracted number of years'. It may be, for example, that a farmer puts up a hay shed and the very next year there is a drought, he has a negative income, and that depreciation arrangement is of no use at all. We should be encouraging farmers to become self-reliant and that means that they have to have a sufficient incentive to do so. I do not believe that the system we have at the moment is at all adequate. I believe that accelerated depreciation of the necessary precautions against a drought in terms of fodder and water conservation are absolutely critical.

         The problem with the IED scheme as it exists at the moment is that there is a big tax penalty on money that farmers put away in the scheme. Farmers say, `Why should we put money away? The first $39,000 of that is going to be subject to taxation, yet I am not really getting the benefit of it in this year or any of the years in which it has been put in the IED'. It should not be taxed in that fashion. I do not think that that is a reasonable thing. The farmer is being told, `Put the money away, but pay us tax on it out of your other money anyway. We believe that is sufficient incentive for you to put that money away to protect against drought'. Of course it is not, and it never will be. We need much more flexibility and an understanding of the real financial pressure that many farm families are under at the moment—not just now but for many years to come—because of the high interest rates and low rainfall that they have suffered. It will take our farming community many years to get out of their current difficulties, and I think the Government has to recognise this.

          In other countries, as honourable senators would know, governments are much more generous. We have a lot of competition with Canada in the areas of wheat, beef, pork production and so on. Farmers there have a marvellous scheme where they can basically quarantine in a very generous IED scheme a portion of their income every year and the Canadian Government matches it dollar for dollar. So for every $1 they put in the scheme the Canadian Government matches it with another $1, and when their income falls below a certain level they can draw down on all of those funds. We are not asking the Australian Government to be as generous as that, and I do not think many farmers in this country really want to receive subsidies and handouts—

This Government has to recognise that this penny pinching in the taxation of the IED scheme does the farmers no good at all. In fact, because it degrades the long term viability of the farm sector, it impedes farmers from earning a generous income in the good years. It lowers the tax revenue to the Commonwealth by doing the things that it has done. We do not support tax evasion, but we do support giving industries an incentive to look after themselves.

          The final point I make is that, no matter how self-reliant people become, there will always be exceedingly bad years. We believe that, just as flood is provided for in the national disaster relief arrangements, so too should drought be provided for. It is the opposite side of the coin: a flood is too much water, a drought is not enough water, and they should be treated equally. Unless the Government embarks on widespread irrigation programs—for example, the Bradford scheme in north Queensland to take the water across to the northern Downs—and provides that infrastructure, which will mean that people will not be affected by drought, severe drought will be a problem, no matter how self-reliant people try to become. Therefore, it stands to reason that the Government has a very clear obligation to make provision for that under the national disaster relief arrangements.

          These matters are of considerable significance. I am grateful to the Senate for making time available to address these matters tonight. The Government and the Senate need to take a long, hard look at drought and not just assume that it can be solved in a matter of months, or even a matter of years.

         —I wish to give a brief report to the Senate on a recent trip I took on behalf of the Government to Africa. I was asked to lead the Australian Government delegation to SADCC, the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, that was this year held in Maputo, Mozambique. I had the opportunity to give the speech on behalf of Australia at that conference. I make three points. The first is that the Australian Government supported SADCC and congratulated it on its achievements so far towards the integration of the 10 countries that now constitute SADCC for the purposes of trading as a bloc and developing more efficient and rational transport arrangements, energy supply, and also the preparation for the acceptance of the membership of South Africa once full democracy and the end of apartheid is achieved in that country.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, we were very much in sympathy with the SADCC countries as a trading bloc because they, as has Australia, have suffered the effects of trade subsidies imposed by the European Community, Japan and the USA. Thirdly, I stress the point that continuing to ignore the particular poverty that is the lot of women is unjust. It is also economically unsound to leave women in a state of illiteracy, with poor health and insufficient provision for care during pregnancy and childbirth. It is a matter of absolute profligacy to waste all that talent. To chase good money after bad in a catch-up program of a minimum sort seemed to me to be worthy of comment.

         Our report was favourably received and we had a number of people from other countries wanting to speak to our delegation about assistance that Australia might offer. It is important to note for the record that Australia is very well received in Africa, certainly in all the countries to which I have ever been—and this time around in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa around Johannesburg and Pretoria where they thought Australia was a good country to come from. They liked Australia and appreciated very much our contribution there. However, there was some qualification to that praise when it came to South Africa.

         I was able to visit aid projects that Australia and World Vision are implementing in Zimbabwe. In particular, I was interested in them both from the position of being a member of a government that has aid projects there and because of my background as a doctor. Those projects are providing primary health care in community health centres of a sort that most Australians would not recognise, although perhaps some Aboriginal communities would feel that the circumstances were somewhat similar.

         I was particularly interested to note that, when it came to weighing babies, scales were tied to a tree. Babies were then placed in a sling which was hung from a hook on the scales. Older children were taught the trick of holding on to the hook underneath the scales and taking their feet off the ground. So the primary health care is certainly primary. But, of course, it provided the necessary information about weight gain in little babes.

         The health workers are trained to help mothers to record the weights, to see that the babies are adequately nourished. They were also taught how to hydrate babies, particularly the simple method of using hydration fluid. Babies received their inoculations against childhood diseases and the mothers received contraception advice, a supply of the pill if they needed it or injections of depo-provera if they chose it. Condoms were available, but there was not a very large demand for them.

         I mention these things because they relate to two of the major problems confronting Africa and the challenges that country has in dealing with them. Firstly, countries that are very poor and are struggling to feed their people need to look seriously at population control programs. But this is a very awkward and difficult area. So by and large these matters are left to health care workers and, in particular, to the mothers themselves. Therefore, this leads to an insufficient provision of care and service in that area.

         In particular, the mothers who are choosing contraception from either the pill or the depo-provera injection are not being provided with the contraceptive cover that allows them to practise safe sex. So the very benefits of contraception are also contributing to the potential for the spread of AIDS. In Africa, AIDS is a very major problem.

         The figures that I was given on AIDS in Africa are not just frightening; they are devastating. As I recollect, 10 million people of a population of some 500 million people in south Saharan Africa are HIV positive. One person in 50 of the population is HIV positive. The rest of the world has not quite grasped the consequences of those figures.

         Today I spoke with some representatives from World Vision who have also worked in Africa. They spoke of communities and villages that are now abandoned. The only people left alive in them are grandparents and tiny babes. The generations in between are now all dead. They are not just sick; they have already died and are wiped out. We have not begun to understand just how devastating this huge disease is in Africa. It will only get worse and it will only spread further.

         The problem of AIDS in Africa is different from country to country. The figures are very horrific and very large. When I visited the Deputy Minister for Health in Mozambique I was told that there are 1,200 new cases of AIDS per annum per one million of the population in Uganda compared with 1,000 in Kenya and about 1,000 in Malawi. Curiously, 200 is the comparable figure in Mozambique. The figure is low in Mozambique because of the bizarre benefit of war. The chronic war in Mozambique has prevented the ordinary communication, relationships and travel of people, so the number of AIDS cases there is actually lower at the moment.

         But 1.2 million Mozambique people are living across the border in Malawi, which has a very high percentage of the population with AIDS. Many of those people are said to be HIV positive and, when the war is over, they will return to Mozambique. So the effect there will also be very devastating.

         In Johannesburg I met some health officials and discovered that AIDS is a very significant problem in South Africa. In the black community it is a heterosexual disease; in the white community it is a homosexual disease. This means that we do not yet know a sufficient amount about the spread of the HIV disease. We do know that it is transmitted by sex, be it by homosexual or heterosexual practitioners; that it is spread by blood transfusion; and that it is spread by the use of shared needles. Also, rather horrifically, it is spread during pregnancy from parent to child.

         All those means of transmission are significant in Africa. It is something that is beginning to be treated as seriously as those numbers indicate it ought be. In fact, one thing that is most impressive is the effectiveness of the Australian treatment and management of AIDS. There is no cure for this disease. The only way it can be managed is by proper community education and the proper living practices so that its spread is minimised.

         I was very shocked the other day to read the remarks of Professor Hollows. He mentioned the word `quarantine'. He suggested that, as a means of protecting people who are at the moment free of the disease, we should quarantine them. It is far more important to give people information than to isolate them.

         A Ugandan woman called Noerine Kaleeba has written a very beautiful book, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          We Miss You All

         , about the effect of AIDS in Uganda and what happens to families when two, three, four or five members die of AIDS. We are now not talking about an isolated case here or there or a small pocket of the community but rather a very devastating epidemic. The cry from her book and the people who spoke to me is, `Please do not isolate people. Give us the information so that we can use it to live safely and constructively with AIDS or with HIV positive people so that they are not isolated'.

         The very worst thing she says in her book—and others have told me this—is that people who are HIV positive or who are suffering from AIDS find themselves isolated and abandoned by their communities. Certainly for those who are HIV positive and certainly for those with AIDS, and also for people who are at risk but are not yet HIV positive, it is far more important that we do not practice the ostrich syndrome of putting our head in the sand and isolating or quarantining people. It is far more important that we learn the facts about the spread of AIDS and learn to live successfully with it so that it is not spread.

         The visit to Mozambique also gave me the opportunity of seeing the variety of ways in which Australian aid is provided. Some of it is development aid very much at the grassroots level. For example, I visited a covered well of clean water that Australian aid has provided in a Julius Nyerere village in Xaixai, a northern province. It was very pleasing to visit that community and see how appreciated something as small as a covered well water supply was by the community and what assistance it provided.

Commodities assistance is a very successful different type of aid exchange program whereby expertise and equipment from Australian Telecom is being provided to Mozambique Telecommunications, which is very much appreciative of that effort. It is also interesting because Australia has to deal with exactly the same sorts of problems of great distance, significant temperature differences, drought, flood and fire—the sorts of things that make for specific requirements even in a telecommunications system.

         Finally, I simply say a few words about the time in South Africa. It is sobering to go to Johannesburg and Pretoria or, more particularly, to leave the white cities and go to the townships. I spent some time in Soweto, in Katlahong and Soshanguve. The townships were shocking in the mile upon mile of grossly insufficient housing. We were able, after we had asked whether we could, to visit with a family in what most of us would call an insufficient description of a garage: a galvanised iron shed, the roof held on by rocks and the ceiling but six feet high. If one put two single beds in the room, one would be out the front door.

          The place was immaculately clean. Each day this lady made sure that her house was tidy and in order. There was no water; standpipes were some many yards or kilometres away; water has to be carried, as African women are good at doing, on their heads; and of course there was no sewerage. This, for mile after mile.

         In Johannesburg and Soweto there were huge slag heaps within cooee of the townships. I was interested, when visiting the hospital nearby, to ask the doctors what was in the dust. One doctor said, `It's just dust, you don't have to worry about it'. Another doctor said, with remarkable honesty, `It's from the mines; it's full of cyanide'. That dust blows so that we could hardly see trees across the ground—dust which is full of cyanide that was falling on those people day after day. It is just a little extra that they had added to their lives.

         The poverty there was extraordinary. Another reason why I was pleased to go was because there are a number of APHEDA projects funded to some of those townships. One was a creche and another a pre-school centre that was going to open the next day. The walls were built and the ceiling was being put on that afternoon or evening. Again, apart from water, housing and sewerage, the principal request for black people in South Africa was for education—education that has been denied them under the Bantu education system. I was advised that that Bantu education system will ensure that whenever democracy comes to South Africa apartheid will continue for at least 20 years but, more realistically, 40 years, as the people who are insufficiently educated wash through the system and a new generation of people, hopefully better educated, come into the system. The need for education is critical at all levels. The programs are aimed at the moment to start the education system with children at the beginning of school, so that they at least can expect to leave school with an adequate and comprehensive education.

I am also happy to put on the record that when I met Walter Sisulu, amongst other things that we talked about were, of course—from my point of view—women. I was somewhat surprised when Walter Sisulu said to me, `You know, you are the first politician, Senator, who's ever raised the question of women with me'. I believe that that is something I will want to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) about so that again and again we will see that women are legitimately part of any international discussions and that they are on the agenda.

         For the financial year ending June 1992, according to an estimated profit and loss statement from their accountants which has been submitted to the Department of Social Security, there will be a total income for the year of $5,892. The problem is that of that income of $5,892 their farming enterprise shows a loss of $1,573. There is $300 in bank interest, wages of $500, an accident insurance claim of $1,250, and most significantly a QIDC household support assistance payment from 1 October 1991 to 30 June 1992 of $5,415, making a grand total of $5,892.

         Mr and Mrs N sought financial assistance through the QIDC, and on 17 October 1991 the QIDC advised Mr and Mrs N that $1,805 was approved for household assistance support to cover the period from 1 October 1991 to 31 December 1991. It advised that the assistance was available in quarterly advances for an initial period of six months. I make it clear that this funding is provided to alleviate financial hardship while the people concerned face the decision of whether to adjust out of primary production and sell their property. After this period, if the people decide to retain their property, the assistance provided converts to a loan, with interest charged at commercial rates repayable over seven years. Therefore, there is no guarantee that it is income; it could be a loan if they decide to stay on.

         Meanwhile, back at the Department of Social Security, Mrs N, as is required, has advised the Department that they will be receiving $1,805 in household support assistance and that the support was available for six months—they had received it for a period of three months. The Department of Social Security got out its calculator and worked out that Mr and Mrs N would receive income of $1,805 multiplied by four—a sum of $7,220 until June 1992. Clearly that cannot be the case because even if the assistance were to run for the whole period through to the end of June 1992, they could still get only three quarters of that, but that is the Department's logic.

         The DSS decided that the QIDC household support would be to June 1992—$1,805 multiplied by four, or, as I said, $7,220. The Department said that interest would be $108 and—I ask the Senate to listen to this—that Mr and Mrs N would have a farm income of $20,020. The reality is that they will have a farm loss of $1,573, which is the estimated figure. The Department also estimated that accident insurance would be worth $1,440 and wages $500, making a total of $29,288. In the words of the Dickensian character Mr Micawber, that result would be bliss if it were true. If it were true, these people would not be bothered with the Department of Social Security in the first place. Something is severely wrong. As the Senate will recall, Mr and Mrs N's accountant estimated their annual income for this financial year to be $5,892, made up of $5,415 principally of QIDC household support.

         I am not going to restate the arguments of this afternoon about whether or not spending $20m in north Queensland is a good thing. It seems to me to be a perfectly ludicrous argument for a Queensland senator to make. But that is something for the Liberal Party. I do wish to make the point that I think all of us should avoid naming people who cannot defend themselves unless they take advantage of referral through the Standing Committee on Privileges. But that is not easy for many ordinary Australian citizens unless they know that that procedure is available. I will certainly be advising Mr Reynolds and Mr Parker that that facility is available, but whether or not they take action on it is entirely up to them.

         It is important this evening to put on the record the fact that honourable senators should think very carefully before they name people in this place. We can name each other; we can say what we like about each other because we can all come back in and argue the point. We are part of this process; but innocent bystanders do not deserve to be named in this place, unless it is in the context of some absolutely extraordinary allegation that is in the public interest and there is full documentation of that circumstance.

I remind Senator Reynolds that the remarks I made followed a question to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins). The reason they followed that question is that I moved a motion that the Senate take note of the Minister's reply. The reply he gave me was unsatisfactory and not in keeping with the facts I obtained upon doing a thorough search on what this $20m was to be spent on.

If anything is needed in this country today, in view of our current account deficit and in view of the number of people unemployed, it is a real stimulus for real jobs.

         On investigation of the remarks that had been made by the Chairman of the Port Authority in the Townsville newspaper, what I said was quite correct. The old board was basically thrown out and he was appointed chairman by his mate. It was a mate's job for the boys. I know that he was mayor for many years. In fact, he extended many courtesies to me on the trips I made to Townsville.

         It was difficult to ascertain what the money was going to be spent on, hence the first question I asked of Senator Collins. When he responded and said that it was to ensure the continued jobs of 900 people at Yabulu, that was clearly wrong. The expenditure of that money on the outer harbour had nothing whatsoever to do with the continued existence of Greenvale Nickel. In fact, Greenvale Nickel distanced itself from this expenditure because the initial expenditure was no good unless there were further contributions of another $60m-odd to complete the project.

         There are many other projects in the Townsville area that need money. It seems that the Government has put together a package very quickly to respond somehow to the Hewson Fightback package, and in the process it has not done its homework. In all the remarks I have heard today—whether from Senator Collins or Senator Reynolds—I have yet to hear any justification for throwing money at a rail loop where there is already a perfectly good rail loop, and for spending money on land reclamation and dredging of an outer harbour where there is no demand for that port facility. If there was a demand, I would agree with Senator Reynolds, but she knows and I know that Greenvale would prefer to use Halifax Bay, although at this stage it is prevented from doing so. Using Halifax Bay prevents double handling and would enable them to be viable, and there is an appeal going on in relation to that.

         —In recent days we have seen the Government solving the crisis in youth unemployment by pretending that there is not one. It has been coming out with invented figures which, as has been pointed out in this place, are totally mischievous, totally dishonest and totally deceptive—claiming, for example, that the real measure of youth unemployment is not as a percentage of the work force but as a percentage of the population. We all know that is absolute nonsense. The real measure is the number of people looking for jobs. If the Government is going to apply this new criteria, I wonder why it has not applied that percentage to the adult unemployed. There is exactly the same proportion of adults out of the work force as there are 15- to 19-year-old young people out of the work force. The percentage for adults is about 52 per cent and for 15- to 19-year-olds it is about 60 per cent. That dishonesty is exposed as absolute total nonsense.

         Looking at the adult work force, it would be just as rational to include in the work force as the measure all retired people and all wives who do not work if you are going to include all young people who are at school and not seeking a job. The irrationality of the Government's position is self-evident. But now we come to a greater dishonesty in the Government's position. Mr Beazley, who is now Minister for Employment, Education and Training, is so ill-informed in this matter that he said on the Richard Palfreyman radio program `The World Today':

        Youth rates of unemployment are high, that is true, but compared to the 1982-83 recession there are far fewer young people actually looking for work; about 450,000 back in 1982-83. The number is now 290,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, he was suggesting to the listeners that there had been a dramatic cut of 145,200 in the number of young Australians looking for jobs. That is totally false. Maybe it is only incompetence that led him to that because the figures he quoted are exactly the figures of the number of young Australians in full time work. It is true that back in 1983 in that recession there were 450,000 young Australians in full time jobs. There are now only 290,000 in full time jobs. His figures are exactly right for the wrong matter.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Those figures reflect the number of jobs wiped out. One in every three full time youth jobs has been wiped out since the 1983-84 recession. Yet Mr Beazley got on radio and quoted those figures of the jobs wiped out. Wrongly and incompetently, he referred to them as the number of young people actually looking for work. For his information, let us get the facts straight—and let us hear him apologise.

         The facts are that the total number of 15- to 19-year-olds unemployed—that includes people looking for full time and part time jobs—in January 1984, at the peak of the recession, was 222,100. It is now 218,100—roughly in line, except that there were more people in the work force then. So the unemployment rate among 15- to 19-year-olds in 1984 was 26.9 per cent and the unemployment rate now is 27.3 per cent, the worst on record. They are the actual figures, if Mr Beazley wants to know the facts, and that is taking part timers as well as full timers. Of course, if we take the proper measure of youth unemployment, which is the full time unemployment rate, it is now 34.8 per cent compared to 30 per cent.

         On every honest measure, youth unemployment now is worse than it was in the last recession, and for Mr Beazley to come out pretending that there had been a drop of 150,000 in the number of young people looking for work when in fact it was a drop of 150,000 in the number of young people at work indicates either a massive desire to pretend that the problem does not exist, to talk it out of existence, or a massive incompetence in being able to read the unemployment statistics. Whatever it is, it explains clearly why this Government has done absolutely nothing to resolve the crisis of youth unemployment. All it has done is try to invent figures to pretend that the problem does not exist.

         That is why the young people of Australia received nothing in this One Nation program—nothing but an admission that the job training schemes had been failures. Three of them are being quietly closed down and the funds diverted into a repackaged version of the same sort of thing. This Government has the hide to come into this chamber and accuse me of retailing misleading statistics when they are in fact from the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force survey. The only people misleading the Parliament and Australia on the level of youth unemployment are in this Government. If they are going to do anything about it, it would be a nice idea if they tried to fix the problem, not just fiddle the figures.

         —in reply—We have had a number of speakers on the adjournment tonight. Senator Crowley spoke about her experiences in Africa, which was informative. Senator O'Chee raised a matter in the nature of a grievance. Senator Reynolds did the same about the naming of people who are not members of this place and are unable to defend themselves when they and their reputations are criticised. Senator Parer replied to those allegations, although, I might say, quite limply and ineffectually. Senator Michael Baume rose on the subject of youth unemployment.

Why does he bother to propound a fallacy so consistently unless he believes that by continuous repetition he can sometimes change reality? What Senator Baume has done here tonight is what he has done on a number of other occasions. Words like `dishonesty' and `misleading' trip very lightly and easily from his tongue. I suggest anyone interested in this subject should in fact look at the truth of the circumstances and come to a conclusion. Senator Baume put out a press release the other week in which he said that one in three young Australians was unemployed.

         The situation with youth unemployment is of course different from the situation of adult unemployment. The reason for that is that the labour market for young people is a different labour market in character and nature than the adult labour market. Young people are traditionally between the ages of 15 and 19 and are not married with families; therefore, one does not find the lack of participation in the work force that there is amongst adults because they have family responsibilities or other duties. So the test about family or domestic responsibilities does not apply to this group in the work force.

         The other notable thing that does not apply to this group in the work force is that a huge number of people in this age group are in education or training. In fact, the most significant element of education and training is that in the nine years of this Government—and today I think is the celebration of the ninth year of the election of the Hawke Labor Government in 1983—the retention rate for year 12 students has doubled. That is quite a significant achievement. It is also true that during this time in approximate terms real expenditure has increased in real terms. I cannot be absolutely sure about this figure, but the figure I have in mind—

         —No, I will not invent one. It is about 40 per cent or more; I am being modest. It represents a huge commitment to education under this Government and a huge boost in opportunity for young people to remain in the education system. If one looks at the youth labor market, in rough order the figure is one in 10. About seven of the 10 young people are in education or training of some sort; the other three are in the labour market. One of those three is unemployed. That is the true context in which this occurs. To run around with headlines about one in three is, of course, ridiculous.

         The other characteristic about youth unemployment is that there is a tendency in this age structure for young people to dip in and out of the labour force, to transfer between working and training and back again. Another feature about this age group is that these people tend to be placed much quicker than other age groups. So we are not looking here at an in-built group which is long term unemployed; we are looking at a group of people who move around in employment much more quickly. The great feature of what this Government has done is its commitment to training and education.

         The huge feature of the One Nation statement is, of course, the commitment of an extra $720m towards TAFE training. This Government is concerned that the funds spent on education have meant that the technical training and TAFE sector is out of balance with the tertiary and education sector and that there is now a need to commit funds to that area.

         The innovation in the One Nation statement is to do this in cooperation with the States on a national scale in order to bring opportunities for technical training back into focus. That is, I think, one of the most positive commitments any government can make to the question of employment opportunities for young people. Those who have the better skills are the ones who are likely to be placed. As the recovery takes place with greater force during the course of this year, employment opportunities in real careers will be opened for them. This training that they now have access to will stand them in good stead for those careers.

         document, the Hewson consumption tax package, which alters some of the labour market programs in a way in which the victims get blamed and the cost is borne by them. In fact, Austrain, which is supposed to be a labour market support program under the Hewson consumption tax package, is best named, as it has been called now, `Austslave'. It means that people who are employed under this program, should it ever take root, will work at 80 per cent of the award rate. That means that a pool of low-wage labour, able to displace existing labour without creating additional spots, will be created. The cost of bidding wages down across the board will be borne by those people who are wage earners.

        However, Taxation Ruling IT 2255, which issued on 27 February 1986, explains the Commissioner's view of the law in this area. A specific provision (section 26AD) of the income tax law includes in a taxpayer's assessable income amounts paid in respect of accrued and pro-rata long service leave to which a taxpayer is entitled. Such income is subject to a maximum rate of tax of 30%.

        The provisions, however, only apply to pro rata long service leave payments if there is some formal arrangement for the making of the payment. A gratuitous payment to a terminating employee, calculated on a basis similar to that for ordinary long service leave entitlements, is not sufficient. That is the case whether the payment is a payment to an employee who has not qualified for any long service leave entitlement or is an additional payment calculated by reference to the employee's ordinary long service leave entitlements.

        Such a gratuitous termination payment is an eligible termination payment. Where such a payment is an approved early retirement scheme payment or a bona fide redundancy payment it may qualify for concessional taxing treatment. That is, only 5 per cent of any amount (not including forgone superannuation benefits) in excess of what the taxpayer would have been entitled to on voluntary retirement is included in assessable income and taxed at marginal rates. The tax law does not discriminate in this respect between a taxpayer receiving a redundancy package or a taxpayer retiring early under an approved early retirement scheme.''
