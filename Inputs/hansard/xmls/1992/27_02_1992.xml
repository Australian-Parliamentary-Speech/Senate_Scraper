There is a significant period during which the provisions of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) will operate. It will be legislated and there will be subsequent legislation to implement the depreciation arrangements announced in the statement. I have no intention of getting into a debate now about anything that is not concerned with the parliamentary timetable. I will deal with these matters at the appropriate time—when the tax Bill comes in. However, there will be a significant period when the announcements of March 1991 constitute the law under which a number of people have already made decisions. They are entitled to have the law changed to reflect their expectations when they made those investment decisions. That will happen and there will be subsequent legislation to further enhance the depreciation arrangements as announced yesterday.

I do not doubt that he was one who, some years prior to the introduction of this legislation, supported the banning of political television advertising, but I thought it not without consequence that the greater parts of Senator Schacht's speech and Senator Loosley's speech were justifying the banning of the advertising on pragmatic, political grounds. There was no ideological persuasion in Senator Loosley's proposition. He missed the one fundamental tenet. In fact, he described us as ideological zealots.

The truth of the matter is that Senator Schacht holds himself up as a civil libertarian, as the Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, but he seems to have this quaint notion that human rights and civil liberties begin at the very shores of Australia and extend out. I find it remarkable that Senator Schacht finds no difficulty in denying Australians the intrinsic and inherent right to watch television advertising if they so choose.

         Senator Schacht made much of the fact that there has been, thus far, no great revolt on the streets as a result of the ban, and that was a measure of his approval. But it goes without saying that the identification card, about which we had an election, was not a major issue in that election. It was only after a subsequent awakening and awareness by the community of the implications of that card that we had the revolt that swept right across Australia. In due course the majority of Australians will take great exception to this legislation.

         Senator Schacht also has some quaint notion that all wisdom and knowledge resides in Canberra. He had no difficulty whatsoever with the fact that the legislation imposed itself upon State elections and local government elections. I find it absolutely outrageous that the Federal Government believes that in some way it ought to be responsible for controlling the manner and the method of political advertising not only for State elections but also for local government elections. I find it an arrogance, an impertinence, which is breathtaking in its width.

Surely he is not suggesting that they did not persuade people to cast their vote for the Greens, and that because his Party happened to be higher than ours on the Green ticket the preferences were not running very heavily towards his Party. It was a very effective way of communicating a message—a dishonest message, a bland message, an untrue message but an effective message.

There is still relief to be had in the courts, however, in certain circumstances. The truth of the matter is that political parties invariably will spend the money where they judge it to have the most effective results.

What they did was to articulate an emotional, subliminal feeling of the time. There was a feeling, perhaps latent, in the community at the time that it was time, and the slogan captured that feeling. The object of political advertising is not to create new information, but to articulate the feelings, even if latent, that people already have. To that extent, both those slogans were effective. `Turn on the Lights' was a very effective slogan. We had been through a period of darkness in Australia and that slogan very effectively picked up that feeling.

         The truth of the matter is that this legislation and these regulations are not about a government that is making, on behalf of the Australian people, a judgment as to where expenditure should be or expenditure should not be, what is the most effective way of advertising and what is not the most effective way of advertising. Quite frankly, it is none of its business to make those judgments. They are commercial judgments and political judgments, to be made by political parties—as are policies, as are platforms, as are issues and as are attitudes towards issues. The truth is that this legislation is brought before us because the Labor Party is going into the next Federal election without hope, without policies, without money and without any likelihood of any of those three elements changing in dimension. We now find that there is a ban on rights and freedoms of speech as a result of the crude politics this Government is seeking to play.

         Perhaps there was, in a not too obtuse way, no more practical example of this Government's fear of freedom of speech, and a comparison between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, when recently we had Her Majesty the Queen in Parliament House. The Government allowed the Queen to come into King's Hall for two hours or an hour and a half to meet a number of Australian people, but denied her an opportunity to speak. In the normal course of events, if the Queen had spoken, John Hewson would have spoken. If John Hewson had spoken, he would have created an odious comparison between himself and the new Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Mr Keating had gone through that dubious pleasure on the occasion of the visit of George Bush and he was not going to have it repeated. So that Keating could not be compared with Hewson, the Queen was denied an opportunity to speak.

         I conclude by saying that it is not any longer curious but consequential to note that the party that claimed to be made up of icons of people's intrinsic individual rights is the first to use them and abuse them when its political agenda requires it to do so. As I say, Senator Schacht claims a great concern for human rights. Senator Loosley claims to be concerned for human rights. I rather wonder what the Lionel Murphys of this world would be thinking now if they could see what this Government is doing to people's human rights. However, notwithstanding the corruption of this Government, there is no prospect of its being re-elected. No doubt, in due course, this legislation will be repealed.

         —in reply—In exercising my right of reply, I rise to speak in support of my motion to disallow the Political Broadcasts (Tasmania) Regulations and Political Broadcasts (Australian Capital Territory) Regulations. To put the matter into perspective, I will just recount what it is all about. Honourable senators will remember that some 12 months ago this Government decided to introduce legislation which would have banned all paid political advertising on radio and television for 12 months of the year. It was the most draconian, outrageous legislation ever presented before this Parliament in respect of attacking freedom of speech and freedom of political expression.

         As the legislation progressed, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) took a cocky view by saying that he was confident the legislation would be passed—legislation representing a total ban on political advertising for 365 days of the year, for ever. It became apparent that the reason for his confidence related to some shady backroom deal between himself and the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell. I can recall being jointly interviewed with Senator Kernot—who spoke on this matter yesterday—by one Haydn Sargent on radio in Brisbane. During that radio debate I remarked that it was apparent that some deal had been made. Senator Kernot, who at that time was throwing her hat in the ring for either leadership or deputy leadership of the Australian Democrats, said after a pause, `I sincerely hope not'.

         The grassroots membership of the Democrats became concerned that the parliamentary members of their party, who had come in here supposedly to keep the so-and-sos honest, were making a deal on a principle for which there could be no compromise whatsoever. As a result, the Democrats changed leadership and remarked that under no circumstances would they support this attack on freedom of speech and freedom of political expression in Australia. Senator Coulter took over the leadership. As a result, because the Minister had lost the deal, the legislation was amended somewhat—not without a battle, I might say. It was only with the insistence of the Liberal and National parties that the legislation was forced before a select committee for investigation.

         Towards the end of last year the Government decided to make this an urgent Bill, guillotined it through the House of Representatives, and put on a time limit in respect of debate in the Senate. I believe it was the longest debate that has gone on since 1964. But to show the incompetence of this Government, and this Minister in particular, even then it did not get it right. That debate had to be adjourned because the formulas in regard to the allocation of free time, as pointed out by Senator Macdonald, were found to be absolutely incorrect. We had to have separate discussions outside this chamber in order to come back with some sort of formula that was more equitable than the one that had been suggested.

         The Bill was eventually passed with the support of the Democrats—except, I might say, Senator Sowada, who stuck to her principles. At the time I made the remark that when the Democrats were offered the choice between principles and money, they took the money. Not only did they collect a whole lot of additional free advertising paid for by the radio and television stations of this country, but also they made the absolutely lunatic proposal that at every election in the future a photograph, a CV and a brief description of policy for every candidate in the country be presented to every elector. That would cost millions of dollars, and logistically I would say it would not be possible. In the main, from the date of nomination close to an election will be about 20 days. In that period, every candidate in this country will present the Electoral Commission with a photograph, a CV, and a brief policy description, and the Electoral Commission will be required to put that in the hands of every householder in Australia.

In recent years there has been an increasing tendency, in accordance with the general greater openness of parliamentary processes, for Senators to disclose the advice they have received on particular matters. This has created an impression in some quarters that the Clerk and the Senate have undertaken some new or expanded advisory role. In fact, the advice which is now given covers the same areas relating to Senate and committee proceedings as advice which has always been given by Senate Clerks, and the only change is that more written advices are given and more of them are eventually disclosed.

In the Act, the definition of a referendum is one that seeks to change the Constitution. Neither of those referenda sought to change the Constitution. The one in the ACT was to determine whether the electoral system would be single member electorates or Hare-Clark and the one in Queensland was in respect of daylight saving.

         In Queensland, those supporting and those opposing daylight saving ran a fairly emotional campaign on both sides, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will appreciate; and they were entitled to do so. They were entitled to run paid ads. However, people in the ACT were not. On verbal advice and on legal advice, the radio and television stations refused to run the ads. Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum in Queensland, those people who ran the ads opposing daylight saving would probably claim that it was only by alerting the city people to the problems in the bush that they were able to get the referendum result that they did. That is the sort of thing, in a general election campaign, that this Government has banned. It is preventing people—individuals in society, not necessarily people standing for Parliament—from actually getting their point of view across.

         I wrote to Mr Westerway of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, asking him on what basis the ads in the ACT were banned. After some days he responded to me. Basically, what he said was that the ABT was somewhat limited in what it could do. I can tell the Senate, because I have had feedback from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, that it, being the policeman for this legislation, does not like it one little bit. Frankly, I do not blame it. The Tribunal said that, with the exception of children's programs, it cannot assess material for broadcast before it has gone to air and that it can respond to complaints from viewers or listeners only after a program has been broadcast.

         What does that mean? It means that the radio and television stations have to take the risk; and, if they are wrong, they run the risk of having their licences taken from them. Mr Acting Deputy President, it is akin to you or me going to a police station, being unsure of the law, and saying to the local sergeant of police, `If I do a certain action, will you arrest me and put me in gaol or not?'; and he responds and says, `Go and do it and, your having done it, I will then tell you whether you are guilty or not'. It is absolutely ludicrous, and it is indicative of the great shemozzle this legislation is and of the fact that it should never have been introduced and should be thrown out. The new Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that it needs amendment. My observation would be that his consideration of amendments will not be based on principles, on which our whole stand on this matter has been based, it will be based on political pragmatism. If he thinks it is going to advantage the Labour Party, he will do it. If he does not, he will not.

         That is the sort of thing that is wrong with this country. It is the sort of reason why Dr Hewson is so much accepted out in the community. He is prepared to put his cards on the table and not use simple, political pragmatism for the direction he takes. This is to be compared with the approach taken by the Prime Minister and to a large extent reflected by what came out in the statement last night. The statement, and I say this from a totally apolitical point of view, will not be any sort of incentive for investment decisions in this country, which is the only way to contribute to real growth.

         I should like to comment briefly on some of the remarks made by other participants in this debate. As I mentioned, the remarks made by the Minister, quite apart from his attack on the Clerk of the Senate, were so shallow as not to warrant response. I listened with care to what Senator Loosley said and I believe he maintained a very lucid argument in the main, which is more than can be said for the incompetent Minister who handled the Bill and the Act. The only comment I would make is that I thought Senator Loosley went very well until he started to compare the Australian system and what might be the case in Australia with the American system, particularly in respect to voting and the attendance at the polls. There is no comparison between the two. This is where I think he went off the track. He would have been more credible if he had drawn parallels not between Australia and the United States but between Australia and New Zealand, which is the closest country with a similar system. However, that will be the subject of another debate further down the line.

         Mr Acting Deputy President, I have moved a motion to disallow these regulations. An argument has been put on the other side that this is just a repeat of what happened before Christmas. I think that reflects the principled view we have taken on this legislation right from the word go. We have not deviated; we believe there is no room for compromise. I just wish the Democrats would go back to their initial grassroots support, that they would stick to what they said after they dumped their leader and not support this ban.

         We had the crazy situation where deals were made. For example, the argument about talking heads was put in the debate on the legislation. The Democrats are aware that the reason for that is to make people turn off, to get them bored. From a Liberal Party point of view, this legislation suits us down to the ground because the sort of debate that will come up at the next election, where we will have the credible Dr Hewson against the discredited Mr Keating, will be right up our alley. But we did not support the legislation as a matter of principle.

We had the situation where everyone used France, for God's sake, as an example of the funding of political campaigns. Talking heads: that is a great description! They invented the guillotine, so they might as well have talking heads. There is a great corruption inquiry going on in France right now.

         —I rise to present the Opposition's view on the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991. Reform of Australia's land transport infrastructure is a key national priority. It has been estimated that, if Australia can achieve world class performance in road and rail, gross domestic product would be increased by up to 2 per cent, with the bulk of 40 per cent of this potential gain coming from the rail system itself.

         The Industry Commission, in its 1991 report on rail, estimated that moving to international best practice in management and work practices would increase gross domestic product by $5 billion per year, or $300 for every Australian. This Bill allows the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. The agreement is set out in schedule 1 of the Bill.

South Australia has not yet signed the agreement and Queensland has not yet become an equity partner at this stage. Provisions have been made for these two States to participate in the future if they so desire.

         By way of background, the parties to the agreement agreed that a company would be established for the purpose of conducting interstate rail freight operations in Australia on a commercial basis in accordance with principles compatible with those set out in the Heads of Government agreement on the National Rail Freight Corporation of 31 October 1990. The principles are that the company will operate on a strictly commercial basis; have access to the requisite assets; operate under labour agreements that reflect best international practices in productivity standards—that should be borne in mind; be able to contract activities where appropriate; provide access to its network and facilities to public and private sector operators; be able to provide services to the governments on a strictly commercial basis; and not be in any way responsible for redundancies that may arise in rail authorities resulting from its formation and operation. A further principle is that, during the establishment period of five years, the current financial position of the Commonwealth and State rail authorities' interstate rail freight operations will not deteriorate as a result of the Commonwealth and the States participating in the formation and operation of the company.

         The Bill provides that the National Rail Corporation will be subject to all rates, taxes and charges; not have the shield of the Crown; and be treated as an ordinary incorporated company, including being subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Bill provides for the transfer to the NRC of assets owned or leased by the Commonwealth or the Australian National Railways Commission. It also provides for substituting the NRC for the Commonwealth or AN in cases where the legislative transfer of assets or contracts has been agreed in accordance with the shareholders' agreement.

         To turn to the financial impact, the Bill does not appropriate funds. However, the Commonwealth's cash equity contributions under the NRC agreement are forecast as totalling $295.8m in the five years, commencing with $40m in 1991-92, plus another $20m brought forward under the former Prime Minister's statement.

         The Commonwealth's commitment is dependent on the NRC meeting the agreed principles already mentioned, particularly labour arrangements. The establishment of the NRC is expected to have an impact on the deficits of State railway systems and the Australian National system. This will be no small task, as the total losses on interstate rail freight are estimated to have amounted to $377m in 1989-90. The NRC is supposed to break even within three years and to be fully self-sufficient within five years.

         The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia are founder shareholders. The number of ordinary shares is based on each shareholder's estimated long term equity in the company. Accordingly, the ultimate anticipated shareholding will apply at the outset instead of the usual basis of progressive cash and asset contributions. Additional shares will be issued if Queensland becomes a shareholder.

The shareholders will contribute $414.5m, with the Commonwealth contributing $295.8m. The company will progressively take over functions from the Commonwealth and State systems, and this transference will be completed by the end of the company's third year.

         On 5 December 1991, report No. 16 of the Auditor-General, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Accountability off the Rails
         </emphasis>
         , was tabled in the Senate. The report raised serious concerns about the appointment of a private auditor to the NRC and the erosion of accountability to the Parliament. While supporting the establishment of the NRC to handle interstate rail freight, and later possibly passenger services, the Liberal and National parties are concerned that the Commonwealth has the majority of equity in the Corporation, and consequently the auditing should be carried out by the Auditor-General or under his control in order to fully protect taxpayers' money. We attach a deal of importance to this, particularly as the Commonwealth plans to invest $296m over five years. The intent of the amendment will be to ensure that the Auditor-General has the control of the audit of the Corporation while the Commonwealth is the major equity holder.

         There is a very recent legislative precedent for our concern that the Auditor-General should control the audit. We made the same point in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 and were successful in having this provision written into the legislation. The Corporation must be open to public scrutiny. The Auditors-General of five States support the Auditor-General's Office's warning of the erosion in its ability to scrutinise the activities of a public sector company unless this amendment is made to the legislation.

         The Scrutiny of Bills Committee notes that while the necessity to enact legislation must be considered an `unusual circumstance', there is still no obligation to proclaim this piece of legislation once the other parties to the agreement—New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia—have enacted legislation to approve the agreement. I would like the Minister representing the current Minister for Transport and Communications to give his views on this matter in his response.

         The agreement specifies that labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award which reflect best practice in productivity standards must be in place before any capital is committed. This aspect of the agreement is of vital importance and one the coalition insists should be enforced. It is no use ruining the window of opportunity even before it has been opened by just throwing money at the railways—which lose millions of dollars each year currently—without addressing the fundamental underlying problem. If the problems the Government has experienced with redundancies in Australian National is any guide, it is clear it is not prepared to take the hard decisions necessary. This is not an encouraging sign for the beginnings of the NRC.

         It is not clear what the shareholding will be at the end of the five-year establishment period, but it appears no shareholder will be able to hold more than 49 per cent of the shares. This restriction places the claim of commerciality under a question mark. Also, in any commercial operation it would be known what the shareholdings would be right from the start.

         Another point the coalition would like to raise is what happens to the leftovers in Australian National and V/Line once the NRC is operational. It is our belief that if any lines are profitable—or capable of becoming profitable—the NRC should be encouraged to take them over on commercial grounds. However, this may not be possible because of the clause in the agreement which gives the States the power to decide what happens to intrastate lines. Of course, I can understand the concern in my own State because Queensland, with its own intrastate lines which carry bulk commodities, has used those lines for over a decade as the milch cow for government to the detriment of the mining companies.

         I will list some of the coalition's other concerns. Firstly, there are problems arising from the ability of the States to revoke references under section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution. Under clause 3(1)(a)(i) of the agreement the States must enact legislation referring to the Commonwealth under section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution the matter of the Commonwealth holding shares in the company when the company engages in intrastate rail transport services in each State.

         Secondly, there is resolution of disputes. Another area I want to comment on here is a matter which appears to be similar to one we were concerned about in the Roads Commission legislation. It involves a possible inappropriate delegation of legislative power. I am referring to clause (2) of the Bill which provides:
        </tab>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Act commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.

        There is no limit as to the time in which such a proclamation must be made, and in this regard the provision is contrary to the general rule set out in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel drafting instruction No. 2 of 1989. The explanatory memorandum of the Bill states:

        Proclamation will occur when all the parties to the Agreement have enacted legislation approving the Agreement.

        This aspect of the agreement requires a more detailed examination for which there is no time now. However, it is quite possible there may be disputes at some future time for which there is no satisfactory process of arbitration as the Inter-State Commission no longer exists.

         Thirdly, there is the adequacy of capital. Article 5(3) of the articles of association provides that during the establishment period no charges in the capital of the company, other than the 500 ordinary shares, 500 B convertible shares and such of the A convertible shares as may be allotted to the Commonwealth or any State in return for cash or in satisfaction of the transfer of interests in assets, may be allotted without the unanimous resolution of the company and general meeting. It must be noted that A convertible shares do not carry a voting right.

That is in article 2(1). The transition period has been defined as the first three-year period of the establishment period in clause 1 of the agreement.

         Fourthly, there is the access to and transfer of assets to the company by the rail authorities. Clauses 5(5) and 5(6) of the agreement provide for the access to and transfer of assets to the company by the rail authorities. The objective is that all transfers of ownership, leases or grants of access shall be completed before the end of the transition period of three years. While clause 5(5) in particular is probably intended to meet the constitutional hurdle referred to previously, the practical implementation may lead to disputes in relation to contract prices for use of the assets, as they are tied with the efficiency of operations of the State rail authority that owns the assets and to NRC standard costs.

         Then there are best practice industrial agreements. The agreement between the Commonwealth and the States revolves around the ability of the company to negotiate successfully with the unions concerned a best practice industrial agreement. Thus recital B(iii) expresses the hope that the company shall operate under labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award, which reflects best practice and productivity standards through efficient and commercial consideration. This is vital. What is meant by best industrial practice? What is the benchmark? Is the authority to adopt the negative, destructive work practices which have been the largest single factor which has contributed to the destruction of much of industry in Australia? Are we going to have a closed shop with union leaders who have no interest in their members, but only in their own power base, calling the shots? Are we going to have the same inflexibility which bedevils the rest of industry in Australia?

         The infusion of additional capital is, under clause 5(1)(b) of the agreement, made dependent upon the confirmation by the company that best practices are in place to provide a basis for commercial operations. There would be considerable uncertainty of the viability of the company if best practices were not in place which were effective over a period longer than one year, to which awards under the current system generally apply.

With all the best efforts in the world, even though the cost of road had escalated at a considerable rate, it was still not economically possible to do so. One of the reasons was that, once one got to the border of Queensland, the rail gauge changed. There is no doubt that a standard rail gauge is something we should all aspire to.

Four days later it was discovered marooned in a siding near Goulburn.

         It is going to be extremely difficult to get costs down to the levels envisaged. It is, therefore, absolutely vital that the provisions in the Bill for ensuring that labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award reflect best practice in productivity standards are in place before any capital is committed. Once the capital starts flowing without the appropriate structure being in place, we have once again wasted the opportunity for reform. Getting the structure right is the major concern that I have with this Bill. Questions have to be raised as to the right of any State to revoke access to intrastate operations, the resolution of dispute processes, capital adequacy guarantees, asset valuation, and the power of any one State to disagree with the corporate plan for political purposes.

         We can see from this legislation and its obvious shortcomings that the NRC is not off to a smooth start. This is a step towards commercialisation of the Australian rail system and for this reason alone the legislation is necessary. Rail transport in Australia has great potential. Rail is ideal for most of the freight carried here. The problems to date have been the chronic inefficiencies that have plagued rail. The infrastructure has deteriorated, lines have been decommissioned, restrictive work practices have created enormous inefficiencies, and costs are artificial.

         This has led to a situation where rail has lost more and more of the freight market, when instead it should be dominating the market.

The commercial sector can see the convenience and the capability of the rail system, and laments its inefficiencies.

         To date, the major problems causing rail to be unable to compete with road have been—on top of the rail track itself being run down a certain amount—the different awards for operators of the trains and people that work on the trains between, say, Perth and Sydney, and the different rail authorities with their different running stock and locomotives, rather than rolling stock that goes right through. There are three safe working systems, I believe, between Sydney and Perth; there are three State rail authorities operating them. You just do not have a certain amount of efficiency.

We on this side of politics will be looking to privatisation of the contracts to maintain the line, where contractors can work 24 hours a day if necessary rather than for the limited times when the major capital equipment that is needed for rail upkeep can be used.

         It has been impossible in the last 20-odd years for rail to compete with road. Because road is mainly private enterprise, the trucks can move quickly—too quickly in some cases—and when they get to the other end they go straight into their terminals and trailers can be disconnected. At present wagons arriving in Perth from Sydney may get shunted in late on a Friday night and no-one can get to them until Monday morning—two days wasted. With a private enterprise system they could go into private freight yards or yards leased off ANR and they could be accessed immediately. It is useless a train getting to Perth from Sydney faster than a truck—and they should get there faster if truck drivers keep to their strict speed limits and regulations—to have those wagons tied up for a couple of days in a yard that cannot be accessed. This Bill provides the means of getting somewhere down that track, but I am afraid it does not go far enough. Part of the Bill provides access to the rail network and its facilities for public and private sector operators.

         As I said before, this is the time this Corporation has to work. If we fail to get rail back onto its feet this time, I am afraid that the rail system of Australia will go down the tubes and road transport will take a further share of it. In the last few years in this place there have been attempts to get rail back to where it should be in Australia. However, those attempts have been brought about by loading taxes, regulations, and other measures onto road transport and that is not the way to do it. When one loads it onto road transport, rather than making rail efficient, one is loading it onto short haul road transport.

         From my knowledge, I would say that about 70 per cent of road transport is in distances of about 60 or 70 kilometres. So when one tries to load taxes onto the long haul transporters, using the kind of measures that this Government has used in the past few years—I have always said in this place that I do not believe that any road transport from Perth to Sydney or Melbourne to Brisbane should be able to compete against rail, and yet it does, and very easily—one is also damaging the road haulage system in the short haul. One of the prime examples of that was when B-doubles were allowed in Victoria. In order to put a load on them, and to get money back to spend on rail, they were loaded with registration fees of about $12,000 a year compared with a standard semitrailer system of about $4,000 a year. Unfortunately, this does not work and the people of Victoria are obviously paying for it in the cost of their freight.

         When this company is put together I understand that a valuation of the assets has to be done. I certainly hope that for Westrail, in Western Australia, the valuations will be true and correct. Westrail is the most efficient rail system in Australia. It is shown that Westrail's part of interstate rail is the only line that is making a profit. So we would like to be assured that it will be evaluated on a true basis. I do not really understand why this Government insists that in this case no one shareholder will get more than 49 per cent of the company. If that limit is imposed, I cannot see how we will have true competition in the long run, especially when we are talking about it all being internally owned. If we are talking about overseas ownership, that is a different story.

I know that a lot of lines in Australia have been closed in the last 20 years. I have been a supporter of some and a critic of others, especially of the grain lines in the more remote areas. A lot of those lines are now part time lines. We would like to be assured that where lines are needed, they will be kept; so we would like to know what will happen to the leftovers.

There is also the guaranteed capital, which I have mentioned before, and assets valuation, which I have covered.

A heap of money was spent on the line from Perth to Koolyanobbing in about 1983, when BHP had the iron ore mine at Koolyanobbing. As soon as the upgrading was done, BHP pulled out and left the Western Australian iron ore industry to its own resources. Fortunately, it appears that the miniature steel mill in the south-west is getting off the ground and we hope that the Koolyanobbing iron ore mine will reopen.

The result of these years of neglect has been lives wasted in needless accidents on busy major highways, at great social cost to the community. Huge quantities of fuel have been wasted in transporting goods and people by road, while a functioning rail system would have done the job much more efficiently, and large sums of money have been wasted as a result. Local government authorities have had to pick up the tab for much of the road damage that has been created by the closure of rail lines through the decades and continuing to this very day; unfunded, or not sufficiently funded, by their so-called partners in government at Federal and State level.

A fully privatised corporation would be under absolutely no obligation to provide community services, even when those services might be fully paid for at commercial rates by the Commonwealth.

         It should be remembered that more than $730m has been spent by Labor on upgrading the Hume Highway, Melbourne to Sydney. This puts the $110m to be spent on the Melbourne-Sydney rail line into its proper perspective. The fact is that roads were the real winners in last night's statement. The hype that surrounded the rail plans has tended to disguise the fact that road spending will be increased by a greater amount, around $600m.

         I want to put on the record here too, Mr Deputy President, that I have some particular concerns about the rail transport plans emerging for Victoria. For example, the statement includes the blunt admission by the Prime Minister that the future of spur lines off the Adelaide-Melbourne line is `a matter for the Victorian Government'. Mr Keating, of all people, knows very well the parlous state of Victoria's finances and this means that he has signed the death warrant of existing broad gauge lines to rural Victoria and has washed his hands of any responsibility for the consequences—a callous and unacceptable way, in my view, to treat rural Victorians who are now dependent on a functioning rail line. The Federal Government must consult the Victorian Government to identify the likely closures and their social and economic consequences and decide what action should be taken to avoid or to cushion the blow.

         I am also concerned that the upgrading of the Melbourne to Geelong line, which of course is welcome, has been driven rather too much by the desire to shore up some two or three marginal Federal seats and five or so marginal State seats that will be serviced on that particular line. It seems to me, however, irrational to upgrade that part of the line, Melbourne-Geelong, when one can travel at the other end, at the East Gippsland end of the Melbourne-Gippsland corridor, and see electrification poles being ripped out of the ground. This is an area where 80 per cent of Victorians live and it should be seen as a corridor, not just as a vote catching Melbourne to Geelong exercise. This illustrates the point I am making about the emphasis in the package last night on the national rail highway at the expense of those routes that are not part of that major trunk system.

         In the context, the plan to build a road from the South Dynon rail terminal to the Swanson and Appleton docks, virtually mid-city in Melbourne, really mystifies me at this stage. It is a move that will add more trucks to an extremely heavily congested area right on the edge of the central business district in a city suffering from chronic and worsening smog problems. That problem is seen as a major one by citizens of that city, just as Sydney people are concerned about theirs; and it seems to me that the logical thing to have done there was to have upgraded the rail link. Surely this would have been a greater contribution to efficiency and, in the case of much of the freight movement, would have removed one change of mode from the process.

It is set up pursuant to an agreement between the Commonwealth and several States—New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.

         Schedule 1 contains a memorandum of association and articles of association which set up this company, and schedule 2 sets out the functions that this Corporation will perform once set up. I suppose the significant thing about the legislation is not so much the mechanisms that it sets up to enable rail to return to the place it ought to, but the fact that it is a ringing endorsement of rail transport. It is good to see that this legislation, which is a symbol of the nation's faith in land travel, and specifically in rail travel, has been endorsed by the statement last night of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which says that hundreds of millions of dollars will be devoted to backing up what we today are symbolising by passing this legislation.

         Rail is a very efficient means of transport; and it provides an alternative to road transport, which has its problems. It is to be noted in this context that the statement last night also indicated that hundreds of millions of dollars devoted would be devoted to roads. So after the plan has been worked out, we will then have very efficient rail and road systems in Australia. That is proper, given the fact that Australia consists of major cities and towns which are quite divorced from each other when compared with other countries. Vast distances must be traversed, and traversed as efficiently as possible. If there is anything that vindicates this Government's stand on micro-economic reform, it is what it is doing now in respect of land transport. This Bill heralds a most imaginative scheme, a great undertaking, and last night's address by the Prime Minister ensures the great vision will be realised.

         As things now stand, it is true that rail freight services operate at a deficit, but studies have shown that rail enjoys significant competitive advantages over road transport for medium to long distance haulages, in terms of fuel and energy efficiency. I have already spoken about that. It is important because transport costs are at the heart of the total price that our nation's export oriented products, such as steel, coal and wheat, incur. It is imperative that the movement of these goods between producers and purchasers occur in the most cost-efficient manner.

The Victorian Government—to give it proper credit—has invested more than $100m in recent years in making substantial improvements to performance of rail in that area. As a result, VicRail's capacity to move wheat efficiently and with flexibility from the great producing areas of Victoria to the ports of Portland and Geelong will be retained. Although Senator Panizza is familiar with wheat growing in Western Australia, I suppose he is not quite so familiar but nevertheless considerably familiar with the great wheat producing areas of Victoria, which no doubt he admires.

         One of the problems with the spine line that will go down the east coast of Australia, around the corner, and over to Adelaide is that it will be of a different gauge from the lines that run in the west of Victoria. It is imperative that this great scheme that the Federal Government has initiated does not result in the lines in Victoria being rendered non-viable. It is imperative that money be spent to make sure that they are kept open so that wheat, and cargo of all sorts, can be transported by rail. Passenger lines also must be maintained in that State.

         Unless adjustments are made when this new line is put around Australia, there is a threat not only to the cargo carrying capacity of trains in Victoria but also to some of the V/Line passenger services there. For example, in Victoria we have passenger services to Ballarat, Ballan, Melton and Bacchus Marsh. These are heavily patronised, popular and offer relatively high cost recoveries. There is a need to enhance these services through the introduction of better vehicles, more frequent trains and improvement to passenger amenities.

It can be reduced with some improvements to infrastructure and at a relatively low cost. If this is done there is a chance that there will be re-engendered in Australia a culture of travelling by rail.

         First, it is important that the transport infrastructure in Australia is structured in such a way, and is so competitive, that whatever mode is used will be the most efficient and most economical way of carrying out the particular task. I do not think we should get carried away with promoting one against the other, as tends to happen from time to time in debates such as this. It is very important, as far as this Bill and the agreement that has been reached between the Commonwealth and the States are concerned, that in the medium and longer term the structure is such as to maximise the efficiency advantages of rail in the carriage of some goods, in those tasks that rail can carry out.

         I want to refer particularly to a couple of points as far as this Bill is concerned. Some of it must go back to the statement of last night, although I shall not dwell on it: the rail systems are still paying fuel excise. Fuel excise was put in place, as I am sure we are all well aware, initially for the task of building and maintaining roads. The rail system currently is, in effect, charged about 7c per litre of fuel that is used—to enhance a competitor. That in itself creates an anomaly and puts rail at a significant disadvantage as a transporter, particularly of bulk commodities. That is something that needs seriously addressing. I have raised it in this place and prior to coming here, on a number of occasions. It was not until we saw the light of day of the Fightback package that we actually saw this particular problem, which is a very unfair imposition on the rail system, being addressed. I bring it again to the attention of the Government.

         Some years ago we found, in work that we did in Western Australia, that about 20 per cent of the direct cost of carting grain in Western Australia on rail arose as a direct result of the fuel excise. It put up significantly the cost to the individual producers whose wheat was carried on rail. It put the rail system at a significant disadvantage to road transport and it meant that a task that should have been carried out on rail was forced onto the road systems through bad economic policy.

         The next concern I have about this Bill is the emphasis, when we have a States and Commonwealth agreement, on interstate carriage. Senator Cooney alluded to this. In terms of maximising the efficiency from this agreement, I ask whether enough consideration has been given to the impact that it could have within the States, particularly in my State of Western Australia. In a number of the tasks that are being carried out, and because of the different gauges of the railway line, it could put the State systems at a disadvantage.

Of course, the vast majority of the tasks carried out by rail, particularly in agriculture and mining, are carried out within the States. Having said that, I must add that I believe that this will also give the opportunity for goods and services, particularly bulk carriage of goods, to move between States much more efficiently and more effectively than has happened in the past.

         There will be different requirements in terms of the manning levels, the hours, the stoppages and what is required to carry them out. For example, a quite different agreement would be required for the shifting of minerals across this country, from that required for, say, motor cars that were brought into the port of Fremantle, and put on the train to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or any of the capital cities. I believe it is quite ludicrous for us to see `operate under labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award' in the principles of the agreement. It really spells out clearly the problem that the Government has with its current industrial system when it operates on the basis of a fundamental principle that big is beautiful when, in fact, situations are quite different.

         In Western Australia some years ago we saw the introduction of two-man crews for carriage of grain in our State. It was one of the decisions that kept a significant amount of grain on our rail system. In addition to that, obviously it kept the trains rolling. In fact, in terms of the grain task that was being carried out, it increased the number of people employed in the rail system by actually taking one person off a particular train, because more trains were running and carrying out that particular task. The situation in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland or New South Wales, could be quite different for different tasks.

Hopefully, under this new agreement we will see an increase in passenger movement across Australia, but to try to have an enterprise award for the tasks that have to be carried out on a passenger train, as against a goods train or a bulk train, is really quite ludicrous.

         The other point that I would like to raise here concerns the amendments relating to accountability. Senator Parer covered these, so I will not say a lot on them. But in terms of the accountability of such corporations as the National Rail Corporation it is essential that the Auditor-General be the auditor for the Corporation. I think that the reports on the accountability and the credibility of these particular operations and their overseeing should come through the Auditor-General and should be reported back to this Parliament on a consistent annual basis.

         I conclude my remarks by saying, first, that it is important—and I re-emphasise this point—that transport policy must be designed so that the most efficient and most cost-effective of the modes of transport which can carry out the tasks wins each particular task. There should not be a loading in favour of rail, road or air transport. Secondly, it is essential that the impost of the fuel excise on rail transport in this country be removed so that it is not put at a disadvantage in relation to its competitors, particularly the road transport industry. Thirdly, in terms of the principles that are incorporated in this agreement, having a principle whereby one operates under labour arrangements incorporated in one enterprise award really amounts to staying in the Dark Ages and not moving into the nineties and the two thousands.

         —The position of the Australian Democrats on issues is becoming increasingly unpredictable. They seem to wish to have the luxury of looking at each issue on a case by case basis, which gives no consistency in terms of their position on many fundamental issues. The issues that give me most concern are those of accountability to this Parliament. It was the Australian Democrats who endorsed the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts. That recommendation was that the Australian National Audit Office was to be the auditor of government instrumentalities, including government corporations. At the time this did not fit easily with some Labor Party people. Increasingly we are seeing attempts by this Labor Government to usurp the fundamental role of the Auditor-General. It is increasing, and it is very disappointing to find the Australian Democrats—the people who want to keep everybody honest—falling into this attitude of relaxing the essential role that the Australian National Audit Office has to play in terms of its responsibilities to this Parliament.

         The role of the Auditor-General is essential to the accountability of this Parliament. The Auditor-General can perhaps be perceived as an extension of the arm of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, with which it works most closely, and also of the Parliament itself. Indeed, the Auditor-General meets on a regular basis with members of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts.

         The issue is merely one of what is the appropriate authority to be the linkage between this Parliament and the statutory authorities in circumstances where the Commonwealth has a significant and a major financial interest. While members of this Senate are rightly concerned about community service obligations and the wider social responsibilities of statutory corporations, it is distressing to see legislation of this nature demeaning the role of the Auditor-General and replacing him as the essential link between these so-called increasingly independent statutory corporations and the Parliament. Increasingly, we are seeing such corporations—though not all of them—thumbing their noses at issues of social responsibility, community service obligations and accountability at times when it suits them. This is a serious contradiction, since all of these statutory corporations have a bureaucratic arm supposedly directed to meeting social responsibility criteria and accountability-type responsibilities.

         Let me give an instance. Telecom has decided to centralise certain activities in Tasmania, with the result that a significant number of people will be moved from the north-west and the north of the State to Hobart. Unfortunately, Telecom did not see fit to communicate to the staff or to the wider community the cost-benefit behind this decision. It was an autocratic decision which appeared to lack logic to the unions and appeared to lack logic to the communities in which these staff members were located. I think this is typical of what is happening.

         What we must see is a strengthening of the relationship between this Parliament and the statutory corporations, and that appropriate linkage is the Australian National Audit Office through the Auditor-General. We all know that the Auditor-General should be the final arbiter, but he does have the power to contract out audit responsibilities to the private sector and increasingly he is doing so. This is quite significant and quite appropriate. In fact, as issues are becoming more and more technical in certain areas, I think it is entirely appropriate that he should not only be relying increasingly on the private sector to provide audit services, in terms of getting teams of people in to audit particular activities of government instrumentalities, but also reaching out to seek advice on a technical nature from the private sector. Therefore, it is indeed an unfortunate time to see yet again a reversal in principle by these Australian Democrats sitting on the cross-benches who have such a significant impact on accountability issues, on moral issues, and on issues which affect the future of Australia.

         Standards in this country are very much at risk. All too often this Parliament is being seen as a rubber stamp. In the House of Representatives two days ago, on an important tax Bill, the Government did not have an adviser to answer Opposition queries—on a technical tax Bill, No. 4. This is just another reflection on the fact that this Government wants to make this Parliament a rubber stamp. We must avoid that. The Auditor-General is central in maintaining proper accountability.

         —The area of Cambodia over which this unhappy incident occurred—an injury to Colonel Russell Stuart, who is the commander of the Australian contingent to the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia—is an area where the Khmer Rouge have been active. But it is by no means an area confined to the Khmer Rouge. In fact, it has been described as a patchwork quilt, involving occupancy on the ground by the three resistance factions. The only faction that is not in the immediate area that was the subject of the attack is in fact the SOC army of the present Phnom Penh administration.

         So it is simply not to be assumed that the shots were fired by a member of the Khmer Rouge. Investigations are proceeding. It may never be known where the shot came from; it may never be known whether it was the result of some kind of order and some kind of semi-disciplined military exchange or whether rather it was the actions of a bored or disgruntled individual soldier.

         It is, of course, the case that there are and will continue to be throughout the UN's occupancy of this transitional role in Cambodia, risks to the soldiers on the ground. We do not need rather unhappy grandstanding of the kind that we are listening to today from Senator Hill to be aware of those risks. We do not need to be reminded of them. We have stated them—Senator Ray, as Defence Minister, has done so; Mr Bilney has done so; I have done so—on innumerable occasions. There are risks from disease; there are risks from mines. There are risks of being exposed to some degree of sporadic fire or cross-fire in the context of the kind of military engagement that has happened on this occasion, particularly in the period before the disengagement of the various factions—their cantoning into barracks of one kind or another—and the putting aside of their arms is accomplished.

         The first stage of this process involves the immediate implementation of the removal of aviation specific restrictions on equity investments between Australian operators. That is, it breaks the barrier between international and domestic operations in Australia. The first stage is to proceed immediately to renegotiate our bilateral agreements that require renegotiation for multi-designation and to facilitate charter operations by Australian based operators.

Implementation of a policy of multiple designation for Australian carriers is part of this stage of the proposal, along with allowing additional freight carriers to operate on international routes to and from Australia, and multiple designation for Australasian carriers in international markets at the end of the day, if we successfully negotiate a common aviation market with New Zealand.

The one substantial difference between the Government's approach to aviation and the Opposition's is in the operation of international airlines in Australia. The Opposition has proposed an extremely dangerous and anti-Australian proposal in providing for substantial benefits to be given—the Opposition calls it the open skies policy—to the 35 international carriers that operate in Australia without any reciprocal benefits being offered to our Australian carriers in those countries.

         Only this morning, when discussing these issues with senior officials of an international airline that travels to Australia, they expressed their astonishment that anybody would propose something like that. In order to assist the stability and certainty that we need in aviation for the benefit of the people who have to invest these sums of money, I ask the Opposition, firstly, to support these proposals, which I know it does; and, secondly, to indicate that it will not pursue the option it is advancing of providing significant rights for international carriers in Australia without negotiating reciprocal rights for Australian carriers in the countries from which those airlines come.

I was so busy putting together a new aviation policy for this country that I did not have the time to attend. Senator MacGibbon can check with the FAC and it will confirm that.

         —The depreciation allowances that were announced in the statement last night can benefit Australian industry and investment in a number of ways. The prime purpose of those changes to the depreciation system was to make the system of business tax in so far as it relates to investment much more competitive than it was with the international regime and in comparison with a number of other countries—countries with which we are sometimes traditionally compared, such as those in the OECD, and countries in our region where sometimes unusual depreciation and other investment incentives exist.

         As far as the various elements of the depreciation changes are concerned, as I said, they emphasise longer lived assets.

On the other hand, the corporate tax rate in Germany is currently 65 per cent, I think, and we have a 39 per cent corporate tax rate in Australia.

We took away 5:3 as a government when the 39 per cent corporate tax rate was introduced. Then, 5:3 was a distortion in the taxation system because it gave effectively the same depreciating life to an asset of 30 years as it gave to an asset of six or seven years, for example. That was a significant distortion in the tax system. The proposals announced last night do not carry that distortion with them.

         I believe, and Mr Greiner believes, for example, that there is great advantage in facilitating the development of offshore banking facilities in Australia. The danger about offshore banking facilities is that domestic banks will use them to try to obtain the lower tax benefit which applies to offshore banking. That has to be carefully fixed up in the legislation. When Singapore introduced offshore banking it found that there were one or two indications of abuse of that system. The relevant bankers were told that they would have to leave Singapore at 8 o'clock the following morning or they would be in gaol at 9 o'clock. They have had no further trouble there.

In fact, it will add taxation revenue which would never before have existed if that opportunity had not been offered.

         —Let me tell Senator Short why, because he is clearly a man of little faith, except for some recently discovered faith, which I shall refer to in a moment. Let me mention the lesson of history in relation to recessions in Australia. I know that Opposition senators such as Senator Short believe that history began the day John Hewson announced his plan for a new tax-led recovery. To look at history in terms of this post-recessionary experience in the Australian economy is very instructive. In the three years following the 1982-83 recession—that is, the recession of those opposite—this Government delivered growth of 6 per cent, 5 per cent, and 4 per cent. The 1961 recession—a Liberal government recession—was followed by growth of 6 per cent, 7 per cent and 7 per cent in the next three years.

         —Those opposite do not want to listen. As the anxiety rises, so does the level of interjection. I understand that lot very well. The 1974-75 recession was an exception. After the 1974-75 recession the growth rates were 2.7 per cent, 2.9 per cent and 4 per cent. The reason for the failure of growth after the 1974-75 recession was that there was no wages policy. That reduced the profit share for Australian companies very significantly. For the information of Senator Bishop, who is showing a lively interest in this answer, this current recession has not been preceded by a wages explosion.

         —Oh, come on, do not talk rubbish; it is structurally sound. The forecasts, which are consistent with early signs of recovery in the economy and consistent with those of private sector commentators, quite apart from lessons of post-recession experience in Australia, are in this situation based on low interest rates and improving, although still very subdued, international economic conditions. In saying that, I think we should remember the importance to the economy of the trade with countries in this region, which is still growing strongly. For example, OECD forecasts underline the strength of the Asian economies with which we trade. The OECD says that imports by the Asian countries will grow in volume by between 8 and 12 per cent in 1992 and 1993.

         Those opposite—I am not looking at the Australian Democrats—are fixed in a sort of static model of the Australian economy which derives from their limited experience in government. The fact of the matter is that the whole performance of the Australian economy in terms of trade has undergone an extraordinary structural change in the last decade. Just as our relationship with Great Britain has undergone an extraordinary structural and historic change, which some people in the Party opposite do not seem to accept, so has the trading relationship of this country changed. The importance of the relationship with countries in the Asian-Pacific region is very significant in looking at the world scene and the forecasts of growth which are given in the One Nation statement.

I will not go into those at this time, but if anyone wants to ask me about them I am quite happy to go into them.

         There is one thing that I can say with certainty: people can criticise these forecasts but, whatever one says about them, they are not horrible forecasts like the Opposition's, as evidenced in the document published by Chris Murphy the other day, in terms of unemployment, growth in GDP and all the significant indicators which affect the Australian people. They are very bad forecasts. They are part of an ideological exercise which would mean medium term pain of great intensity in order to achieve some distant ideological goal, perhaps by the year 2010.

         In so far as the PSBR is concerned, not many commentators agree with Max Walsh, I must say. The Budget-time estimate for the PSBR in 1991-92 was 4.3 per cent, up from 1.7 per cent in 1990-91. The current 1991-92 estimate is broadly unchanged at about 4 per cent. Increased Commonwealth and State government borrowing requirements are expected to be offset by lower borrowings by the Wool Corporation and the Wheat Board. Beyond that, the net PSBR is expected to decline to about 2 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. The expected fall in the net PSBR after 1991-92 is basically a reflection of the expected decline in the Commonwealth Budget deficit, which is referred to in the statement, and the other elements of the public sector are expected to have broadly offsetting movements in their net borrowing requirements over the period.

         The objective of these pre-start agreements is to signify now to all would-be investors in major development projects in Australia that it is possible on greenfields investments to arrive at substantial improvements in industrial relations performance by reaching agreement on certain principles beforehand; and for existing companies, where they wish to undertake major expansion in their enterprise, for that expansion to obtain the same sorts of arrangements. Therefore, investors will know what the industrial relations outcomes will be before they actually start—before a sod is turned or before they start the development of a project.

The effect for the employer will be a single union agreement. That will help remove demarcation disputes that have bedevilled some projects in the past. It will also aim to ratify award coverage. The preference that we will be expressing is for one single workplace agreement, and I think that is strongly what the ACTU's preference is as well. The agreements will contain dispute settlement provisions to avoid disputes.

         The Government wants to change the nature of the fixation of youth wages to one that recognises qualifications, skill and experience and to set the wage not on the basis of age but on the basis of the contribution the individual can make to the workplace. Therefore, if a young worker has the qualifications and is able to do a job that is done by an adult worker, then the right rate of pay should be closer to that of the adult worker rather than that youth worker being tied to an age rate which could mean that his real ability and contribution to the enterprise are being exploited.

         The Government is discussing that concept at the present time. Some further development of it has to be undertaken before it can be introduced as the standard. It is consistent with the restructuring of awards that we have undertaken around Australia. We have encouraged workers to become more highly skilled, to seek training, to broaden their qualification base, and to receive wage increases based on that type of training and improved qualification.

We need to recognise that the future young workers of this country must be hooked into a training regime in which they regularly update their qualifications to suit the needs of industry.

         So please do not propound the continuing fantasy that bedevils Mr Howard and assumes that there is no discussion in most Australian workplaces between workers and employers about whether or not individual workers are entitled to an extra margin above what the minimum rate prescribed by the Commission might be. It is the normal characteristic of the workplace. I have to say that in larger workplaces the normal characteristic is that that is done by direct overaward negotiation with the union. None of the features in the new industrial relations system that we will introduce will change any of that.

         It is only fair that the national highway system should be expanded to include links not just between Sydney and Melbourne, that people have concentrated on, but between Sydney and Adelaide and between Melbourne and Brisbane. So the Sturt and Newell highways have been added to that plan as well. This will benefit people from the four capital cities—not just from one or two and certainly not just from Victoria.

          As well as all of that, there is another $70m going to the black spots program. This will save lives around Australia in the next two years. Many lives will be saved just because the Commonwealth has been prepared to put in a great deal of extra money, and it could not have picked a better time to do it.

        It is also relevant to mention that, following consultations between officials and a large number of industry bodies and tax professionals, a detailed Statement of the intended operation of the depreciation changes was issued on 26 September 1991 by the then Treasurer, Mr Kerin, and myself.

        In cases like this where some taxpayers may be obliged to compute taxable income prior to the enactment of announced legislative changes, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised that taxpayers who make the computation reasonably based on the announced changes or, in this case, the amending Bill will not be subject to penalty tax.

        Mr President in reply to a question from Senator Baume from Tuesday's question time I offer the following.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator Baume asked a question about youth unemployment and how my colleague the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services arrived at the figure of 8.8 per cent as the percentage of young people seeking full-time work and unable to find it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The 8.8 per cent figure is simply the number of young people who are full-time unemployed as a percentage of the young people between the ages of 15-19 years. The 30 per cent figure is the number of unemployed young people as a percentage of young people in the full-time labour force.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In asking his question Senator Baume alleged that the 8.8% was a `phoney figure' and that the Minister had claimed that the 30% figure was misleading. In fact neither is the case—as we have already seen 8.8% is the correct figure to describe the number of young people who are unemployed as a percentage of the teenage population.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What is phoney is Senator Baume's constant use of the 30% figure as if 1 in 3 of all young people in the teenage population are unable to find a job. I refer to his press release of 16 February which boasts that there are `No Jobs For 1 in 3 Young Australians'. Granted Senator Baume gets it right in the text of his release but the implication is clear; Senator Baume wants to make the situation sound even worse than it is. He wants people to believe that every 1 in 3 of all the young people in the 15-19 age category are unemployed. In fact what we have is a situation where the majority of young people in the age group are in further education. About 1 in 10 of all young people in the age group are unemployed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, no one on this side of the Parliament thinks that youth unemployment at it's current level is satisfactory but Senator Baume and others of his scaremongering type delight in making it sound worse.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What is phoney is the Opposition's Fightback package which has absolutely NOTHING specific in the great thumping doorstop of a thing (because that's about all it's good for) for young people who are disadvantaged, that is the type of young people who Senator Baume sheds crocodile tears for.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The only thing they say is that they will abolish the Youth Bureau which amongst other things administers grant programs for disadvantaged young people. They will abolish the CES not realising that abolishing them also abolishes Youth Access Centres which are designed to help young people especially the disadvantaged. What vision! What foresight!
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Concerning the second part of the question that Senator Baume raised in his supplementary question, no-one has ever claimed that the youth unemployment rate is less than the adult rate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If one were to calculate the share of unemployment in the total population, the figure would be 6.5 per cent. No-one has ever suggested that this is the true unemployment rate amongst adults—because obviously the great bulk of the 5 million or so adults who are not in the labour force are not doing anything of immediate relevance to the labour market.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The same does not apply to young people—the great bulk of the 537,000 15-19 year olds who are not in the labour force (either full-time or part-time) are in education and training, which is of direct relevance to their future labour market prospects.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr President, the only people who have been misleading in this debate are the Opposition—who continue to pretend that a 30 per cent youth unemployment rate mean that 30 per cent of all young people are unemployed. That is manifestly untrue and Senator Baume's righteous indignation is just an indication that he has been caught out.

         There is a fishing Agreement between the Australian and former Soviet Governments that entered into force on 15 February 1990. Article III of this Agreement indicates that Australia shall permit USSR fishing vessels to carry out feasibility fishing operations in areas of the Australian Fishing Zone. Any such feasibility fishing that is agreed must conform with the Agreement, any subsidiary agreement, Australian law and an annex to the Agreement which sets out procedures relating to such operations.

         The management of Commonwealth fisheries is now the responsibility of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). A subsidiary agreement was signed by AFMA on 25 February 1992 to allow a joint venture operation involving an Australian company and Russian interests to use a Russian vessel for feasibility fishing in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) fishery.

         The GAB fishery is still considered to be a developmental fishery and there is provision in the Management Plan for up to three large vessels to be licensed for limited periods to carry out exploratory fishing in the offshore areas. While this provision has existed for some time, there has been very little interest and until this joint venture operation there was only one such vessel doing exploratory fishing in the area.

         The Russian vessel is restricted to outside the 400 metre depth line and outside certain additional areas in which there are known resources. The vessel will have two AFMA observers on board at all times and will be required to lodge full catch reports and other information. The arrangement is for a maximum of six months and is on a full cost recovery basis.

         —That graph shows the share of profit in relation to national income going back to 1966-67, which I understand was the first year on which such data was compiled. The graph shows what is called the gross operating surplus of companies, less income tax paid by them and less net interest. In other words, it is the profit of trading enterprises after they have paid tax and their interest bill. That graph shows that in 1990-91—the last year for which these figures were available—the profit share of corporate trading enterprises was the lowest it had ever been since this data was first compiled, which, as I said, goes back a quarter of a century to 1966-67.

         The table I have had incorporated is a graph. It does not contain the actual percentage figures for profit share. I would like to read into the record those profit share figures for the years of the Hawke Government. In 1983-84, the profit share was 20.7 per cent; in 1984-85 it was 21.25 per cent; in 1985-86, 20.1 per cent; in 1986-87, 19.4 per cent; in 1987-88, 19 per cent; in 1988-89, 18.7 per cent; in 1989-90, 15.4 per cent; and in 1990-91, 13 per cent. In other words, with the exception of the first year of the Hawke-Keating Government—1983-84—there has been a decline in the profit share of trading enterprises in every successive year of this Government.

         I just wanted to have that on the record because it is simply not true for the Government to say, as it is saying, that the company profit share has held up well. It is not a fact. Indeed, the contrary is the case. There has been a progressive fall in every year except the first of the Hawke-Keating Government in the company profit share. No wonder this country faces the deepest recession for 60 years. Yesterday's spending, pump-priming, unfunded binge is just going to add to the misery of the millions of Australians who have already suffered so grievously at the hands of this Government.

         Revised guidelines for presentation of ministerial statements and reports to Parliament, issued in November 1991 by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, require the covering memorandum provided with the annual report to indicate the date the report was furnished to the minister and the date of receipt by the minister.

         When one looks at the statistics outlined in this publication it is easy to understand the extent of the problems associated with family law. Since 1976 a total of 642,246 divorces have been granted and last year the figure of 42,635 was regrettably an increase on the previous five years. Over half the divorces involved children, with some 44,000 children having been caught up in family break-ups last year alone, and 750,000 since 1976.

          Against this background it is regrettable that the court has not had any increase in the number of mediation centres, as was intended, in Melbourne, Dandenong and Parramatta. Apparently it comes down to a matter of resources. Given the evidence to date that has been taken by the Joint Select Committee into Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, we have been given the impression that mediation is successful and needs to be made more available. One hopes the Committee will be able to help in that regard.

          Another interesting comment made in the report by the Chief Justice relates to costs. He has introduced a practice direction requiring solicitors during litigation to give their clients a written estimate of costs incurred to date and likely anticipated costs. During the parliamentary inquiry the question of expenses in the legal process has been constantly raised. I also note that the Chief Justice refers to the establishment of the parliamentary inquiry, and remarks:

         Therefore, the Senate can take a bow for having agreed to set up the inquiry. It was interesting to note that before the inquiry was established Justice Nicholson left me in no doubt that he saw the inquiry as unnecessary and an intrusion into the court's work. Having met him and having noted his remarks in this annual report, I now know that he realises that we are here to try to help improve the position in terms of scrutiny of the Family Law Act. I hope that at the end of our inquiry everyone will agree that we have achieved something.

          If the court welcomes the extension of community awareness, it is a matter of continuing regret that so much of the proceedings are forbidden to be publicised or reported in any way. That is another area at which we are looking in our inquiry; we will see what happens when the Committee scrutinises that area in a forthright way. I hope that the next annual report of the Family Court will be able to report favourably on our parliamentary Committee's final report on the proposed changes to family law. I also hope that the work of our Committee will make things better for people who get to the stage of litigation in the Family Court.

        The opening comments in the report by the Chairman of the War Memorial Council reveal that the year 1990-91 was a significant one for the Memorial. There was a new organisational structure, a new director and a new corporate plan. Another significant and unfortunate event was the ill-fated decision to introduce fees for entry to the Memorial. The Parliament in February 1991 judged that this was simply not appropriate for our national War Memorial, and the fees were subsequently removed. It was certainly not appropriate that veterans and war widows, those who have sacrificed so much for our country and whose sacrifices are embodied in the concept of a national war memorial, were required to pay to enter the Memorial.

         It was staggering to learn, therefore, that it was only after the fee had been rejected that the Memorial Council commissioned a paper on funding options. This clearly should have occurred at the outset. It reflects badly on the decision making processes of the Council and Memorial management. Clearly, no decision should have been taken until there had been a thorough consideration of the options. If the only option to ensure the continued development of the Memorial's activities was an entry fee, then the Government should take a good look at the regard in which it holds the Memorial and the resources it gives to it.

         The entry fee saga was not the only controversial event at the Memorial in 1990-91. The drafting of the new corporate plan was criticised by me and others for a mission statement which intellectually undermined the raison d'etre of the War Memorial. At one stage it omitted a clear statement of the Memorial's true purpose. I am glad to say that this was finally included after public pressure.

         Both of these decisions, I believe, reflect the need for formal representation of ex-service organisations on the War Memorial Council. It could easily be argued that decisions such as that concerning entry fees would have taken a different course had there been ex-service organisation representation on the Council. Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Opposition, indicated last year that the coalition in government will ensure that such representation does occur.

         It is also of concern that in the current financial year there have been a couple of situations in which the management of the Memorial has not distinguished itself. The first was the sacking, at short notice and contrary to earlier assurances, of several security staff and their recall on the same day, following the intervention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys).

         The second situation concerns the restricting of guiding at the Memorial. In the face of absorption of the training and affairs of Memorial guides into the education section of the Memorial, and the insensitive and uncooperative manner in which this was occurring, a number of those voluntary guides—some of them very experienced—have resigned over the past 12 months. There have also been reports of guides being asked to restrict tours to an hour or less, to bypass commemorative areas, and to be selective in how they describe sensitive events such as the Banka Island massacre of the nurses and the shooting of Vivian Bullwinkle by the Japanese.

         In the annual report, the Chairman laments the prolonged public criticism of the War Memorial as destabilising. It must be stressed that the Memorial has an emotional foundation and an emotional legacy and that there will always be great interest in how the affairs of the Memorial are managed. It is widely recognised that the Memorial is one of the finest of its type in the world. Any criticism levelled at the Memorial is only out of a desire to ensure that it continues to uphold its traditions and to maintain its standing as a fine and respected institution. With its already proud history, I am sure it is the wish of all Australians in this year of fiftieth anniversary celebrations year that the sentiments of the Chairman are realised when she says that the Memorial is entering a new and positive phase of its history.

          —The Industry Commission report on the Australian dairy industry raises great concerns within the dairy industry, particularly in my own home State of Victoria where the majority of dairy producers are in business. The report comes at a time leading up to the need for new dairy industry legislation, as the so-called Kerin plan reaches its sunset date on 30 June of this year. The establishment of the Kerin plan in the early 1980s was a difficult process in an industry which, between the various States of this country, was fraught with difficult and competing interests. It was to the credit of this chamber, particularly the role played by my former colleague Senator Michael Macklin, and to Minister Kerin that that plan came into place and has operated since.

          New legislation is necessary. The Government must not write that legislation along the lines of the report that the Industry Commission has put down. To date, we are unclear of the Government's position. I want the Senate and the Government to be clear on the position of the dairy industry, particularly in my own home State of Victoria.

          The Industry Commission report makes a number of recommendations which can be summarised by saying that it speaks of vastly reducing many of the current interventions that are in the industry. The dairy industry is very concerned about the consequence of those reductions in intervention. The Industry Commission recommends removing price distortions, ensuring that the industry has flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances, that least cost locations are used for milk production relative to market outlets, and a number of other items. The consequence of that, according to the Commission, is an expectation that prices for milk will go down by some 12 per cent. The potential effect on dairy producers is quite catastrophic.

          These, we must remember, are amongst the most efficient dairy producers in the world. That should not be forgotten, particularly when they are, in the export context, competing on a very unlevel playing field. The farm gate price of manufacturing milk would decline by between 5 and 9 per cent, or 2c or 3c per litre, and the prices of manufactured dairy products would fall by around 12 per cent as these market support payments were reduced—if the Industry Commission report were pursued. Total milk output would contract by around 5 per cent, putting dairy farmers, many of whom are currently only just scraping a living, right to the wall.

          It is important, I think, that we acknowledge the efficiency and effectiveness of the dairy industry in our Australian economy and particularly in our Australian community. For every dollar that a dairy farmer in this country creates, an additional $3.66 is created in his or her community. This creation of wealth is dependent upon continuing support for the dairy industry and will be very much at risk should the report of the Industry Commission be pursued and lay the basis for the Government's new legislation.

          I wish to put the Government on notice that at least the Democrats understand that our dairy industry does not play on a level playing field; that no such playing field exists; that we cannot ask dairy farmers to go to the forefront in an international situation which is unfair to them; and that we must not risk that industry, nor must we risk the many rural communities that are dependent on that extremely efficient Australian dairy industry. The loss of skills and the loss of export income that would come as a consequence must be borne in mind as the Government drafts new legislation to replace the Kerin scheme.

I would also urge the Government to think very carefully about the recommendations of the Industry Commission in its report on the Australian dairy industry.

          Most of the dairy farms are relatively small in acreage. They do not have enough room to advance into broadacre farming such as beef farming. Many of them are in areas where the topography, the climate, the soils or various other things may not be suitable for cropping and where this opportunity does not exist. If we were to take the sorts of actions that would follow the adoption of the recommendations of the Industry Commission, we could further hurt very severely a lot of what are regarded as lesser rural communities.

          One of the problems facing rural Australia these days is the continuing drift from the country to the cities and the lesser number of farms and the loss of community units. There is no reason at all why the sorts of recommendations that have been put forward should be adopted at this time. The dairy industry has made fantastic advances in efficiency and productivity. The manufacturing industry has done a great deal in terms of getting into the best lines with the higher profit margins, particularly in the cheese area.

          The Australian cheeses that have come on to the market in the last 10 or 15 years have been absolutely magnificent. Instead of there being just a bulk market of sending product somewhere overseas for on-processing, the cheese is now produced in Australia. The Australian people are now consuming considerably more cheese than they used to, and the market overseas for particular varieties is improving all the time. As far as my home State is concerned, we have three manufacturers—Lactos, United Milk Products and King Island—all of whom are producing product which is keenly sought in many parts of the world.

          While this is going on and while these advances are being made, there would be no justification at all for adopting the sorts of propositions that are put forward. The industry needs a continuation of the present scheme for further consolidation and further profitability. The manufacturing industry was in terrible trouble a few years ago. Nearly every company in Australia was bankrupt or almost bankrupt. In the main, they have now settled down, with many amalgamations. The business is now profitable and should be encouraged to continue in that way.

          The economy, generally, requires micro-economic improvements in order to pick up and it is absolutely necessary that transport costs, general costs, marketing costs for exporters, the introduction of a tax regime that would allow exporters to be treated much better than they are at present, and matters of that sort are addressed at this time. I certainly urge the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) who is in the chamber at the moment to recommend that the Government not follow all the recommendations put forward by the Industry Commission in this instance, but proceeds on the basis on which the industry is currently operating.

The substantive issues which concern the Australian Democrats in the State of Victoria have already been put on record by Senator Powell. However, I wish briefly to commend Senator Archer for the comments he has made and lend support to the position that he has adopted which is essentially an interventionist one to assist the dairy industry. In that sense, it departs considerably from the position advocated on economic issues by the coalition parties which generally tend to think that the free market forces should be allowed to operate.

          In this case, however, I am very glad to see that there has been a very enlightened response, a response that calls for government action. It rejects the essentially very dry position adopted by the Industry Commission and recognises that the dairy industry in Victoria and throughout Australia is of extreme importance. We as a community need to decide whether we are prepared to perhaps pay a few cents more for our cheese and other dairy products to ensure that the farmers in Gippsland and other areas in Australia survive and continue to be part of a viable dairy industry in Australia.

         I congratulate the Corporation on its annual report and the work that it does in trying to enhance the profitable production and marketing of Australian dairy products. On 27 November, when this report was before the Senate, I made a few remarks but was unable to complete all that I wanted to say. Our dairy foods are as good as, and in many cases better than, any in the world. Our dairy food exports earn more than $700m each year. More than 100,000 Australians have jobs thanks to the dairy industry. The industry provides about 20 per cent employment in a number of important dairying regions. This is especially important in light of the particularly difficult times rural Australia is experiencing.

         Studies show that for every 100 jobs in dairy factories an additional 110 jobs are created in associated regional activities. The flow-on effects beyond the region are about as large again. Currently, Australia's dairy industry manufactures many specialised products for markets here and overseas. Its farmers currently produce milk valued at some $1.7 billion each year, all of which is processed within Australia. On top of this, processed dairy foods are valued at about $4.5 billion a year, an added value of $3 billion annually.

         The industry's major investments in research, technology and market development will see these export earnings grow. Dairy farm productivity is increasing by 5 per cent per year, as it has for the past decade. The industry's willingness to adapt to change means that it will benefit from even minor reforms in the international trading environment.

         Already, Australians buy premier quality dairy foods at prices as low as anywhere in the world. Our farmers produce milk at lower cost than those in Europe, the USA, Canada or Japan thanks to our pasture based farming. In fact, few countries can produce quality dairy products as cheaply as Australia. Australian consumers are now paying the lowest prices in the world for dairy products—although I sometimes wonder when I go shopping at the weekend whether the women shopping in the supermarkets think they are paying the lowest prices.

         Dairying is a very real industry—close to the people it employs, part of everyone's day-to-day life, and earning export dollars for all Australians. In the south Burnett where I live we have a number of dairy farms. Unfortunately, the number has been reduced over past years. If the Government introduces many of the recommendations of the recent major study by the Industry Commission into the dairy industry, which we were looking at earlier, many more dairy farms will indeed face extinction. These recommendations could cut the average farm income by up to $21,000 per year. It is no wonder that Senator Archer said that he hoped the Government would not act on all of the recommendations of the Industry Commission report.

         Already, a significant scaling down of the Queensland dairy industry has been undertaken to remove any areas which cannot compete with interstate and trans-Tasman competition. The number of farmers in Queensland has wound down from 20,000 to 2,000 in recent years. These farmers have quotas and are obligated to supply fresh, quality dairy products 365 days of the year. I compliment people who are in the dairy industry. It is a constant job. If they want to have a day off they have to find somebody who is willing to come in and do their work for them, otherwise they can never have a holiday. I pay tribute to those people who help to keep the dairy industry going.

         —In speaking to the Ombudsman's annual report for 1990-91, I intend to confine my remarks to the section on the Australian Taxation Office. I remind the Senate that the written and oral complaints received by the Ombudsman show the importance and necessity for his office. The Ombudsman's office received 362 written complaints and 839 oral complaints with a 76 per cent and 75 per cent resolution respectively in favour of the complainants, the taxpayers. Without this office, at least 600 taxpayers in this country would have felt that their rights had been denied by the Taxation Office.

         The Ombudsman and his office are an important check on the activities of the ATO, especially for those taxpayers who are involved in contentious issues and who have arrived at a stalemate in their negotiations with the office. Further, the cases handled by the Ombudsman show clearly those areas where procedures and regulations practised by the Taxation Office need revision and change.

         It was pleasing to note that the effect of self-assessment, electronic lodgment and the establishment of problem resolution offices has resulted in a decrease in the number of oral complaints involving unreasonable delay in the issue of assessments and refund cheques. I congratulate the Taxation Office on its achievement, particularly those officers who staff the problem resolution section.

         However, hand in hand with congratulations come areas within the Taxation Office that need revision. I was interested to note from the report that the main ongoing issues in the tax field continue to be, first, delays in the processing of interest payments under the Taxation (Interest and Overpayments) Act and in giving effect to tribunal and court decisions pursuant to section 200B of the Income Tax Assessment Act. A second issue is the offsetting of credits for debits not yet due. I believe that for the Ombudsman to single out these two areas signifies a potential weakness in the workings of the Taxation Office. I have had constituents come to me concerning both areas.

         It appears that several branches of the Tax Office consistently fell below what could be viewed as a reasonable level of performance; that is, to finalise more than 90 per cent of the cases within 30 days of issuing amended assessments and refunds of tax overpaid. The Ombudsman makes quite a point of stating that in 30 per cent of all interest on overpayment cases received in 1989-90, the Tax Office had failed to meet its own standard of finalising payments of interest on overpaid tax within 30 days. This is despite the issue being brought to the attention of the Tax Office the previous year.

         The Ombudsman is also very harsh in his criticism of the Tax Office in failing to comply with section 200B of the Act. If a taxpayer's objection or appeal is successful in the AAT or the Federal Court and results in a refund of tax overpaid, the effect of section 200B is to require the Tax Office to refund the overpaid tax within 60 days of the decision becoming final.

         The Ombudsman is convinced that the Tax Office is not fulfilling its responsibilities under this section. The Ombudsman has recommended that the Tax Office's computer systems be upgraded to enable it to issue interest cheques simultaneously with amended assessments. The Ombudsman's report states that on 28 June of last year the ATO reported that its office was investigating the problem and would remedy it after the full extent is known. I hope that since this was in June the Tax Office has attended to this problem. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator McMullan, whether this has been done.

         The report also highlights the difficulties being experienced by taxpayers resulting from the Tax Office's practice of applying tax refunds to tax debits which are not yet due and payable. This problem is particularly prevalent amongst provisional taxpayers. I have already called for a significant reduction in the uplift factor that is applied to provisional taxpayers as a result of the present economic climate. For a provisional taxpayer to be denied his refund is adding insult to injury for this class of taxpayer.

         I note that the Ombudsman states that the Tax Office has implemented a policy of paying the credit to affected taxpayers on request using manual transactions, as its present computer systems are not sophisticated enough to handle this type of transaction automatically. The Ombudsman's office continues to receive complaints relating to the practice of offsetting all or part of a refund against a debit assessment. Therefore, this is an area that the Tax Office needs to correct.

In the overview of this report attention is drawn to the issue of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to investigate program related actions of the ABC. It seems that in this respect, as in a number of other areas, the SBS is well ahead of the ABC because, while the SBS accepts the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the ABC for some reason does not.

         Mr Cameron, who became the fourth Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman in April of this year, believes, like his predecessor, Professor Pearce, that he does have the right to investigate the way the ABC dealt with a complaint it received. As Mr Cameron notes, there exists a clear need for this dispute to be resolved by the Parliament in the form of a legislative amendment. The alternative is costly litigation between two government agencies at taxpayers' expense, which is to be deplored.

         It is interesting to note the comments of the Ombudsman with respect to his power to report to the Parliament. As the situation stands, the Ombudsman may report to the Parliament in three ways. After submitting a special report to the Prime Minister, it is then within the powers of the Ombudsman to forward the report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives for presentation to the Houses of Parliament. On the two occasions that this power has been exercised in the past 15 years, no substantive response was forthcoming from the Parliament. The Ombudsman might also submit from time to time a report to the Prime Minister for presentation to the Parliament. Finally, of course, there is the annual report. In none of these cases is there a direct link between the Ombudsman and the Parliament.

         In the report the Ombudsman relates the circumstances of his equivalent in New Zealand. There, the Ombudsman is an officer of the Parliament and is funded separately from the agencies of the Executive Government. In my opinion, this arrangement has a great deal to recommend it. After reading the report, one cannot help but see that in pursuing its charter the Ombudsman's office suffers from severe financial constraints. This can be directly linked to its dependence on the Executive for its budget allocation and the great uncertainty that must necessarily exist from year to year in its funding. That situation could shortly start to seriously affect the capacity of the Ombudsman to meet his obligations.

         These are very serious concerns not to be taken lightly, because the implications of an emasculated administrative watchdog will be an increasingly self-serving rather than public-serving Commonwealth administration. In terms of funding and in terms of a charter to answer directly to the people, the idea of the Ombudsman as an officer of the Parliament has, I believe, great merit.

         The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration was reviewing the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and has now reported. I believe that important recommendations flowing from this review are only worth while in so far as the Government responds to them quickly and effectively. With a staff of only 72 and a budget of $4.4m in 1991, the Ombudsman and his staff have performed well in their efforts to meet the increasingly heavy demands placed upon them.

         As a senator in this place, I must say that the work of the Ombudsman is of great value to me in representing my constituents, particularly because he alone is able to go into a department and read a file which is not given to any of us to do which often, of course, results in a change of attitude on behalf of the department concerned. Certainly, in looking after defence constituents, I find that the defence Ombudsman is a very valued adjunct and participant in the democratic process. It would be very bad indeed if we were to allow the Executive to starve such a worthwhile organisation of its resources. To place it under the responsibility of the Parliament itself, to me, seems much the best way to go.

These could appropriately also be dealt with under document No. 52, the Australian Film Finance Corporation. I raised concerns about the fact that the Film Finance Corporation, using $270,000 of taxpayers' money, was financing a pornographic movie called

         When last speaking I said I would be writing to the then Minister for the Arts, Mrs Kelly, and Mr Beazley. I have not had a reply from Mr Beazley, but I have received one from Ms Wendy Fatin who is now the Minister for the Arts and Territories. It is interesting to note that although I raised concerns about this issue, together with the concerns of Southern Cross Homes in New South Wales—which sent me a petition from some 170 people saying that they were disgusted with the fact that the Government was in the game of handing out money to organisations funding these types of operations—Ms Fatin did say in her reply that, amongst other things, to stop these types of corporations wasting money on this type of production, they must qualify under a test under division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

         Ms Fatin said that this test ensures, amongst other things, that those programs are of broadcast quality or suitable for public exhibition in the cinema; that a film which received a rating more restrictive than R would not be considered a qualifying film; and went on to explain why this particular film only received an R rating. Hence, I am speaking on this film today because the film did receive an R rating but was banned in New Zealand. I think that is a reasonable example of beauty, or whatever one likes to call it, being in the eye of the beholder. Even though we gave that film an R rating here, it was banned in New Zealand, so obviously someone there thought it was a pretty poor production.

        It was only yesterday that I spoke on a report of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which is very much connected with the Great Barrier Reef. The annual report of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority deals with the reef itself. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is off the coast of Queensland and Queensland is very proud of it. As I said yesterday, I consider the Great Barrier Reef to be the eighth wonder of the world. It is really a marvellous, God-made place. So many people love to go there and see it.

         The park is the only large marine ecosystem in the world which is comprehensively managed with the explicit goal of ensuring that its use is ecologically sustainable in perpetuity. In discussing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority annual report, I want to focus on three brief issues. In the chairman's report he said:

        Indeed, there are three major questions about the park which still remain unanswered. One of them—the cause of the crown-of-thorns starfish infestations—has been extensively studied over the past few years. An enormous amount has been learned in these studies, not only about the starfish but also about the processes and other living organisms which constitute the Great Barrier Reef.

         Only recently I read that sophisticated computers are currently providing help in protecting the reef from starfish. The article said that a team of Townsville-based marine scientists, using supercomputers to model the larval dispersal of the starfish, have revealed its spread and predicted future points of infestation. The results have confirmed the basic southward drift of the starfish and the high incidence of outbreaks on reefs around the middle of the Continental Shelf. They also showed that reefs such as Green Island and John Brewer Reef are more susceptible to infestations because of their connection with upstream reefs, and that the area around Cooktown acted as a partially self-contained source of larvae and a possible site for the start of future infestations.

         The article went on to say that the modelling program they are trying to establish up there involves feeding data on prevailing tides, winds and the east Australian current, together with the physical make-up of individual reefs, into supercomputers with very fast processors, large disc capacity and a high system input. Another instrument which is proving very helpful in monitoring the activities of the reef is the video camera and photographs. These are used to record in detail the effects of the reef's predators as well as the long term effects of tourists. Of course, many tourists visit the reef and that is one thing they have to be careful about.

         The first tests in this program have begun at Michaelmas Reef, a popular tourist spot near Cairns. As I was looking at the report, I found a very interesting photograph of Michaelmas Cay, a very beautiful island on the reef which I have had the privilege of visiting a couple of times. There are a tremendous number of birds on the island. As I looked at the photograph, it brought back memories of my visits to Michaelmas Cay.

        I would like to say one thing about the worry over the crown-of-thorns starfish. Captain Cook had to off-load a lot of luggage when his ship hit a reef while sailing up the Queensland coast many years ago in 1770. In order to lighten his ship he also had to have five cannons thrown overboard. Not so very long ago a team of people found the cannons. Believe it or not, quite a deal of the reef had grown over them; they had to be dug out of the reef. So it is quite obvious that the reef continues to growth, despite crown-of-thorns starfish attacks.

        I preface my remarks by paying tribute to the immediate past Director of the Office of Australian War Graves, Alf Clarke, who died on 15 December last. I knew him for only a fairly short time, but his heart was very much with the war graves office. He died very shortly after his retirement. I offer my condolences to his family and express my appreciation of the love and care which he gave to the Australian war graves.

         I would also like to mention briefly my pleasure at having been included in the official party as a representative of the Opposition at the fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the Fall of Singapore Week which was held a few days ago, and at the Battle of Australia in Darwin commemorations a week ago. We met with sons and daughters who perhaps had never known their fathers who were prisoners of war of the Japanese in Singapore and Thailand. We met with widows who, for many years after the war had ended, had cared for veterans disabled as a result of their war service.

         We attended a terribly moving ceremony in the mist very early in the morning at Kranji war cemetery in Singapore where an international ceremony was held to remember the dead. Again, on the following morning, the Sunday, the 8th Division had its private family service. Many of the families had come to Kranji for the first time and they remembered the members of their families who had made the supreme sacrifice. As an Australian, I was very proud to see a detachment from the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, which is currently serving in Butterworth, Malaysia. Members of the battalion came down to Singapore to provide a guard of honour for the ceremony.

         The annual report of the Office of Australian War Graves briefly mentions that in the past year the Office also arranged, on behalf of the Department of Defence, 54 memorials for Australian service men and women who died in service in the past year. There were eight from the Navy, 35 from the Army and 11 from the RAAF. We do not often realise that being a member of the Australian Defence Force is a very dangerous occupation. Even in peacetime, training has to be realistic and people do die. I take this opportunity to make sure that people are reminded of the contribution that is made even in peacetime in training to defend this country from war.

         One very disturbing thing I noted while reading this report is the fact that in most States there has been an increase in vandalism of Australian war graves. South Australia, Hobart and Launceston are picked out for particular mention. The war graves office is now trying to combat the problem in the major war cemeteries and gardens of remembrance by investigating security systems suitable for use when staff are not on duty. It is a terrible commentary that we should have so allowed a lack of respect for our dead to grow in our society that people are prepared to commit acts of vandalism against war graves. I alert the Senate to something which I have noticed in reports. I am appalled to think that this is a growing problem.

         One innovation I draw to the attention of the Senate is a backpackers guide that is being produced by the Office of War Graves. This will assist visitors backpacking in France and Belgium to find their way around the Australian battle sites in those countries. This guide commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of the arrival of the AIF in France and Belgium in 1916. The leaflet will be distributed through our embassies and airline offices and should be of assistance to all who visit the battlefields of World War I. That is an imaginative way of hopefully trying to educate people to respect what the young men of this country have done for this country over the years.

         The Government's so-called free health care system has led to a grossly inefficient and unstable health care delivery system that can no longer be sustained. One of the things that surprised me greatly in last night's statement was that health has yet again been neglected by this Government. I am sure that will be of great concern to Australian citizens, especially the elderly, many of whom are languishing on so-called `elective' waiting lists for medical treatment.

          Broad public acceptance of some of the features of Medicare, such as its universality and the availability of free medical and hospital services, has until recently hidden very serious deficiencies in the system. But no longer are those deficiencies hidden. They include a massive rise in hospital waiting lists and rising costs of private health insurance which have been largely due to the massive decline in the population holding private health insurance. The appeal of the so-called free health system has led to the widespread drop-out of people from the private health care system.

          Private health insurance costs have increased markedly as the private funds have had to cope with the declining membership and, in many cases, a more costly membership as the young and healthy give up their membership of the funds. The newly unemployed—the thousands and thousands of them—who now cannot afford to take out private health insurance are also added to that list.

          The annual report of the operations of the registered health insurance organisations highlights the decline in the numbers of people with private health insurance. At 30 June 1991, 43.5 per cent of the population was covered by private insurance at the basic table level. Only 12 months ago, 44 per cent of the population had this level of coverage.

          The report shows the steady decline in membership of private health funds since this Government came to office. The table indicates the decline in membership from 50 per cent in 1984. In fact, the proportion of the population with private health insurance has fallen from 67 per cent in 1982, when this Government came to office—and this report only goes until June 1991. I was in Mildura only a couple of days ago and people there were talking about the number of people who had fled the private health insurance system since then. So I am sure that if the figures were up to date they would be even more devastating. All the people who formerly had private health coverage now require treatment in the public system which, as I have said, is greatly overburdened.

          What is the Government's solution to the crisis in the private health care system? It comes up with a proposal to nationalise our private health insurance market and to create one single private health fund—a typical and predictable response from this Government. However, the coalition has responded to the problems in the health care system by developing a comprehensive blueprint as part of its Fightback package that will restore the incentive to take out private health insurance and provide the correct balance in the system between public and private resources. Under our policy there will be financial incentives to take out private health insurance. There will also be an expansion of private insurance options.

       Last December, when I drew the attention of the Senate to some quite startling figures on the state of the rural economy, I mentioned that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics had announced that farm incomes had fallen by a tragic, massive 75 per cent in 1991. For Australia it is a crisis of quite significant proportion. The net value of farm production in 1991 was $21 billion, the lowest net value since 1982. Farm cash operating surplus fell from 1989-90 to 1990-91 by 40 per cent and is expected to fall a further 18 per cent between 1990-91 and 1991-92. Farm business profit fell by a massive 357 per cent between the financial year 1989-90 and 1990-91 and is expected to fall a further 67 per cent between the 1990-91 financial year and the 1991-92 financial year.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        These figures are averages across all farm enterprises. For some, the situation was and remains far worse. For sheep and beef producers there has been a 178 per cent drop in profits, and even for specialist beef producers, who according to ABARE have had a pretty good year, farm business profits slumped by 100 per cent.

        I have been warning the Senate for quite some time now about how, even though interest rates might have fallen lately, all the input costs have built into them the high interest rates of the regime that was imposed on Australian farmers by the Labor Government.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Since those figures were released, the Government has staged its 1992 Agricultural Outlook Conference. The news at that conference was that prices for Australia's major export commodities would remain weak and that the net value of farm production would sink further to another record low. It suggested that, despite considerable economising on costs, farmers would still suffer a further drop of 16 per cent in net farm cash income.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The considerable economising farmers have undertaken includes sacking staff. In fact, farming employment has dropped from 152,000 to 140,000, while the figure for unpaid family helpers has jumped by 50 per cent. That means that children are being removed from school, often before their schooling is completed. It means that farm wives are becoming the stock hands on the property.

        In many cases it has meant the husband going off farm to look for work or take stock on the road while his wife takes on the full time running of the farm on top of her other duties, also full time, with the children. I do not need to remind the Senate that Australia until recent weeks has been affected by drought over several States. The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has been looking at the treatment of drought and the Federal Government's approach to drought funding. We have travelled to all States except Victoria and interviewed or taken evidence from 170 witnesses. The witnesses have been a broad spectrum of those involved in the process—from agricultural departmental officers through to consultants and to counsellors.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Most importantly, the Committee has travelled to drought affected areas and spoken directly with farmers affected. We have seen the devastation, the despair and the desolation. I cannot describe to anyone who has not travelled to Cobar in New South Wales, to Roma in Queensland or to Esperance in Western Australia just how serious the drought has been for the people in those areas. But what is most depressing is the overwhelming sense of hopelessness that we as outsiders felt, yet those families, whose livelihoods and all they had worked for were about to be lost, still had the most tremendous courage and, surprisingly, very little bitterness about a situation that in so many cases was simply not of their making.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Time and again the story was repeated. We heard of the family that had 80 per cent or more equity in their properties but were encouraged to buy the farm next door for their sons or to economise their operations. They bought in good faith and with reasonable expectations of being able to meet repayments. Many borrowed at 12 per cent only to see commodity prices fall, unanticipated abandonment of the reserve price scheme for wool, and interest rates jumping to 18 per cent, 20 per cent or even higher. I have it told to me many times that many farmers are in trouble only because they took too many risks and were too greedy. That has not been the case. Farmers have not been greedy, but have been very long suffering in the past eight years of Labor Government.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        What woolgrower could have predicted that the Labor Government would abandon the reserve price scheme, particularly when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy at the time, Mr Kerin—apparently the farmers' friend—said that if there was any movement in the reserve price it would be up, not down, and certainly not out. He was quoted at the time as saying:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The rural sector is vital to our national economy and the rural community is vital to our national identity. This has always been the case in Australia, and it's not about to change.
      </para>
      <para>
       They come as cold words of comfort now that he and the rural sector have been decimated. But given such assurances as those from the Minister, what farmer could have anticipated that interest rates would double in a matter of a few short years? Who could have anticipated such a massive and widespread collapse in commodity prices? Who could have predicted that on top of all these other factors farmers would first be hit with a flood, as Nyngan was, then a drought and then another flood all within a period of four years?
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        It is important to remember that farmers have been caught in a desperate cost-price squeeze for the past 20 years. Since 1973-74 prices paid to farmers for their output have doubled, but prices paid by farmers for their inputs have jumped 4 1/2 times. I ask honourable senators to think about that. How would people react if their household budgets had suddenly jumped in that way? How can anyone prepare adequately for a string of disasters against that background? The simple answer is that they cannot do so. It is history that the number of farms is reducing as is the number of farmers. In the year 1989-90 to 1990-91 the total number of farmers dropped from 243,000 to 228,000. That reduction will accelerate, I anticipate, this financial year.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Certainly based on figures given to the drought inquiry in Queensland and Western Australia, there has been a significant increase in the number of farmers moving from the sound to the doubtfully viable category. Previously, 20 per cent of farmers in Queensland were borderline; that figure is now 30 to 40 per cent. In Western Australia at least 6 per cent of farms are not viable long term, with a further 33 per cent suffering short term difficulties. Half the 30 to 40 per cent of farmers in Queensland I mentioned basically have no future at all, and this was said to us by the Queensland Government.

        The crisis in rural Australia has been developing for a number of years, and most certainly during the entire period of the Labor Government. But I draw the Senate's attention to just how much Labor has done for this most vital sector, a sector which still, despite its adversities, produces 27 per cent of export income. In outlining the specific attacks that the rural sector has suffered from successive Keating budgets, let us not forget the greatest legacy the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), left this country, and that was a record period of record high interest rates. That alone was of sufficient magnitude, but Mr Keating's abuse of rural Australia went even further.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Let me quote to the Senate what I heard the Prime Minister say today at the National Press Club: `Draconian high interest rates slow the country down'. He was making a claim that some of the policies that we will put into place in government after the next election may cause high interest rates, which they will not. The Prime Minister—Mr Keating, the former Treasurer—did cause high interest rates to prevail for far too long, which caused so much harm, so much hardship, and knocked all the confidence out of the business sector. So what has happened to the farming community is on his head.

        In May 1983 the Labor Government cut general depreciation allowances and abolished special depreciation allowances for on-farm fuel storage. That same year it scrapped the in-out opting arrangements of tax averaging and increased the margin paid by farmers under the fuel freight subsidy scheme, and it automatically indexed excise taxes to CPI and imposed a new tax on fortified wines. The year 1983 was a big one for Labor's rural bashing campaign—Senator West should be hiding her head under her desk—because in the Budget of 1983 the Labor Government abolished sales tax exemption on oils and lubricants for farmers. Labor imposed a 200 per cent increase in export inspection charges and abolished tax incentives on income equalisation deposits.

        In 1987 we saw a cut in wool research funding by $5m and the fuel freight consumer component was lifted. In 1988 the Hawke-Keating Labor Government did another job on those of us in country areas. Export inspection charges were increased again and fertiliser subsidies were abolished, along with immediate write-off for electricity connection, changes to depreciation allowances which cost rural industry $90m, wool promotion funds were cut by $20m, the export trade incentives programs were cut by $78m and primary industry levies were increased. If some of these things had not happened it would have helped the rural community, but these all put more costs on the rural community. Indeed, primary industry levies were increased by $105m largely through lifts in the wool tax and livestock slaughter levies.

Furthermore, family allowances have been assets tested, which has effectively eliminated most farm families, no matter how cash poor they are.

Today both those industries are experiencing historic difficulties. I suppose that, given the long list of destruction I have just detailed, we all ought to be grateful that wool and wheat growers actually received a mention in the statement from General Custer last night. The Prime Minister told Parliament that we should help farmers during the recovery phase. I have read the much-ado-about-nothing-much package launched last night.

        I cannot be ungrateful. In those 14 lines there was a one-off addition to the rural adjustment scheme. Farmers can now borrow even more money to plant crops this year. The Wool Realisation Commission will be allowed to make cash payments to woolgrowers in the event that sales from the stockpile occur faster than anticipated. Some much needed extra funds are to be provided for rural counselling services, and I welcome that. Depreciation allowances will assist those farmers who have sufficient equity to make new machinery purchases. But remember all the things that have been taken away before they get a little given back. I do not think that is what the rural communities have needed in the last eight years—take a little away and then give a little back. There was so little when so much needed to be done.

There was no question of underwriting this year's wheat crop so that farmers would have confidence to risk capital in planting. Last year saw a record drop in the size of the crop. We cannot afford to have another small national harvest because we will jeopardise our traditional markets if we cannot supply them. Despite evidence provided by almost every single witness to the drought inquiry to the effect that the income equalisation deposits scheme had to be made more effective, despite the fact that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has been made aware of this, again nothing was done about the income equalisation deposit scheme.

Farm incomes have dropped for a number of reasons, which really have not been outlined very well today by my colleague opposite, Senator Brownhill. Of course, it comes as no surprise that the Government does not accept this notice of motion. The Opposition clearly has chosen to overlook a worldwide recession; to ignore what is happening in the rest of the developed world, and I presume to an even worse extent in the developing countries of the world.

We certainly sent the message very clearly to the US when President Bush was here. We certainly spoke at length to the US press corps which attended with him. Members of the Opposition were very good and vocal at doing that. Unfortunately, I do not recall seeing many of them doing it when the British press corps visited here last week.

This will enable those people to access funding purely for that purpose. They will be able to plant their crop and get their cash flow moving again. That needs to be praised and noted for its usefulness. We also need to note that it is for crops and not just wheat. It is exceedingly important that we recognise that.

We have seen the basket of goods mentioned in the Opposition's Fightback package—or `Frightpack' package as it could be more aptly titled. One has only to look at an answer given in the other place by the former Treasurer, Mr Willis, on this matter. As he said, it would appear that if people want to live on the Opposition's basket of goods they will have to eat Pal and drink Harpic. I think that outlines very clearly what the package contains.

I suggest that they talk to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner. He is in favour of abolishing payroll tax—but only if the State is compensated by the Federal Government. The other furphy about payroll tax that needs to be remembered is that in New South Wales—and I presume that other States are fairly similar in this regard—for wage bills under half a million dollars, or $500,000, employers do not pay payroll tax. It is a great thing to abolish payroll tax when most farmers have wage and salary bills well under half a million dollars. That is a false promise—an incentive or carrot—that they put up to try to entice the people of Australia to support them.

        —I have much pleasure in supporting my National Party colleague Senator Brownhill in the debate on this motion. I have listened with interest to what Senator West has been saying. She wanted to know what the coalition was going to do for rural people. I suggest that she read the Fightback package completely, because the coalition parties realise the important part that farmers play in the economy of Australia. She told us that there had been a downturn in returns to farmers. We quite realise that. But she forgets to mention the increased costs and imposts on rural producers brought about by this Labor Government. That is one thing she did not mention or bring to our notice at all. Senator Brownhill in his speech outlined a lot of the assistance to primary producers that has been removed by this present Labor Government. It is no wonder that so many of them are in such a disastrous plight.

        I have made many speeches in this place about that problem. The Labor Party likes to talk loudly about social justice, but rural people apparently are not part of its social justice program. Its economic policies have already been ruinous to anyone trying to contribute to the productivity of the nation. Those of us who inhabit this nation are all Australians. Last night the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tried to claim in his blueprint for a bankcard led recovery that we are all together as one nation. But I tell honourable senators that we are two nations in terms of financial opportunity: those who are fortunate enough to live in metropolitan Australia and those discriminated against by living in rural or remote Australia. It is this Government which has created these two nations.

        The Government has done nothing to try to bridge this rift. Indeed, its policies have contributed to a disturbing widening of the gulf between these two sections of our nation. This Government has demonstrated that it has no interest in those non-metropolitan Australians. Its neglect effectively punishes those who, for a variety of reasons, choose not to live in the cities and big rural towns. To be a non-metropolitan Australian under this Government is to be second class—a member of the B team; a reserve grade Australian. Last night's document purporting to be for one nation and for all Australians seems to conveniently forget the hundreds of thousands of people who live outside metropolitan Australia.

        What was there in the document for rural Australians? Nothing much—only a few meagre crumbs. But we know that this document will not underwrite the price of the coming season's wheat crops to restore confidence in that industry. It will not change the income equalisation deposit scheme—an excellent scheme for people in rural Australia—to make it an effective insurance policy against low incomes. Regrettably, the Government does not intend to abolish the wholesale sales tax in order to save farmers $170m a year. The Prime Minister will not abolish fuel excise, which is paid on nearly 50 per cent of fuel used on farms and pushes up the cost of transport used to move goods to and from farms. I think that that excise is probably one of the most evil things that has been imposed over the years. Of course, the Government will not bite the bullet and implement a national drought policy, despite the severe drought conditions that have hamstrung farmers for the past 12 months.

        This motion from Senator Brownhill shows that the Government's own body—the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, or ABARE—confirms that farm incomes were slashed by a massive 75 per cent last year. There is no hope being offered for these people by the economic statement. Instead, as this motion suggests, any recovery will be too late for the hundreds of thousands of farmers who are already bankrupt, financially and emotionally.

        It is not as though this Government has simply turned its back on rural problems, letting them fester by callous neglect. I believe it is worse than that. Its policies have actively worked to make things worse. I have heard many speakers in this place and in the media argue about the merits of free trade and the abolition of tariffs, but I have yet to see any significant benefits flow to our rural sector. Only hardship seems to be the end result. Australia has been building its tariff policy around its commitment to the Uruguay Round of GATT. We are told that it is necessary for Australia to reduce its tariff barriers to demonstrate our good faith at GATT and to encourage the larger, more powerful nations to demonstrate that they will follow our lead. However, I believe it is quite clear that this philosophy is not working. The EC and other countries have failed to respond to any of the initiatives taken by Australia and other trading nations.

This came under a considerable spotlight when we addressed the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. In that debate the Government outlined how it intended to set what it calls a `level playing field' for the motor vehicle industry; the textiles, clothing and footwear industry; the vegetable industry; and the sugar industry. What concerns me greatly is that it did this without regard to the impact of its policies on the competitive conditions within which producers in each of those industries work.

Unfortunately, in doing so we place a number of our major industries in a position where there will be even more unemployed; where there will be an even larger number of those engaged in those industries who will be shutting up plants and moving offshore; and where, in many rural sectors, we will find that imports will take over their market share. Regrettably, even with the peanut industry and the fruit growing industry, we are finding that imports are taking over the local growers' share of the market. Reductions of tariffs in these areas as some sort of grand gesture, while they are not being matched by our trading competitors, is a warm inner glow nonsense.

        One economist commented at the last Agricultural Outlook Conference that recovery has been six months away for three years—or four years, or five years or the length of this Government. To my knowledge, the recovery in the rural sector has been coming since 1986-87. Every time the Government looks at it, it is six months away. As a result of the decisions that have been taken by this Government and certain industries, the 1990s is likely to be the worst decade in the rural industry for many decades. Australian farm families will be facing their most difficult decade with increased adjustment pressures from changes in technical, economic, environmental and institutional conditions facing agricultural industries. This Government neglects this section of the Australian community time and time again.

        The outlook for many farmers, particularly those with smaller enterprises amongst the broad acres, is very much one of trouble. Farmers are making considerable savings—they have to. In the farming game, if one cannot see the dollar coming in the door, one has to economise in certain sections to survive. One can make cuts, use less inputs here and cut something else there. It has to be done to survive. People just cannot keep borrowing to get them by in this long drought—not `drought' as in rainfall but drought as in rising prices and neglect by the Government.

        Even though farmers have made cutbacks in costs, net farm cash income is forecast to drop by 16 per cent to $3.2 billion in 1991-92, following a 40 per cent decrease in 1990-91. When allowance is made for depreciation on plant, stock and those sorts of things, the real net value of farm production is expected to fall by 42 per cent to $398m in 1991-92. That is the lowest on record. I repeat: $398m is the total net value profit for all farmers in Australia. That is a very damning figure. Wool, wheat, cotton and sugar producers are expected to experience large drops in income. There are a few bright spots existing: meat has always remained reasonable while dairying and horticulture are probably on the up. But, in general, the whole of the agricultural industry in Australia is suffering badly.

        We have had two very savage years in a row. That has had a terrible effect on the industry. There was a drought in the eastern States last year. The Government says that it is not responsible for the drought. Of course it is not responsible for the drought. But the Government certainly claimed credit for breaking the drought in 1983. If the Government claimed the credit then, I suppose it is fair enough that we blame it for what is happening now. We had a disastrous wheat crisis in the 1990-91 season. It was disastrous because of the actions of the European Community and the American export enhancement program. We have to accept world prices. The only way that we can turn around our productivity and any profit that we make on farms is to minimise our costs. That is the only way to go.

        As Australia's primary industry has now come to the end of its worst two years, one would have thought that the Government's One Nation package which was delivered last night would have given rural industry more than the half a dozen lines it did receive. Rural industry could have been in a much better position, and the Government would not have had to do quite so much in this package, if the Government had taken the right decisions in the last half a dozen years.

        For instance, let us look at the IED scheme—the income equalisation deposits—that Senator Brownhill and Senator Bjelke-Petersen mentioned earlier. We had a good scheme going which commenced in the Fraser years. Unfortunately, when Senator Walsh was the Minister for Finance—and I tell him this any time I talk to him about it—he perceived that there was a rort in the system. He has never been able to explain so that anyone can understand why there was supposed to have been a rort. Anyhow, he decided that there had been a rort, the IED scheme was changed and it was useless.

        I will turn to the figures I have on equalisation deposits. The first year for which there is information available is 1978-79. In that year there were deposits totalling $66m; in 1979-80, $79m; in 1980-81, $136m; in 1981-82, $163m; and in 1982-83, $165m. Unfortunately, 1982-83 is about the time that this Labor Government was elected and the IED scheme changed. So the following year, 1983-84, it went back to $155m; in 1984-85 it was $130m; 1985-86, $94m; 1986-87, $67m; 1987-88, $48m; and in 1988-89, $34m. We can see how it was drained out. If the IED scheme had been left in place as it was, those savings by farmers would have been there to be used in those tough years. But no, the Government took them away.

        So while those good years—the high wheat price years—from about 1982 to 1986 were quite good right through to 1988, the rural industry was not able to use the IED scheme and it simply paid out money to the Tax Office and it was gone. The Keating Treasury got hold of that money and the bank was bare before the tough years started. That is one of the decisions that this Government has made that has gone awry. The rural industry could have been in a position to keep itself right to get over these tough years.

        Let us move on to the price of wheat and the wheat industry. Senator Bell asked, `Where's Senator Brownhill's economic rationale when he is calling for a GMP on wheat?'. I can tell you, Mr Deputy President. The wheat industry would not be in the strife it is in now if it had listened not to us—not to the Opposition—but to the Premier of Western Australia. Last year she gave a one-off and told the President of the wheat industry in Western Australia, John Walsh, that if he came back for a second time around she would throw him out of the office. She gave that one-off guarantee. We were looking at $115 a tonne this time last year when planting was coming up. She gave a guarantee of $150 which enabled the banks to lend with confidence to the growers needing money to plant crop.

        In the One Nation statement delivered last night was a certain amount of money to help plant crops. Senator West made that point. But the point is, that sort of money has to go through this RAS—the rural adjustment scheme or whatever it is called on the other side. By the time it is decided who is worthy or needs that money or does not need that money, and when it is being done in the city rather than out in the bank branches, it is too late. The money comes through in July when the crop should have been planted in May. How can that work?

        Now I come back to my point that the wheat farming industry could have revived far earlier than late 1992. You may know yourself, Mr Deputy President, that the price of wheat—the estimate of the pool return was only altered last Monday—has now reached $180. So in the last six months or less, it has gone from $115 to $180. If there had been a one-off GMP last year all around Australia and all the crop had gone in, many—I would say most—of those farmers who have a chance of surviving would have been in a far better position because they would have been receiving $180 a tonne, and that is guaranteed money in the bank as of the end of March.

If the Government had a one-off GMP this year—forget last year—then the farmers in the eastern States who may be battling to plant crops could do so with guarantees from their local banks. That could and should have been done this year. Senator West said that such an arrangement does not help other grain growers.

As Senator Button told us last night and today, under the depreciation schedules, claims on machines and buildings can be made over seven years rather than 20 years or 30 years. Unfortunately, very little is done for schedules which relate to periods of around five years. This is the period within which most farm machinery is written off. At Question Time today Senator Button told us that it is a rort to reduce the five-year period and, therefore, that arrangement will not be changed.

        Many businesses have been forced to use their capital, and, in the process, have been forced to capitalise their interest. That is now flowing through into their ability to service their debts and their costs. The other impact of interest rates is that businesses have to pass their costs on to producers. In effect, in the end it is the exporters who have to pick them up. It is almost impossible for rural people and exporters—the people who pick up the total cost—to survive in the environment of high interest rates that was run by Mr Keating when he was Treasurer.

        I want to say something about the rural adjustment scheme. Witness after witness told the Committee that the last thing that they wanted was more money. They said that they could not handle or service more debt, yet that is being put forward as one of the panaceas of the rural situation.

        Let us now look briefly at wool. Is it not a marvellous gesture that if the Wool Realisation Commission makes a profit on the sale of the wool—the wool that is owned by the producers, the debt for which is being serviced by the producers, a wool stockpile in which they have a $2 billion investment of their own money—the producers will be paid back their own money? I do not know what the Government expected to do with the money before it brought this statement down but, in effect, it is saying that the farmers will get their own money back.

        I turn briefly to a number of things the Opposition has said it will do. The first thing—and this has been raised by previous speakers—is that we will return to and put in place a proper IED scheme. I want to quote from a producer who gave evidence to us at the drought inquiry the other day—a producer who is just about out of business today, with the combination of collapsed commodity prices and drought. In the last four years before the drought started two years ago that producer averaged $40,000 income tax a year. Yet he had no mechanism by which he could set aside money to protect himself from a downturn or a drought day. One of the first issues that will get our very high attention is a proper IED scheme that will allow people to become self-reliant and look after themselves, to smooth out their income flows, because agriculture is an industry that has very rough income flows.

        The other step the Opposition will be taking, and it is very important for export industries, is looking at the system under which export regulation is applied.

        Another means by which the Opposition will address rural problems—this comes straight from the Fightback package, and I make no apology for it—is that farmers, graziers and pastoralists will pay 26c a litre less for all petrol used on-farm for business purposes and 19c a litre less for petrol for personal vehicle use. Our proposed fuel reductions will also flow through to the transport companies.

        We heard in the statement last night about road building, and one will not argue that we need a good road system. But it is important how that is done, whether we can afford it and whether it is funded. We did not see anything in the Government statement about how it will be funded. Under the Opposition's policy, with the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise, fuel reduction costs to the road transporters who carry our goods will be in the order of $53,000 per rig per annum.

        As I mentioned earlier today, the rail system pays fuel excise. The cost of that to the rail system represents some 20 per cent of the cost of carrying wheat on rail—or it was in Western Australia about four years ago, and I do not believe the relativities have changed. In addition, cuts will apply to Avgas. This will mean that the cost of aerial agricultural work such as crop dusting, superphosphate spreading, mustering and all the other tasks for which aeroplanes are used will drop.

        I have outlined a number of the Opposition's policies which will benefit those in rural areas very significantly. Since we have little influence on the international scene, the Government should be addressing itself to getting rural costs down. It has long been the cry of the farmer organisations, whether it be the National Farmers Federation, State organisations or the commodity councils, that the way to allow agriculture in this country to remain competitive is to look very closely at the impost of taxation on inputs and get them off; and to look at the imposts on the infrastructure industries such as transport and get them off. This Government has done little or nothing about that. We will then be able to operate on the same basis as countries such as America, Canada, Argentina, Brazil and the European countries—the list is endless. They do not have the up-front imposts we have. That is something that could be done immediately, and it would certainly make a big difference at the end of the day to the profitability of the individuals within the industry.

One thing I want to say is that there are a lot of economists in this place, but no-one realises the fundamental truth about the Australian economy: unless the rural economy is doing well, the urban economy and the national economy are not doing well. We have been going through very difficult periods with commodity prices overseas and bad weather. They are factors that we really do not have any control over, but we do have control over the imposts we load onto our farming community. This Government has loaded up the farming community to a degree that we have not seen in our history. It has made economic survival a matter of desperate necessity.

          The Committee is one of the oldest committees of the Parliament, passing into non-existence—if this move is accepted—after some 35 years. It is a committee on which, since the time it came into existence in 1957, 102 senators and members have served, 12 of them as Chairman. You, Mr Deputy President, were a member from August 1978 to September 1980. It is almost like looking at a history of the Parliament to note those who have been involved. In its early years, a senator was always a Chairman of that Committee. From a quick count, it seems that over 100 reports have been tabled by the Committee over the period, dealing principally with variations to the city plan.

         This is the legacy of the Hawke-Keating years, of their stewardship of the Australian economy. The key to Australia's problems lies in the ongoing current account deficit. Through wages indexed to the CPI and other mad policies of Labor, we ceased to be competitive in so many areas. It led to a crisis, a crisis which is still with us and which has been rekindled by last night's pump-priming.

         In the last quarter before Mr Keating became Treasurer, the current account deficit was $612m. Under Keating, as we know, it was often over $2 billion. Mr Keating's answer, instead of seeking to make Australia more competitive, was to force up interest rates to dampen demand. But in fact he pushed up interest rates until even the best run businesses were no longer competitive. Having destroyed so much of the economy, he now wants to buy an answer with money we do not have—the quick fix, the kick start, which puts us back into the boom-bust cycle from which we so desperately need to break away.

         Dramatic contrast is offered by the coalition's Fightback package. It is fully funded, because we recognise the need to arrest debt, not contribute to it by the fiscal blow-out we are again experiencing. Remember Mr Keating, as Treasurer, saying not so long ago that never again would it be necessary for the Government to put its hand into the cookie jar of people's savings. Yet here he is, doing it again.

         Access Economics estimates a fiscal deficit of $9 billion this year, before Mr Keating's latest expenditure. Australia cannot afford to keep running this way. Fightback seeks to set the framework within which Australia can again be internationally competitive. It is structured to provide incentives to individuals and businesses to grow and to employ. It does so by offering cuts in business taxation of some $20 billion a year, fully funded, compared with Mr Keating's offer last night of less than $1 billion unfunded. And business taxes must come down if we are to be competitive.

          Only last month we learnt of a new OECD study which found that Australian business has to pay the highest rate of tax on new investment in the industrialised world, except for Turkey. Coincidentally, at about the same time the Business Council of Australia released a study showing that, of nine countries, Australia imposes the highest taxes on output for domestic sale except for Japan and the highest apart from Japan and Germany on production for export.

         Fightback would allow a business tax structure which would be internationally competitive. As almost all the industrialised world has found, it cannot be financed without a broad-based goods and services tax, and Mr Keating knows that, too. That is why the Keating statement was flawed from the outset, if it ever was supposed to provide a more competitive economy.

         Fightback provides the framework for competitive labour relations—not lower wages as Mr Keating would claim but contracts tailored to the unique circumstances of a particular enterprise so that both employer and employee can benefit. The Labor Party has been dragged kicking and screaming to enterprise bargaining, but nobody really believes that it will deliver. Senator Cook made clear today that, despite the change of rhetoric, those opposite in the Government will not deliver. They do not even understand what it means. That is why Mr Keating's statement last night requires that such agreements must be registered with the IRC, the core structure of the centralised system.

That is less than one in every two fully qualified South Australian school leavers who sought to get into university to further their education will not get the opportunity under Labor. Just as important as other initiatives, Fightback with the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and of course no GST on exports will mean that exports are cheaper and more competitive.

Only 15.5 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports were manufactured goods compared with, say, Canada with 57.1 per cent. I use Canada as an example because it also is a major resource exporter.

         What is obvious is that, although Australia might be changing, others are changing more rapidly. We are not chasing static targets. We have not improved our position even in Asia, the fastest growing of all the markets.

Although most of the recent growth in Australian exports has been to Asian markets, which I accept, our market share is not increasing.

         I draw Senator Button's attention, as obviously he does not read these things, to another report delivered this week from the Business Council of Australia on participation of Australian companies in trade and investment in Asia. The report expresses the position in these terms:

         Asia is clearly the most significant trading area for Australia, accounting for about 50 per cent of our exports, but our profile in Asia, if resources are excluded, is very small. Primary products plus metals and basic manufactured metals account for 83 per cent to 88 per cent of goods exported. The real problem is that in the higher value added area we are not competitive. Under Mr Keating's economic policies of high interest rates and a high dollar it was difficult enough for our natural resource exporters to remain competitive.

         To recapitulate some of Professor Garnaut's main points, in his report, which the Government claims to have adopted as a recipe for a greater involvement in the expanding markets of Asia, Professor Garnaut said:

        Garnaut also stressed the need for stable macro-economic policy to keep domestic expenditure on a steady, low inflation growth path—which, of course, we did not get last night. Here is Mr Keating again pump priming the economy in a way which must add to our current account, inflation and then interest rates. The same argument applies to the need for a more efficient tax system. I remind the Leader of the Government of the 1989 Hughes Committee report on Australian exports, which I would have thought the Minister would have read, which identified the lack of a value added type of tax as a factor reducing Australia's competitiveness vis-a-vis competitors employing the same systems.

DFAT, as is the style of this Government, gives much greater attention to the regulatory impediments in North Asian countries than to our competitive deficiencies. It is always easier to attach blame elsewhere. Analysis of the progress post-Garnaut is left to others. David Chessell of Access Economics analysed the Government's performance in the

There is no Coronation Hill in the statement, no abandoning of its restrictive uranium mining policy, and no GST, which even Mr Keating realises is essential for a real package of reforms.

It is really Paul Keating saying, `I'm sorry; here's $125 compensation for making your life a misery'. The money will be welcomed by most families, if somewhat cynically.

         This payment seems to be the one measure in the package designed to provide an instant kick-start to consumer spending. It comes wrapped up in the guise of a social justice measure, but it fails on both counts. Firstly, the additional $300m is a mere drop in the ocean of consumer spending. Further, many of these families will not use the payment to buy consumer goods. They will, despite the Government's exhortations, use it to pay off their very many debts which have accumulated during the recession—a recession brought on by Mr Keating himself and in some cases due to earning limitations on unemployment beneficiaries and pensioners. If they are able to afford to spend the payment, the risk is that the money will go on imported goods.

         If the Government is expecting the payment to stimulate the economy, it should therefore be urging families to use the payment only on the purchase of Australian goods. One way to ensure this would have been for the Government to develop the `100 per cent Aus' labelling scheme. Consumers could then actually make an informed choice about what they were buying, and Paul Keating should now be urging families to spend their one-off payment on 100 per cent Australian production.

         Secondly, the payment really demonstrates very clearly this Government's inability to come to grips with the structural problems of poverty. Yes, families are assisted by the payment, but what about those single people or couples without children who are trying to live on low incomes? Where is the help for them? We welcome the increase in family allowance supplement, the boost in funding for welfare agencies and the reduction in rent assistance waiting periods.

         These are somewhat hollow gestures in the context of a package that accepts around 8 per cent unemployment for at least the next four years. With that long term prospect in mind, what does the package do by way of addressing the structural problems of poverty? The short answer is: absolutely nothing. Here was a chance to tackle some of those structural problems. For example, the Government could have increased the amount people on pensions and benefits are permitted to earn before losing their entitlement to payment. It could have reinstated young unemployed people's incomes back to the adult level. It could have reduced or removed all the existing waiting periods for income support, which are currently responsible for so much poverty in this country, particularly amongst families. But the Government has not gone for genuine social justice for the victims of this recession. Instead, it has gone for the easy option, the social justice gimmick, the money, not the structural box.

But again, $720m is simply not enough. Over 100,000 applicants missed out on TAFE places this year. That is a tragedy both for them and for this nation. The Prime Minister has failed to develop a strategy to overcome this shortfall in future years. Commonwealth estimates of funding requirements for the TAFE sector indicate that between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in recurrent annual expenditure will be needed to meet the education participation goals of the Government by the year 2001. This is especially so if, by the year 2001, 95 per cent of all 19-year-olds are either in the work force or in higher education, as the Finn review recommends and the Democrats strongly hope will occur.

Equally, we need to know—and the Prime Minister is not telling us—how the Government plans to fund the infrastructure, staffing and capital works programs needed to cope with the increased university enrolment that Labor has been imposing on universities and promises to continue.

         Mr Keating is to spend $1 billion on big projects, especially in the transport sector. We have long advocated this, although we have said that $2 billion in outlays was needed for that expenditure to be effective. Mr Keating has, to the extent of $1 billion, now confirmed our view. Senator Powell has already raised our concerns in this chamber, but because of the importance of this area I shall repeat some of them. This statement has been touted as a major boost to rail transport. An additional $454m will be provided to the National Rail Corporation to standardise and improve the national rail system. At first glance, this level of rail spending looks like a welcome boost to a vital element in our national infrastructure. But it must be remembered that, under Labor, investment in rail has been appallingly low and has been progressively run down.

         In his statement, Mr Keating points out that the construction of a national rail highway `should have been done a hundred years ago'. That means it could have been done over the last nine years under a Labor government in which Mr Keating was the chief policy architect. The fact is that $454m over the next two years will compensate—and that is all—for the total neglect of rail by Labor. No evidence has been provided by this Government to demonstrate that the money it proposes to spend will result in a major shift of freight from road to rail. We are told that Melbourne to Sydney rail transit times will be 12 hours, a reduction of 1 1/2 hours. But a modern heavy truck can do the trip in 10 hours and can go direct to the final destination.

Unfortunately, though, there are two tax decisions that reinforce the impression of the entire document that the Government does not understand ecologically sustainable development. The first is the sales tax reduction for new motor vehicle purchases. It is Democrat policy to tax cars on the basis of their fuel efficiency. The sales tax reduction should apply only to fuel efficient vehicles. This would reduce our consumption of and hence importation of oil and therefore our current account deficit. It would also reduce the smog which recently grounded about 10 per cent of Sydneysiders who suffer from asthma and other respiratory allergy disorders and were therefore advised to remain indoors on two successive particularly smoggy days.

There is expenditure of new money which is actually filched from old programs such as the MFP program taken from the better cities program. There is a danger of foreign takeover in the program. There is a complete lack of awareness of the future; there is no vision. Mr Keating is simply on the wrong track and in most of the statement he has pushed ahead on that wrong track.

The effect is to undercut world markets by 60 per cent. The EC also gives dairy subsidies at the level of 69 per cent. It is the same with wheat, with the US selling subsidised wheat into our traditional markets. Only one-third of all wheat production is freely traded in the entire world. Just this month our ally, the US, offered 200,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Yemen—our traditional market—on top of the 300,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat it has already sold there, taking over half of our market.

         It is the same with sugar where a 57 per cent subsidy is provided by the EC. The sugar industry is presently feeling the effects of major droughts and low world prices. It has to accept the corrupted world price of 8c a pound while its competitors in the US receive a guaranteed domestic price of 23c a pound and 15c a pound in Thailand. The sugar industry, for example, has a goal to increase production to five million tonnes by the turn of the century. It is an industry capable of lifting our much needed export earnings, but when it is the sugar producer most exposed to world prices and has just lost $350m from drought and corrupt world prices now is not the time to remove the small tariff levels.

         However, the real attitude of the Government to Australia's farmers is seen by the $51m payment to the textile, footwear and clothing industry to assist adjustment, compared with the assistance given to farmers. Besides this, the rural sector is to receive only $10.8m next year and $6m for part B of the rural adjustment scheme for 75 interest subsidies to enable grain growers to plant crops—and cane growers too, I might add. This is a totally inadequate response.

         With 10 per cent of all broad acre farms with two consecutive years of negative cash income and our wheat crop down to 9.5 million tonnes, the industry called for underwriting for one season to give confidence to growers to plant a crop and to lenders to finance a crop. This has been totally rejected by the Government. A GMP could definitely provide a major turnaround for the national economy—surely it is just the type of scheme we should be considering. With current prices at a high of $180, government exposure would be minimal, but it would provide that boost, that confidence, to get Australian wheat farmers planting again.

         Plantings have to take place by early March in Queensland—two weeks away—and by late March in the southern States. But already, one day after the announcement, there are indications that the scheme will run into problems. To qualify for part B there have to be short term money problems. But for a bank to lend, a farmer has to be able to service the debt and repay the capital. When a farmer is eligible for part B, he is in a difficult position to get approval for a bank loan. An interest subsidy will not help when farmers are in desperate need of credit. Banks will need security before they will lend, plus a guaranteed ability for the farmer to pay back the debt. Already these farmers on part B are being assisted with interest payments to make them viable. The Government has to address this problem urgently—not just flick past it and leave it for State rural adjustment authorities to work out.

I ask the Democrats whether they remember that he told the Senate that he wanted it passed immediately so that the farmers would have it available `next Monday'. Do they remember that?

Some industries are just too small to launch anti-dumping cases. The small navy bean industry of Queensland knows that baked beans are being dumped.

But the increase in costs since the accord was introduced in 1983 for extras such as the training guarantee levy, structural efficiency levy, classification creep, shorter hours equalling 5 per cent—that is, a 38-hour week—has seen at least a 25 per cent increase in wages from 1983 to 1987, and they have increased considerably more since then.

But it is an achievable, responsible goal against the Fightback package, which claims, with some smoke and mirrors, that with a bit of luck a lot of jobs will be created. In the middle of a recession, what it is proposing is to tighten fiscal policy by between $1.7 billion and $3 billion in the first year. First year high school economics would tell us that doing that in the middle of a recession would lose a lot of people their jobs, and there are a whole lot of other proposals in the package to sack people.

         On the tax front, it is as stark as it can be because of the goods and services tax—the ideologically driven commitment to change the tax mix from income to consumption. There is a lot of sophisticated capacity to analyse the implications of the tax policy, but just look at it by this one criterion: if people consume 100 per cent or more of their income—and many people are forced to consume more than 100 per cent—they pay the GST on the whole 100 per cent of that income. If other people are wealthy enough not to have to spend all their income, if they can save 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent, they have to pay the GST only on what they spend and they get tax cuts to help them enjoy the fruits of their higher income. They also get bigger tax cuts than the people down the bottom, who pay the GST on every cent they spend.

All the modellers, even the supporters of the GST, are saying that if one does not have a wages policy one cannot get that one-off surge out of the system.

         The fourth area of major contrast is in wages policy. There is absolutely no wages policy. What does that mean? Combine that with the GST, and it means one gets the surge in inflation. There is no way of getting it out of the system and no fiscal policy capacity to do it because the Opposition has its fiscal policy locked in. The only vehicle the Opposition has left is higher interest rates, and that means interest rates will go up. The economy, already tightened by $1.7 billion to $3 billion worth of cuts in expenditure, will tighten even further as we get the impact of the higher interest rates trying to squeeze the inflation out of the system.

         We then get the emotional argument—whoever wrote Senator Boswell's speech was making the same point—that this is somehow terrible because it is what is called an unfunded increase and because in 1992-93 we will have a projected 1.9 per cent of GDP as a deficit. I will come back to that in a moment. Australian public sector debt is very low. It is very easy to play the distorting game and say that Australia has a massive debt. Australia's public sector debt is one of the lowest in the OECD. It remains very low and modest even under this package.

         I want to talk mainly about public sector debt because that is what this debate is about. How will this be funded? It will be funded in the same way as other deficits that Australian governments have run up in 26 of the last 30 years were funded. It may have escaped the notice of Senator Short and his colleagues that only one government in Australian history has ever delivered a surplus and that was this Labor Government. There was a surplus for four years. In every other year there was a deficit and we funded it.

         The projection for the five years from 1991-92 to 1995-96 is for an average deficit of 0.88 of one per cent of GDP. I can compare that average. The highest projection is for 1992-93. I think it is a pretty accurate projection; it is not far out. The projection is that it might be 1.9 per cent of GDP. Even that is less than the deficit as a percentage of GDP in 15 of the last 40 years in Australian history. It is less than it was in five of the eight years of the Fraser Government in which the deficit as a percentage of GDP averaged 2.5 per cent.

         How was that funded? It was funded in the same way that every country around the world funds deficits in a recession. It is approximately the average deficit as a percentage of GDP of the 30 years before 1983. The average would be even less if one took the Labor Government's record of running some surpluses into it. But the average of the 30 years before the Labor Government came into power is approximately what is projected for the next five years.

He asked, `Will not this borrowing to fund the deficit push up interest rates?'. Does anybody seriously think that the problem in the Australian economy is an excess of demand for money; that there are too many people out there wanting to borrow to invest; that there is too much demand? I really do not think that is the problem we are confronting.

         Nor is there an excess of demand for other resources. I wish there were an excess of demand for labour; it would be great. We would not have the One Nation package then. What we would be doing probably would be inflationary. That is why we did not do it when there was an excess of demand. That is why in the good years we cut back. We went into surplus so that when the difficult times came we had the capacity to spend and still remain within the normal standard parameters of the fiscal policies pursued by Australian governments over the last 30 years.

I should add to that the fact that this discharges the macro-economic responsibility of any responsible government. Put aside the very reasonable social concerns that this will provide jobs for people. Just talk about it as the macro-economic responsibility of a government to say, `In a recession it is our responsibility to try to maximise the level of growth to get the economy back on a growth path, to give it a stimulus'.

         —Senator McMullan has once again tried to put a brave face on what is an extraordinarily difficult situation for him, because he is going in to bat for something which has been seen already, and which will continue to be seen, as a fundamentally flawed package. Where he is right is when he says that the battlelines have been drawn. There now is a very clear distinction and stark choice facing the Australian electorate. We look forward to putting that to the test whenever the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has the courage to call a by-election in Wills. As John Hewson said tonight in the other place, we would delight in having that by-election turned into a general election.

         today calls it, `The triumph of survival politics'. That is what this is all about. It is petty, vote-buying, a spending binge, an attempt to salvage a dying government document. It is spend now, pay later, damn the consequences for this nation a few years down the track. So it goes on in most of the comments made in today's media.

        That is a pretty good description of the unbelievability of the proposals that have been put before us. This statement will stand or fall on whether it has any more credibility than the credibility that the new Prime Minister has. He was Treasurer for eight years, the architect and implementer of the greatest recession we have seen in 60 years. This was the Treasurer who boasted that he pulled the levers of economic policy. Well, he sure pulled them and with them pulled 1.5 million Australians out of work or caused them to be under-employed, and he pulled millions of others into a recession that he deliberately engineered.

         The Prime Minister has no credibility at all. Last night's statement suffers the same fate as its author, the Prime Minister. It has no credibility either.

         The literature is replete with them. One would not want to waste the time of the Senate by going through them all, but some need repeating and repeating and repeating. There is an attempt going on by the Government and the Prime Minister to rewrite the economic history of the past eight years. The Opposition will never allow this Prime Minister and his Government to get away with it. Just four days before he made his first attempt at the political assassination of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, at the end of May 1991, the former Treasurer said:

         The essence of the problem with last night's statement is that the Government has gone on a very major spending binge, particularly in the area of infrastructure spending, without taking one offsetting decision which would enable the increased spending to be funded. As a result we shall face, according to the Government's figures, a situation where over the next four years, including 1991-92, we shall see a cumulative Budget deficit of $20 billion.

He did not know, for example, that there is not one word or line in last night's statement to explain how it would be funded. Senator Button did not explain it. Senator McMullan did not explain it adequately tonight. The only way it can be funded is by government borrowing, either overseas or domestically or a combination of both, or by going to the Reserve Bank of Australia and cranking up the printing presses.

The Government will have to raise that money on the domestic or overseas markets. Presumably, it will aim mainly to raise it on the domestic market because of its rightful concern about an even bigger blowing out of the foreign debt than will occur anyway. I will come back to that later. However, assuming that the Government aims basically to raise it on the domestic markets, that loan raising and drawing on the national savings will occur at a time when, assuming there is a recovery in the economy, as there will be at some stage—all economies recover; even the Australian economy will recover, at least in part, from the bludgeoning that this Government has subjected it to in recent years—the private sector as well will be seeking funds as part of the recovery process.

         What the Government seems to have completely overlooked is that already there is a very significant stimulus moving through the economy as a result of the interest rate cuts of the last year or so. Because of the lagged effects, those cuts have still to make an impact. Also, there has already been an enormous stimulus given through the unprecedented deterioration in the Government's budgetary position over the last two years. We have moved from a situation in 1989-90 when the Government had a Budget surplus of $8 billion to a situation this year, just two years later, where, even on the Government's own reckoning, the deficit will be $6.8 billion—say, $7 billion. That represents a turnaround in those two years of $15 billion.

         No-one really believes that that $6.8 billion will be achieved. It is more likely to be a deficit of something approaching $9 billion. To come in during the next five months—the figures are as yet unknown—with a deficit of $6.8 billion will require between the first half of 1991-92 and the second half a turnaround of an amount that is absolutely unprecedented in Australia's history. We have a deficit in the first six months of this year of $11 billion. To achieve a deficit of $7 billion means that there has to be a surplus of $4 billion in the second half of this year. That makes a turnaround between the first and second halves of the financial year of $15 billion. That has never before been achieved in our history. It could be achieved only if there were a major increase in economic activity in the second half of 1991-92—that is, between now and the end of June. Even the Government acknowledges that that will not happen and that we are still in a very recessed condition.

         The budgetary stimulus that is in the economy is very great indeed. What the Government is doing with the package that it announced last night—this unfunded package, this absolutely, totally irresponsible spending package—is to compound that deficit situation in a way that will put enormous pressure on the financial markets. The bond market moved up today as the analysts started to look at the impact of the package. I am certain that on further inspection that market rate will increase. So we are now facing again a situation of inevitable and inexorable rises in interest rates. The last thing that the private sector in this country needs, if we are to attempt to get any recovery, is yet another increase in interest rates to the crippling levels that brought this country to its knees over the last couple of years. The impact of the deficit will be very considerable.

         Senator McMullan before he left the chamber said, `Oh, well, it wasn't really all that big a problem because it was only a small percentage of GDP'. The forecasts in last night's statement are not really forecasts, as the Government itself admits in the fine print in this document. The so-called forecasts for the next four or five years are only scenarios. As the document makes clear, they are not forecasts as such, yet the whole of the figuring of the Budget has been predicated on the basis that they are forecasts. That is a fundamental flaw in the whole conceptual calculation.

         The other enormous difference between the statement of last night and the coalition's Fightback proposals is that every ounce of increased revenue that the Government is relying on to fund its spending binge over the next four years is based on a very rapid rate of economic growth. The Fightback proposals that the coalition put forward were absolutely self-financed without any allowance at all for an incentive effect as a result of increased economic growth, which would obviously occur.

         Whereas the Fightback proposals are costed on the most conservative possible basis, the Government's statement last night and all its calculations are based on the most ambitious and least conservative result that could be achieved. There only has to be a hiccup in the growth forecasts on which last night's figures are based and there will be an enormously greater Budget deficit than the one forecast. For example, the predictions in the economic statement last night were based on a growth in the economy of something over 4 per cent on average over the next four years. That is a very optimistic scenario. If the growth rate falls below 4 per cent the $20 billion cumulative deficit over the next four years will absolutely skyrocket.

         Some modelling has been done today by the coalition using the Murphy model, which I think is accepted by both sides of politics as a very accurate econometric model. The results show that the Prime Minister's One Nation package will cause a major blow out in foreign debt. It will boost inflation significantly. It will cause a massive increase in the current account deficit. The Budget will remain in significant deficit through the whole of the four-year period—not just in a cyclical way but in a way that will produce a very significant structural deficit.

Inflation, far from the Government's 3 3/4 per cent claim by the Prime Minister last night will, on the basis of the modelling done today, blow out to 6 per cent.

         A great con job has been attempted by the Government in the last 24 hours in the area of its supposed personal income tax cuts for Australians. The Government was claiming that average taxpayers would get an income tax cut of $46 a week in 1994 and 1996. That is palpably wrong. Firstly, on the Government's own admission in the statement last night, there will be no tax cut at all for persons earning less than $20,700 per year, and 42 per cent of all Australian income tax payers earn less than $20,700 a year. Almost half of the taxpaying population of Australia will not get one crack at tax cuts out of this package.

All of those things add up to about $20 billion. That $20 billion is now paid by business simply on the cost of doing business in this country.

They will not get one iota of benefit out of this package over the next five years. Because of the increase in inflation and the increase in interest rates, they are all going to be worse off.

         —This is a very valuable opportunity to be able to speak in this debate. If one were to believe the Government, all our problems would be over after last night's performance. The sort of extravagant rhetoric that we have had from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is part and parcel—indeed, stock in trade—of the way in which he has conducted himself on economic issues. I have no doubt that in the days to come the analysts, the economists and the commentators will do the arithmetic and will come to only one conclusion, which is inevitable: that this package is simply unsustainable. It is built on sands that simply do not exist. Indeed, it is the height of irresponsibility.

         If one tries to think of the most important single line that goes through Australian politics in terms of economic responsibility, it is: where is the money coming from? It has almost in itself been enough to bring down governments in the past. When one tries to judge these things objectively, it is right that it should because it is the height of irresponsibility to make promises to spend money that is not ours, to hock the country in the future and to, in effect, mortgage one's grandchildren. This is precisely what we have before us.

         A public debt that will rise by $20 billion over the next four years is an horrific sight to contemplate, given the enormity of our foreign debt and all the economic indicators that are weighted so heavily against us already. I do not think anyone can express it better than did Max Walsh today. I noticed Senator Button's churlish response. In one breath he said, `Of course, I don't want to put Max Walsh down; he is really quite an intelligent fellow, but he is a bit of a manic depressive basically'. At the same time, he was careful not to decry Max Walsh's economics.

         I think we can take it that even Senator Button is embarrassed to have to defend the package in the way that he tried to do today. It was painfully clear from his answers to several questions, one from Senator Short, that he was embarrassed in the extreme. He did not know some of the fundamentals of the document, and quite clearly was intellectually uncomfortable in defending the indefensible. What Max Walsh says, for example, when talking about this as a crude and dangerous political pork-barrelling exercise, is that Mr Keating has gone on a spending spree. He says:

        He then goes on to demonstrate that the public sector borrowing requirement is indeed much higher than the Government would claim and is destined to go even higher in the very near future because of the blow-out of State deficits. What really is the ultimate in magic puddings is the statement that the Government will halve that borrowing requirement simply by restoration of the Commonwealth Budget balance, relying on restraint in outlays which decline as a proportion of GDP from 1992-93, partly offset by a decline in revenue as a proportion of GDP.

At the end of the day it is simply a means of pretending that somehow the Government will be able to achieve savings when it has given not the slightest indication of how it hopes to do so. There is no doubt at all that the Government can finance these sorts of spending sprees only by borrowings; yet, just to quote another one of Mr Keating's immortal lines from only two years ago:

        In three years there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It is an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the Government of Australia. I doubt there is any other OECD economy that will not have any bonds on issue at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Short said, bond rates have already moved upwards today in anticipation of the inevitable, and it is quite clear that, if the Government is not going to embark on expenditure cuts or taxation increases, there are only two other options: one is simply to print money, which has drastic inflationary consequences; the other is to borrow, and that will indirectly force up interest rates and presumably exacerbate inflation in due course.

         So there is no semblance of responsibility in all this. Mr Keating has reached new heights of bombast which I suspect even Mr Hawke could not have achieved with a straight face. It really defies common sense when we look at some of the statements he has made in the past, such as `We are leading the world, as usual'; `redesigning capitalism'; `If we get the economy right then the security we give our people will really be quite profound by an international comparison'. Probably one of the most telling is a statement of about 18 months ago:

        There is no prospect of massive increases in public spending—full stop. If you're savings poor you can't have it—like the people who say we've got to have a super highway from here to there. People here believe they can have brand new roads, buildings, brand new everything. Well, they can't.

        Of course they cannot. He knew it then and he knows it now. But he has the gall to get up and somehow pretend that you can have all these things—in the hope, of course, that he will be taken at his word. We will not have anything to see for this prior to the next election. We will have some promises about all sorts of things down the track, but the political strategy is clear: simply to muddy the waters, pretend that things are happening, and make extravagant promises about the future to disguise the fact that unemployment will still stay around 10 per cent. Again, of course, the Government simply chooses to pretend that it will be below the magic 10 per cent figure. Somehow that is even more excruciatingly embarrassing for them, so it says that it will be around 9.5 per cent. The truth is that the Government has no idea.

         Mr Keating said as recently as December 1990 `We are setting up a market economy but built around a compassionate policy', and then last night he announced obscene taxation cuts for the likes of Senator Tate, who is on $100,000 a year. He will be picking up about $2,500 a year as a result of this package. But the 3.9 million taxpayers and the people least able to defend themselves, the low income groups, part time and casual employees, mostly women, students and the aged—all those who are simply eking out a living on the side—get absolutely nothing at all.

That is the very antithesis of welfare targeting. People on $75,000 can be eligible for this sort of handout. What are they meant to do with this $125? I suppose they could buy 2 1/2 bottles of Veuve Cliquot, or maybe another hub-cap for the Mercedes. But could anyone in his right mind suggest that those people are in need of that sort of assistance? The people who are desperately in need of more help than a one-off transparent bribe are those who are out of work and those on low incomes.

         The sort of derisory payment to voluntary agencies of about $2m this year is really put in perspective when one considers the cynicism of the way in which the Government is going to hand out this $125—by personal cheques from the Prime Minister. The cost of postage will probably be about the same as the amount of money that the Government is handing over to voluntary agencies in order to alleviate distress in the community. Can honourable senators think of anything more cynical than that, anything worse by way of wasting taxpayers' funds? That money could have been given to the agencies, in spades. Indeed, the sort of money that is being handed over in these $125 payments is of the order of several hundred million dollars—a $317m package in one-off payments. As a number of welfare agencies have said, that money could have been much better applied if it had been given directly to charitable organisations to disburse. The Anglican Home Mission Society said that last night. The Sydney City Mission said that putting a bandaid over the wound was not going to heal it. It is quite clear that, as the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle spokesman said, this is little more than a bandaid measure.

         The fact remains that the Government could not use this money less effectively if it tried. If it were in any way serious about trying to help those who have suffered most from the recession, it would not give the money to fat cat public servants; it would not disperse it in such a way that it almost dissipates it by sending off 1.9 million cheques. Indeed, it would give the money to voluntary agencies. Yet the money was there for the taking—because it is all unfunded. Instead, what happens? None of it will go to them except a miserable $2m, and $3m next year—for what it is worth—presumably after the election so the Government does not have to deliver on it. The cynicism is breathtaking. One can only conclude that the people who made these sorts of decisions have long since lost touch with reality.

         Mr Keating has now been in this place for about 24 years. One would have thought that he had pride and self-respect, that he had tried over the years—putting all that hyperbole and euphuistic nonsense aside—and was somehow interested to establish a reputation for some degree of economic rationality, and that perhaps he was sensitive to some of the charges about what had happened to his predecessor but one when he had a fairly extravagant Budget in his last term in office. All of those lessons seem to have gone for nought, because we have Mr Keating here simply being prepared to throw it all on one roll of the dice, to be about as profligate as he could ever be in expenditure terms—not just in one year but, if this package were to be taken seriously, which of course it will not, a commitment to spending of the order of $20 billion over the next 4 years with nothing more than pious hopes about how it will be funded.

         To talk about labour productivity increasing by 300 per cent I would have thought is pretty breathtaking stuff.

Indeed, labour productivity has been averaging less than 1 per cent over the last five years and all of a sudden we are talking about 1.5 per cent. So the figures are not just rubbery; they are unrecognisable if one is serious about arithmetic. Of course, that shows the hollowness and emptiness of this whole package.

         It was suggested last year that Keating should stop the Government's disgraceful early retirement scheme—which is laughingly known as superannuation—by raising the preservation age from 55 to 60. That is a perfectly rational proposition which every responsible commentator would endorse as a means of closing off the double dipping gap. But what was Mr Keating's response? It was, `We will not do it because it is too difficult politically and industrially'. In other words, there is not one rational economic argument for not doing what must be done; simply that Bill Kelty and the ACTU will not wear it. Look at the sort of veto that the ACTU is able to continue to exercise on this country. There will be an announcement tomorrow which presumably will mean that we will see more of it. We will certainly see a lot more of it in terms of superannuation over the period of the next weeks and months because we know that this progressive impost—a $4 billion payroll tax on employers—will simply be funded from their own retained earnings and profits; it certainly will not come out of the pockets of workers.

         Even the likes of Senator Cook, who has to be the ultimate member of the club, had the grace to concede last year that perhaps workers ought to bear some share of the burden in terms of contributing to superannuation, but there was not a skerrick of a suggestion that that will happen in practice. There was simply a reaffirmation in last night's statement that the whole of the burden will be borne by employers—up to 9 per cent—and some vague waffle about the other 3 per cent being funded by a combination of wage restraint and tax cut trade-offs. We all know that is a fiction. It will clearly be a 12 per cent employer impost within a period of eight years. That is totally unsustainable, about the last thing the Government would ever want if it were serious about economic recovery. To pretend, as people such as Kelty do, that somehow this will not have any inflationary impact, that it will not cost any jobs, is again simply showing breathtaking cynicism.

         One does not have to go through all of the areas in which the Government could have tackled reform, if it had been fair dinkum, to have some idea of the missed opportunities and to understand that this does virtually nothing to address Australia's economic difficulties. Sure, accelerated depreciation is a worthwhile initiative. Sure, there are a few other little bits and pieces around the place. But can anyone seriously suggest that this even amounts to tinkering at the edges? It clearly does not. If the Government is talking about giving business some $2.5 billion worth of assistance over the next five years, when what we have in mind is a fully funded $20 billion worth of concessions and seven tax replacements for business, it is not hard to see that there will be a very real gap between the respective packages. In some ways, it is quite extraordinary that business has not recognised that as yet, but I hope that some of the captains of industry do have some second thoughts and look beyond their noses and realise that if they want to live in a country that is going to turn the corner—not one that is simply going further and further downhill and which will force them offshore—then the economy needs a very great stimulus and not the sort of nonsense that is being put forward by a very desperate Prime Minister.

         —Some of them are even adopting Democrat policy. The major initiative, and other speakers have mentioned this, is the new accelerated depreciation regime. The Government has abandoned the level playing field to an extent—it is a pity it does not apply the same philosophy in the rural sector—and has skewed the tax system slightly towards productive investment. The Prime Minister is claiming that Australia now has a world competitive depreciation regime. But what Mr Keating conveniently did not remember to tell us is that, up until 1988, Australia had a more generous depreciation regime—it was destroyed by him when he was the Treasurer—than the one announced last night. Similarly, the so-called development allowance is basically a less generous yet more targeted investment allowance which was originally introduced by Prime Minister Fraser and axed by level playing field Keating in 1985.

         The first environmentally bad decision is the sales tax reduction for new motor vehicle purchases. It is Democrat policy to tax cars on the basis of their fuel efficiency. The sales tax reduction should apply only to fuel efficient vehicles. This will reduce our consumption and hence our importation of oil, thereby reducing the current account deficit—something which everyone keeps bleating about but does not seem to make the vital connections. The second decision is the increase in the depreciation rate for tourist accommodation from 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. We think the best thing to do is to encourage efficient design by granting the higher rate of depreciation only to energy efficient buildings.

         The infrastructure bonds are an innovative attempt at boosting long term private sector development projects. Whether they will assist the private provision of infrastructure is a moot point. The Government's own figures do not estimate any activity in this area until 1993 or 1994. There are some tax carrots for small business, which we support, the most important being the increase in the capital gains tax exemption for goodwill from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The goodwill exemption was created by the Democrats when the original capital gains tax legislation was passed. Then there is the token measure of delaying this year's first company tax payment for small businesses by nine weeks. I do not think this will do much to usher in a recovery and neither do the small business people, judging by the reception they have given the package.

         Financial deregulation is again championed in this statement. We are to have more foreign banks. These will be allowed to operate at a wholesale level as a branch instead of as a separate subsidiary. This undoubtedly means that the Reserve Bank will not be able adequately to supervise the banks which are operating as branches, not as subsidiaries. We are told that this is okay because foreign central banks will be supervising them. The world has just seen the collapse of a significant international bank, BCCI, which was not prevented by the international monetary authorities. This ideological worship of foreign financial institutions is simply a manifestation of the cultural cringe. Mr Keating made much today in the House of Representatives about our cultural cringe towards Britain, about being bootstraps to the British. I think Mr Keating could well look at his own record in respect of Australia's cultural cringe to foreign investment, to foreign banks.

         The ultimate hypocrisy can be seen in the decision to grant a 10 per cent income tax rate to profits earned by offshore banking units. This approach was explicitly rejected by Mr Keating while he was Treasurer in a press release issued on 1 July 1986. The Government cannot see its way clear to assist the productive industries of the twenty-first century in appropriate individual ways, yet it bends over backwards to cater to unproductive paper shuffling by granting the most generous tax regime possible. Senator Button admitted today that such arrangements had been rorted overseas, especially in Singapore, and that therefore this Government would ensure that the concession was not abused. I think we have to ask: how can we be sure this can be done?

They do not favour, as Senator Alston pointed out, those with the lowest income. They are simply directed to neutralise the proposals of Dr Hewson. Two weeks ago Mr Keating said he would not get into an auction tax with Dr Hewson, but obviously he has not been able to resist the temptation to do so. Mr Keating's priorities are clear. Ordinary workers are promised a maximum income tax rate of 30 per cent in four years, and offshore banking is to face a maximum tax rate of 10 per cent from 1 July this year.

         The most important matter I have been able to identify from my interest in this package is the proposals concerning foreign investment. The Hawke and now Keating governments have successively weakened and liberalised the pathetically meagre controls Australia imposes on foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Review Board is merely a part of Treasury which approves about 98 per cent of the proposals that come before it. The foreign investment decisions contained in the One Nation package are nothing short of scandalous.

Sure, it is in the text, but not a word did he convey to us orally. He did not say it because he knew that the Australian people feel very strongly about this issue. He did not say it because he knew that it was an outrageous proposition. He did it so that the financial markets would continue to give this Government the thumbs up. In this package the Government has proposed that the previous threshold for automatic consideration of proposals by the Foreign Investment Review Board be raised from $5m to $50m. That is an intolerable difference. That means that any business or farm or building worth less than $50m can be bought by foreign interests without any assessment of the effects of that purchase.

         The first person I want to talk about was Werner Baer, who has been properly described as an elder statesman of classical music in Australia. He died on 28 January, aged 77, after a long illness. Mr Baer, who lived in Castlecrag, was an outstanding accompanist, organist, lecturer, choir conductor and composer, a former ABC music supervisor for New South Wales and a founding musical director of the Sydney Jewish Choral Society. He also played the organ for me, for which I was always grateful, at my first wedding, which was 29 years ago last week.

         Werner Baer was born of middle class Jewish parents and grew up in Berlin in the 1920s. When he was aged only 3 1/2, his mother heard him naming the notes as the piano tuner struck the keys. At six he went to his first opera, which was the marvellous Mozart opera

          Cosi Fan Tutte

When Japan entered World War II, he naturally left Thailand. He came to Australia and enlisted in what was then known as the Army Labour Corps.

         There are various sides of Werner Baer. He was a person who unfortunately did not enjoy good health. There are those who have taken the view that sometimes he could be a little hard to get on with, perhaps because of these successive illnesses. Some people did see him as perhaps a little bit of a martinet, irascible and prone to flashes of temper. I would say that to an extent, though, he set such high standards himself that he did have difficulty putting up with people who did not meet those high standards. I must say that everyone who was in contact with him had the highest possible regard for him.

He was the first person to play the Canberra carillon. He was the Australian expert on carillons. When John Gordon was an arts undergraduate in 1932, he began his unique 59-year association with Sydney University and its carillon as a skilled performer, composer, arranger, teacher and author. In fact, his 1928 treatise,

         In the first place, the $43m alleged cuts is in fact largely due not to cuts in the arts at all.

         We point out in the GST package that the delivery of $53m in arts money through the Australia Council costs $8.6m to administer.

Quite frankly, I would rather see arts money going to the arts and not to the arts bureaucrats—not to the people running the Australia Council. Some of them are very good, but it does not mean that they should get a bigger and bigger proportion of the arts dollar, and that is what is happening.

All the rest suffered funding cuts, with the exception of course of the Australia Council's own Council programs, such as the Donald Horne talkfest—which strikes me as maybe being worth while but not at the expense of arts money.

These talkfests may be of great intellectual stimulus to some people, but to my mind they are an improper diversion of arts money away from the arts. That is the area that I said was to be cut. There are to be no cuts to arts grants. Yet we have Ms Fatin complaining about my plan to cut arts funding by $43m. Maybe she was mistakenly looking at a whole lot of other things. Maybe she was lumping in the cuts to the Australian National Gallery, the National Library, the National Museum of Australia and the National Maritime Museum. That must have been what it was. If she was, she was being equally dishonest because the cuts there are cuts to capital programs in 1994—in other words, after those programs have basically been completed anyway. It was a clear warning to those organisations that in a recession they cannot expect to keep getting capital programs funded.

         If Ms Fatin meant that, it might have been a nice idea if she had been honest and said so, but to present that as arts funding cuts is a disgrace and she ought to be ashamed of herself. Maybe she was looking at another section—film. There is no doubt that there will be some cuts in the area of film. In fact, under the Government's funding programs there is to be a significant cut in grants to film in the coming years unless the Government changes its mind which, quite frankly, I expect it to do. But what I had said was that the Opposition would support the continuing Government policy, which was to diminish the role played by grants in funding Australian films and increase the proportion provided by way of tax incentives to those people prepared to invest in Australian film.

         —If she is being blatantly political, without a care for the welfare of her portfolio, then maybe that is the motive that is involved. But it is extraordinary. I have said that, instead of facing this cut in grants of $75m, which would proceed if the Government's policy did not change, I was going to limit the cut to $20m under the Fightback package. That is exactly what I have said. I said that the coalition government will accelerate the rationalisation and privatisation of the film industry and its financing as it no longer needs to depend so heavily on Commonwealth funds. I said that this follows our overall policy commitment to freeing industry from government intervention and dependence. With grants totalling almost $112m, including the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, plus considerable tax expenditures worth more than about $20m, film receives 50 per cent more government grants than all other arts in Australia combined.

         The Government's policy of reducing direct funding is now being reviewed before the expiry of the present grants program next year. To avoid undue disruption to the industry during its transition period, the coalition will limit the reduction in direct assistance to $20m in the first instance. This will be reviewed subsequently. I then said that in addition Film Australia would be privatised and so on and that total savings in film in terms of direct grants would be $27m.

         Maybe what Mrs Fatin has done is added all these together—the end of the capital works program for the Australian National Gallery and all those other museums, libraries and so on—added up the film situation where we are limiting the fall to $20m instead of the Government's Budget figure of $75m, added up the $4m only of cuts to administration and to the non-arts activities of the Australia Council and come up with this magic $43m.

         There may be one other excuse she might have for misrepresenting the facts or distorting the truth or falsely representing the coalition's figures.

What I find intolerable is organisations which receive funding through the Australia Council, allegedly for arts purposes, using that money to run blatant, dishonest political attacks on the coalition's arts policy. If organisations such as that think it is their moral duty to spend taxpayers' money which is directed towards the arts in that kind of political dishonest smearing of my policy, then I will say to those organisations that they underline the need for arts money to be redirected back to the arts, instead of their being diverted for political stunts supported by a member of the Parliament in a Ministry in a disgraceful comment to a newspaper. Exactly the same figure is used; exactly the same nonsense is spoken. It is funded by this Government, funded through the Australia Council, diverted away from the arts to which the money should be directed. Ms Fatin should be ashamed of herself.

         —I should like to take a few minutes to raise a matter which has had some considerable publicity in recent days in Tasmania. The recent attacks on environmentalists who are blockading the road in the Picton area in Tasmania are not isolated incidents, as readers of most of Tasmania's newspapers might have assumed. These attacks are instead part of a pattern of violence and harassment that has been present in the area near Geeveston in southern Tasmania for many months. The so-called `greenies' who are now in the area have simply become an easy and very public target for the sorts of vandalism and harassment which have been taking place and which were directed at other people previously. The State Government's inaction in regard to the attacks—and both the Field and Groom governments have to take some responsibility—has in effect given consent to the activities of local thugs.

         One relevant fact is that the tourist group Tasmanian Expeditions has experienced considerable harassment while taking tourists into the Picton area. This group used to camp overnight at the Tahune Reserve before a day's rafting on the Picton River. The groups have been frequently kept awake by a gang who would get drunk, shout verbal abuse at the tourists, throw beer cans at them and urinate on the camping area.

         In early December last year this behaviour became so serious that one guide left the reserve in a mini-bus to call the police. He was chased by cars, which attempted to force him off the road, ramming the bus several times. The tour operator is trying to press charges, but has met some resistance from the police in the area. He has had to be very persistent just to get someone to come from Launceston, a considerable distance, to take evidence such as paint scrapings, headlight glass embedded in the bumper bar and that sort of thing. Several people are able and willing to identify the people involved in the attack—they know who it was. The operator no longer camps in the area because of the risks involved, and instead stays at a youth hostel, which means extra travelling and expense for him.

         Only a fortnight ago when this tourist group stayed at a cabin near the river the same gang of thugs appeared again, shouting and jumping on the rafts that were to be used. They were chased off to the other side of the river, where they started throwing rocks. One rock went through a camper's tent and struck a person inside. All these incidents have been reported to the police and to the Ministers responsible for tourism and police. The operator, Mr Lars Winberg, says he has no faith in the willingness of the police to do anything about this. They know who does this but no action is taken.

         Mr Charlie Brignell from Wandering Albatross, another group, had a group of guides on a training camp in the Tahune Reserve in late November last year. This group was also abused by the gang; the incident included shots being fired into the air. Now when they take tourists into the area they do not stay overnight if there is any sign of this gang. He feels that reporting it to the police is useless because they will do nothing, and indeed have done nothing when other operators have reported similar attacks. Mr Brignell says that there is also concern about recriminations from the gang if they are reported.

         The situation now is that there are some people who are protesting about forest activity in the area. The protesters who are at the blockade which has been established there are also convinced that this violence is not new and is not happening just because the protesters are in the area. The tourist operators are justifiably angry that nothing has been done previously. They have expressed real concern that it will not be long before somebody takes the law into his own hands and people will be seriously hurt.

According to the preliminary accounts of News Corporation for 1990-91, the interests of all News Corporation subsidiaries in the Australia/Pacific basin reported earnings before interest and tax of $332m (down $94m on the previous year). Some of these subsidiaries are involved in activities other than print and electronic media. It is not possible to establish from these accounts the amount of tax paid to the Australian Taxation Office by these Australian/Pacific Basin interests.
