         —The Prime Minister has nothing at all to apologise for for the way in which he conducted himself on behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian nation when he was overseas. His trip was an admirably successful one and demonstrated in a very dignified and very effective way the kind of contribution that Australia can be expected to make to the region in the future as, indeed, it has done in recent years. It did a great deal to cement the bilateral relationships between Australia and Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. From all the feedback that I have had, that was exactly the way in which the trip was regarded by all the key people in those countries.

         There is no question of diminishing Australia's stature by raising, as Mr Keating did, the question of Australia's identity in the region. This is an issue that many Australian Ministers, including myself, have raised on a number of occasions in a number of forums right around the Asian region because it is crucial to our future—one directed towards securing effective engagement with Asia—that we both perceive ourselves to be part of this region and we be perceived by others to be part of this region. It is an entirely legitimate issue to raise in that particular context of how we present ourselves to the region and what kind of identity and what kind of image we present.

         It is not a matter of washing dirty domestic political linen in an overseas context, which is something for which the Opposition parties were absolutely notorious when in government. It was not a matter of Mr Keating doing anything as crude as Dr Hewson in Papua New Guinea—formally presenting an Australian flag to Mr Namaliu with an accompanying comment that he was not going to be doing anything thereby to diminish Australian authority and responsibility. That was a crude and undignified incursion of squalid domestic politics into an international sphere.

         What Mr Keating did was raise the issue a couple of times quietly in his discussion with officials. He did not raise the issue of the flag publicly, except in answer to a question at a forum of people in Indonesia when, in response to a specific question, he gave a specific and frank answer—no different to the kind of answer that he has given on a dozen occasions on this issue in Australia. There was nothing new in what he said. That answer was greeted with fascinated attention by his audience and, indeed, a storm of applause when he had completed it. He made the point very effectively indeed.

         On the question of aid and human rights, we had a pathetic attempt a little while ago by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to try to carve out some separate high moral ground distinct from the Australian Government by suggesting that so far as the Opposition was concerned human rights should be the fundamental criterion which applied in determining whether aid was directed to particular countries. When we look at his text further, it becomes absolutely apparent that Dr Hewson's position on this issue is no different from that of the Australia Government, which is that this issue about the conditionality of aid needs to be treated on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the human rights incursions that are involved and whether or not they represent a deliberate act of the executive government concerned.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is a very obvious difference, for example, between the Tiananmen situation, which was a deliberate act of state policy which justified a withdrawal of Australian aid; the situation in Burma, which represents, again, a deliberate act of state policy at the highest levels and which again justified a withdrawal of aid; and the situation of the Dili massacre last November which on nobody's analysis involved a deliberate act of high state policy directed from Jakarta. That is the kind of case by case judgment we make. There are many other examples that one can offer.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of course it is the case that in other aspects of aid delivery we do take human rights questions very closely into account. In the design and the construction of particular programs and projects we take human rights issues, like the role of women, into account in the formulation of policy. We take very much into account the effectiveness of aid in aiding and abetting the victims of human rights discrimination in the way in which aid is delivered.

         So there are many ways in which human rights principles, foreign policy and the policy of aid do intersect. It is just a squalid, politically motivated nonsense to claim that there is some significant difference in the way in which the Government and Opposition respectively approach these issues. So, if the Opposition were a little bit more honest and a little bit more consistent about these matters, it would have a lot more credibility in the eyes of the community of Australia than it does at the moment.

         May I say that from my own experience of many discussions on these sorts of issues around the region, both in years past and more recently since this issue has been raised, I am in no doubt whatsoever of the absolute accuracy of Mr Keating's perceptions about the utility of such a change in terms of the way in which we would be regarded around the region. It is not a matter of anyone, in the absence of the issue being raised, having any particularly strong views about it. But it is certainly a matter of people responding very favourably, very warmly, very positively and very understandingly to the kind of policy change that Mr Keating is suggesting, which may present to the region a very different face of Australia from that which we have had in the past with assistance from the forelock tugging grovellers who are lined up opposite.

         The Chamber and the industry are united in the view that imported second-hand cars threaten the future of the automotive industry in this country. The crucial question about the automotive industry in this country relates to the issue of tariffs generally. The Government's policy, which was announced in March 1991, was based on a report of the Industry Commission after a complete inquiry which recommended phasing down to a 15 per cent tariff by the year 2000. It is only the Opposition that sees fit to depart from a recommendation of the Industry Commission in respect of this matter.

The supplementary question about that is `Why?'. The answer to that question is that automotive industries around the world depend on volume and we do not have sufficient volumes in this country to have a fully competitive automotive industry. We may get there, but we are not there yet. That is something which I think the Opposition ought to take account of. The Opposition has to find its model for this zero tariff proposal somewhere and it cannot find it anywhere in the manufacturing world in respect of automotive manufacturers.

         In March last year the Government announced tariff arrangements for the industry which will see a phase down in protection to the year 2000. It accepted the recommendations of the Industry Commission report. It is a real challenge to the industry to meet the additional competition from imports which it will now face as a result of reduced tariffs. The phase down in tariffs was decided at a time when the Government did not envisage large scale imports of second-hand vehicles from Japan.

         If one could translate the 20,000 reduction in new car production in New Zealand into the Australian market—and I agree that it is a speculative exercise—it would represent something like 80,000 to 100,000 cars. The Government will not let second-hand imports jeopardise employment in the Australian car industry. As I said on 3 December, we will impose a tariff on second-hand cars brought into Australia at high volume and, if that tariff is not sufficient, then further action will be taken by the Government in due course.

         What that means is that the Industrial Relations Commission is abandoned. What that means is that the award system that has served Australians well in having an independent umpire determine minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for Australian workers is abandoned and set aside. What this system means is that the national wage case, which corrects wages for economic adjustments over time, is set aside, abandoned and no longer occurs. What this system, the Hewson system, means is that once again we would see the spectacle in this country, as we did during the Fraser years, of a government making war on that section of the Australian community that happens to be members of trade unions.

         What Mr Howard has said is disingenuous in the extreme. He has said that the Opposition would retain the arbitration commission where both parties agree to do so. That means that where an unscrupulous employer agrees not to do so, that unscrupulous employer has the power of veto and, therefore, the worker in that situation has no access to the Commission. That is disingenuous. It pretends that somehow or other the Opposition supports the Commission system by the use of smart lawyer-like language, but the intent is to encourage employers to veto access to the Commission, veto access to the umpire, and prevent there being fair determinations made in particular circumstances.

        Events of 6 April: Conclusions
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        11. Ministers directed senior officials of responsible departments and agencies to investigate what went wrong and report to them. Mr Peter Kennedy, Deputy Public Service Commissioner, assisted with aspects of this process.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        12. Officials found that the major reason for the failure of protective procedures was that critical information was not communicated promptly enough or in sufficient detail to the right people to trigger appropriate responses, and that as a result the decisions made and actions taken by those to whom information was provided, in the event, were either insufficient or inappropriate. Particular conclusions were that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . The Iranian Embassy gave timely advice by speaking to the APS at 2.54 am on 6 April, in accordance with standing guidelines to diplomatic missions, of a possible threat to their security. The APS responded to this advice by increasing patrols and by advising the AFP at 3.33 a.m. They did not advise DFAT until 8.40 am, nor did they advise the PSCC.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . The AFP responded by increasing patrols from 3.50 am. They did not advise ASIO until 8.30 am nor did they advise the PSCC.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . News accessible by 2.44 am from the international wire service AAP (subscribed to by DFAT, ASIO, and AFP) included information that Iranian embassies in a number of western countries had been attacked. This, coupled with the initial Iranian Embassy request for additional security at 2.54 am, suggested the possibility of a coordinated campaign worldwide against Iranian diplomatic representation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . Officers in some agencies became aware during the morning of media reports of attacks on Iranian Embassies. Nobody in any of four agencies aware of the request from the Iranian Embassy (APS, AFP, DFAT and ASIO) advised the PSCC, and thus initiated the process of coordinated consultation on the need for increased security.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . The AFP contacted ASIO about the advice from the Embassy and about a media report of attacks on Iranian embassies overseas, but spoke to the ACT Regional Office rather than Central Office.

       </para>

         So far as Mr Vinnicombe is concerned, let there be no doubt about the results of his tests—they were positive. The sample was collected in accordance with International Olympic Committee standards and was tested at an IOC accredited laboratory. However, the test did not meet the stricter requirements of the ASDA legislation which formed the basis of the recent court action by Mr Vinnicombe. This, I understand, is what led to the recent problems in the Vinnicombe case. That is why the Minister for Sport, Mrs Kelly, approved drafting instructions on 12 April to amend the ASDA Act so that ASDA can officially recognise the results of tests conducted by other agencies when those tests are conducted in accordance with internationally accepted protocols.

Even that is a relatively gentle insult in terms of what might be said on these occasions. I make no judgment at all about the position on this issue of either the Australian community generally or the returned services community in particular. Everyone will have individual views on this matter. I think it is a reaction of extraordinary arrogance for the Opposition in general and Senator Bishop in particular to pretend that they are claiming to speak for a constituency with one voice on this issue. I am sure there are many different voices.

In light of these figures, is the Minister prepared to stop all further tariff cuts, including the proposed tariff reduction for sugar, and to use tariffs strategically, that is, to provide time and resources to boost our import replacement capacity through specific incentives, to protect regional industries and to protect workers and their families, even when it becomes necessary to phase out over time certain industries and to redirect resources?

         Senator Spindler essentially asked whether this Government will not proceed with its announced tariff reduction for sugar in July of this year. The answer to that question is no. He asked about a wide range of other tariff reductions and whether we can somehow strategically use the tariff system to advance the special sectoral interests of the Australian industrial community and so on. I do not believe that we can do that. I do not believe that there are valid intellectual reasons for seeking to do that.

         The assumption in the question is that tariff protection—the question contains the word `protection'—protects jobs. The fundamental flaw in that argument in a contemporary world is that the thing which reduces jobs in particular industries and diverts them into other industries is changes in technology, not artificial tariff protection. If we look at the major changes in job and employment patterns which have taken place in Australia in the last few years, they are essentially due to changes in technology, not to changes in tariff protection.

         For years of high tariff protection in this country industries such as the motor vehicle industry kept losing jobs. The industry lost more jobs under the Liberal Government, which had enormously high tariffs in the motor vehicle industry, than it has lost under this Government's motor vehicle plan. There are reasons for that: it has become inherently uncompetitive and lazy. A whole range of behavioural considerations follow for industries which are protected by high tariffs.

That would send the average worker, the average employee, in this country broke. But with a system of tariffs which help direct industry into areas in which it can compete by quality, fashion, design or particular characteristics related to raw materials and so on we can achieve positive results.

        newspaper carried an article by a Peter Chiltern concerning so-called raids made by the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Taxation Office upon the offices of the Unemployed Workers Union in Launceston on 19 March. The article makes a number of observations about the way in which the so-called raid was conducted, including that police allegedly refused to provide any reason for the raid and an allegation that the operation was regarded by police as a fishing expedition. Not to put too fine a point on it, the article seeks to leave the impression that the operation was a vindictive, politically inspired act taken without good cause. The article then goes on to state:

        Mr Keating went to Indonesia with a planned program to denigrate the Constitution, the flag and the heritage of this country because he thought it could serve him some domestic benefit back here in the home constituency. Never before has an Australian Prime Minister behaved in that way: gone to a foreign country and talked down our Constitution and those symbols of Australia that are important to so many Australians and under which Australians have died. The Prime Minister did this for his own domestic political purposes. In some way—and beyond the competence of most—he believes, in Senator Evans's terms, that that is the way to cement our relationships within this region.

        The issue was raised, in equally interesting terms, in Canada in the mid-1960s. It generated an equally strident debate, spread over several years, involving very rowdy Party discussions and very comprehensive assaults on the integrity of the Government of the kind that we have heard today. In the result, a new flag was adopted by Canada in 1964 which has done immense things to generate a sense of national unity and national pride in that country. It has given that country an extraordinarily strong identity in the world at large. It is something that, a very few years after the event, no single Canadian would have been prepared for a moment to change.

We need to have a debate, a public discussion, spread over an appropriate period of time, culminating, as the Prime Minister said today, in some appropriate test of public opinion. No Australian government, certainly not this one, would act to change the flag without clear evidence of public support.

        We are looking for some sensible process, some extended discussion, taking place to enable this debate to occur in the proper, sensible context in which it should occur. This kind of reflex jumping to attention because some pavlovian bell has been rung, because some ancient Tory symbol is thought to be put at risk by some remarks that the Prime Minister has made in a positive and constructive sense, does no credit whatsoever to the Opposition. It does not, in any sense, amount to the kind of matter which needs to be debated under this procedure today. The Government rejects this motion.

If the Prime Minister has some concern about his identity as an Australian, it is appropriate to discuss that in Australia and to involve himself in that debate, but it is quite inappropriate—and I agree entirely with Senator Hill on this point—for him to go to Indonesia and discuss those matters before other people.

I would like to contribute briefly to this debate because I, along with Senator Tambling, come from the one part of Australia where we do have a symbol. If I could be forgiven at this point for referring to the Northern Territory as a State—or at least equating it with a State, as it will certainly one day become—we have a State flag in the Northern Territory which is the only flag in Australia that does not have the Union Jack on it, and a very attractive symbol it has become.

        The decision deliberately not to have a Union Jack on it was taken, to his credit, by the now President of the Queensland Liberal Party, Paul Everingham, when he was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.

It will not be done by calling for a competition.

It is an irritant to me—and I freely confess it—that 90 years after gaining so-called independence from Great Britain we still, as the most prominent feature of our own flag, fly the flag of another nation.

Indeed when I was the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory at the time I publicly supported him for having a flag that did not have—and it is the only State flag that does not have—the Union Jack on it. We did not have a competition to design the flag. The Northern Territory Government simply employed a very prominent Australian, Robert Ingpen, to design it, and there was our flag—black, white and ochre with, I am pleased to say, the Southern Cross still on it. I support Senator Parer there; the one thing I want to see remain on our flag is the Southern Cross, which is so distinctive and internationally designates this country and New Zealand.

I personally favour the suggestion by the National Flag Committee of removing the Union Jack from our Flag and lifting the Commonwealth Star into a central position and then leaving it as it is. It would then be a matter for debate as to whether it remains the existing blue and white—which I would not worry about personally; I think they are quite appropriate colours—or whether we should have the green and gold which in recent years have come to symbolise Australia.

        Mr Alcorta has expressed very eloquently the feeling that so many Australians felt on ANZAC Day as thousands of Australians marched through the streets, proudly bearing the Australian national flag, and proud to say that it is the flag for which comrades have died. This is the same flag that was tenderly created by inmates of the Changi prisoner-of-war camp on the pain and penalty of punishment and death. They stitched together with bamboo needles from the pieces of rag that they managed to gather a replica of the national flag, a flag of which they can be proud.

        I am sorry for members of the Labor Party who have no identity, who feel that they are wandering lost souls. I am sorry that we have sent the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)—a boy on a man's errand—to try to negotiate and strengthen our ties in our own region. I am ashamed of this boy on a man's errand who does not know the difference between diplomacy and being able to speak with the voice of authority of a nation that respects him. I do not respect the Prime Minister for what he has done, and thousands upon thousands of other Australians feel angered, as I feel angered.

        I say in all sincerity that the Labor Party has made a bad error of judgment, for very political purposes, to try to camouflage the fact that this is the lot who brought us the recession we had to have, who gave us a million unemployed, who single-handedly lowered the standard of living of ordinary Australians, and who now want to change the flag. Why? Do not change the flag; change the Government.

        We are a proud people. I know I am Australian; other Australians know that they are Australian. There is no conflict. There is no lack of identity. We are not like Canada, which had a problem with half of its people French and half of them English, living on the border of the United States, who needed to try to say that they were something different. We are an entity of our own with a constitution that makes us the oldest constitutional democracy in the world. I am proud of the heritage and the British institutions that have established a tolerant society—one that has allowed Senator Collins to be proud of a flag in his Territory.

This is a Parliament that is for Australians and Australians only. Senator Collins has made a bad error of judgment, because Australians, whether they have been here five minutes or five generations, are proud of their identity and proud of the symbols that represent others who have served and made sacrifices on their part.

        —Senator Collins calls it jingoistic simply because he has not found, within himself, that he is certain who he is. He wanders aimless in the desert, just like his policies, and he cannot acknowledge the suffering and the sacrifice that has been made in the name of our flag, which represents our traditions and our roots. I feel sorry for him. But he will not re-educate me to agree with his lost cause. Indeed, the whole notion that he thinks that he can re-educate people is an affront, just as the Prime Minister has affronted so many Australians in his sojourn into a foreign place. It is a pity the Prime Minister did not learn his history better before he went.

       The Opposition is taking this further step in relation to the preservation of the existing national flag because it is deeply concerned about the situation that the Government, in particular the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), has created about the future of the Australian national flag and what the Government has in mind in relation to the flag over the next year or two.

        In the short space of time that the Prime Minister has held office, he has raised the issues of Australian nationalism and the monarchy and he has now raised the future of the Australian national flag. Apart from the extraordinary and despicable way in which he has raised it in the last few days—namely, in the course of a visit to a foreign country—he has definitely placed on the agenda for the immediate concern of the Australian people and also, I would have thought, of this Senate, what the Government's intentions are.

        This afternoon we endeavoured in the Senate to find out the order of the Government's program in relation to the future of the flag. We have clear evidence of that from not only the Prime Minister but also from the behaviour and comments of a number of Government senators, including the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). The Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, and Senator Collins have both indicated clearly that the Government has an agenda to change the national flag, and to do so without necessarily having a referendum.

        Any change to the flag would require, of course, an amendment to the Australian National Flags Act. This Parliament would have to make a decision before the flag could be changed. The flag can be changed by this Parliament and such a decision would not require a referendum of the Australian people. Senator Parer's Bill is designed to ensure that a referendum would be required before the Australian national flag could be changed in any respect.

        This is a very important matter. It is important that this principle be established. Senator Collins has agreed that the flag is our principal national symbol.

        Incidentally, I asked Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, whether he would affirm support for the flag. He gave a very delphic answer in which he referred me to the Australian Labor Party constitution. It seems to me that this is a very roundabout way of saying that the flag would be part of a process which would culminate by the year 2001 in a new Constitution for Australia. However, I am not clear what in fact Senator Evans has in mind.

        So this chamber and the nation are left in a complete state of limbo. We know from past polling that a clear majority of Australian people are at present opposed to changing the flag. The Government is equivocating on the way in which the Australian people will be consulted on this most important matter. It is vital and urgent that Senator Parer's Bill, which clarifies this matter, should be brought on for debate forthwith.

        —The Government will be opposing this second motion to suspend Standing Orders for the reasons that I thought were put very succinctly by Senator Coulter, the Leader of the Australian Democrats. This is an important debate. I think I clearly affirmed that when I spoke in an earlier debate on the suspension of Standing Orders. It is going to be a long debate. I hope that as many citizens of this country as possible will participate in this debate which I believe will continue for a significant time. This is what happened in the case of the citizens of Canada. It is instructive to look at the public record of the debate in that country. In 1964 Canada moved to adopt a flag which I personally think is one of the more attractive and distinctive national symbols that exist today.

        For the record, I would like to correct a number of assertions we have heard that are quite wrong. Just a moment ago Senator Durack said that I had indicated some government agenda to change the flag. Of course, I did nothing of the sort. I could hardly have made it more clear that I was simply speaking personally, as I hope most Australians will, on this issue. I was indicating a personal preference for a flag. I thought it was appropriate to point out that in a debate which, I must say, was not fiery at all, we adopted a flag for the Northern Territory. For the first time in Australia the flag of a political entity in this country did not contain the Union Jack. That flag is a very attractive and appropriate national symbol.

        We have heard the nonsense put forward in this debate—and it will continue to be put forward—that nations, for some strange reason, are fixed in time and place. We are told that things never change. This is nonsense. Honourable senators who want to dispute that should refer to the development of the Union Jack itself. They should look at why it came to be called the Union Jack. The same sort of debate—if one likes to call it that—took place when that flag was being put together. They should look at the historical facts. It is nonsense to seriously suggest that an attempt is being made to rewrite Australian history by changing the flag to a more appropriate national symbol. It is also nonsense to suggest that this is some kind of betrayal. I must say that this is one of the cheapest—

        —Well, I may be pathetic but the honourable senator is Ian Macdonald, and that is infinitely worse. It is a piece of utter nonsense to cheapen the debate and reduce it to the lowest common denominator—and this has been done here again this afternoon—by suggesting that this is some kind of betrayal of the service men and women who died while serving under the present flag. Of course, the symbolism contained in the current flag will not be altered. The symbolism will not be removed from the historical record because people think that a change in the flag is more appropriate.

        I repeat, for what it is worth: I think it is a significant irritant to a great many Australians—and I am one of them—that 90 years after we became independent we still have as the most prominent feature on our own flag the flag of another nation. It is absolute nonsense.

        I just want to correct the record in respect of one other matter. In his opening remarks to this debate, Senator Hill made the point—and obviously Senator Hill has not availed himself of the work that has been done in recent years—that we should not be ashamed that this country began as a British colony. I want to point out that, of course, is an absurd piece of nonsense. That, in one sweep of the brush, omits 40,000 years of recorded human occupation of this continent by Aboriginal people. This record can be set against the mere 200 years of European occupation of this country. Indeed, as anyone who has taken the trouble to have a look will know, we are talking about a complex and sophisticated community involving interrelationships, extremely complex languages and ceremonial customs that have existed for thousands of years prior to European occupation of this country.

        —If there were one reason why it is urgent to bring forward Senator Parer's Flag Amendment Bill for debate, that reason was contained in the answer given today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, to a question asked by Senator Parer. Senator Button was asked to give an unequivocal commitment that the Australian flag would not be changed without there being a referendum held of the Australian people. He was given the opportunity twice to commit the Government to that course of action. He deliberately and very obviously refused on both occasions to give such a commitment. That is what the core of Senator Parer's Bill goes to. The purpose of the Bill is to prevent changes to Australia's national flag occurring without the prior consent of the Australian people through a referendum.

        I remind the Senate that an identical Bill was passed by the Senate in 1984. It was a Bill introduced by Senator Durack. Its passage through the House of Representatives, of course, was frustrated by the then Hawke Government. It did not want to have a bar of the Bill but this Senate did pass that Bill in 1984. I introduced an identical Bill in 1987 which lay on the table until after the 1990 election. Senator Parer's Bill is the third, if you like, of the trio.

        One has to ask why the Government is refusing to allow such a course of action; why it is refusing to allow debate on a Bill to do just that at this time. The reason appears to be tied up very much with the actions of the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in terms of the way he seems to want to run his government and the directions in which he wants to lead this country because what he is doing, almost every time he gets to his feet—be it in Australia or in foreign places—is raising issues which divide this nation.

        I want to remind senators opposite about the present flag. First of all, this myth that every Australian soldier from 1901 died under the present flag is an absolute furphy, an absolute fraud. If the soldiers in the First World War had a flag when they stormed Gallipoli, it was purely the Union Jack. It was not the flag of Australia. If they had another flag, it would overwhelmingly have been the red ensign—not the flag with a blue background. Through most of the First World War it was very seldom, if at all, that Australians fought under the present flag.

        In the Second World War, the blue ensign flew on a few occasions. I must say that Sir Robert Menzies, when he was Prime Minister, did give an indication that he thought it would be appropriate. But, overwhelmingly, Australian servicemen in the Second World War fought under a different flag from the one we have today. They were under the red ensign or the Union Jack again. So it has only been since 1953 that the flag those opposite all want to die in the ditch for has been the official flag of Australia.

Six weeks ago John Howard said, `Let's go back to the `50s, to the golden age'. Now the Opposition wants to go back to the nineteenth century.

        One of the interesting things I have noted in recent times is that at sporting events when Australians want to hold up a symbol of Australia, we end up with all sorts of other symbols—not the Australian flag. For the America's Cup in 1983, it was a kangaroo on a green background. That was shown all over the world as Australia's flag. Even in the recent cricket World Cup, people were showing bastardised versions of the Australian flag in other colours because, at the same ground, British supporters were waving the Union Jack. I want to remind people opposite that about a year or so ago when the Australian netball team won the world championship in Sydney, there was a photograph in the paper the next day showing the victorious team standing in front of the Australian flag. The only thing you could see was the Union Jack. It was as though Great Britain had won the world championship, not the Australian team. That was the photograph that went all around the world; an image of another country.

The coalition is falling apart on tariff policy. This Bill is a diversion of attention from the fact that the coalition is being wagged by the Queensland National Party. Braithwaite has resigned, Ronny Boswell has won the day, and the coalition is falling apart. It is 1987 all over again and we will win the next election as a result.

        The matter of urgency relates to the behaviour of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is taking Australia back to the isolationist xenophobia of the Labor Party's origins. As Senator Coulter said earlier in the day, he finds the behaviour of the Prime Minister absolutely inappropriate; the way he is flaunting his personal insecurity. I agree with that completely. I have never seen a public figure make a public display of personal insecurity the way this man is doing. It is certainly correct when Mr Keating says he does not feel an Australian.

To go and run what is a very personal argument of his about our national status and standing when he is a guest in another country—and in Indonesia in particular—is absolutely indescribably counterproductive for Australia's interests. He cannot claim that it is probably the first time he has been to Indonesia. He should have been advised by people like Senator Evans and Foreign Affairs officials that Indonesia, with its Javanese culture, is a country above all others where the subtleties of behaviour are of prime importance. To do what he did has put Australia back in its relationships with that country for decades.

Keating has learnt from his well-funded research programs that in the marginal electorates—which those in the Labor Party are masters of winning and dominating in an election—there is a high migrant population of non-British stock. The Prime Minister has put two and two together and made five. He has  decided that, if he opposes everything that is associated with the United Kingdom and our history, then he will win votes in the electorate at the next election.

        I have a little bit of advice for Mr Keating. In February this year I wrote to every newspaper, radio station and every other media outlet in Queensland. I enclosed a form asking people to write to me stating their views on the retention of the Australian flag. I received more than 2,000 responses and they are still coming in. They came from all age groups, all ethnic groups and all parts of the State. The result was that, out of over 2,000 responses, a staggering 84 per cent of people in Queensland were in favour of the retention of the Australian flag; 16 per cent wanted it changed.

        The advice I would give Mr Keating is that, if he wants to change the flag in the face of all the polling results, he must go to a referendum. If he finds the majority of people want to change the flag, then he can run his design competition. However, until he holds that referendum, any change is not in the interests of the Australian people and I believe will be opposed by the majority of them to his political detriment.

        —In speaking to this motion, Senator Collins said that we were going to engage in a very long process and one which would give us endless opportunities for future debate. I draw his attention to a statement made by his ministerial colleague the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) in a radio program this morning. He was asked:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       How many have you got in the warehouse?
      </para>
      <para>
       They were referring to Australian flags. The question continues:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       I mean, you're not going to be caught with a couple of hundred thousand outdated flags on your hands, are you?
      </para>
      <para>
       To which the keeper of the flag, Senator Bolkus replied:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I think the flag has served its purpose over the years. But even if we do have some in stock, I am sure that they could be quite useful as memorabilia in places.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further on he said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       I think, basically, the situation Australia's in at the moment is that we are quickly moving towards a new flag and I welcome it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Bolkus does not mention the long process that Senator Collins promises and none of the endless opportunities for debate.

        I would certainly draw the attention of many people to the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Indonesia, in Papua New Guinea and in Australia in recent days when he invited children to design new flags and look at them differently. It is very obvious that Prime Minister Keating is only placating the Left faction within his own Party.

       The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.

      <para font-size="-=2">
       Your petitioners pray that the Senate in parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in vitro fertilisation. IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. One in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1,500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

         The Opposition's concerns with these regulations arose from the changes in the Medicare Benefits Schedule to the fees for optometrical and ophthalmic items.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There are two major changes in the regulations that concern the Opposition.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         First, the regulations provide for a reduction in the Medicare Benefits Schedule rebate paid to ophthalmologists to the same level of reimbursement paid to optometrists. Where a consultation is performed by an ophthalmologist and a refraction test is involved, the rebate will be the same as for a refraction test by an optometrist. This means a reduction in the rebate in cases where a consultation by an ophthalmologist results in the issuing of a prescription for glasses or contact lenses.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government defends the change to bring the payment for refraction testing by ophthalmologists into line with that for optometrists on the grounds that it is in line with the principle of equal pay for equal work and that there is little justification for the difference in the fee. Our concerns stem from the greater legal liability and educational qualifications of ophthalmologists.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Ophthalmologists follow a similar pattern of training as other medical practitioners and complete a six year medical degree followed by six years of specialist training. Optometrists undertake a 4 year degree to achieve a Bachelor of Science with study in clinical optometry and general medicine. The fourth year includes clinical experience.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It would also appear that there is a greater legal liability on ophthalmologists. As medical practitioners, ophthalmologists are subject to the same legal liability for medical misdiagnosis, misconduct etc.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The second item in the regulations causing concern is that from 1 December 1991 a new item number has been included in the optometrical schedule. This enables initial consultations to be separated from second consultations when carried out within a 24 month period of the first. Previously, both consultations were claimed under the one item number.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This means a rebate for a second initial consultation can be claimed within 24 months of the initial consultation where the patient has one of the conditions as set down in the Medicare Benefits Schedule.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Coalition is concerned that a number of the categories of ocular conditions covered in the regulations are outside the scope of optometrists. There is doubt as to whether some of the medical conditions are within the scope of both the educational and legislative ability of optometrists. However, optometrists have argued that this change only formalises the circumstances in which they have been operating.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is for these reasons that the Opposition gave notice of a motion for disallowance to give it greater time to consult with the industry, the Minister and his department, and also to give the Opposition the opportunity to debate the matter in the Senate.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         What a mistake we made in thinking that Minister Howe would respond to our concerns regarding the provision of ophthalmic and optometrical services. We received no response to our concerns, but instead the Minister issued a news release claiming our move was a threat to Medicare and we were playing politics with patients.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, the Opposition's move has met with success as I believe the Minister has consulted with the profession in relation to the concerns the Opposition hold regarding the second initial consultation for optometrists.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         At no time did the Opposition ever intend to disallow the regulations and prevent the payment of medicare rebates to Australians. Our intention and concerns had clearly been outlined by both Dr Woods, Shadow Minister for Health, and Dr Hewson. The only one trying cheap political stunts was the Minister, Mr Howe.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In fact, only the Coalition's concerns were directed at ensuring the best delivery of ophthalmic and optometrical services.

          The report of the Resource Assessment Commission is a comprehensive document and should be considered in detail by all honourable senators, and in fact by all people interested in this debate. In particular, I draw attention to Volume 1 where, under the heading `Improvements in Intergovernmental Processes', paragraph 1.269 states:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Forest Conservation and Development Bill, if it is enacted, should help to simplify assessment procedures, but only for selected projects. The Inquiry's main concern with the proposed legislation is that it applies only to projects with a threshold value of $100m.

There is certainly a need for the Government to comprehensively pick up many of the recommendations of the Resource Assessment Commission. Senator Cook, in his summary on the legislation at the end of the second reading debate, alluded to many issues that the Government wanted to address. But at that time we knew that the Government wished to pursue ahead at all costs without amending this legislation. That action is now seriously called into question.

However, I must point out to Senator Tambling that the Resource Assessment Commission has actually said that this legislation is unnecessary. If one reads the report comprehensively, one will note that it indicates that the legislation really is unnecessary and should not be supported.

          The report is without doubt the most comprehensive and detailed review of the Australian forests and timber industries yet conducted. For well over two years, the Resource Assessment Commission has listened to and thoroughly explored the arguments of advocates from all corners of the debate.

          In this report, the Resource Assessment Commission is thoroughly dismissive of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 now before the Senate—the so-called resource security legislation. Yet negotiations between the Government and the Opposition are still going on in an attempt to secure its passage. I can only hope that these talks are just a continuation of the charade of the past few weeks, with the Government and Opposition desperately trying to avoid being blamed for the likely and inevitable defeat of this Bill. If, however, an agreement is about to be reached, then this report will have been a total—and I stress total—waste of resources and we can kiss goodbye to the ecologically sustainable management of our native forests.

          The Commission concluded that the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, if passed, `will entrench the current practice of reactive project-by-project assessment'. This is the fundamental flaw in the legislation. The Commission's preferred alternative is `cooperative, integrated, prospective'—and I stress that word prospective—`regional assessments' of natural values.

          The key word here is regional. So rather than frantically examining a forest area only when it is proposed to be logged, we need regional assessments which are divorced from specific project proposals. Only then will we have a solid basis for the ecologically sustainable management of our forest resources. Indeed, this approach should underpin the management of all our natural resources.

          The Commission has dealt another blow to the resource security legislation in its finding that, `the establishment of a bleached eucalypt craft mill seems a prospect only in Tasmania', and even there it would preclude other uses of the very large areas of forest needed to feed the mill, possibly including saw log production. The Commission notes that:

         There are aspects of this report that the Democrats have considerable difficulty with, particularly the findings that logging in native forests should continue and that State forest management agencies have implemented sustained yield management strategies. If they have that is certainly a very recent development.

          I make this point to highlight the fact that the Commission did not adopt the conservation movement's agenda in reaching its conclusions. Indeed, the Commission has remained at arms' length from all parties to the protracted national dispute over forest policy. Nevertheless, it has found nothing to commend the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, and has proposed a comprehensive and realistic alternative which would seem to the Democrats to be a substantial step forward towards ecologically sustainable management of our native forests. Accordingly, I look forward to this evening's debate and to the Opposition joining with the Democrats to defeat this very flawed legislation.

          —The final three volumes of the report of the Resource Assessment Commission are substantial by any assessment that any person might make. Mr Justice Stewart, the Chairperson of the RAC, suggests in his preface that it was clear from the outset that the Commission's task was demanding and complex. He said that never had such a wide-ranging inquiry into forest and timber matters been commissioned before.

          In my view this report debunks a few of the popular theories about forestry in Australia; for example, the definition of old growth forests. The report says that there is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes old growth forests and that the inquiry had attempted to clarify the use of the term. The report then went on to recommend that the use of the term old growth be reserved for forests that are both negatively disturbed and ecologically mature and have high conservation and intangible values.

          That definition will put into perspective the countless dozens of forests that conservation groups like to term old growth. But the Resource Assessment Commission also supports continuation of timber production. The Commission also made the point that, on its definition, very few forests can be classed as old growth.

          As far as resource security is concerned, the inquiry was of the view that the Commonwealth Government's Forest Conservation and Development Bill—which we are going to debate later tonight—is largely irrelevant to the majority of producers in the forest industry since it applies only to projects worth more than $100m. In relation to resource security, the report states that, regardless of the possible passage of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill through the Senate, the inquiry's preferred approach to resource security is as follows:

         Let me reiterate: the cessation of wood production activities in native forests is not justified on the basis of the evidence before the inquiry.

          —The forest and timber inquiry of the Resource Assessment Commission is undoubtedly the most thorough investigation that there has ever been on this matter. The appointment of Mr Justice Stewart made sure that the matter was going to be dealt with absolutely thoroughly, almost to the point of exhaustion. It is very heartening just to look over the list of witnesses who gave evidence. Anybody interested in the subject could not but be impressed by the list and be satisfied that the industry, the resource conservation groups, the academics, foresters, primary and secondary industries, scientists and ordinary people have all had an opportunity to make some input. I am sure that they will also agree that on the basis of the intensity with which Mr Justice Stewart customarily proceeds with these things the findings must be in accordance with the facts as he has put them together.

          We only have to look for half a moment at the position of Australian forestry today to see that something is wrong. Throughout the whole of the country the industry is in limbo. We have had bad government interference. We have had bad non-government interference. We have had bad legislation. Now we are left in a position where there is absolute and total uncertainty. There is no employment, no investment, no certainty of any description. The Bill before the House does not provide that either.

I do not think that that is an unreasonable request at all. The evidence that came before the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs in the course of dealing with the Bill a couple of weeks ago so closely resembles the main findings of this report that surely the Government must take it into account. It cannot ignore areas which happen to comprise the same evidence as was put before the Committee a few weeks ago.

          The legislation is important for the future of Australia and its regional areas. The Opposition wants to see resource legislation and it wants to see resource security. It needs to be as secure as it can possibly be. If the recommendations that were made in this report were taken into account and acted upon, there could be and would be security for the industry. We could then see such things proceed as the pulp mill in northern Tasmania that we have been talking about as well as works in other parts of Australia. We want to see them proceed but under this sort of legislation it is absolutely impossible. I would certainly be asking the Government to make some comments about the report and to incorporate the suggestions and conclusions of this report into the legislation in a form that could make it work.

          —On 26 November 1989 Mr Hawke issued the terms of reference for the forest and timber industry inquiry, the first reference issued under the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989. It was not until July 1991 that the inquiry published two draft reports. The Government hung on to those two draft reports and refused to allow them to be distributed. I suppose we all wondered why at the time these reports had been delayed; but not for long. Once we saw the Government's legislation for resource security we understood why these reports had been delayed. These reports are very critical of the Government's legislation. Now that the final reports have been published and made public we can see how much backing this report gives to our comments.

          Referring to the present Bill that the Government has put forward, the report says that it is largely irrelevant to the majority of producers in the forest industry since it applies only to projects worth more than $100m. That is what the Opposition has been saying ever since the legislation was introduced. Our main criticism of the legislation is that it applies only to very large investments and that it left the small sawmillers—people trying to invest $30m, $40m or $50m—out in the cold with no security of resources at all. This report picks up that particular flaw in the legislation.

         Again, we have pressed very clearly the need for, at the very least, the abolition of the no compensation clause that the Government has in its legislation; and that if, at the very last minute, a piece of flora or fauna that is considered endangered is found, an additional resource be made available to take that place. How can we possibly expect any industry to invest large sums of money and then not give it the security of the resource it needs to make that investment work? How can we expect industry to invest when we tell it that if, at the very last minute when it goes in to use that resource, some flora or fauna is found, it will be denied that particular resource and it will not be offered any other resource or any compensation?

          Now we have this Resource Assessment Commission report which was brought forward by Justice Stewart. As he said, never before had such a wide ranging inquiry been commissioned in relation to forest and timber matters in Australia. I have here only one of the three volumes of the report and I suggest that quite a few trees were involved in just putting the report together. It has taken three years to produce—it is almost as big as one of Cecil B. De Mille's epics, such as

          In fact, the commandments are in here. The report justifies the stand we have taken and it justifies the need for security of resource for this very important industry. It points out that even with Australia's resources of timber and the plantation timber that is coming on stream, we export only about one-third of our forest harvest—mainly hardwood chips—and we run at a very significant balance of payments deficit in forest and timber products. In 1990-91, we exported only $596m worth of timber products, yet in that same period we imported in the vicinity of $1,928m worth. So we have a $1,332m deficit in that area and I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that is something which needs to be corrected.

          As previous speakers have said, one of the key recommendations of the report concerns the need to guarantee the wood supply. The report also points out that, in relation to aspects of forest management, the inquiry was of the view that the private sector should make the decisions on the basis of its own assessment of commercial opportunities, risks and investment projects. In other words, it was suggesting that the Government butt out of the whole situation as much as possible.

As to his particular slant about the conservationists not being in favour, when I was looking through the report a while ago I noticed that it said that the conservation movement generally did not oppose the development of a vigorous forest and timber industry.

          In fact, the Australian Conservation Foundation, though advocating an accelerated plantation program, was willing to accept native forestry harvesting until the year 2000. That also came through to us in the evidence we received. However, there was a fair amount of stretching of the truth. One thing that disturbed me about the whole thing was that, in my own State of Tasmania, it was put to me that the thylacine had become extinct because of logging operations; I believe that that is very hard to prove, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President.

The Senate was certainly not misinformed regarding the failure of the WA Government to expeditiously fill the casual Senate vacancy of Senator Vallentine. On the contrary, it appears from her letter that the Premier herself was not fully informed as to what occurred.

         Secondly, the facts regarding the delay in appointment are as follows. The Premier confirmed on 3 November 1991 her knowledge that Senator Vallentine intended to resign on 31 January 1992 and that, following a ballot, the Greens of Western Australia had nominated a successor, namely myself, to the State Government to follow Senator Vallentine when that casual vacancy arose. As recorded in the State

         of 5 February 1992, when the official notification from the President of the Senate was transmitted to the Western Australian State Parliament, both upper and lower houses of the State Parliament were sitting. There was therefore nothing to prevent a joint sitting being called in order to proceed with the appointment. The most charitable interpretation that can be made is that it represented a failure of knowledge rather than a lack of political will on the part of the State Government not to proceed at that point.

         —I would like to make a brief comment about Dr Lawrence's letter because I find it most extraordinary for it to be said that there been some anomaly in the drafting of the Constitution.

        There are options open that Dr Lawrence refused point blank to act upon. This saw Senator Chamarette sitting in the wilderness for quite some time. I think the point is that not only has the State Government goofed on this once but it has now goofed on it twice. The Parliament was not in session when the vacancy actually occurred, but it was in session when it was notified of the vacancy. It was in session after Senator Chamarette had effectively taken over—she had not been sworn in—after former Senator Vallentine had disappeared from the scene. The Parliament did have an opportunity. For Dr Lawrence to say that the Senate is misinformed is the absolute height of hypocrisy. Dr Lawrence should read the Constitution and have her Executive Council understand it. It would be helpful if she, as Premier of Western Australia, also understood the Constitution.

We thought that a grave injustice was done to her by the Western Australian Labor Government. Those few people who support her are nonetheless still entitled to their voice in the Senate.

The Labor Party is in government in Western Australia. Why is it that the independents and the Democrats always believe that we as the Opposition will change the world from opposition? While we got more votes at the last election, we are still not in government. I am the first to recognise how frustrating it is to have more votes at an election and still not be in government.

         I wish to direct some of my remarks to what has been said by Senator Knowles about political blame. There is always a tendency in these matters to seek some sort of political conspiracy as to why things occur. Governments are organisations which take advice from their legal officers. My understanding of what happened in the case of the Western Australian Government is that it received advice from its Crown Law Department that the procedure it entered into was the proper procedure. That advice may not be right, but a government in receipt of that advice is bound to pay attention to it. If it did not, I can well imagine that the political supporters of Senator Knowles in Western Australia would belabour the Lawrence Government, in the context of all that is going on in the Royal Commission in that State, for ignoring the advice of the Crown Law Department and the legal officers who are retained for the purposes of giving that advice.

         There are three points in the notice of motion. First, it addresses the need for casual vacancies to be filled expeditiously so that States have their full representation. Secondly, there is a need to recognise that there may be a difficulty in the interpretation of section 15 of the Constitution. Thirdly and finally, there is a recommendation that all State parliaments adopt procedures whereby their Houses, if they are adjourned when a casual vacancy in the Senate is notified, are recalled to fill the vacancy, and whereby the vacancy is filled within 14 days after the notification of the vacancy.

         A further anomaly arises in relation to the Constitution in that a motion to fill a vacancy has to be followed by a joint sitting within 14 days if notification occurs when Parliament is sitting. There is an elastic period between notification and actually putting a motion for a joint sitting. This interpretation of the Constitution has allowed the State Government to delay its appointment and to be rendered powerless to fill the vacancy.

It would have been enormously useful to me if in 1970, when this sort of thing previously occurred, the Senate had passed a motion recommending that a specific time limit be imposed or be taken into consideration by States in order to fill a casual Senate vacancy expeditiously.

         I wish to say a few words about report No. 27 of 1991-92. This project audit report by the Auditor-General on the Retirement Benefits Office deals with the effectiveness of the information campaign which was conducted by the Retirement Benefits Office in 1990-91. That information campaign stemmed from the changes to superannuation provisions applying to the public sector.

          On 1 July 1990 a new superannuation scheme for public servants—the public sector superannuation scheme or PSS scheme—was introduced. Eligible persons were given 12 months to elect to transfer to the new scheme or to remain with the existing scheme—the Commonwealth superannuation scheme or the CSS. During this period the Retirement Benefits Office conducted an extensive information campaign to assist members in their choice—namely, whether to stay with the existing Commonwealth superannuation scheme or whether to move across to the new scheme. As I said in my initial remarks, the Australian National Audit Office, as outlined in audit report No. 27, undertook to report on the effectiveness of that information campaign.

          Of course, it has not been possible to examine the report in detail. But, in summary, the audit report discloses that although the information campaign was generally effective in providing members with sufficient information to enable them to make an informed transfer decision, some categories of members received unreliable information owing to shortcomings in members' contribution records.

          There were also some problems in respect of that part of the campaign related to the development by the Retirement Benefits Office of what was called a ready reckoner, which was a personal computer program on disc designed to permit members to project their benefits under each scheme. There were apparently a number of errors in the first version of that ready reckoner and that, of course, detracted from its usefulness. The second version was due for release in November 1990 but it was not in fact issued until April 1991, which was just two months prior to the end of the year during which contributors to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme had to elect whether to stay or whether to change to the new Public sector superannuation scheme.

          The Auditor-General's report brings up some specific criticisms of the exercise conducted by the Retirements Benefits Office. As I understand it, the Retirement Benefits Office has accepted and is proposing to take action on the majority of the recommendations that the Audit Office has made in report No. 27 to prevent such an outcome occurring in future. Hopefully the recommendations also relate to the provision of information by the Audit Office in terms of its own record system, which does not have the unreliability that some of the existing information was found to have when this matter was being examined.

          I do not want to say too much more about it other than to point out that at the recent Estimates hearings the Department of Finance told Estimates Committee B that 69 per cent of Commonwealth superannuation scheme members had been expected to transfer across to the new public sector scheme but that in fact only 37 per cent have actually done so. That is a very significant difference between expectation and actuality.

          This much lower than expected rate of transfer is no doubt due, at least in part, to the errors in the information and the late information to which the Audit Office has drawn attention and to which I have already referred. I think that is unfortunate. I think it is a matter that we in the Senate ought to be looking at in greater detail. An opportunity to do that will occur at the next Estimates hearings following the next Budget. But that is a small comfort for those contributors who may have not elected to change schemes on the basis of unreliable information. The Auditor-General's report is very salutary in drawing attention to those difficulties and one would certainly hope that the Retirement Benefits Office in future will not be subject to the same criticism as it was on this occasion.

          I also very briefly take this opportunity to comment on the recent retirement of the director of the Retirement Benefits Office, Mr Geoff Vanthoff, who has retired after a very long Public Service career which stretches back into the late 1940s. He has been a very senior officer in a variety of senior and important Public Service positions over those decades and I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate him on the contribution he made to the various positions he occupied over those many years and to wish him well in his retirement.

         The Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure welcomed the opportunity to conduct an inquiry into proposals to develop rocket launching facilities in Australia. Rocket launching was once a field of activity in which Australia ranked only second to the United States.

          In 1947 Woomera became operational as a guided weapons testing range and Australia, with the United Kingdom, tested a variety of rockets at the range. In 1957 the United States also established a presence there to support its Mercury manned space missions. From 1961 the European Launcher Development Organisation, ELDO, used Woomera for its launching activities.

          Australia launched its WRESAT satellite from Woomera in 1967 and thereby became only the third nation to launch a satellite from its own soil. By the late 1970s, for a variety of reasons, Woomera declined as a centre for space related activities, having in its heyday been the world's most heavily used space launching facility apart from Cape Canaveral.  Australia has, nevertheless, been involved in the satellite tracking industry for nearly 35 years and its expertise now in space technology for communications and remote sensing is widely recognised. Apart from that, Australia is not regarded as a leading participant in space-related activities.

          The proposals to develop satellite launching services on Cape York Peninsula and Woomera are positive steps. The Cape York service is intended for equatorial launches of payloads into geo-stationary orbit while the Woomera proposal is to provide launches of small satellites for communications, global positioning and remote sensing into low earth or polar orbit. The Committee's report deals in detail with the proposals.

          The Committee also addressed the role of government in the development of launching services, the space industry and other aspects relevant to Australia's approach to space matters. It is generally acknowledged that the world market for the provision of launch services is very competitive and that there is no launching service which is not either government owned or heavily government subsidised. Given this situation, and while accepting that the decision to develop any Australian launch service ultimately rests with the proponents, there will be a continuing role for government participation in the Australian development of such services.

Invitations for submissions were also made to companies, associations and individuals participating in the space industry and those involved in space-related activities. The Australian Government and the State governments of Queensland and South Australia were also invited to participate, especially due to our interest in the Woomera and Cape York space sites.

          The Committee commenced its program of inquiry in early July last year with an inspection of the coastal and inland area around Temple Bay on Cape York Peninsula. At the time of the inspection Temple Bay and its hinterland was the only publicly declared preferred site for the possible development of a rocket launching facility by one of the two proponents of the Cape York launching service. The Committee also held public hearings in Cairns in July, followed by hearings in Brisbane and Sydney. In August the Committee received a private briefing from the Australian Space Office in Canberra.

          The major conclusion reached by the Committee is that a high priority must be given to reviewing what Australia's future attitude and approach will be as a participant in space related activities. The Committee also recognised that there is a growing recognition in an increasing number of countries that an involvement in space endeavours will bring substantial benefits. It is, therefore, important that the Commonwealth Government take a leadership role on space matters to determine a national strategy and to implement positive measures which will provide direction, impetus and assistance for the indigenous space industry to develop in a cohesive manner. To achieve this goal it is important that all sectors of the Australian space community and potential participants are consulted and, if the Government fails to adopt this approach, its lack of commitment to space related developments will be clearly shown at both local and international levels.

          The proposals to develop commercial launching services located at Woomera and Cape York are at the stage where their commercial viability has not yet been firmly established. The final decisions on whether to proceed with the developments will be up to the commercial judgments made by the respective proponents. The Committee is of the view that this will not take place without some form of support from governments, and that is particularly so in regard to the proposals for the Cape York space base. It may well be that the Woomera proposals have a much greater chance of getting off the ground successfully without the need for any significant government involvement or intervention. However, I am very sceptical as to whether, in fact, anything can occur at Cape York without significant government involvement.

          It is on that basis that the Committee made eight recommendations relating to the development of satellite launching facilities and these were supported by all members of the Committee. The recommendations relate to the satellite launch vehicle project, the South Australian Woomera rocket range and the Scramjet project, which I believe is the most exciting project that is currently under way concerning the development of space facilities and space projects in Australia. From all the evidence that we took it seemed to me that strong emphasis should be given to the development of this particular technology for the launching of space facilities. Of course, this is particularly relevant to the Woomera location because the Scramjet project relates to the launch of low level satellites for communication purposes. This technology and this project offer the best opportunity for Australia to become more actively involved in a space program.

          It seems clear to the Committee that it is unlikely that Australia has the opportunity to become significantly involved in the development of a space industry without substantial government involvement, particularly in terms of purchasing payload provisions for the launch of rockets especially in regard to the Cape York base proposal. It is really up to the government of the day to make a final judgment about whether it really believes that its involvement in the space industry is of general benefit to the Australian community and is in the national interest.

I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee and, at a personal level, I found that the evidence we received was fascinating. In particular, I want to make a few remarks about the proposals that affect my own State of South Australia about which Senator Foreman and Senator Chapman, who are also South Australian Senators, have also commented.

          Firstly, credit should be given to an organisation called Australian Launch Vehicles, which is based in South Australia. That company took the initiative to start a proposal to reactivate Woomera as a launching site for low orbiting satellites. The company approached me as a South Australian Senator even before this inquiry started and asked for support. It outlined the possibilities concerning the Motorola Iridium program and the possibility that some of the Motorola satellites could be launched from Woomera. Unfortunately, that possibility did not eventuate and the main reason for that was that even though technically the preparation of the proposal from Australian Launch Vehicles was very good, in the end Motorola declined to put the consortium through to the final list because it could not actually demonstrate a launch vehicle, that is, it did not have a workable rocket.

          Throughout the evidence that we received about Woomera it was clear that the bottom line is that, to get the project off the ground—if Senators will pardon the pun—the Australian Government or governments will have to, as an article of faith, put up money for the design and construction of two rockets and launch them from Woomera with a scientific payload. CSIRO has indicated plenty of interest, and has plenty of ideas as to how it could use a rocket to launch a low orbiting satellite for some of its research. However, the total cost of that will be in excess of $30m and in these times of tight budgetary constraints all governments will cough a bit when they see that sort of figure.

          If we really are serious—and the Committee's report shows that Australia should be very serious—about being involved at an appropriate level in space technology, that sort of contribution will have to come forward. If it is successful and if Australia can establish a facility at Woomera to launch a range of low orbiting satellites, the benefits to Australia in terms of technology and employment will be enormous.

          I have a particular interest in the communications side. The Motorola program raises the issue of new communications technology. In the latter part of this decade and into the next century the emphasis will be not so much on geostationary satellites stationed 30,000 kilometres above the earth in a permanent position but on many low orbiting satellites at only 100, 200 or 400 kilometres above the earth's surface—a whole network of them continually moving in orbit around the earth, always having one over head and, therefore, always being able to be contacted. The view is that with those low orbiting satellites a message from a mobile telephone device will be able to go direct to the satellite without a dish and then be transmitted anywhere in the world to another telephone. Apparently, the market for such devices is very big indeed. In the maritime area, in the civil aviation area, in remote areas of the world on land and in mining companies exploring in remote areas, there is a strong desire by all to have access to that sort of communication.

          I believe that our report dealing with Woomera shows a real opportunity, but I admit that it has a $30m price tag. I also commend the Australian Space Office for putting forward further money this year, with the South Australian Government and the consortium of firms based in South Australia, to do a further definition study on the possibility of getting small satellites launched from South Australia. That report will come down in the latter part of this year and it may be that at that time State and Federal governments will have to be asked to contribute the sort of money it will take to get a couple of rockets launched. I, like Senator Chapman, have wider doubts, though, about the possibility of the Cape York venture taking place. The investment there would be massive, running into many hundreds of millions of dollars. Whether the Cape York option is a goer commercially is, in my view, more debatable than the Woomera option which needs much less investment.

I am no expert, but in both the Cape York and Woomera regions one has to admit there are environmental concerns; Aboriginal land rights and claims cannot be ignored.

It was to obtain $20m by the end of December 1991. This milestone was not met. The Committee was then informed by STS in February 1992 that, although that milestone had not been reached, arrangements were being finalised with a Euro-American financial syndicate for the funding of the project.

          I am making the point that we have been told time and time again that an announcement about Australian backing in this project is imminent, and it just has not eventuated. We really have to ask the Queensland Government why it continues to give preferred developer status to STS when there is another consortium, headed by another former Queensland Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, which claims that it can put the deal together. I find it one of those delicious ironies of Queensland politics that we have two former National Party Premiers competing in consortia to fund the spaceport proposal. However, I think it really suits the political purposes of the Premier of Queensland to make it appear that this project is bubbling along nicely whereas in fact I do not think that is the case at all.

We have the example here of an Australian firm with the leading edge internationally in this technology, and it has been unable to find $1m of government support to take it to the next stage.

I, like Senator Kernot, was particularly interested in the scramjet proposal being developed by a private consortium in Queensland, in conjunction with the University of Queensland. It is a very exciting project and one that I hope will proceed. I commend to the Government the recommendations we have made in our report along that particular line. We made recommendations about the establishment of a national space policy council.

I am sure that they will be properly addressed at the appropriate time. I believe that in nearly every case it is an issue that governments should look after and that it should not be left to private developers. In relation to the Cape York project, it is very difficult for the developers to have to go out and make the arrangements, make the ground rules, with environmentalists and Aboriginal groups. Very often, the guidelines are not even there. At times, it is very difficult to know who you should be making the agreements with. I urge the Federal Government and the Queensland Government to take on a more up-front role in determining the issues relating to Aboriginal heritage and environmental matters and not leave them all to private developers.

          All the way through our deliberations, when we were talking about the Cape York space base, it was emphasised by all those talking to us that this was to be a private enterprise organisation; it was a commercial organisation. Some of my colleagues who have spoken before me have cast some doubts—regrettably and in a negative way—upon whether that project will go ahead without massive government support. The people who appeared before us were at pains to say that it was entirely commercial. There are differences in definition of what is `entirely commercial' and I might mention some of them a little later. It was intended to be a project with minimum government interference, minimum government involvement and minimum government money. It was to be directed and advanced by private capital from people who were prepared to take the risk and be entitled to the rewards if the project succeeded.

The inquiry and report originated from a suggestion by my colleague Senator Panizza with respect to satellite communications and how they might help, particularly with telephone communication in the outback. That was the impetus for the report. It then became a very detailed examination into all aspects of the space industry, particularly looking at satellite launching facilities in Woomera and Cape York.

          As the evidence came out, it became quite clear that both of those proposals were not competing; they were complementary. They related to different launches. Using very basic terms, one was a very high launch in a geostationary orbit and the other was a low earth orbit. They were looking at different markets and different users. Both could complement each other. In fact, once we get a space industry going, the expertise, learning and material we gather from that will help the space industry in Australia.

          The Cape York proposal was an initiative of the Queensland Government in 1987 when the Government called for expressions of interest. From there a lot of work was done. The basic part of the proposal for a Cape York space base was in relation to the use of a Russian Zenit rocket to launch it. The payload would be the payload of the customer who was organising it. A lot of work was done on the commercial viability of the proposal. The original front-runner on it, Cape York Space Agency Pty Ltd, did a detailed series of figures showing how it could be commercially adopted. A competitor in the activity on Cape York, Space Transportation Systems Ltd—STS—is now the preferred operator in that area. As I say, both of them have given a lot of thought to the money needed and the commercial reality of their proposal.

In the area that I come from in north Queensland it will mean a new direction for our higher education places such as the James Cook University, and the proposed university campuses in Cairns and Brisbane. There will be new industry build-up. It will provide a lot of work for engineering places. I specifically mention the NQEA—North Queensland Engineers and Agents—a company in Cairns that has done a lot of work on the space project. It is a company that is involved in high tech manufacturing of that order, and a company that could well do a lot towards developing a space base in the cape and do it very well and at world best standards.

The added employment to Australia, a matter that is very important in this day and age with one million unemployed, could be in the range of 4,500 jobs in fairly high technology industries.

Some submissions put to us, with which I agree, suggested that in the case of an establishment in the Woomera or Cape York areas, there would be a reasonable argument for asking the Government to look at helping in the way of some infrastructure assistance—not direct grants on the commercial viability of it, but help in the infrastructure that could be expected if a new industry was being set up in other places in Australia.

          As I said before, my interest lay in being able to provide Australia with regular and reliable communications in the outback. Safety is a prime reason for having such communication systems, as are commercial reasons involving mineral exploration and the pastoral areas. I always knew and believed that satellites are the only way that we will provide communications for every square metre of Australia. Geostationary satellites can provide that direct communication but, unfortunately, it comes at a cost. These days, people can have completely mobile telephones with just a disc on the top of their cars, but it comes at around the $50,000 or $60,000 mark. We have to look at other cheaper ways to provide communication.

          As Senator Schacht mentioned, the Iridium project was developed. Instead of having one big geostationary satellite, a band of satellites was used at a much lower cost. Basically, it consists of 77 light satellites in a polar route—in other words, going from south to north—with 7 bands of 11 across rotating around the world. In other words, they are not geostationary.

That will lead us towards personal communications which will be a feature of the future. Rather than having a telephone with one number in a house all the time, we will carry a number with us anywhere within Australia, or within the world for that matter. That will come in time.

          One of the big advantages of both places is that they are located in a country with a very stable government, which cannot be said about many other places on that particular route. There are not too many places in the world where one can launch satellites for the equatorial or the polar route. There are many considerations. Firstly, the satellites do not travel too far over populated areas and, secondly, the satellite route has to be within so many degrees of either the equator or the north-south meridian as the case may be.

On report 314, the eight performance audits, under the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, the Committee is required to examine all reports of the Auditor-General, including reports of efficiency audits.

          On this matter of internal audit, the Committee notes that a major activity currently being undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office is the survey of internal audit in the Commonwealth public sector. The Auditor-General has reported on stage 1 of the survey with the second and final report expected in June of this year.

          The survey found that about 70 per cent of Commonwealth departments and agencies had internal audit units and that overall internal audit activity resulted in improved efficiency within departments. The Committee considers that internal audit activity is critical to the efficiency of a department and its accountability to Parliament, and has recommended in this report that new financial administrative legislation require that all Commonwealth organisations establish effective internal audit functions. A second recommendation relates to the need for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to strengthen its internal audit activity. I regret to note that we have commented on this matter previously.

          In regard to the follow-up of the Auditor-General's reports, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts plays an important role in stimulating the efficient and effective use of public moneys through the scrutiny of the Auditor-General's reports and departmental responses to his recommendations. The Committee believes that systematic follow-up of performance audits by the Audit Office is an essential adjunct to the Committee's scrutiny of performance audit reports. The Committee in its Report No.296 made it clear that the Auditor-General should accept responsibility for the follow-up of his own recommendations. The Audit Office has accepted that recommendation, as has the Government by providing additional funds to the Audit Office for efficiency audits. The Committee notes with approval that the Audit Office has embarked on a program of follow-up audits, conducting four in 1990-91, and planning a further six in 1991-92.

           The Social Responsibilities of Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises
          </emphasis>
          . This report is the result of the Committee's investigation of how statutory authorities and government business enterprises—GBEs—measure and report to the public and the Parliament on the performance of their social responsibilities. The report also records the Committee's conclusion that most government agencies still have some way to go before they perfect the use of performance measures, and recommends ways in which this might be done.

          I now address the question of social responsibilities. Social responsibilities are defined in terms of the responsibilities of statutory authorities and GBEs towards their clients, their employees and the environment. Their responsibilities towards their clients include making their services as accessible as possible, having means available by which clients can provide input to the operations of statutory authorities, and by freedom of information. The social responsibilities of statutory authorities and GBEs towards their employees include equal employment opportunity, occupational health and safety, training, and industrial democracy.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Some of these responsibilities are imposed on statutory authorities, while others are undertaken by them on a voluntary basis. Whether they are legally required or voluntarily assumed, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts believes that the nation's statutory authorities and GBEs should act in accordance with the highest possible standards. The Committee recognises that there may be pressures on commercially oriented agencies to concentrate on their commercial performance at the expense of their social responsibilities. It is essential, however, that this does not happen.

          In regard to the social responsibilities to be included among corporate objectives, to ensure that government organisations act in a socially responsible manner and can demonstrate this to the public and the Parliament, the Committee is recommending social objectives be included among the corporate objectives of these organisations, and progress in meeting all these objectives to be reported in annual reports.

          As to measures and reports of performance, the Committee recommends that in making their reports, whether annual reports to the Parliament or reports for other purposes, statutory authorities and GBEs should compare performance with a standard or target; focus on the outcomes; use several indicators for each program, retaining the same indicators over a number of years so that changes over time can be monitored; choose information to suit the needs of the user; and use both qualitative and quantitative information. While recognising that there are limitations on the use of performance information, the Committee believes that agencies should strive for the best possible performance information and develop expertise among their staff in the development and use of performance information.

          The Committee's report provides detailed recommendations about the nature of the information that should be reported in relation to equal employment opportunity, training, access to services, activities that impact on the environment, and the activities of consultative groups, including those of statutory marketing authorities. A social responsibility summary is advocated by the Committee as a means by which each organisation can outline its progress and achievements in the performance of its social

          responsibilities.

          On the topic of scrutiny of reports, requiring an organisation to define its social objectives and to measure and report on its performance focuses the organisation's attention on its social responsibilities. If its reports are scrutinised and regular responses provided, the pressure on the organisation to observe its social responsibilities is enhanced. Scrutiny of and providing response to its reports are therefore of the utmost importance, whether they are provided by Ministers, the Parliament and its committees, review bodies or the public.

          In relation to the value of social responsibilities, the Committee also considered the means by which values could be attached to social responsibilities. This was a difficult task. The value of social responsibilities may be financial or non-financial. They are of value to individuals, the organisation providing them and the wider community, but their impact cannot always be fully assessed. Most of the information received by the Committee about the value of social responsibilities concerned the cost of providing them, particularly the cost of providing community service obligations, such as telephone and mail services to remote and isolated areas of the country. How the costing should be carried out has been determined by the Government in relation to Telecom's—the new AOTC's—provision of telephone services. The method of least avoidable cost is to be used and it is expected that other GBEs will use the same method. The Committee noted that criticism has been expressed about the validity of estimates of community service obligation costs. We recommend that the way in which estimates are made should be monitored and improvements sought.

          On the more general level of dealing with the values and costs of socially responsible behaviour, the Committee endorses the use of cost-benefit analyses. Such analyses should consider both the quantifiable and qualitative aspects of any proposal and take as wide a view as possible of the impact of the proposal on the community and the environment.

          In conclusion, the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the social responsibilities of Commonwealth statutory authorities and GBEs is important, and I suspect that in time it will prove to be of great significance. Both this report and report No. 314, which reviews eight of the Auditor-General's performance audits, focus on increasing the accountability of government agencies to the Parliament. I commend both reports to honourable senators.

          The report addresses the current operation of Medicare benefit fees under the Medicare schedule for radiological services and the restructure of the Medicare benefits arrangement for diagnostic radiology proposed by the Minister. The restructure proposes to amend sections of the current table for radiology services contained in the Medicare benefits schedule of the Health Insurance Act 1973.

          Essentially, these amendments would create two separate categories of radiology practice—`comprehensive practices' and `other practices'. These would be categorised according to the number and type of modalities provided, the hours the radiologist works in each facility, and the attendance of the radiologist at the provision of certain items. Practices classified as `comprehensive' would receive 103.5 per cent of the current schedule fee for diagnostic radiology services, while practices classified as `other' and general practitioners providing radiology services would receive 75 per cent of the schedule fee. Although this would retain the existing fee for general practitioners, it would mean a drop of 25 per cent in the current fee for specialist radiologists.

          The main proponents of the restructure—the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, and the Australian Medical Association—are concerned that there has been a dramatic and unnecessary growth in plain diagnostic radiology services which places at risk the provision of affordable, high quality procedural radiology services to the community. They see the problem as basically twofold.

          The current schedule is said to overcompensate practices providing only a limited range of diagnostic radiology services with low radiologist input and basic equipment. At the same time, it undercompensates practices providing a comprehensive range of procedural radiology services with substantial radiologist input and high-cost, state-of-the-art equipment. This is not only seen as a misallocation of Medicare benefits, but also is alleged to have allowed so-called entrepreneurial practitioners to overservice for financial gain, instead of providing services strictly for medical reasons. Compounding these concerns is the fear that overservicing and inadequate supervision by radiologists of services increases radiation exposure, and thereby poses risks for patients.

          The restructure was based largely on the costing models of `comprehensive' and `other' practices defined by Coopers and Lybrand Consultants. These models were supposed to have shown the differing costs of practices, the disparity in remuneration under the current schedule between comprehensive and plain X-ray practices, and the need for adjustments to various items on the radiology table.

          The Committee believes that the supposed problems behind the recent growth in radiology services have not been demonstrated conclusively, that the real reasons for this growth are more complex than the Department or College would admit, that the Coopers and Lybrand costing models are not representative of a range of practices, and that the proposed solutions have been insufficiently worked through.

          The Committee is not convinced that the growth in radiology services, as reflected in Medicare data, can be attributed simply to overservicing and the profiteering of so-called entrepreneurial practices. The evidence presented to the Committee suggested that a multiplicity of factors underlies the perceived expansion in radiology services. These factors range from population increase, demographic change, patient expectations, advances in imaging technology and the more technical/scientific approach of younger medical practitioners, to medico-legal defence concerns of doctors and cost-shifting from the State public health sector to the private health sector covered by Medicare. These factors were glossed over or downplayed by the proponents of the restructure, which suggests a less than thorough approach to this issue.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Trends of fairly recent origin, such as the higher incidence of sports injuries and the expansion of radiology services to cater for hitherto underserviced, if not unserviced, needs in lower socioeconomic areas have also contributed to the increase in radiology services. As these factors do not appear to have been taken fully into account, claims of overservicing may well be exaggerated and based on an inadequate understanding of recent developments. Furthermore, if overservicing does occur, legislation is already in place to take action against this practice. It is the responsibility of the Department to utilise this legislation effectively and promptly and to provide new legislation if the current provisions are deficient. The Committee does not believe that the proposed regulations are the most effective means of limiting unnecessary services.

          The Committee is not convinced that the restructure will result in improved radiological services for the community. We consider that there is a serious possibility that dated equipment will be purchased, and that complex services will be provided by inexperienced persons in order for `other practices' to qualify for `comprehensive practice' status. There are many reasons why `comprehensive practices' may not be the most effective and efficient providers of services at present. Comprehensive practices may, for instance, be encouraged to maintain businesses which are not needed. Evidence was also presented to the Committee which indicated that `comprehensive' type practices have been established in areas in order to win greater market share from rival practices, rather than to meet real community needs. The proposed restructure does not address such problems.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another likely repercussion of the proposed restructure is that there may be a serious decline in the availability of all types of diagnostic imaging services, especially for certain sections of the population. Currently, extended hours services may well be meeting a need. This need may exist because hospitals are busy or do not provide services after hours, or because other practices are not easily accessible in terms of transport, cost, or available hours. If `other' type practices, or marginal `comprehensive practices', either go out of business or charge higher fees in order to survive, other services may not change to meet real needs.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This highlights a number of major issues that need to be considered thoroughly if radiology services are to be restructured in a systematic and effective way. The Committee believes that the role of hospital services requires greater consideration, especially in terms of the extent of cost-shifting from State health systems to the Commonwealth and the extent to which patients are expected to use Medicare services in the community to obtain X-rays and other radiology services prior to admission to hospital. It is also necessary to clarify the involvement of general practitioners in radiology, especially in so far as they may provide essential services to rural and remote areas.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Committee emphasises that the consideration of these and other issues must take place within a planning context that allows for wider consultation than appears to have occurred in the preparation of the proposed restructure. It needs to be remembered that changes of the order envisaged under the restructure can have a substantial effect on the provision of services, on the viability of businesses, on the capacity of people to practise their profession, on the maintenance of health and on the operation of State hospital services including the attendance of private sector radiologists at such hospitals.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Committee therefore believes that the Medicare Benefits Consultative Committee, which provided the formal decision making context for the restructure, in future should publicise proposed changes widely. It should also accept written and oral comment on them so that groups other than radiologists have an opportunity to demonstrate the likely effect of changes and to question the evidence of those who may be seen to benefit most from change. While this may add to the time taken to effect changes, it is considered preferable to take such time as is required at this stage rather than have delays at a later stage.

          Overall, the Committee believes that, on the evidence and submissions provided, neither the Department nor the College has demonstrated an objective assessment of the issues. Consequently, the Committee is opposed to regulations which are based on information clearly biased towards one section of providers of medical services. The solutions suggested through the regulations could destroy business, deprive a number of communities of required services, exacerbate health problems and, overall, have a detrimental effect on the community.

The Committee has also recommended that the Department undertake further research, that it consider any changes to radiology services in a wider context of health policy and flexible service provision, and that the Medicare Benefits Consultative Committee and the Department consult more widely on matters which impact on patients, State government services, medical practitioners and other professionals.

          —One of the interesting facets of this inquiry into radiological services in relation to Medicare benefits is that two weeks ago all doctors in Australia were circulated with a 38-page booklet informing them of the changes that were to be implemented on 1 May before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs brought down its report. The Department of Community Services and Health had adequate knowledge that this Committee was meeting. It was forewarned of the fact that there would be a delay in implementing the report. It showed scant regard for, or knowledge of, the processes of this chamber to expend those funds and promulgate the report and the effects of the regulations without in any way taking into account the findings of this Committee.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) deals with a wide range of issues and amendments to the taxation law. I will come back to some of these in more detail later. The purpose of the Bill is to make various amendments, including those flowing from the Government's industry statement of March 1991—not March 1992, but March 1991, more than a year ago. The amendments cover a very wide area ranging from depreciation provisions to anti-avoidance measures; roll-over relief; dividend rebates; deferral of deductions for trading stock purchases involving prepayments; amendments to the tax file number system; capital gains tax roll-over relief for partnerships so far as publishing indexation factors are concerned; the taxation of foreign sourced income; foreign exchange gains and losses; rehabilitation of mining, quarrying and petroleum sites; research and development; fringe benefits tax; education entry payment and one or two others. There are amendments covering 16 areas in total.

         The interesting thing about the Bill is that it has come in so late after the announcements by the Government, particularly so far as the amended depreciation provisions for capital equipment are concerned. I will come back to that later. The depreciation amendments are to give effect to the announcements made over a year ago on 12 March 1991 in the Government's industry policy statement. The Senate may recall that this statement was initially to be put out by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, but when the then Prime Minister Hawke saw his position as Prime Minister under threat, he moved in, took over the statement and was the main presenter of that statement.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Apart from the fact that that did not work and that as a result Prime Minister Hawke is no longer Prime Minister Hawke, the most significant element was that the amendments to which this Bill relates in the main were introduced that long ago. In many ways that is symptomatic of the malaise that we have in the taxation system in Australia today. We have enormous problems in the area of taxation. The taxation legislation and its regulations have grown over the past couple of decades from a mere few hundred pages to several thousand pages.

         Indeed, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 itself comprises 86 pages. The explanatory memorandum comprises 193 pages. If that were not bad enough, if such was the inefficiency with which this legislation was introduced, we now have from the Government no fewer than 16 major amendments to the original Bill. Although 16 perhaps sounds not all that much, in terms of complexity and comprehensiveness 11 pages of amendments are now required. So we have a continuing situation in the area of taxation legislation and, indeed, in many other areas of Government administration, of what would appear, at least at first blush, to be sheer administrative incompetence.

         I think it is absolutely unacceptable that we have a situation in Australia today—and we have had it for many years now—where we virtually have legislation by press release. The Government announces that changes will be made to this, that and the other, particularly in the area of taxation but also in a wider range of areas. It then puts out a press release. More often than not this is done during a time when Parliament is not sitting. So these announcements are made by way of ordinary press release and they do not come into the Parliament at all. Then we find that a year or more later legislation is introduced to give effect to the Government's decision at the time that the press release was put out. More often than not, we find that the legislation that is introduced does not accord in all respects with the press release that was made.

         During the last couple of sitting weeks a minor Bill relating to amendments to superannuation was introduced into the House of Representatives. These amendments are consequential to changes which the Government made two years ago to principal legislation relating to public sector superannuation. It is only in the last two weeks that consequential legislation has been introduced to catch up with changes that were announced and made as long as two years ago. To a somewhat lesser extent, but nevertheless more significant in this respect, we have a similar situation with the legislation now before the Senate.

         People in the accounting profession, and many others—particularly those who have to fill in taxation returns—know just how difficult and complex the area of taxation in Australia is today. It is almost impossible to know and to understand the complexities of taxation law. Even if one is a taxation expert, it is almost impossible to comply fully with all the requirements or not to make at least some errors of judgment or interpretation simply because of the sheer volume of rules and regulations. With the increasing movement, desirable perhaps in itself, towards self-assessment, the penalties for getting one's self-assessment wrong, even for the most innocuous of reasons, are increasingly steep and are making life increasingly difficult for ordinary taxpayers.

As I also said, as if to draw attention to the confusion and complexity of the law, the explanatory memorandum to this Bill runs to 193 pages.

         The depreciation arrangements flow from the industry statement announcement of 12 March 1991. As I said earlier, these are very important arrangements. The amendments to the law that we are debating were first announced on 12 March 1991. They were supposed to contain measures to kick-start the economy. At that stage the economy was in the depths of recession. It was hoped that introducing some increased and improved depreciation arrangements, particularly those relating to the definition of `effective life', would somehow or other stimulate confidence and therefore increase investment in the economy.

Secondly, of course, if one is going to take so long to get things right in terms of definitions for taxation purposes, one automatically stalls any potential investment growth that might otherwise occur.

This major factor is stalling any prospect of recovery in this economy. This is on top of or additional to the fact that the Government cannot control its own spending. It says that it is going to accumulate $20 billion of additional Budget deficits over the next three or four years. As we found from Senate Estimates hearings last week, already the figures for 1991-92 are going to be much worse than those that have been forecast either in the Budget or in the Government's economic statement as recently as 25 February. Last week during the Senate Estimates hearings we found that revenue collections to the end of February this year are at least $600m—and probably more than that—down compared with what it had been estimated they would be.

         The March 1991 industry statement included a revised depreciation regime based on self-assessment that allowed businesses to write off assets over their effective life. After widespread confusion over the operation of the regime and the definition of effective life, the Treasury put in place strict definitions which met the objective of conserving revenue but at the same time failed utterly to meet the objective of a more internationally competitive depreciation regime. The result of all of this has been, as I have said, that many corporations have actually delayed rather than brought forward their investment programs. The Government's contribution to an already weak investment climate has been to add to the uncertainty.

         As well as being an administrative nightmare, the current tax system is a disincentive to investment and it damages the competitiveness of our exports. Those disincentives have been highlighted recently in a number of reviews of business taxation. For example, in November 1990, EPAC, the Economic Planning Advisory Council, said that Australia's `mongrel' tax system was so disjointed that investment in productive activities was most heavily taxed whilst speculative property investment was taxed the least.

That report also showed that, in terms of the overall tax impost, the Australian system imposed a higher effective rate of tax on those parts of the economy the Government was supposedly trying to expand. It showed that the depreciation system contained a large distortion in that it undercompensated for long-lived assets.

         A report of the Business Council of Australia found that the tax system was a major factor in the decline of Australia's competitiveness. The main problems were found to be in the depreciation provisions and in the wholesale sales tax. Wholesale sales tax, of course, is a tax which compounds right through the whole cost structure of industry in this country, be it service industry, manufacturing, mining or what have you. It is built into the cost structure. That is one of the fundamental reasons why the coalition in its Fightback package is proposing the total abolition of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement by a goods and services tax because a goods and services tax does not get built into the cost structure at all whereas a wholesale sales tax automatically does. The Business Council found that that was an important factor in relation to Australia's lack of competitiveness.

That is why the coalition in government will also abolish the payroll tax which is a major cost impediment on business. It is a tax on jobs.

         It is all part of the division and uncertainty that this Government is creating within the Australian community and economy. It is hardly surprising that more and more Australian companies are investing offshore when one looks at the taxation regime in this country compared with many of our potential competitors. An OECD study released just a couple of months ago showed that an Australian investment has to be 20 per cent more profitable than the OECD average simply to earn the same real rate of return. The reason for that is the punitive tax regime on business that exists in Australia. Also, the anti-corporate bias in our tax structure explains why domestic investment remained so sluggish during the 1980s. It has certainly continued into the early part of the 1990s, despite the recent increase in the share of national income going to profits, although if we look at profits after taking tax and interest charges out we find that at the moment corporate profits are at their lowest since records began 30 years ago.

         In summary, those proposals involve a $13 billion reduction in personal income tax; a reduction of between 25 and 30 per cent of the total level of income tax that is paid in this country, particularly by lower and middle income earners. It includes a $20 billion reduction in the taxes on the cost of doing business, that is, producing goods and services in this country. One of the main taxes on business is the wholesales sales tax, which costs business something like $7 billion a year. This is written right into the cost structure of businesses and increases the cost of every activity in which we engage in Australia. Payroll tax costs almost $6 billion a year and is a $6 billion a year tax on jobs in this country, because it is an increase in the cost of doing business. Fuel excise brings in a total of $6.6 billion into the Government's coffers each year, of which almost $4 billion is a direct cost on business. If the fuel excise is abolished the cost of business will be cut by 25c a litre. It is those and other tax measures that are necessary if we are really going to be serious about creating jobs, restoring dynamism and growth to the Australian community and producing the prospect for future living standards for not only this generation but more particularly for our children and grandchildren. It is an indictment on the Government that it is unprepared to pursue that line.

I certainly will not be tempted by Senator Short's concluding remarks to debate the merits of the Fightback package. I am quite sure that the Australian community will make its decision as to whether it believes that the Opposition has got the balance right. Of course, he did not mention the counterbalancing factor to all those reductions and abolitions of taxes that he spoke of. He did not give any weight or emphasis to the 15 per cent which every person in this country will have to pay in respect of all goods and services that they purchase under the Opposition's proposed regime.

But I should perhaps refrain from discussing those issues in any detail because to do so might be to overshadow the great performance to be put in by the responsible Minister, Senator Button, during the Committee on Friday. However, I will make a few general comments. As honourable senators will be aware, the Government will be introducing a number of amendments to the Bill. In finalising these amendments—as was acknowledged during Senator Short's speech—the questions raised and comments made by Senators Watson, Panizza and Kernot during the second reading debate have been taken into account.

         Taking first the Judges' Pensions Act, subsections 7(2) and 8(2) of that Act currently provide that pensions payable to the surviving spouse of a deceased judge or a deceased retired judge cease to become payable if the spouse remarries. Those provisions are repealed by clauses 4 and 5 of this Bill. Clause 6 of this Bill inserts a new section 8A, pursuant to which a surviving spouse whose pension entitlement is lost—and it might be perhaps clearer there to say `has been lost'—due to remarriage may apply to the Attorney-General for restoration of the pension.

         —The Senate today is discussing the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. The Bill makes a number of largely non-contentious amendments. The main amendments relate to the pension entitlement of a surviving spouse of a judge or retired judge upon remarriage. It is only these amendments which have any financial impact, albeit of a very minor nature. The provision for a pension to continue upon remarriage already exists for politicians and senior bureaucrats. Therefore, this piece of legislation is only correcting an anomaly in the legislation dealing with judges' pensions and is eminently equitable.

         It is interesting to note that judges do not contribute directly to a superannuation scheme, whereas politicians and senior bureaucrats certainly do.

        —The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is interesting and important legislation. The Bill deals with a very important subject; namely, that of conscription by Australians for the defence of our country. The legislation has a somewhat long background, going back to the Defence Act 1903. Modern events, which are the background to the amendments to the Act, in relation to conscription are very much influenced by the national service for the Vietnam war, the conscription which took place at that time and the after-effects of that experience, which resulted in a Senate committee inquiry and report. Indeed, there was a private member's Bill on one aspect of the subject by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate).

        As I have said, there is quite a long history behind this piece of legislation. The Bill deals with a very controversial subject, one which has been particularly controversial at times in our history—the period of the Vietnam war was clearly one such period. Of course, it goes back much earlier than that to the conscription debates of the First World War. Despite the very controversial nature of the subject, as well as its importance, I am pleased to say that the Opposition is supporting most of the provisions of this Bill. There is one important exception to that, but we will be supporting the second reading of the Bill. We have an amendment with respect to conscientious objection. Apart from that and one other relatively minor matter, the Opposition will be supporting the Bill.

        As I have said, the Bill is an amendment to the Defence Act. The Defence Act tackled up-front the question of conscription. Section 60 of the Defence Act provides that the Government may introduce conscription for service in the defence forces in time of war by means of a proclamation by the Governor-General. In its historical context, that was quite normal. The decision to go to war is a major Executive act. The question of conscripting forces for defence or war of any kind was clearly seen at that time, and since, as an Executive act. However, the Defence Act limited the power of the Governor-General by the issue of proclamation to time of war. War is defined in the Defence Act as:

       The power of conscripting Australians for national service is as it has been since the amendments in 1973. That legislation was post-Vietnam.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        That ability to conscript people for service is very limited. It applies only in the case of an attack or the threat of an attack on Australia by an enemy or armed force. I stress that at the forefront of my remarks on this Bill because it is vital to the Opposition's conclusions on this matter.

        The Government proposes to make a number of amendments to bring that basic provision of the Defence Act up to date and to modernise it. Before I deal with that, I refer to the recent history of conscription. In 1951, the National Service Act was passed to introduce national service and to require Australians specified in that Act to be available to perform national service for a time. National service is a subject which crops up a great deal in discussion on defence matters. A view that still commands quite a deal of support in Australia is that all young Australians should perform some form of national service for a period of their early lives. However, I do not propose to go into the position in the Vietnam war period.

        The Whitlam Government when first elected substantially repealed that National Service Act. However, it did not do so entirely, because there were people who had certain rights largely as a result of having been called up for national service. Therefore, the National Service Act was not entirely repealed. As a tidying up and modernisation operation, the first thing we should note about this legislation is that it now entirely repeals the National Service Act 1951. That clears the decks so that the piece of legislation which covers the question of conscription, and which should continue to cover it, is the Defence Act.

        The Defence Act was passed a long time ago. It set out in some detail who and what classes of citizens of Australia should be liable to be conscripted. As one might expect, at that time the Government was very much thinking of a large army. The view was that it should be a staged process, depending upon the exigencies of the requirement to defend Australia. For instance, it started off by saying that the first people to be called up would be unmarried males between 18 and 35. It then went down various classes to those who were married, those who were married without children and so forth, until finally the last order of people to be conscripted would be males between 45 and 60.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The Government's view, and the Opposition agrees with this, is that this is an outmoded approach. In modern war, with the high concentration on technology and sophisticated equipment, it may not be so necessary to have large numbers of people. Although if Australia were attacked by a determined and powerful enemy, we would certainly need a great conscription of manpower. But with regard to the nature of the threat or the invasion of Australia, it may not be necessary to go that far. It may be more important to be able to conscript in the first place certain people with technical qualifications.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The Government is proposing to scrap those provisions in the Defence Act and replace them with a power to make regulations. In other words, the Government would make regulations which would be more akin to the actual requirements of the day and the circumstances. That clearly is the way to go. No doubt it would be preferable for that to be included in the Act, but the very nature of flexibility that is required precludes these provisions now remaining in the Act. Instead, it is proposed that they should be in regulations.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        One other outstanding feature of the existing provisions of the Act is that conscription is limited to males who are British citizens, excluding Aboriginal Australians. These are referred to as the discriminatory elements of the Defence Act. It is proposed that they be removed and replaced by a general requirement that anyone who is a resident in Australia for at least six months and is between the ages of 18 and 60 could be conscripted in accordance with the regulations that we are enabling the Government to make. Again, that is a provision with which we agree. Clearly, the obligation should not be confined simply to males. Certainly anyone who has lived in Australia for at least six months should not be excluded. If such people have made a commitment to Australia and if Australia found itself in dire need of defence, people of all kinds should be available, provided they are within the ages of 18 to 60.

        I now come to one of the more controversial aspects of this legislation. Traditionally, imperial powers have felt they needed to conscript people for wider purposes than simply the defence of the mother country. Indeed, that view has been adopted to some extent in Australia from time to time. It has been a feature of laws relating to conscription that people with a genuine conscientious objection to war should be relieved of the obligation at least to serve as combatants. This legislation tightens up and clarifies—in a much better way than did the old Defence Act—the availability of claiming a conscientious objection to military service. Again, as with a lot of the proposals made here, the Opposition has no objection.

      <para first-indent="16">

        In particular, there is a much tighter definition of what is a conscientious belief. The Bill provides that there must be a fundamental conviction of what is morally wrong, not necessarily based on religious considerations. It must be of so compelling a character that a person feels that he or she has a duty to abide by it. It also has to be of a longstanding nature. That latter provision is one of great importance from a practical point of view in how far people would be able to succeed in claiming conscientious objection.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        We support what I see as a tightening up of the existing provisions. However, the Bill goes on to provide a new ground for exemption from compulsory service, and that is that the person claiming it may claim conscientious objection to the service in relation to a particular war or warlike situation. The Opposition does not believe that that is an appropriate provision to make in the Bill and we will be moving to delete it in the committee stage.

        We see this particular provision extending this area of conscientious objection as arising very much out of the circumstances of the Vietnam war. It was certainly very much to the forefront of the Senate committee which investigated this question and which, in fact, recommended that there should be available a conscience belief in these cases. But I come back to my original point. It has been overlooked that under the Defence Act we are now dealing with, the only power for conscription which a government will have—and has had for some time now—will arise in the very limited circumstances that Australia is invaded or is under the threat of invasion.

        So we are talking here about circumstances in which Australians are being asked to defend Australia itself—maybe our territories which are near the Australian mainland. So we will, if necessary, have to conscript people to defend their own country. In these circumstances we think it is unbelievable that people should be acknowledged to have the right of conscientious objection to actually defend their own country. It was much more a problem and much more relevant when Australians were being conscripted to serve way beyond Australia's shores or areas of direct military interest, as they were in the case of Vietnam, although there were many good arguments that they were performing a very important role for the ultimate defence of Australia. But the fact is that we have quite a different situation here. Quite clearly, under the Defence Act we would be conscripting people simply to defend Australia itself.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        There may be some debate on whether or not the circumstances of a threat to Australia are justified, but that matter is dealt with by the Government—and it is something that perhaps I should have mentioned earlier—providing in this legislation that Parliament itself should have to agree to a proclamation for conscription. That is certainly an important addition to the existing Act, which leaves that for an executive decision. This Act now will tidy that up and strengthen it, and say that there must be parliamentary approval for any such proclamation. That is important in relation to a government that comes along and says, `We want to conscript. Nobody is about to invade Australia but there is a real threat that there could be an invasion of Australia'. So that will not be left to the Executive but will be a decision for the Parliament.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        That having been decided by the Parliament, we believe that a person who wants to claim a conscientious objection would have to be able to establish a conscientious objection to participate in war itself or warlike operations. If the Government's proposal were accepted now to expand conscientious belief in the way this Bill does, we believe that it would be very difficult indeed to sort out whether people had political objections only, as against genuine objections. That would be a practical difficulty.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        It would also be very divisive for the community that people could, in fact, claim a conscientious objection when Australia was about to be invaded or, indeed, was invaded. If people were able to say, `No, I object to being invaded by this particular country but not another', that would be an impossible position to maintain as far as the morale of the whole community was concerned in the defence of Australia. To believe that people can pick and choose who would be a desirable or an undesirable invader, where one could have a conscientious objection to one country but not another, would be impossible to sell. Circumstances of that kind would create a tremendous division and affect morale in Australia, which would be very serious as far as the defence of the nation is concerned.

        For those reasons we see this situation now as quite different from the Vietnam situation or a similar type of situation. In these circumstances, all these factors which are great improvements and which we support—the modernisation of this legislation, its adequate definitions now of conscientious objection, and the need for parliamentary approval for conscription—are spoilt by this innovation which we will oppose.

Before I do, I would like to add to what Senator Durack said about the important removal of the antiquated legislation which only allowed certain classes of people to be conscripted to defend Australia. It is both right and proper that the legislation be amended to include all able-bodied men and women to come to the defence of this country if it is under threat.

Most people in those days worked in one job for 20 years or more and the DFRDB scheme reflected this, paying handsome benefits to those who served in the military for 20 years or more. The DFRDB has not kept up with society and the increasing mobility of the modern work force. People these days are more likely to change their job or their profession than not. The defence forces are not exempted.

        Most superannuation schemes now accommodate people in a transient work force. The DFRDB remains a good scheme only for those who served 20 years or more with the forces. It offers nothing to those who serve for less than 20 years. In fact, it is not even really a superannuation scheme. In recent years only approximately 27 per cent of DFRDB members have received any benefit at all and of those that do, only a small proportion—one in 194—receives full retirement benefits.

        The DFRDB does not meet the occupational superannuation standards. It is a compulsory 5.5 per cent of salary for all Defence Force members, paid directly into Consolidated Revenue rather than into an earning fund. Effectively, therefore, it is a $100m a year interest-free loan from defence personnel to the Government. It refunds members only their own contributions without earnings if they leave before 20 years. It includes a 3 per cent penalty for every year an officer leaves before the statutory retiring age, which means that they receive back less than their own contributions. Members of the Defence Force, by nature of their employment, have not been able to take a stand against such inequities. While the Government is coercing the private sector superannuation schemes into improving arrangements for the granting of employer contributions for those who resign early, the scheme which covers the nation's defence forces is being ignored.

        In 1989 the Opposition, in its defence science and personnel policy, announced that it would ensure that defence personnel were not disadvantaged compared to the civilian community in relation to superannuation. In developing our policy, we recognised that Defence Force members were not paid interest on their contributions and that for those leaving before the 20-year mark this was a gross injustice. Fortunately, the Government eventually recognised this too. The Opposition's persistence had been effective, and the Government being in a position to take action did so with the implementation of the MSBS—a considerably better superannuation scheme.

        The new scheme is something which I think deserves credit. The MSBS meets all the occupational superannuation standards. It pays interest on contributions—contributions which can be raised from 5 per cent up to 10 per cent as the member requires to suit his or her retirement needs. It has a very handsome government component which rises from 18 per cent to 28 per cent of salary and is fully government-vested after seven years. It includes a retention benefit of one year's salary taxed at the 15-year mark to encourage experienced service men and women to remain in service for another five years. There are many benefits under MSBS and Defence Force members should take the time to acquaint themselves with them.

        It surprises me to learn, as I did during the additional Defence appropriations at the Estimates Committee, that there was a lower than expected take-up rate for MSBS. Perhaps they were all waiting until the last minute, until September of this year when they must make a decision on whether to take it up or to stay with the DFRDB scheme. I am sure that an element of the problem is that for years the defence forces have learnt to distrust the Government and to be suspicious of decisions it makes. It has a bad track record and defence personnel are reluctant to believe it this time around.

        They only have to look back to 1986 when the Government legislated for a 2 per cent discount to be applied to the 1986 superannuation pension increase applied to government superannuation benefits payable to or in respect of former Commonwealth employees and Defence Force personnel. It effectively reduced the base on which superannuation pensions were to be calculated. Defence personnel were told that the 2 per cent discount of their superannuation pension would be restored once Australia's foreign debt, expressed as a proportion of GDP, was on a falling trend. I cannot imagine the Government trying to get away with doing this to one of the industry groups with union support. In 1989, after much pressure from the Opposition, the 2 per cent discount was restored. Inevitably, however, it leaves Defence Force personnel sceptical. Superannuation is their future and the Government has tampered with it before.

        Some who may want to stay in DFRDB because they are nearing the 20-year mark are worried in case they are made redundant before 20 years, at the 19-year mark. They will only get a refund of their contributions rather than a meaningful retirement income. During the Estimates hearing it was highlighted that this could lead to redundancies based on the type of retirement plan a member had rather than on the needs of the Force.

        My concern is whether defence personnel are receiving adequate advice. An amount of $2.7m has been budgeted over two years to assist defence personnel in making their decision. This money is primarily being used to fund a superannuation information group to provide counselling to defence personnel, but many do not seem to be aware of it. I am also concerned that some defence personnel are not taking the time to find out what best suits them—and each case is different. It infuriates me that some people misinterpret aspects of MSBS and then circulate the misinformation. What is worse is that people then take the misinformation as gospel rather than checking it out for themselves.

        I now turn to the specific amendments that this Bill makes to superannuation. They are basically housekeeping amendments. The first is an amendment to the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme Act of 1991. Section 47 of the MSBS Act personally indemnifies the trustees of the MSBS Board of Trustees, the Commissioner of Superannuation and the staff assisting the Commissioner from any action, liability, claim or demand arising from the bona fide performance of their duties or functions. These amendments extend the indemnity provisions to cover an acting trustee, a member of an incapacity classification committee, and a member of a reconsideration advisory committee.

        The Opposition was initially concerned about this amendment; indemnification from professional responsibility should not be allowed. However, we have since been advised that the amendments relate to personal indemnification only. The amendment does not affect the corporate liability of the Board as a whole, which liability is retained by section 47(2) of the Act.

        The second amendment in this Bill is to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. It amends subsection 14(3) of the DFRDB Act, enabling the deputy of the chairman of the DFRDB Authority to preside at meetings in the absence of the chairman, taking precedence over the deputy chairman. If that sounds like Alice in Wonderland stuff, I believe that it is. But the Bill also ensures that a quorum is maintained—obviously an important matter.

        Thirdly, the Bill amends the Defence Forces Retirements Act 1948.

Given that it did close in 1973, a number of provisions in the DFRB Act are now obsolete. These amendments repeal the obsolete provisions which deal predominantly with fund contributions.

        Before turning to the home loan amendments of this Bill, and before I leave the subject of superannuation, I think I should highlight a few of the Fightback initiatives which the Opposition proposes for the superannuation area and which will be of benefit to defence personnel. We will abolish all lump sum tax on superannuation pay-outs, abolish the absurd reasonable benefits limit, provide a 25 per cent tax rebate to all individuals who contribute or have contributions made on their behalf to superannuation funds up to $6,000 per year, and reduce the tax on employer contributions from 15 per cent to 5 per cent for those on incomes up to $55,000 per annum.

        The other amendments in this Bill relate to defence home loans. Firstly, the Bill makes amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990. The Defence Housing Authority Act, which establishes a home loans assistance scheme for members of the Defence Force, makes special provisions for incapacitated persons. The current definition in section 3 covers incapacitated persons who are discharged because of a compensable disability on or after the commencing day, which is 21 January 1991. An unintended consequence of this is that some incapacitated persons who joined the Defence Force after 14 May 1985—the cut-off point for eligibility under the old defence services homes scheme—and were discharged before 21 January 1991 are not covered by either the old or the new scheme.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The Bill amends section 3 to ensure that the definition of `incapacitated person' includes persons who are not currently covered by either scheme. The Bill also amends section 4 of the principal Act so that incapacitated persons who are affected by the amended definition have two years to exercise their entitlement. That is the same entitlement of all service personnel under this new Bill.

        Further, to have an entitlement to a home loan under the Act a member must be issued with an entitlement certificate. Section 13 enables certificates to be cancelled where they are found to be issued as a result of false or misleading statements or where entitlement did not exist. However, there is no provision to vary or reissue certificates in order to correct errors or omissions. The proposed amendment will enable the Secretary to the Department of Defence, who issues certificates, to vary or reissue them, effective from the time the original certificate was issued.

        Finally, the Bill amends the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 by amending the appointments by the Governor-General to the Authority to include the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) as the fourth member of the Defence Housing Authority. This move reflects a change in ADF higher structures. This, like all the previous amendments, will be supported by the Opposition.

        Before I conclude, I must emphasise that I remain dissatisfied that in introducing the new defence home loans scheme the Government removed the entitlement to a home loan for war service. The fact that it did so at the same time the former Prime Minister was waving the troops off to the Gulf war adds insult to injury. As it remains, Australians who enlisted since May 1985 and on operational service are killed, or injured and invalided out of the Services no longer have an entitlement to a war service loan and nor does their surviving spouse. This is the first time since 1918 that Australians in war have not had such an entitlement, and the Government should be ashamed. This will now be the case for our personnel serving in Cambodia.

Also, these service men and women will be given a lesser degree of coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Once they are no longer declared to be on operational service, the proof required will be more demanding under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The proof required is not just that they are serving in an operational area any more, but that their disease or injury was caused by that service. Sometimes, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know from constituents who come to see you, years down the track when the effects of disease or injury incurred in war finally start to show their long term effects, it is often quite difficult to prove the connection with the war service, the operational service, which caused the problems the veteran is enduring.

        I will comment briefly on the history of conscription in Australia. It is not generally realised that conscription has been a factor in Australia since Federation for very many years. It existed before the First World War; it existed in the 1920s; it existed, I think, in the 1930s after the Labor Government was thrown out of office after having given us the first Great Depression that it has given us this century; and it existed on two occasions—in the 1950s and in the 1960s—with two separate schemes. I am one of the few people in this Senate who have discharged a national service obligation and I value the experience that was afforded me by the obligations that were placed on me by the Government of that day.

        It is quite wrong to say that conscription was always a controversial issue in Australia. For example, the period of conscription from 1949 to 1959 was a period when there was no dissent about conscription of the Australian youth. There were no protests in the period before World War II, as I understand it. But the myth has been created by the Labor Party in light of the Vietnam experience that, somehow or other, conscription is always controversial and totally destructive of the good order of Australian society, so it cannot be entertained at all.

        There is a place for conscription in the life of a nation when it looks to its own defence. I do not think it is a high priority today. I think we have higher priorities in providing a basic defence force than conscription today. But I place on record that the view that is sedulously cultivated by the Labor Party that conscription has been a very divisive issue and an issue which has divided the Australian community is a false one, like most of the Labor Party's views of Australia's military history.

        The fact is that in today's climate around the world, of high technology weapons systems, we do really need a high degree of professional ability in the defence forces. We need specialist training to operate those systems and the short term commitment that national service or a conscription program provides really does not suit itself to  the provision of highly professional, highly trained forces that the countries of the Western world have now adopted.

        What goes on in the Asian region, of which we are part, is another matter. Conscription is practised by Singapore and various other Asian nations will practise it from time to time.

I certainly would not exclude the fact that the need for it might arise in the future.

        As I said before, I have a marked concern about the 90-day requirement for notification to be given, which I think limits the flexibility of the Government. Part of that relates to the definition of `war' contained in the Act. It defines `war' in terms of threats to Australia and an imminent Australian invasion. There are a couple of problems with that. The first is that countries seldom declare war these days. The old convention of a declaration of war, followed by the outbreak of hostilities and a peace treaty after the surrender of one side—sometimes unconditional surrender—has all disappeared. That is not the way armed conflict between nations is now conducted.

Clearly definable and demonstrable threats of that nature may well be impossible to demonstrate. It might well be an obligation on the Government to take prudent steps to reinforce Australia's defence capacity in the light of what are intangible threats. In certain circumstances some sort of conscription may be required to meet that threat adequately.

        I want to deal with the point about the objection to a particular war. It has been a basic part of our cultural values that we have always accepted the right of a citizen not to serve in the armed forces on the basis of sincerely held religious and moral beliefs. The presumption is that they are long term. The introduction of this clause, which allows a person to have a particular objection to a particular war and therefore not serve, is absolutely impractical and wrong-headed in my judgment. It would expose Australia to the risk that we would be very much divided on religious grounds. If we were being attacked by a Muslim force, the Muslim community may decide, for example, that it was not going to enter into armed conflict with its Muslim brothers.

        That would be extremely divisive for Australia because we have certain cultural values which do not admit those distinctions. We admit that someone on a sincerely held conscientious belief against the violence of war has a right to claim exclusion from conscription. As part of our cultural values, we also hold the belief that it is the business of all to defend the country in times of great need. I would respectfully suggest that this is one of the further examples of what we are seeing from the Government as part of its long history of an inability to cope adequately with the needs of Australian defence.

        Let us look at a statement made by the Prime Minister last week in an interview with Mr Greg Sheridan. He made accusations against Mr Menzies, Mr Page and the other members of the United Australia Party and its predecessors in the early part of the Second World War, before Menzies was pulled down by the Country Party revolt and Artie Fadden was put in as Prime Minister in 1941. As part of the Anzac Day celebrations last week, we were celebrating the New Guinea campaign. The Prime Minister makes the claim that it was Curtin and the Australian Labor Party that saved Australia, and that the predecessors to that Government had done nothing to contribute to the defence of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the 1930s under the Lyons Government, the United Australia Party started the rearmament program—in the face of intense opposition from the Labor Party. Eddie Ward, who bore an uncanny resemblance to the present tendencies of the present Prime Minister, was always saying, `We want to take that money from defence and spend it on welfare; it is criminal to be spending money on defence'.

        The United Australia Party, the predecessor of the Liberal Party, started the industrial expansion of a country that could not even build cars beforehand. It gave us the ability to build our tanks, engines, aircraft engines, ships, armaments and munitions. That was all up and going in 1941 when the Japanese attacked. It raised something like 12 divisions; there were 10 divisions in Australia when Japan attacked and two overseas. It raised an air force, which ultimately was the fourth largest in the world, and a sizeable navy. All of those things were done. And not one of them would have been done by a Labor government if it had been in power in the 1930s. The proposition that is being run before the uninformed people of Australia that somehow or other the Curtin Government and the Labor Party were the great saviours of defence is a travesty of the truth. I am not prepared to put up with the Prime Minister telling lies about the military history of this country. The matters are far too important for that.

        On the Cambodian issue, the Prime Minister said that Australian troops will not be at risk. They are at very great risk. It is very possible that some of those Australian troops, sadly, will be injured and some may be killed. I believe it is quite wrong for the Prime Minister to tell the Australian community that we are sending troops over there and that, if there is any sign of trouble, we will pull them out. That has two implications. It is misleading the Australian public to the extent that the Prime Minister is saying that those troops are safe and secure—as safe and secure as if they were in mainland Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth.

        The other side of the proposition is absolute nonsense. Our troops are integrated into a United Nations force. They provide a crucial function—communications. If things get difficult, if the Khmer Rouge, for example, play up, revolt and start the tricks that they have been at for the last 20 years in terms of armed warfare, does the Prime Minister really believe that the vital communications functions of the Australian Defence Force are going to be pulled out, that the Australians are going to cut and run and leave to their fate the Indonesians and all of the other members of the United Nations, who are probably in a combat role trying to quell what the Khmer Rouge are up to?

        The Prime Minister should be adult enough to say to the Australian people, `We believe that we have an obligation to the community of nations to support the United Nations in this effort. We will do all that we can to minimise the risk to the Australian contingent up there. But we must recognise that there is a risk and that they may pay with their lives on some occasions'. The Australian community is adult enough to accept that. Instead, we have all this dissembling from the Prime Minister that they will be pulled out if there is any trouble.

         The other misapprehension that the Prime Minister has created in the Australian community is that somehow or other Lieutenant-General Sanderson, an Australian general up there, will look after the Australian troops. Lieutenant-General Sanderson is the United Nations force commander. His obligations are to the United Nations; they are not to the Prime Minister of Australia. The commander of the Australian contingent up there is Colonel Stuart. He is the person who has the responsibility. He is the person who is answerable to the executive government of this country for the safety and welfare of the Australian troops. Again, it is misleading to say that because we have an Australian general up there, somehow our troops will be looked after.

        —The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is important legislation which seeks to amend the Defence Act 1903. The Bill is essentially about conscientious objection and conscription. This is one of those rare opportunities—perhaps this has happened only once in this decade—when there has been a philosophical debate about defence. To a large degree this major piece of legislation happens to have the support of all senators.

        The Defence Act provided for conscription in terms of the immediate defence of Australia. It was conceived at a time nearly 90 years ago when attitudes and ways of doing things were quite different. In the 1950s the National Service Act supplemented the Defence Act and provided for the calling up of Australian men for compulsory service. In particular, during the Vietnam War national servicemen were conscripted to serve overseas. This led to a heightened and increased interest amongst many in Australia about the questions of conscription and conscientious objection.

        Subsequently, in the 1980s a number of senators who were members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and who still had in mind the public debate that took place in the 1960s and the early 1970s helped produce a report entitled

         Conscientious objection to conscripted military service.

        The Government has taken the opportunity to pick up many of the recommendations of the Senate committee inquiry and to completely repeal the National Service Act and the National Service Termination Act 1972. I should note that the latter Act effectively did make null the National Service Act of 20 years earlier. But because there were certain provisions in the National Service Act that gave a benefit to those who had served as national servicemen, the Act was not completely removed from the books. Only the operative ongoing parts of that legislation that actually affected national service and call-up were terminated by the National Service Termination Act. After 20 years, neither of these pieces of legislation are of any further relevance. The legislation now before the Senate completely repeals these two Acts.

        I think any Australian reading section 59 of the major piece of legislation covered by the Bill now before us—the Defence Act 1903—would agree that it is completely outdated. Section 59 provides that all persons liable to serve in the Defence Force in time of war are male persons. Clearly, Senator Newman has said, the Opposition believes and the Government proposes that all persons, both male and female, would serve this country in the Defence Force in time of war. In fact, persons liable to serve now include all persons aged between 18 and 60 who have resided in Australia for not less than six months. So it is not only citizens but also permanent residents of this country who are in this category.

        Section 60 of the Defence Act sets out the classes of persons who would be, subject to proclamation, called up. This would perhaps happen in order of priority. It would be based on whether someone is single, married, or a widower and also a person's age group. I believe that it is quite appropriate not only to amend section 59 in the ways that are proposed in this legislation but also to remove the rather Aristotelian classifications of section 60—to allow classification to be appropriate and defined appropriately to meet the particular needs of any proclamation that would be used to call up persons. So the categories of priority for call-up in any defence of Australia from immediate invasion in the future will now be subject to regulation and will no longer be defined as they are in section 60 of the present Act.

        So far so good. These changes are supported by the Opposition. The other broad area of this legislation relates to the defence force retirement and death benefits scheme, the Defence Housing Authority Act and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme Act. My colleague, Senator Newman, directly addressed these aspects of the legislation. My colleagues and I readily agree with what she has said about the Act and about the Government's inadequacies. However, the Opposition agrees with the Government with regard to the precise legislative initiatives that are now before us.

        The matters that remain and which are contentious flow on from the agreed definition for `conscientious objection', the setting up of tribunals and the need for parliamentary approval for conscription proclamation. There is contention about conscientious objection to a particular war and to the provision of a 90-day limit in terms of any parliamentary approval. I will need to speak to these matters when the Senate resumes debate on this legislation.

She was in her ninety-third year and had been dynamic, active and energetic, keenly interested in current affairs generally and the status of women in particular from very young womanhood until she suffered a stroke which severely disabled her and led to her death.

         Irene Adelaide Driver was the daughter of a prominent member of the Womens Christian Temperance Union when that organisation was significant in persuading the Western Australian Parliament to extend the vote to women in 1878. Her mother, Adelaide Driver, was widely known as a prominent and effective woman of her time. Irene herself enthusiastically embraced her mother's feminism and activism. Her long life was dedicated particularly to the enhancement of the status of women, and no less passionately to the cause of world peace and disarmament long before it was fashionable or even acceptable to work as a peace activist. We sometimes forget that even the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom, of which Irene was a long time member, was considered seditious for many years. It took courage to be a member.

This occurred in the mid-1930s and Irene told me much later that the organising committee put her on the platform because it needed a woman and she was conspicuous because of her red hair.

         Her red-gold hair had become nearly white before I got to know her well when she was in her 70s.

Fortunately, in her latter years she had been systematically interviewed for the Battye Library oral history collection. A previous set of recordings which she herself had painstakingly made had been stolen, probably by children looking for tapes to play with.

As a result, the Australian League of Voters became an early affiliate and later the Women's Service Guild.

         Irene was one of the first professional women to be employed by the Western Australian Government in 1919, and she maintained an intense interest in the International Labour Organisation for many decades. As in all her activities, she was unceasingly determined to disseminate her knowledge and experience and imbue other women with enthusiasm for the United Nations and such agencies as the International Labour Organisation. For many years she was the leading force behind the celebration of International Women's Day in Perth. She has shown me programs dating back at least 40 years. The United Nations' Declaration on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, which used affectionately to be called DEDAW, was the focus of much of her formidable proselytising from the time of its genesis in 1948 until it became a convention in 1979.

However, Irene's greatest gift to me has been that sense of what has gone before: the struggles of generations of dedicated feminists against the barriers of entrenched bias against women, and social attitudes which denied them economic and political equality with men. For example, it is less than 20 years since the typical response of the media to issues concerning women was to sensationalise, trivialise, and/or ridicule. How wonderful that Irene lived to see the journalistic and editorial transformation that now ensures that concerns and achievements of women are treated as a matter of course and usually with dignity.

I am talking about the Australian best practice demonstration program and the satisfaction—if not pride—that I took from being asked to present the cheque for $200,000 as the first payment of a total of $420,000-plus grant to a firm called Hendersons Automotive in South Australia.

         It is probably best summarised by giving a small history of the firm. In 1985 the parent company of Hendersons Automotive South Australia recommended closure. Hendersons was paying big workers compensation bills, losing an average of 300 hours a month to injuries, 32 per cent of the work force was injured annually, staff turnover hit 120 per cent a year, absenteeism stood at 8 per cent and the company was facing substantial loss by the end of June 1986. Despite strong growth in the industry, this firm was unable to improve sales or make a profit. Under threat of closure, the 200 people in the firm committed themselves to rapid change.

         The indicators which forecast doom in 1985, today point to success. The firm is profitable, only one worker has suffered injury in the past 27 months, and that was a broken finger, absenteeism is well below 2 per cent and staff turnover has been slashed to 9 per cent. Each year this firm is spending $500 per employee on training, which is well above the national average, and there has been a 25 per cent boost in skilled labour without an expansion in the work force.

         The work that has gone into restructuring, and moving from what was the story in 1985 to the extraordinarily good performance in 1991-92 at Hendersons Automotive, has seen it become one of the international suppliers of its principal product, that is, seats for cars. It actually achieved a quality rating that allows it to compete successfully in the American car market—a quite extraordinary achievement for a small firm in South Australia. In September the firm received confirmation of contracts to supply seating components to three US car makers, Chrysler, General Motors and Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac. These contracts are the result of that drive to quality, the introduction of better practice management, having the huge expenditure on occupational disease and injury reduced to almost nothing now, a complete change in heart on the part of employees there and an extraordinary turnaround in attitude, job satisfaction and, as a result of that, productivity and performance.

         One of the particular points of interest to me were the stories of two women, which were only two of the stories which could be told of the women who work there. Linda Saberton is now 43 and married with three children and one grandchild. She is a former bank clerk who was forced out of her job in the 1960s by bank employment policies which discriminated against married women. Mrs Saberton said:

        It was bank policy that you had to resign when you got married. That was in 1967 and, after five years at home raising three children, I went out looking for a job and started at a car component maker on the production line as a process worker.

         The car industry operates under the `just in time' principle which means that the minimal amount of stock is stored and the maximum amount of stock is delivered as needed. That requires a very fine judgment of having all systems go and arriving at the right place at the right time to ensure that what is promised to be delivered is delivered. It requires a real commitment by all those involved in the work force to get their part of that production line in the right place at the right time. Mrs Saberton's job is to receive and check the orders, input all of that information into the computer, allocate componentry and labour hours to ensure that the company has the people and the parts in the right place at the time. She says it is very demanding because she has to be right. She cannot afford—and neither can the firm—to get that wrong. She said that as well as the satisfaction from doing that, doing it well and being satisfied and pleased with the success that she can contribute to, she was also delighted that she could share some of the stories of her employees with us. She said:

         I was also pleased to see the number of other staff who have actually had a change of heart and job satisfaction after going to work there.

         The other story of a woman that was particularly drawn to my attention—and I am pleased to pass these stories on—concerned Lynn McDonald who is 26 and a personnel officer at Hendersons Automotive. She joined Hendersons from the southern suburb of Christies Beach after high school in 1981 as a junior costing clerk and was working as a receptionist and payroll clerk when management asked her if she would like to study human resource management. In June 1990 she completed her advanced certificate in human resource management at the Adelaide College of TAFE after four years of part time study. She attended eight hours of lectures each week and the company contributed half as time off allowed during working hours. She said herself that she changed her view about what the prospects were for herself and, indeed, her own expectations for herself, as a result of being part of that work force which encouraged her to extend her capacity.

         Both of these stories indicate and illustrate beautifully by means of case histories the real, everyday examples of how a change in attitude towards best practice management, in collaboration with the changes in the workers in that firm, has resulted in a huge turnaround. Because of my interest in occupational health and safety, I was particularly struck by the dramatic reduction in accident and injury that has happened in that company. It is important to note that the fall in the number of accidents and injuries is an indication of a work force that is satisfied with what it is doing and feels constructive and productive at work. The number of accidents in the work place can be a measurement of unsafe equipment, et cetera, but very often it is also a measurement of dissatisfaction, less than optimal working circumstances or working climate, or attitude towards workers and what workers are contributing.

         This story is particularly significant in terms of the turnaround of occupational health and safety. It is very important to see that as one measure of the effects of best practice management. The other great measure, of course, is the improved productivity and the maintenance in a time of recession of all the 204 employees in the work force—that is the same number that has been there over those six years. While we are hearing stories of gloom and doom, we sometimes fail to note the success stories of the very sort that this Government's policies have been aiming to see implemented. Here is a really stunning example of the sort of thing that can emerge from best practice management. I am pleased to put on record the story of what has happened at Hendersons Automotive and also my congratulations to all involved in that success.

         In the backyard of her Coffs Harbour house, Dianne Marshall was sprayed with chemicals from a crop-dusting plane. She was pregnant; the baby died soon after birth. Last week I was given an outline of many instances of people, water supplies and rivers in and around Mungindi being sprayed. Mungindi is a cotton growing area in northern New South Wales near the border of Queensland. One sequence of events started in February 1985, and I have been told that:

        For the information of the Senate, I will describe what parathion is. It is a chemical which is used in fruit growing areas throughout Australia.

         The Australian Workers Union drew attention to two cases of poisoning last month in the Goulburn Valley where a grower and his wife were hospitalised. They had been using diluted parathion concentrate to spray fruit but they had not worn protective gloves. In the United States there have been 52 recorded deaths from parathion poisoning over 25 years. In Brisbane recently a handyman working at a nursery died after accidentally drinking a form of parathion from a Coca Cola bottle. An inquiry was announced earlier this year by the Victorian Minister for Food and Agriculture, Mr Baker, following complaints from the AWU that uncontrolled use of the chemical in Victoria's fruit growing areas was endangering the health of fruit pickers.

        This is the tiniest tip of a very big iceberg which I intend to persist with until governments take this issue seriously. A list has been accumulating in my office.

         —I rise to support a condolence motion moved in the other place earlier today by the honourable member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, and supported by the honourable member for Fadden, Mr Jull, regarding the death last week of Robert Noel Bonnett. He was the Federal member for Herbert from 1966 to 1977.

         The people of Townsville will long remember Duke Bonnett, as he was known to all and sundry, for his distinguished war record and the great improvements he brought to the Townsville region during his term as the Federal member. Duke Bonnett enlisted in the Australian Military Forces in March 1941. He served in the south-west Pacific between 1941 and 1943 with the 2/3 Independent Company and 2/3 and 2/9 Cavalry of the Commando Squadrons. He had a distinguished service record and was promoted in the field to the rank of lieutenant.

         Duke Bonnett died last week and his funeral service was held last Friday at the cathedral in Townsville. After Duke Bonnett left the Army but prior to entering Parliament in 1966, he was a timber cutter, a cane cutter and worked on many cattle and sheep stations in north Queensland. Immediately prior to his election, he was the field officer for the Liberal Party in north Queensland.

         He made a major contribution to the welfare of the Townsville region. Things like the Lavarack Army Barracks, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and a rehabilitation centre for the disabled all became a reality through Duke Bonnett's personal efforts during his 11 years as the Federal member. This period was a time of unprecedented expansion and progress in the Townsville region.

         With the support of Duke Bonnett, the James Cook University of north Queensland and the Yabulu nickel refinery were also established during his term in Parliament. He was a tireless advocate for the Burdekin Dam, the construction of which the Fraser Government committed itself to in 1981. Duke Bonnett was the shadow Minister for pensions, repatriation and housing between 1972 and 1974 and the Opposition spokesman for national and northern development. He served on parliamentary committees for Aboriginal affairs, wildlife conservation, public works and Defence Force retirement benefits.

         He announced his retirement from Parliament in August 1977 due to ill-health. He lived in Canberra for a little while and then returned to Townsville where he again devoted himself to the City through his involvement with the Returned Services League and other local charities. Duke was always a father-figure at special Liberal Party gatherings. I speak specifically for a member of my staff and on behalf of all Liberals in the Townsville region in extending their condolences and sympathies to his family.

         Duke was a very kindly man and one who was loved by all of those who came in contact with him. He helped to put the Liberal Party on the map in north Queensland and will long be remembered by his Liberal colleagues for his work for the Party in north Queensland and in the Federal Parliament.

         My personal association with Duke Bonnett goes back to 1965-1966. He was probably my first mentor, one might say, in party politics when I joined the Burdekin branch of the Young Liberals at the time when he was moving in that area as the Liberal Party field officer. He was a very kindly and a very supportive man. I can still clearly remember our great excitement in the Burdekin branch in 1966—in those days Burdekin was part of the Federal seat of Herbert—when Duke Bonnett won the seat, taking it from the Labor Party for the first time in many years. I can still remember the great excitement and parties at the time not only for winning it but also because a person as good as Duke Bonnett had won the seat and would be there to represent us in Canberra.

         He was a very genuine bloke and a very sincere person. He was genuinely concerned for people. He worked behind the scenes to get things done to help the little people in his electorate. It was for that reason that he was re-elected time and time again—I think some five times in the 11 years that he was in Parliament. My sincere sympathies, and those of my wife and Liberal Party people in north Queensland, go out to the family of Duke Bonnett who have survived him. The people of the north have indeed lost a great man. We have all been enriched by his contribution to life in the north, by his advice and kindliness and by his selfless devotion to those things he believed in. Well done, Duke.

        Accurate figures for June 1991 are not available. As at February 1992 there were 1,913 widows of service pensioners who elected to retain their service pensions beyond the 14-week bereavement period. Of these some 1,738 would appear to also be eligible for an age or other pension from the Department of Social Security. If these widows decided to take up their eligibility the extra cost would be in the order of $2.49m per annum.

        (1) All chemicals whether farm, industrial or household products have potential dangers if due care is not taken with their use. In particular, agricultural chemicals used in pest and disease control are biologically active and can pose a risk to users and the environment if not properly handled including safe application and disposal. Products containing 2,4-D may be safely used in agricultural, industrial and domestic situations provided the directions on the label are observed.

This assessment involves the review of extensive scientific information by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC), Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and other expert bodies. The review process is coordinated by the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council (AAVCC).

        NHMRC is responsible for the evaluation of the public health aspects of agricultural chemicals.

        (3) There is potential for all agricultural chemical products to be misused. State legislation, however, makes it an offence to use an agricultural chemical product for a purpose or in a manner contrary to the approved label directions which have been determined following evaluation of the products safety and performance. Farmers are continually reminded of their obligation to use all pesticides in a safe and proper manner and routine monitoring of food commodities for pesticide residues by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and State agencies indicates that there is a high level of compliance with label recommendations. Should incidents occur which may indicate misuse or inappropriate use, eg chemical spray drift damage, then these are investigated by State authorities and corrective action initiated. Penalties for misuse can be severe.

        (1) No. As I outlined in response to Senator Powell's question in the Senate on 16 May 1991, it is the Government's judgment that it would not be appropriate for the Government to extend guest of government status to the Dalai Lama. Given the Dalai Lama's association with the `Tibetan government in exile', the Australian Government could only accord him guest of government status were we willing to support a bid by the Tibetan people for independence from China, which we are not.

        (1) The report of the Review Committee identified three cost penalties associated with the operation of the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) Tasmania facility. First, there is a financial cost penalty of the order of $400,000 per year. Second, the staff bear a cost penalty in terms of the limited career opportunities attendant with working at a small, isolated, highly specialised establishment. Third, there is a cost penalty to management in terms of reduced flexibility in redeployment of staff to meet the changing priorities of the research and development program in support of the ADF.

        1. Financial guidance relates to the "above the line" component of Defence outlays. This component covers outlays on continuing activities or costs over which Defence has control, and forms the base on which the Government's real growth decisions are made. "Below the line" items such as Service pensions, compensation, customs duty and supplementation for the Gulf War and Cambodia Peacekeeping are not part of this base.

        2. The deflator used to update current to constant Dec 1991 prices is the Gross Non-Farm Product Implicit Price Deflator. This method is used in the annual Budget papers and is applied to both above the line and below the line components of the Defence budget. A better measure of real growth in Defence outlays however excludes below the line items and utilises actual defence price deflators. Based on this approach the real growth outcomes since 1976-77 have been included.

        (2) Previously 30% of all Army enlistees reported that they were directly influenced by advertising. A further 42% were influenced by friends and relations where advertising played a secondary role. For 1991-29 Feb 92 some 47% indicated a direct effect of advertising while 32% indicated the effect of friends and relatives with advertising secondary. The changes to previous percentages are primarily due to the Ready Reserve which comprised some 66% of all Army enlistees to date for 1991-92 and the high profile campaign undertaken for Ready Reserve recruiting and the very strong effect of that campaign (60%). RAN and RAAF figures are not available.

        (5) It is estimated that approximately 60,000 people in Western Australia, and 700,000 in Australia, suffer a level of hearing loss that would benefit from amplification.

        This action was taken by the Government as the inclusion of these Acts would result in the possible cancellation of many benefits available to ex-servicewomen. Primarily, under these Acts an ex-servicewoman can apply for an Income Support pension, subject to the same eligibility criteria as applied to their male counterparts, five years earlier than ex-servicemen. Australian ex-servicewomen who served during the WWII conflict and have qualifying service receive medical treatment at Repatriation Commission expense by virtue of their war time service. Male veterans conversely can only receive medical treatment through the Repatriation Commission if they meet specific eligibility criteria.
