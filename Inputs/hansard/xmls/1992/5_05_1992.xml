         The UN requirement is a temporary measure to meet an urgent need which will also allow the United Nations to get a permanent movement organisation in place without jeopardising the implementation of the settlement plan. The component will comprise nine teams of three specialist movement officers plus a coordination element. They will be deployed widely within Cambodia at major sea and airport locations and in Bangkok. The movement control group will be drawn from the three services. It will be ready to move to Cambodia by the end of this week. Costs will be met from the $49m allocated for Australia's UNTAC contribution.

Secondly, did the Minister or Mr Warren Anderson, who arranged the Minister's meeting with Mr Meissner and at whose home a subsequent meeting with Mr Meissner took place in 1986, provide any inducements to Mr Meissner sufficient to result in the documents and photographs that had been offered for sale to Mr Sturgess being withdrawn from sale?

         What happened on this occasion was that the now Director of the Cabinet office in New South Wales, with the express approval of the shadow Attorney-General and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, got one hundred grand and put it in a suitcase. I do not know where he got the one hundred grand from. I would be fascinated to know. Perhaps Senator Baume can enlighten us on that. Where did it come from?  The hundred grand was then taken to the office of a solicitor by the name of Barwick, a well-known name, one might say.

         I found it extraordinary when that story started doing the rounds in Sydney years ago and I thought it would not be a bad idea to find out to just what depths Sturgess and his colleagues might have gone. But, then again, I should have gotten the hint from the way Senator Baume has carried on here and from the way he slandered the Speaker yesterday; an apology for that should be forthcoming, and should be forthcoming now.

I can remember a series of documents, which causes terrible embarrassment, that I had signed clearances for dead people to move from one branch to another, and these were supposed to be being offered for sale. What Senator Baume has probably conveniently forgotten is that I did a number of interviews at the time explaining that, in the Labor Party office, the General Secretary simply certifies that a branch secretary is sending a transfer. I am sure there were documents. There were probably lots of documents. They did not scare me one little bit. I said so at the time. I anxiously awaited their production; they were never produced.

Senator Panizza would know that we are now able to get mortgages at rates of about 9 per cent. Secondly, the median price of first homes has fallen. That must be very gratifying to those of us who wish to encourage young couples, in particular, to make their first home purchase. Home buyers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are benefiting, therefore, not just from falling interest rates but also from lower house prices. On a national basis, the median price of a first house fell from $118,700 in December to $114,200 in the March quarter. This is good news. But, of course, the Opposition has a policy which will only increase house prices.

         —The honourable senator has asked the question and I will answer it. The Parliament is now familiar with the fact that the Opposition would force up the cost of new houses by about $3,000 by imposing the GST on them. That is a very simple proposition. In addition, the Opposition would lift the cost of agents' and solicitors' fees by 15 per cent—that is, 15 per cent on the fee for the real estate agent and 15 per cent on the conveyancing fee for the lawyer. As I have said, that is added on to the impost of GST on the new houses. It is quite clear. What about the cost of furnishings and other additions to the house? The Senate can see how these would all add up. These price hikes would wipe out the gains made by home buyers over the last six months.

         Senator Hill interrupted me when I was making an important point about what Mr Addis, the Director of the Tasmanian Forest Industries Association, had to say. He said that the decision:

        . . . signals to the international banking and financial communities, or it would have signalled that Australia was providing security for one of its major industries, it legitimises wood production in native forests and it sets in place scientific processes for decision making. Now all of that is very real, it is of great benefit. They weren't prepared to take that and say, `well, whatever else we want we'll work for in the future'. They said we want it all now or nothing, and in my view that's unforgivable.

        The Tasmanian Minister had something to say about that too when he referred to an argument which was advanced here by, amongst others, Senator Archer, that the Bill did not guarantee a pulp mill in Tasmania. Mr Rundle, the Tasmanian Minister, responded to that with this comment:

        What has that got to do with it, for somebody who is not a totally opportunistic politician? The lead times for any major projects like this are huge and the window of opportunity is not very great. So Dr Hewson is on record this morning as saying that the project would not have started before the next election. He has a fixation with the next election, and he ought to have. When he goes to Tasmania to explain the coalition position on this matter, he ought to have a fixation with the next election. He will have to do better in explaining this matter than he did with the GST, both in Tasmania and throughout the rest of Australia.

         I cannot believe that it is the same man who was saying a little while ago that this project had to go ahead. Now he is saying that it would not have gone ahead until after the next election in any event. It is a disgraceful performance by the Opposition. It requires a lot of explanation and we will be making sure that the community gets it.

If he can, why has the Minister not shown this on the register of Ministers' interests, given that the value of the use of the apartment and car is obviously more than the relevant $100 figure and that, clearly, an appearance of conflict of interest may be seen to exist in such gifts being provided to a Cabinet Minister by a wealthy businessman?

Excluding South Africa, the cost of the needed corn and its transport will exceed $US2 billion. Much of this will need to be provided as food aid by donors because the countries affected have limited or no resources with which to pay for commercial imports.

Anyone who looks at the figures around the nation realises that there are an enormous number of radio stations losing money. Consequently—I am not sure whether it was the day before; I would have to check the dates—I did ask that a supplementary licence be looked at as an alternative in Lismore.

I believe it is important to recognise that under the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse and the Drug Offensive strategy there is a very clear realisation that if Australia is to deal with drug abuse, it must do so by a combination of means, including education, preventative programs and health and rehabilitation programs for those who are the victims of such abuse.

         It is relevant in this context to note that nursing home care in a State Government nursing homes is a lot more expensive than in a non-government home. My advice is that the latest information available to the Commonwealth on the cost levels in Tasmanian Government nursing homes puts this cost at approximately $170 per resident per day. The difference between the frozen benefit level to State Government homes and the rate applied to non-government homes is overshadowed by this operating cost level. The Tasmanian Government could make considerable savings by addressing these high cost levels.

        In May 1988, applications were called for an FM licence in the Lismore area. Two applications were received from interested parties. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal conducted its hearing into the granting of the licence and, after waiting for a relevant decision from the Federal Court, the decision was handed down in December 1989 granting the licence to a syndicate named Northern NSW FM Pty Ltd. A legal challenge was then mounted asking for a re-hearing of the case. This was eventually granted.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Another legal challenge was mounted and eventually the re-hearing was set for 9 March 1992, four years after the applications were originally called for. At this meeting, the ABT received a request from radio station 2LM, the current AM licence holder in Lismore, to further delay the decision while it applied for a supplementary licence. This supplementary licence, if granted, would give 2LM control of both AM and FM bands in the Lismore area. This proposal comes four years after the original applications were called for.

        Also at the ABT hearing it was revealed that Senator Richardson had written to the ABT, in this letter that I am holding, requesting that it consider the supplementary licence application in conjunction with the present hearing of the ABT. This, of course, would further delay the decision of the ABT.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        At the time of Senator Richardson's letter, only a day before the hearing, the Minister had not received an application for the supplementary licence. It is completely unreasonable for the Minister to intervene to help a Johnny-come-lately at the last minute stage of the ABT proceedings. The process has been dragging on for four years and, just as the ABT hearing is about to conclude, the Minister intervenes on nothing more concrete than an assurance from an interested party that it would apply for a supplementary licence.

        Fortunately, the ABT hearing continued as scheduled. However, a decision has still not been handed down by the ABT regarding the granting of the FM licence in Lismore. The ABT hearing concluded two months ago. As of this morning, the ABT had still not received any application for a supplementary licence. Therefore, the question immediately arises: what exactly is preventing the ABT from making its decision on this issue? The only answer can be the intervention of the Minister.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The question then arises: on what grounds does the Minister intervene? The law, as it stands, requires that the ABT grant an independent licence if the market can support such a licence. The ABT has already ruled that this is the case in the Lismore market. Therefore, if the ABT is to give 2LM a supplementary licence, it must award an independent licence as well. It would therefore not prejudice the 2LM case for a supplementary licence if the ABT were to award the independent licence now and stop this ridiculous delay.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        It is also seriously questionable whether the ABT can actually hear a simultaneous hearing in this situation due to the sequence of events. For a simultaneous hearing to occur, an application for a supplementary licence must be lodged at the time of the notice of calling for applications for an independent licence or when an application for a supplementary licence is received the Minister must publish a notice calling for applications for an independent licence. Clearly, neither of these situations has occurred as the ABT still has no sign of the supplementary application. The Minister had not received the application by 6 March—almost four years after the original notice.

The people of Lismore have been waiting for four years for an FM radio service, a technology that has been available to the rest of the world for 40 years. The applicants for the licence, the people of Lismore and, by association, the people of Australia deserve a detailed and adequate explanation of the Minister's actions and an immediate resolution of this matter.

         Very briefly, I draw attention to the fact that the key findings of the audit were that absenteeism—that is, sick leave, special leave and short term leave without pay—accounted for about 6 per cent of the available staff working days, representing an annual salary cost of about $30m. This compares with an Australian industry work force average rate of only 4.5 per cent, dramatising the fact that staff savings and increased productivity could be achieved if the level of absenteeism was reduced to the Australian average, let alone to a better figure than that.

          The Auditor-General's report notes that the Australian Taxation Office has recognised the need to monitor overall absenteeism rates and identify, where possible, the causes of absenteeism. It further notes that the Australian Taxation Office had devolved attendance recording responsibilities to sectional management without identifying and documenting the risks and benefits of doing so. The Australian Tax Office has agreed to conduct a post-implementation review of the devolution of control over attendance recording.

          The final basic finding of the report was that there was a need for improvement in management control over attendance and leave recording. Attendance records were subject to limited checking by sectional management and leave taken was not always properly recorded on staff leave records. As a result, it was found that staff absence entitlements could be exceeded.

          There is always a risk that within the public bureaucracies, particularly when there is flexitime, there is scope for a considerable amount of absence, both formal and informal. The Australian Auditor-General has quite properly pointed to the extent to which formal absences in the Australian Taxation Office have exceeded the Australian average. Clearly as a result that is a matter of some concern.

         Report No. 31, the Auditor-General's project report into the use and management of consultants by the Australian Taxation Office, is very damning. In 1990-91 the cost to the Tax Office of the consultancy services that it engaged was, according to the Auditor-General, a figure in excess of $8m. In fact, according to the table on page 2 of the report, the figure was $8.7m, which compares with a figure of only $5m the year before. So in the year 1990-91 the increase in the cost of consultancy services was a huge 74 per cent. I note that the findings of the report relate to issues other than the actual cost of the consultancy services. Nevertheless, I draw the Senate's attention to that very high cost of consultancy services engaged by the Australian Taxation Office and the enormous increase that occurred in 1990-91.

          The more significant fact is the finding of the Australian National Audit Office that the Tax Office had not formally implemented administrative arrangements for the purchasing, managing, monitoring and reporting of consultancy services until December 1991. Indeed, in many instances it had not complied with the guidelines for the contracting of consultancy services.

          In October 1988 the Government endorsed a range of purchasing reforms. Those reforms included the issuing of guidelines, by the authority of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) under finance regulation 42 on, amongst other things, best purchasing practices and techniques. The guidelines arising from the purchasing reforms included a guideline on the contracting for consultancy services. That was issued by the Department of Administrative Services in November 1990. That guideline outlines the required practices and responsibilities for planning, acquiring and managing consultancy services.

          The time gap of three years and two months between the reforms announced by the Government in the area of purchasing until the Tax Office's compliance with them in December 1991 is a very concerning finding of the National Audit Office. Why on earth was a delay of that nature incurred? It is very important in terms of government purchasing practices generally—this applies perhaps even more so than in other areas of government purchasing—that there be seen to be transparency in the relationship between government and its suppliers. That applies particularly in the area of consultants, where we have seen so many examples over recent years of members of the public sector and members of government departments resigning on a Friday and starting work as a consultant on the Monday, often employed as a consultant by the very organisations from which they have resigned just the week before. I am not suggesting that that has happened to any considerable extent in the Taxation Office. That is not clear from the Audit Office report.

          Transparency in the Government's use of consultants is of primary importance. The fact that there was a three-year delay between the issuing of these reforms by the Government and their recognition and adoption by the Australian Taxation Office is extraordinary and disturbing. When there is not transparency, there is always the opportunity for corruption, or for the less than efficient use of taxpayers' funds. If there is not open competition in the advertising for consultants and the appointment of consultants, there is obviously scope for government money to be spent in a less efficient way than it should be spent.

          One of the key recommendations of the Audit Office is that the Australian Taxation Office, where practicable, follow competitive selection procedures for the engagement of consultancy services as outlined in the necessary directives, and that where this is not practicable the reasons and authority for not doing so should be properly documented. It was a matter of necessity that the Tax Office apparently agreed with that recommendation. It is a matter that we will be watching very closely to ensure that it follows the recommendation of the Audit Office.

          The other aspect that concerns me—I would assume it would concern every taxpayer, particularly those taxpayers who have been subject to increasing vigilance by the Tax Office and the Taxation Commissioner in recent years—is that many taxpayers have been hounded and harassed by the Tax Office for the mildest of misdemeanours, if any, and in many cases for unconscious omissions or transgressions as a result of filling in the tax forms. The taxpayers of Australia have been hounded progressively over recent years, as has been discussed here many times, and often apparently in an unfair way. To find that the Tax Office, whilst pursuing that purity of approach in relation to taxpayers, has itself, in such an important area, for whatever reason, neglected to adopt the principles, procedures and reforms laid down by the Australian Government in relation to the engagement of consultants, smacks of hypocrisy and massive double standards. The Tax Office stands condemned for its failure in this area.

          —Report No. 31 of the Auditor-General concerning the Australian Taxation Office is very timely in that it, along with the series of reports concerning the Australian Taxation Office, coincides with the inquiry being conducted by the Public Accounts Committee into the Australian Taxation Office. We have also had the opportunity of questioning the Australian Taxation Office during Estimates hearings, where we saw massive evidence that that Office has set one standard for taxpayers and left its own standards or its own housekeeping in the most appalling disorder. Indeed, Mr Boucher has gone on record as saying that many small businesses in particular fail to keep adequate records. In the Estimates Committee hearings we saw that the Australian Taxation Office itself had fallen far short of the mark in relation to anything like adequate record keeping.

          In dealing with consultancies, this particular report draws two important matters to our attention. The first is the manner in which the Australian Taxation Office has gone about adhering to procurement guideline No. 13, issued in November 1990, and the second is the manner in which it adhered subsequently to the Commissioner's own directives, subject to that guideline, as to how the Taxation Office is to behave in the selection and employment of consultants. As my colleague Senator Short has outlined, adherence has been lacking. He drew particular attention to the fact that every year the Taxation Office—along with all government departments and agencies—is required to publish a list of the consultants it has employed, the tasks involved and how much they were paid. The worrying thing here is that, as the Auditor-General points out, only $5m worth of consultancy has been reported while $8m was in fact spent in the relevant period. Again, this is a blatant lack of proper record keeping.

          In addition, it draws attention to the fact that the way in which the Government has gone about procuring goods and services since the change in the method of procurement, as set out by DAS, has led to a most unsatisfactory situation. We have seen more and more large contracts let where there has been no tender process and where one could say, perhaps unfairly in some cases, that there has been the selection of somebody's four first best friends or two first best friends—two people who cannot compete—and confidence in the method of procurement has been left wanting.

Again and again we are seeing examples through committees of scrutiny where those necessary adjuncts, the process of open and effective competition, really seem not to have been relevant to the choice in the way a contract has been let. In relation to this report, the Australian Tax Office's annual report showed that, of 325 consultancies, 81 per cent had been engaged without either a selective process or being advertised publicly.

          We had the most extraordinary example in the hearings of Estimates Committee A dealing with DITAC, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, where a contract to the value of $169,000 was awarded to one Mr Paul Batchelor, a former director of the Westmex Corporation, who did not even write a report in return for that $169,000. The Deputy Secretary to the Department, Dr Bell, regarded the contract as a shoe leather contract where there was no anticipation of a so-called glossy report being furnished at all. That was Dr Bell's testimony to the Estimates hearing. Subsequently I received further answers from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce that said that Mr Batchelor had, in fact, prepared a conceptual paper.

          That is very interesting, but for $169,000 I think the taxpayer is entitled to expect more than a conceptual paper for a contract which was first described by Dr Bell as a shoe leather contract. Indeed, the result of that was that the same Mr Batchelor was made a director of a company on which the Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Chairman of the AIDC sit and was meant to administer that $1 billion fund which never eventuated. What curious machinations are going on in our method of procurement!  I hold the Ministers responsible in these areas. The public servants are overseen under our system by the Ministers. They make the policy and they are responsible for ensuring that there is proper administration within their own departments.

          Here we see in this Taxation Office report reams of evidence that the Taxation Office simply has not been complying with either the Government's requirements as to the way in which consultancies are administered or the internal directions of the Commissioner himself.

It tells us at the end of the day that the administration of the Department seems to have been largely left to its own purview and that the ministerial oversighting is itself lacking.

One is with regard to the current unelected Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when he failed to lodge his tax return. All he got was a letter saying, `Tut, tut. Naughty boy. Please pop it in'. It is a bit like Senator Richardson. He forgets to declare that he was a director of a certain company when he is obliged to. It is selective morality, if you like.

          On the other hand, in relation to Mr Phillip Smiles, who had a disagreement with the Commissioner of Taxation over the question of apportionment, which is a fairly common argument that the Commissioner has with other taxpayers, the Commissioner has chosen to prosecute Mr Smiles under the Crimes Act as distinct from the Tax Administration Act, which would be the normal way to proceed where a fine would ensue. The blatantly political way which has been chosen—to go under the Crimes Act and therefore imperil his seat in the Parliament—can only be seen to be what it is. It has been seen to be selectively moral in that it allows Mr Keating to get off scot-free, yet Mr Smiles is to be put into jeopardy.

Here we have the Auditor-General telling us in a series of reports, both these reports No. 30 and No. 31, that the manner in which the Taxation Office is conducting its own affairs is far from satisfactory. Indeed, going back to the Estimates hearings, we heard evidence from one Mr Butterfield, who was responsible for beginning an inquiry into the Taxation Office to see who had breached section 16 of the taxation legislation, which requires secrecy. When he was required to carry out an inquiry as to where that leaking of information had come from, he reported to the Estimates Committee that he had been advised that it was not the Tax Office and, therefore, he thought he was absolved, like Pontius Pilate, of any responsibility. But then he went on to tell us that he did not even bother to read the report. Here was a department that had a report, locked it up in a safe and nobody read it. That department thought it was absolved of all responsibility. It is not good enough.

          That is better, I suppose, than the example of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce where, for $169,000, no report was even written. We were told subsequently—this is the curious shoe leather contract—that there were just a few odds and sods of papers. One does get a sense of great disquiet. It has always been said that there is no room in the public sector for corrupt behaviour, yet we heard, again in Estimates hearings, from the Tax Office that 35 tax officers were subject to fraud prosecutions. There is plenty of scope in an area where there is $8 billion worth of procurement annually.

          I say it again: the responsibility must sheet back to the Ministers responsible. We must start asking the questions. If the administration of these departments is so bad and so sloppy, the Minister's head is the one that has to be asked for. More and more we will be looking very specifically at the way in which Ministers are oversighting their departments and taking responsibility for what is going on. They are sworn in as members of executive government to take that responsibility; they are paid in accordance with that responsibility; they answer here in Question Time, often in a facetious manner, without conveying information. Nonetheless, at the end of the day it is they who are responsible.

         The Government recognises that nuclear science and technology can be used in many ways which are beneficial to Australia. It was specifically to encourage the safe, peaceful and beneficial use of nuclear science and technology that the Government, in 1987, legislated to revise the charter and change the name of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That legislation established the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto). Its principal functions are to undertake research and development in relation to nuclear science and technology, the use of isotopic techniques and nuclear radiation for medicine, science, industry, commerce and agriculture, and the production and use of radioisotopes. Also, Ansto is required to encourage and facilitate the application and utilisation of the results of such research and development.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Radioactive Materials and Waste
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Ansto has conditioned, stored and managed radioactive materials and wastes for many years both on its own account and on behalf of other parties. However, this activity was recently challenged when the Sutherland Shire Council took action in the NSW Land and Environment Court. It sought, inter alia, to restrain Ansto from transferring to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories (LHRL) 17 cubic metres of radioactive waste from the St Marys site of Australian Defence Industries (ADI), and to require Ansto to remove from LHRL some 2,000 cubic metres of radioactively contaminated soil from the former CSIRO site at Fishermans Bend, Victoria. These wastes were to be stored at LHRL pending the construction of a national repository for radioactive wastes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The issue before the Court was whether the storage was in accordance with the provisions of the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. Safety was conceded as not being an issue. The judge accepted that LHRL is presently the safest site in Australia for the storage of such material.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In his decision on 5 February 1992, Mr Justice Cripps found in favour of the Council. His ruling, inter alia, restrained Ansto from transferring the ADI wastes to LHRL and ordered Ansto to remove the CSIRO wastes within three years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One effect of these orders is to prevent Ansto providing certain services essential for public health and safety.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These include, for example, bringing to LHRL for repair packages containing radioactive substances which have been damaged in handling at airports. Such services are obviously in the public interest. In the circumstances, the Government has decided that Ansto's powers in this area must be placed beyond doubt.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments accord Ansto the function of conditioning, managing and storing radioactive materials and waste from its own activities or from companies in which it has a controlling interest. The function extends to other radioactive substances from persons who are specified in regulations, thereby allowing Parliamentary scrutiny where such cases arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments respect the order of the NSW Land and Environment Court that Ansto must remove the CSIRO waste from Lucas Heights by 5 February 1995. In addition, the ADI waste cannot be moved to LHRL except by specific regulation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The judgment of the NSW Land and Environment Court has focused attention more sharply on the need for a permanent repository for Australia's low level radioactive wastes. My colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, has been actively seeking the co-operation of the State and Territory Governments in locating areas for investigation to identify a suitable site.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has ordered a full investigation of the technical, legal and other issues concerning the conditioning, management and interim storage of the ADI and CSIRO wastes. A report will be prepared by December 1992 identifying all practicable options. These actions clearly demonstrate that the Government has no intention of allowing the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories to become, de facto, a national radioactive waste repository.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Commercial Activities
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government decided some time ago that public research institutions such as Ansto should be encouraged to become more commercial in their orientation and activities. Ansto has made good progress in this direction. The proportion of non-Budget revenue in its total revenue reached 30 per cent in the 1990-91 financial year—two years ahead of schedule.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, the Ansto Act constrains the extent to which Ansto can make further progress. The Act may not be sufficiently specific, for example, to provide for Ansto's development and operation of its Business and Technology Park.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These amendments will ensure that Ansto has a statement of functions which permits it to carry out fully the Government's intentions regarding the commercialisation of its activities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Immunity from certain State and Territory Laws
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The degree to which Ansto, a Commonwealth instrumentality situated in the State of New South Wales, is legally bound by NSW laws is a complex issue. The policy of successive Commonwealth Governments is that such instrumentalities are to operate consistently with all State laws where there is no existing, parallel, Commonwealth law and where those laws do not directly conflict with the existing Ansto Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, advice has been received from the Attorney-General's Department that the Ansto Act does not provide that Ansto is a Commonwealth agent or emanation. Ansto may, therefore, be fully subject to the laws of the State of New South Wales.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commonwealth has never intended that Ansto should be fully subject to State laws. Indeed, this situation is unacceptable as it may impair Ansto's ability to carry out its functions properly and may even be prejudicial to safety.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Accordingly, Ansto is to be provided with immunity from certain classes of State and Territory laws. Similar clauses are included in the legislation which established ADI and the Civil Aviation Authority. On the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, the proposed amendment is to apply retrospectively.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Once again, the amendment respects the judgment of the NSW Land and Environment Court in that it contains a clause excluding the CSIRO waste from immunity after 4 February 1995.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Nuclear Safety Bureau
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Ansto Act established a Nuclear Safety Bureau which is responsible to the Minister for monitoring and reviewing the safety of any nuclear plant operated by the Organisation. The Ansto Board appoints the staff of the Bureau and may assign it other functions to perform.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In practice, the NSB has operated with complete independence of Ansto's management. However, the structure of the Act means that the independence of the NSB is open to question. The Government has decided, therefore, to amend the Act to ensure that the NSB is independent of Ansto de jure as well as de facto.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new NSB will have the principal functions of monitoring and reviewing the safety of any nuclear plant owned or operated by Ansto, and of providing technical advice to the Commonwealth on the safety of nuclear plant and related matters. It will be funded directly by Parliamentary appropriation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Administrative Matters
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These Sections of the Bill tidy up a number of administrative matters. They deal with matters such as employment conditions for the Executive Director of Ansto, and the setting of a realistic maximum monetary level—$1,000,000—for contracts which Ansto can enter without Ministerial approval.

        Financial Implications

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments have only minor financial implications. Additional costs in the order of $150,000 annually will be incurred on an on-going basis to cover added administration costs associated with separating the NSB from Ansto.

        The indemnification provided by making the oral evidence—and in the case of section 68(3) of the ASC law the signing of the record and the production of a document—inadmissible in criminal proceedings is described as a use immunity. The person is also indemnified against the use of evidence gained indirectly from leads provided by answers to questions or documents produced to the investigators. This is what is described as derivative use immunity.

         The ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions claim that this places an insurmountable obstacle in the way of successful criminal prosecutions. This is because, in the interests of preserving the assets of a company, or otherwise minimising the loss resulting from mismanagement or fraud, the ASC will seek to act quickly through civil actions in the first instance. The ASC is concerned that, by using its powers to compel evidence in order to seek civil remedies, it will be prevented from obtaining admissible evidence which could be used in subsequent criminal prosecutions. The ASC and the DPP provided to the Committee a number of cases where they had moved down the track of a broad investigation and had then come across instances where future potential criminal proceedings may be in order.

         The ASC and the DPP have recommended to the Committee that both the use immunity and the derivative use immunity be removed from the corporations law and the ASC law, which is effectively a return to the provisions of the old Companies Code. The main arguments that have been put in favour of such abolition are, first, that to remove the derivative use immunity would not set a precedent; secondly, that public opinion would support the abolition of a derivative use immunity;  and, thirdly, that derivative use immunity is anathema to the ASC's regulatory function.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The main arguments against abolition put to the Committee are, first, that the current legislation corresponds to the protection offered by the common law privilege against self-incrimination and that the privilege is a fundamental right which should not be withdrawn. Secondly, it is said that the ASC is exaggerating the difficulties it faces as a result of the immunities and that to increase its powers may encourage unfair investigative techniques. Thirdly, there is the argument that the ASC is misreading its role by placing undue emphasis on the pursuit of criminal prosecutions.

         The common law privilege against self-incrimination is an ancient one. It has long been established as a principle that individuals who are facing criminal prosecution enjoy the right to remain silent. It extends to direct incrimination and indirect incrimination. When the privilege is set aside, as it is in the corporations law and the Australian Securities Commission law, it is because the legislature has made an assessment that the public interest to have access to information outweighs the private right of the individual to refuse to answer questions. There is usually a restriction on the uses to which that information can be put.

         In the end the majority of the Committee came to the view that effective regulation of the corporate sector may include legislative provisions which vary the established common law rights available to the ordinary citizen. It has accepted the evidence of the ASC that the immunity applying to the production of documents and the derivative immunity applying to oral evidence curtail the ASC's investigatory powers to an extent that seriously limits its capacity to discharge the responsibilities placed upon it by the Parliament.

         It recommended that section 597 (12) of the Corporations Act and section 68(3) of the ASC law be amended to remove the derivative use immunity provisions, and that section 68(3) also be amended to remove the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a document. The Committee also recommended that these amendments lapse after five years, unless their application is confirmed by the Parliament within that period. That is what we call a sunset clause. The Committee's final recommendation was that both laws be amended to clarify that neither the use immunity nor the derivative use immunity is available to corporations.

         It is important to note that the Committee's views were not unanimous. There is a dissenting report to which I put my name and which was prepared by my colleague on the other side of the chamber Senator Cooney, and by my colleague in the other place Mr Frank Ford. The minority report prefers the view that the limitation of the indemnity to answers given—and then only so long as they do not relate to the identification of documents—puts the rights of individuals too much at risk. We, the dissenters, concluded that the law treats the right to silence as a matter of extremely high principle. The protection it provides against the power of the state should not be diminished, except in accordance with the principle of comparable standing, and a principle of that quality has not been advanced in this instance.

         The Government has proposed this Bill to implement the recommendations of the majority of the Committee. It purports to abolish derivative use immunity under the ASC and corporations legislation on the grounds that such abolition would enhance the ability to secure convictions under the corporations law. It also abolishes use immunity for the production of books. This means that the fact books were produced can be used as incriminating evidence in criminal trials. The coalition takes the view that a distinction can be drawn between making statements to regulatory authorities and producing documents. We agree that there is no strong reason for the retention of the use immunity in relation to the production of documents. It is difficult to imagine that the ability to lead evidence that the accused produced certain documents will lead to abuse. Once such evidence is led, then the documents can speak for themselves.

         The coalition also argues that the privilege against self-incrimination should be treated as a personal privilege and should not be available to bodies corporate. We support the provision in clause 8 of this Bill which makes this clear. However, for the reasons canvassed in the Committee's minority report and also covered in considerable depth by the shadow Minister for corporate law reform and consumer affairs in the other place, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the coalition does not support that part of the Bill which abolishes derivative use immunity in relation to non-voluntary, self-incriminating statements.

         Briefly, the reasons for this are as follows:  firstly, it has not been shown that derivative use immunity has prevented any prosecution.

The Committee gave it long and hard deliberation, as I am sure my colleague Senator Lewis will refer to later in this debate. On the evidence to the Committee, in my view—I am supported by the coalition—circumstances have not been made out to abolish this ancient privilege against self-incrimination.

One of the arguments of the ASC, the DPP and, in the end, the majority of the Committee which Senator Lewis, Senator Spindler and I have the pleasure of being on was this argument of the public interest outweighing the rights of the individual when it comes to the privilege against self-incrimination. The public interest is the argument that we have to deal with. As we have said many times in this debate, we have to create a balance with the public interest, create some integrity in our securities markets, create public confidence in our corporations and securities environment and, on the other hand, protect the privileges and rights—and very fundamental rights, in my view—of the individual.

         I do not believe Sorby's case, which really was dealing with royal commissions, is necessarily apposite in this context. Royal commissions are not ASC investigations. They are designed in the public interest to find out the facts about a matter . . . I do not think it flows automatically from the fact that the High Court said that should not be used in criminal proceedings that the same public interest issues are at stake when the ASC. . . gets information under compulsion.

        I put it to the Senate, and particularly to Senator Spindler, that it is very hard to argue, on the one hand, that the public interest is preserved by taking away people's rights in relation to evidence before the ASC and, on the other hand, to claim that there is some higher public interest in relation to the proceedings of a royal commission. That is a point that perhaps Senator Spindler should consider. I do not deny that there should be a balance—I know Mr Santow's evidence was quite convincing for the Committee; I am sure that it influenced Senator Spindler—but he is really using the public interest on the one hand to support his argument and on the other hand to knock it down.

         The other point I want to raise in relation to the blood lust for putting in gaol corporate offenders from the 1980s and what that actually will achieve is the difference that we draw between the privilege that a blue collar criminal or even a capital criminal—a murderer or a rapist—receives in front of a court compared with a corporate criminal, a white collar criminal. There will be no equality for this privilege if we pass this Bill because the rapists, the murderers—the sorts of people who are going around needlessly bashing up people in the streets of Los Angeles at the moment—will receive a greater privilege than those people who are suspected of conducting a corporate crime.

         It brings us to the issue of the difference between civil remedies in relation to corporate law and criminal remedies. One of the policy aspects that the Senate and the Parliament should be dealing with is to what extent we expect the Australian Securities Commission to be a police force, to be a sort of corporate gestapo, going on fishing expeditions, looking into companies and trying to get criminal prosecutions. The Commission should be going about its business seeking civil remedies where possible, ensuring that there is a fair and open environment for corporate practices, that there is an ethical basis and that there is a very clear understanding in both the corporate world itself and the community at large of what is expected of directors, managing directors and corporations. There should also be a clear understanding of the remedies when they cross the line.

         The last point I move to concerns the consequences of our action here today. One of the biggest advantages of having an immunity—of being able to compel evidence on the one hand, but being able to offset that reduction in the privilege against self-incrimination on the other—is that we can get much greater cooperation from the witnesses that we are investigating. If the witness knows that whatever he says cannot be used in evidence in criminal prosecutions, one would naturally expect that that witness would be far more cooperative with the investigation, and the longer term aims and objectives of the Australian Securities Commission would, of course, be enhanced.

        Such a position would lead to a situation in which the corporate regulatory mechanism would discourage witnesses from providing frank and full disclosure where the witness might be subject to criminal sanction. This would grossly undermine the objective of corporate regulation in getting to the bottom of corporate transactions so as to enable shareholders and creditors to use the information obtained in civil actions for damages or other civil remedies.
       </para>

        That makes the point very well about the role of the Australian Securities Commission. Should it be a sort of corporate Gestapo trying to lock up blue-suited, nice-shirted business people who ran amuck in the 1980s? Or should it be trying to create a corporate environment, seeking civil remedies and looking after the interests of the shareholders as opposed to, I guess, the natural blood lust that comes from wanting to lock up some of these corporate transgressors from the 1980s?

He was worried, having seen what happened in the 1980s and having seen its aftermath—and I am reading Mr Bosch's mind at the moment, which I am sure a lot of people tried to do in the 1980s—that, with all the new regulatory framework, with the Australian Securities Commission and all its resources, the secret to getting it right in Australia is ensuring that there is a responsibility felt throughout the community.

         Under common law it is a well established principle that the prosecution must prove guilt and that the accused cannot be forced to provide information which incriminates him or her. This immunity against self-incrimination is expressly excluded by the Corporations and the Australian Securities Commission legislation. There are a number of reasons for that. One of those reasons is that the immediate victim, the company, is a legal construct, and there often is no human victim with direct and immediate knowledge of the circumstances involved. As a result, the prosecution is compelled to rely on the perpetrator for evidence of the misdeed. A second reason is that very frequently the complexity of the documentary evidence means that it needs to be explained by the person who knows it or who, indeed, has generated it.

         The need for this legislation arises from the fact that both the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions—the agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud—have been experiencing serious problems in their work. The immunities available to witnesses under section 68 of the ASC Act and section 597 of the Corporations Act have the combined effect of precluding the use of certain evidence against a person in criminal proceedings and proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. Such evidence includes a person's self-incriminatory oral statements, the signing of a record and the production of a book; for instance, a diary. This is described as use immunity. It also includes any information, document or other thing obtained as a result of such statements or actions. This is described as derivative use immunity. Section 68 of the ASC Act currently provides for use immunity and derivative use immunity with respect to oral statements, signing of records and the production of a book. Section 597 of the Corporations Act currently provides for use immunity with respect to oral statements and derivative use immunity with respect to oral statements, signing of records and the production of a book.

         An example of derivative use immunity will occur where a person who has produced financial records of a company refuses to answer, under examination, questions as to whether he or she authorised journal entries in the financial records and whether he or she signed certain correspondence, and, indeed, any other matters arising out of that correspondence or those books. The immunity claimed in these circumstances is one for non-disclosure of evidence derived from records already properly admitted into evidence. Both the ASC and the DPP have made submissions before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which Senator Cooney, Senator Campbell and I are all members. They outlined the problems associated with derivative use immunity, as in the above example that I have cited. The ASC has submitted evidence that the immunity applying to the production of documents was, indeed, curtailing quite severely its investigatory powers and its ability to obtain evidence leading to successful prosecutions.

         . The report recommended that section 597 of the Corporations Act and section 68 of the ASC Act be amended to remove the derivative use immunity provisions and that section 68 of the ASC Act also be amended to remove the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a book, for instance, a diary.

         In addition, the Joint Committee recommended that the Corporations Act and the ASC Act be amended to ensure that neither the use immunity nor derivative use immunity be available to corporations and that the proposed amendments lapse after five years unless the Parliament confirms their application within that period. This Bill adopts the recommendations of the Joint Committee with the exception of the recommendation that there be a five-year sunset clause on the amendments. I will return to this point later.

         The main ground of opposition to the recommendations of the Joint Committee is that the current legislation corresponds to the protection offered by the common law privilege against self-incrimination in Australia and that the privilege is a fundamental right which should not be withdrawn. This is the central argument in the dissenting report by Senator Barney Cooney and Mr Frank Ford, which is now supported by Senator Ian Campbell.

         The Australian Democrats are mindful of the strength of the arguments contained in the dissenting report and are extremely concerned that no inroads should be permitted on the rights of citizens before a court. However, in this case, it is wrong to say that the privilege against self-incrimination is being withdrawn. Use immunity remains in full force for oral statements and signing of records under the ASC Act and for oral statements under the Corporations Act. It will not be available in the case of information, including the contents of a book, derived from other evidence obtained legally under valid investigation processes.

         There has been a substantial volume of evidence in this area which shows that investigators in the corporate law area find grave difficulties in situations such as where a person who has produced financial records of a company refuses to answer under examination questions as to whether he or she signed certain correspondence. The need to protect small investors and their savings conflicts with the present right of corporate officials to refuse such answers. As Senator Campbell quite rightly said, we need to strike a balance.

         The Joint Committee proposed a five-year sunset clause which the Government rejected on practical grounds—namely, that serious problems could arise in the prosecution of matters which may have been under investigation for some time and which may still be in process when the five-year limit approaches. The Government gave an undertaking that the operation of the amendments is to be reviewed within five years. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) gave a personal commitment to hold an interim review after 12 months. However, I and the Democrats as a party believe that this is an extremely important matter. Clearly, it is being decided on a balance of conflicting principles.

         Obviously there is concern about a review of these amendments taking place. The proposal put forward by the Democrats would be an effective alternative in light of all the surrounding circumstances. The proposed amendment requires the Minister to cause a person who, in his opinion, is suitably qualified and appropriate to conduct a review into the operation of the amendments within a five-year period and to cause copies of the review to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving the review. Subject to this amendment, the Australian Democrats will be supporting this legislation for the reasons I have outlined.

Their decision was handed down in Sydney on 14 June 1978 but, as Senator Campbell will be interested to know, the case was heard in Perth on 14 September 1977. They said this:

        The fact that there is criminality in the corporate world is beside the point. There is criminality no matter where we look.

They have the right not to incriminate themselves and the right of immunity against the use of whatever statements they make.

         The pursuit of truth is very important, just as the pursuit of justice is very important. As Mr Justice Stephen and Mr Justice Aickin of the High Court said in the passage I have quoted, justice is a matter of balance. I have a statement made in 1846 by Vice-Chancellor Sir J. L. Knight Bruce which puts it very well. This case did not involve crime but involved civil proceedings. One of the parties to the case wanted to gain some information. The Vice-Chancellor said that he would not allow it because there really had to be a balance. He made the following statement, which I think is a good one:

        The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination, nor probably would the purpose of the mere disclosure of truth have been otherwise than advanced by a refusal on the part of the Lord Chancellor in 1815 to act against the solicitor, who, in the case between Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Clinton, had acted or proposed to act in the manner which Lord Eldon thought it right to prohibit. Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely—may be pursued too keenly—may cost too much. And surely the meanness and the mischief of prying into a man's confidential consultations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness, and suspicion and fear, into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself.

         I am anxious to hear what Senator Lewis has to say about this, but before I sit down I will raise another matter which is incidental to the issue of corporate law. It is very important to ensure the integrity of the corporate sector and to look at the corporate sector closely in circumstances where the move is towards privatisation. The privatisation of industries and services is done through the corporate structure. Indeed, one of the things that worries me about the whole issue of privatisation is that it is to be effected through the corporate structure.

         A person who is on the board of a company owes an obligation—and properly so—to the shareholders of that company. That means that the duty is to the shareholders and to the good of the company, which may end up being entirely different from an obligation to act in the public interest.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          If we go down the path of privatisation, we have to look very carefully at the obligations of directors of companies—indeed, the people who run companies. As I say, their obligation does not lie with the general public, but with the shareholders. It is on that basis that companies go offshore or close down factories that do not seem to be viable or which, when closed down, add to the profit of a company. Those are the sorts of considerations directors take into account according to the Corporations Act. Indeed, if they do not take those proper proceedings, directors can be held civilly or even criminally liable.

         One area that has been overlooked in this privatisation debate is how privatisation can be done effectively through the corporate structure. Indeed, that is the only structure through which it can effectively be done. As debate goes on in this chamber, if we are to go down the path of privatisation, we really do have to look at the provisions in the corporations legislation to see whether directors can have a wider regard for the public. It is hard to see how they can, because it is really for the Government to decide what is for the public good and what is in the interests of the electors. Politicians—Ministers, senators and members of Parliament—are elected to do that and it seems a bit hard to impose those obligations on the corporate sector.

         The Government's amendments will remove from the Act all reference to the production of a book. As a result, no privilege against self-incrimination shall apply to the production of a book by a witness. The amendments also exempt a body corporate from the effects of the section. In subsection 68(3) reference to the production of a book is removed. The derivative use immunity is removed—that is, immunity arising down the line. Reference to any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement or signing the record is deleted. Thus, the immunity under subsection 68(3) as amended applies only to the making of a statement or the signing of a record. The amendment being moved by the coalition would restore the original wording, leaving out only the reference to a book—that is, the full immunity and derivative immunity would apply to statements and the signing of the record. In subsection 597(12) the Government's amendments restrict immunity to the answers to questions. No derivative immunity is provided, and the Opposition's amendments would retain the existing wording of subsection 597(12).

         This Bill and this report raised a very fine line for the Committee and for this Parliament. That is made clear by the fact that we have people on both sides of the chamber dissenting from the report and people from both sides of the chamber supporting the report. In effect, at hearings conducted by the Australian Securities Commission the right to silence has been removed. The Australian Securities Commission was saying that the fact that the sections provided an indemnity to the persons against the use of the evidence gained indirectly from `leads' provided by the answers to questions or documents produced to the investigators, went so far that the Australian Securities Commission was hamstrung in its prosecutions.

         All members of the Committee were very unhappy that no prosecution had been brought forward for the High Court to make a ruling on that matter. In effect, until such time as the High Court gets around to making a ruling on the matter, there is, was and continues to be some doubt as to what the effect of this immunity really is. The Securities Commission and the DPP both argued that should any prosecution of a person so compelled arise, the prosecutor must prove that the evidence being advanced was not gained directly or indirectly from the answers or documents obtained where the privilege against self-incrimination was claimed by the person being examined.

         That was very strongly denied by a witness who impressed me enormously: Mr Ehrlich. I refer to paragraph 3.5.3. of the report, in which his argument is set out. He argues that the derivative evidence is only inadmissible if it was:

        On the other hand, Mr Santow, another witness who impressed me very much, argued that the whole of the corporation law was based on a fiction in that the law enabled a corporation to be established, and, having enabled such a body to be created, obviously by way of rules and regulations, the rules and regulations should not enable it have, in effect, the personal privilege which one grants to a human being. In  referring to the Guinness case in the United Kingdom, he said:

        His view was that the penalties ought to apply to corporations because they are established under a fiction and that they should not be able to escape because of the right to silence which we have granted people for centuries under our system of law.

         Unfortunately, there is considerable doubt about all of this. I argued very strongly in the Committee along the same lines as Senator Cooney, but in the end I supported the Committee majority for a number of reasons. The first is that the Committee agreed to monitor the use by the ASC of its investigatory powers. I draw the Senate's attention to the powers of the parliamentary Committee under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 because this Committee has the power to inquire into and report on the activities of the Commission, or the panel, or matters connected with such activities to which, in the parliamentary Committee's opinion, the Parliament's attention should be directed.

         In other words, the first and, I think, one of the most significant things that weighed heavily with me was that the Committee itself can inquire into anything connected with these matters. It is not dependent upon a resolution of either House—although that is required if either House resolves to conduct such an investigation. It is not dependent upon the recommendation of the Minister, the Executive Government, the Attorney-General or anyone else. If the Committee wants to inquire into a matter, it can do so. That means that, if a witness is unhappy about the treatment which he or she or his or her company has received at the hands of the ASC, that person can make a complaint to the Committee and the Committee could investigate it, if it wished, regardless of the attitude of the Executive Government and the ASC.

         Furthermore, as set out in the report, the Committee has agreed to monitor these investigatory processes. I think there is much merit in the fact that the parliamentary Committee is, in effect, a minder of the minder—the minder of the ASC. It should be a fundamental activity of this Committee, with routine investigations being done regularly—something to which the Committee has, in effect, agreed—and if any member of the public wished to complain, the Committee could receive the complaint and, if it wished to, investigate the matter.

         The final paragraph—which, I think, was put in the Committee's report at my request—is of great importance. It recommends an inquiry into whether the activities of the ASC should be limited to the civil jurisdiction. I have little doubt that the solution to this problem lies in taking that course—that is, that the ASC should be able to act with all of these wide-ranging powers in the civil jurisdiction. It should be able to step in straight away, as soon as there is some fear that a company has acted improperly, appoint a receiver or whatever it has to do, seize the assets, and make sure that creditors and shareholders are protected against the criminal machinations of corporate officers.

I have my doubts about that. How one protects future investors from crooks, I do not know. What one does is prosecute the crooks. As Mr Santow said in his evidence, if one or two of them can be sent to gaol, that may make the others sit up and take notice. However, the truth of the matter is that there will always be crooks trying to find some way around or through the law—committing offences that rob investors and their own shareholders; defrauding people. This legislation will not protect the victims. It may assist with the conviction of some people in the future but, unfortunately, the protection of investors is difficult to ensure. In the last 20 years decency seems to have fallen by the wayside. While there have always been crooks, in the last decade it seems as though the financial crooks of this country have become uncontrollable.

         Senator Cooney made reference to the problems involved in corporatisation. While I heard his remarks and I accept and agree with much of what he was saying, I draw his attention to what his Government has done in relation to corporatisation. The Government has taken a large number of Government instrumentalities out of the control of the Parliament and given them a degree of independence. Yet who are the shareholders who might control those corporate bodies?

         It is one of my great concerns with our large public companies that the shareholders really should be represented by the directors. In many cases they are represented by the directors and many of those directors do a good job. But, from time to time, one wonders when companies make bad decisions. Let me give an example. Look at what the banks did during the 1980s. They were in such enormous competition with each other and they were so determined to ensure that the new banks which had come in from overseas would not get a foothold in Australia that they were frequently lending enormous sums of money to companies on the basis of some sort of an undertaking. They were not even examining the companies' full statements of assets, liabilities and other commitments. On the basis of some sort of undertaking by a director of a company, or a resolution of a company, a bank would lend it enormous sums of money. One is aware of a situation where an enormous sum of money was lent on a Sunday morning as a result of a telephone call.

         That is a problem for public companies. I say to Senator Cooney that his Party has, in my view, set up a situation for which some poor Minister will end up carrying the can at some stage down the track. I do not know when it will be: five, 10, 15 years time. But in due course, somewhere down the track, unless my Party manages to totally privatise those corporations that the Government has established, one can bet there will be major problems because the only shareholder in a lot of those organisations is the Commonwealth of Australia, in effect, the Executive Government. So the directors of those corporations and the Minister will be able to do deals. There will be no responsibility to this Parliament. Senators will not hear about it until the whole thing explodes.

It has even gone further; some of those bodies, such as the Commonwealth Bank, have a small public interest and an enormous Commonwealth interest. If ever there are possibilities of problems, that must surely be the prime example. I say to the Government that it went half way because of the difficulties of finding finance. But it has taken these bodies out of the control of the Parliament and, in effect, placed them in the hands of corporate officers whose responsibility will be to no more than one Minister. That Minister will have, in effect, a responsibility to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet, ultimately, to the Party. It is too remote in my view and fraught with difficulty.

For all we know, that person may in fact, as a consultant, be the one who is controlling what that company is doing. One can imagine a situation where, in effect, men of straw are appointed as the directors of the company and the real controller is appointed simply as a consultant to the company and he uses the men of straw to achieve a particular end.

         The effect of the Opposition amendment is to amend section 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act by preserving derivative use immunity in relation only to the making of statements and signing of records. It does not have the effect of negating the whole Bill. I think Senator Spindler knows that and I am sure the Minister will give advice to that effect.

         Having said that, I should like briefly to talk about what Senator Spindler said in relation to Senator Lewis's consideration of this matter. Senator Spindler would probably know better than I that Senator Lewis contributed to the debate at great length in the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, and moved that Committee from a position which was clearly supporting the Government towards more middle ground.

         Having read this report of the Joint Statutory Committee in the last 24 hours, I would make clear that 90 per cent of the evidence, 90 per cent of the quotes and 90 per cent of the argument in the majority report really support the Opposition's view. All the quotes in relation to preserving rights and privileges support that view. It is very hard to find any evidence that supports the Government view, even in the majority report.

         This is a matter of principle. On my reckoning Senator Lewis has really considered the matter and has finely balanced himself on the side of the argument of the minority report—something he could well have done and may easily have done. I remember talking to Senator Lewis the morning before we decided where we were going to put our names on the report, and Senator Lewis said he was still deciding. It is indeed a matter of fine balance.

         Senator Spindler made the point that the Democrats have a free vote and a conscience vote. More often than not in my short time in this place I have found that their consciences all seem to coincide at exactly the right time on the same Bill. The only occasion I have seen any expression of a free vote and conscience involved Senator Sowada on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. I may be simplifying matters there, but that is the only example I have seen of it. We all have a free vote and we exercise it from time to time.

         —In response, it is fair to assert from the Government's position that a major and primary purpose of the legislation is to put an end to the use and derivative use immunities—immunities which would be available to natural persons. The impact of the Opposition amendments that are now before the Committee would be to negate the Government's intention in that area. The Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill is broader than that and that is acknowledged, but this is very much a primary objective of the Government. To the extent that the Opposition is detracting from that position in the legislation, then we have to oppose it.

         It is also worth placing on record that this issue has had considerable debate and discussion, particularly in this place. In 1983 I was involved in a committee on the National Crime Authority which took a close look at the operation of use and derivative use immunities. Obviously since then the issue has been discussed by at least two further committees of the Parliament.

         Also, it is worth while placing on the record that those who are charged with implementing the legislation are concerned that they have the powers to be able to enforce the law. That is basically the motivating force for the Bill before the Parliament this evening. We have to be sure that we can give those who have the responsibility to enforce the law the powers with which to do so. As a consequence, it is asserted that the current situation prevents the effective investigation and prosecution of offences under the legislation—whether it is by the ASC or the DPP. For those reasons, we on the Government side stick to the position that we put up by way of the legislation and would oppose the Opposition's amendment.

        As foreshadowed in the second reading speech, the Australian Democrats are moving an amendment to ensure that a public review of this legislation is held within a five-year period. It will be useful to advert to the matters that we seek to have this review address. One of them is to assess how much and in what ways the amended provisions have helped in the enforcement of national scheme laws, and how much and in what ways the amended provisions have helped the ASC in making investigations and gathering information. The extent, if any, to which persons to whom the amended provisions have applied has been unjustifiably prejudiced because of the enactment of sections 4, 7 and 8 of this Act.

         —The Opposition supports the amendment moved by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We think the sort of review envisaged by the amendment will be worth while. I support the proposition mentioned by Senator Lewis earlier this day in relation to the role of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities; that is, we have it within our power and our jurisdiction to oversee the operations of this amending Bill between now and that period. That is a responsibility that we all take seriously.

        The taxation process should be used as an instrument of social policy. That is a point we have made very often in the past. The Government has claimed on a number of occasions that it is committed to ecologically sustainable development. The taxation system is, as I have said on many occasions, a way in which the externalities in much of our economic process can be written into the costs.

       <para first-indent="16">

         There are many costs in the processes of using resources—costs in relation to environmental damage and the pollution which results both from the mining and from the use of those resources further down the track. Every single economist says that we need to internalise those externalities if, indeed, we are going to get to what the Opposition fondly calls a level playing field. Only in that way will we have costs properly represented in the economic system with people making judgments founded on the proper costs. This Government amendment to clause 31 seeks to allow 100 per cent tax deductibility for partial restoration, whatever that means.

         Mining is a major industry in Australia. That has long been the case and will continue to be the case into the foreseeable future. The Australian mining industry is a world leader in a number of areas and is very competitive internationally. Mining—and here I include quarrying—is a special industry. It involves a unique right. It involves the right to extract natural minerals from the earth, minerals which are owned in common by all citizens of Australia. The right to mine is the granting of an exclusive right to a particular person to the use for the time being of those resources.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Australian Democrats argue that the granting of these rights must be balanced by an obligation on the part of the extractor to rehabilitate the mine site. Given our historical constitutional arrangements, most onshore mining is conducted under the administration of State governments. Thus, it is those State governments which impose the conditions on the exploitation of our minerals and also prescribe the rehabilitation which must be undertaken in exchange for the right to undertake the mining operation.

         As is usual under our archaic system, there are myriad differing rules and regulations which obtain in the various States. Some States require full rehabilitation as a matter of law. Some simply rely on ad hoc licence conditions. When I was in Western Australia recently looking at sandmining operations, I was rather shocked to find that the requirement under the State law there was merely the restoration of at least 10 per cent of the species and areas that have undergone sandmining. The area might look rehabilitated, but to any trained botanist it is grossly deficient in species that were there before.

         The Australian Democrats support the concept of compulsory mine site rehabilitation. This does not mean that there may not be some circumstances when it is appropriate to rehabilitate the site into a public recreation area, as has already occurred in some areas such as Penrith Lakes in Sydney, instead of back to its original state. To help to ensure that the mine site is fully rehabilitated, we must have a system of taxation incentives which maximise the benefits to those who maximise the rehabilitation. Clause 43 proposes that all rehabilitation expenditure be fully deductible, even where there is no intention to fully restore the mine site. This is a deliberate move by the Government to undermine—and no pun is intended here—sustainable development. As such, the Democrats oppose the clause.

         In the Committee hearing last Friday, which Senator Kernot could not attend because of her duties on the Aboriginal Reconciliation Council, the Tax Office put the view that this amendment is not necessary; it changes nothing. If that is the case, why are we wasting taxpayers' money in bringing the amendment before the Parliament? Certainly the industry, at whose behest this amendment was drafted, was concerned enough to convince the Government to proceed with the amendment. The actual wording of the original provisions of section 124BA(1) of the Assessment Act states:

        There is absolutely no doubt that the current law only applies to restoration; there is no specific reference to partial restoration.

         Under common usage, we do not restore—and I am coming back to the Oxford definition here—a piece of furniture if we partially fix it; it is only restored if it is completely restored. Similarly, if a mine has a 200-foot tailings dump, it is not restored if only half the tailings are removed. What we need is a system of taxation incentives which tend to maximise the amount of environmental restoration our industries undertake, and minimise the amount of environmental damage that they cause. That is a sine qua non of ecologically sustainable development. This proposal means that full deductibility is granted whether a superb rehabilitation is undertaken or whether an inadequate procedure is settled for. This Government amendment can do nothing other than deter full mine site rehabilitation and, therefore, the Democrats will insist on our amendment.

I would like to point out to the honourable senator from the Democrats, Senator Coulter, that this amendment could result in situations which are quite unjust. It could work unfairly in respect of a partial restoration regime in situations where a company spent, say, $100,000 but, according to the Democrats' amendment, I understand could only be entitled to $50,000 where that partial restoration represented only 50 per cent of the potential 100 per cent restoration.

         The problem is that the Australian Democrats do not provide us with any help on a definition. I believe that the Australian Democrats' case could have been supported had they provided a comprehensive definition of what they refer to as `restoration'. Senator Coulter gave an example of where only 50 per cent of the tailings were removed. How would the Democrats cover a situation where 50 per cent of the tailings had been left and they were covered by special grasses, trees, et cetera? I feel that that would cause a whole host of subjective problems.

         I believe that the Senate should be very careful about using the Income Tax Assessment Act as an instrument of social policy. As an instrument of social policy in terms of ensuring that people who have a higher income pay a higher rate of tax, yes, I think that is reasonable. Once we start going out into other areas of social justice, human resource management or environmental matters and using the Act to enforce them, the Act would become even more incomprehensible than it now is. I submit to the Senate that perhaps the practice of previous governments in trying to do too much with the Income Tax Assessment Act in this area has caused problems in the past.

         I take this opportunity to congratulate the Australian mining industry on responding magnificently with respect to rehabilitation. The great majority of rehabilitation programs around the country are a credit to those companies involved. There will always be isolated examples. I think it is appropriate that the income tax legislation acknowledge fully the money that has been spent and the work that has been done in this area.

I do not think there are too many in this chamber who have practical mining experience, and I happen to have some of that experience.

         —Senator Bell should know that rehabilitation starts even before mining does. I refer to gold mining, the area in which I have experience. There is a corporate tax on gold, so one has to allow for depreciation. If one expends so much on rehabilitation in one year, surely one should be able to claim 100 per cent. As I said, rehabilitation starts even before mining begins. If one is doing an open cut pit and wants to rehabilitate slime dumps or mullock dumps, one clears the site, removes the trees and puts them aside, and also one removes the topsoil and puts it aside.

         Senator Coulter argues that there should only be  100 per cent rehabilitation when the job has been done. In that case there cannot be ongoing rehabilitation, and it must be ongoing. When one starts building mullock dumps one has to start putting the topsoil on when the first bench is completed. It is no good doing six, seven or eight benches which reach 100 or 150 metres into the sky. How would one put topsoil on that? One starts when one finishes the first bench; one starts to pour it over the sides. When one does the next bench, one pours over some more, and so on. Because topsoil has been put on the mullock dumps, the last bench is virtually the finished job. How can Senator Coulter tell me that we cannot have ongoing depreciation for ongoing work? If that is the case, it is patently unfair with respect to the taxation regime and as a practical consideration.

         Senator Coulter said that we should remove mullock dumps and also get the area back to the pre-mining condition. Senator Coulter was referring to sand mining, which might be different from gold mining. What would we do with the mullock dumps from gold mining? We can put the material back in the pit, but by the time that is done no open gold mine in Australia would be profitable. What is more, the mining laws in Western Australia say that we cannot refill pits or shafts. If we drop the lease, we have to give someone the chance to access the work that we have done. I am sure that those laws are still contained in the mining legislation of Western Australia. We have to leave access for someone else if we decide to give the lease away. If Senator Coulter meant that those dumps were to go back into the pit, his suggestion contravenes the mining laws of Western Australia. If he wants the mullock dumps to go back into the pit, it will put any gold mine, unless it is a fantastically rich one, out of the running altogether.

         if we want to ensure that rehabilitation is ongoing and that a company does not finish a mine off by leaving a big hole or a big dump and then walking away from it, there are provisions in the mining Act of Western Australia for a percentage of the amount represented by the gold we extract to be spent on rehabilitation. If that process is left right to the end, it cannot be done properly. If there is not 100 per cent tax deductibility, there is no encouragement to undertake that work. I would like Senator Coulter and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to take note of what I have said on this topic.

They have failed to read the words which appear in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 and which are, `. . . even if the taxpayer had no intention of completing the restoration. . . '. It seems to me that that is a very important qualifier which demolishes everything that Senator Panizza has just said. Both Senator Watson and Senator Panizza seem to be unaware that the requirements in relation to restoration and what that means is usually determined, as Senator Watson identified, under State law. The 100 per cent restoration would be in conformity with the requirements under State law. We are saying that where people fail to fulfil those requirements under the State law to 100 per cent, they should not be eligible for tax deductibility.

         Usually, as we certainly find in South Australia, the law sets certain requirements in relation to restoration. Clearly, restoration in the terms of this clause would mean 100 per cent restoration with respect to those requirements; yet this Bill seeks to give tax deductibility when only partial restoration of the site has been carried out, even if the taxpayer has no intention of completing the restoration. It seems to the Australian Democrats that, on the one hand, that is encouraging people not to complete the task that they are or should be charged with and, on the other hand, providing them with encouragement to not proceed with the work to full restoration according to the requirement.

On the other hand, if only $50,000 is spent and the site is half restored, again that full $50,000 can be claimed as a tax deduction. We are arguing that a much lesser incentive should be put in here for that expenditure as an encouragement to fully restore the site to back up the requirements which are often in place, and evidently are not in place in Tasmania, under State law.

         I want to make three points. I do not want to take much of the Committee's time. The reason we have legislation committees is so these issues can be argued elsewhere. Firstly, we are dealing with not a mining Bill but a tax Bill. If people want to require compulsory rehabilitation, the place to do that is in the mining Acts in the various States, not in the tax Bill. In fact, the tax Bill cannot do it. Even if we wished to do it, the tax Bill cannot do it; it is not possible. That is the first point. Whichever version of the clause—that is, the existing clause or the amended clause—were to be the law of the land, neither would require compulsory 100 per cent rehabilitation.

         We are talking here about the circumstances in which deductibility should be available for mine site rehabilitation. It has been said, and it remains the Government's view, that the existing clause allows claims on partial rehabilitation. But there was doubt and some uncertainty about that. It remains our view that that was the better interpretation of the Act as it stands, but to make it clear, we have proposed this amendment which, it is now agreed, does make that situation unequivocal.

         It is a public good that work should be expended to rehabilitate mine sites. We want companies to do that. To the extent that they spend money so rehabilitating, it should be tax deductible. It is very unusual for expenditure conducted in the normal course of running a business not to be deductible. It would be an extraordinary situation if, amongst all the expenditures that companies might have, we were to isolate partial rehabilitation as something which is not deductible. Companies can do all sorts of other things of which people may or may not approve, but those expenses are incurred in the normal course of running their businesses, so they are tax deductible.

         It is proposed that one expenditure which is socially desirable, but perhaps not as socially desirable as some other expenditure—that is, 100 per cent rehabilitation—be plucked out of the normal course of business expenditure and made an exception. It is true that, in the distant past, rehabilitation was not deemed to be deductible for reasons about which we do not now need to worry. We are saying that this is expenditure which businesses are, and should be, now required to conduct and that therefore it should be deductible.

         The second points relates a little to what Senator Panizza was saying. I thought there was a lot of validity in some of his points. I will express it differently, but it is consistent with the point he was making. It is quite likely that there will be circumstances at the end of a financial year when it is not possible objectively to establish whether the expenditure on rehabilitation is part of a 100 per cent rehabilitation because the process is only half finished. There has been expenditure in the financial year on mine site rehabilitation, but the process is unfinished.

         Is that total or partial rehabilitation? Does the claim have to be put off until the work is finished to prove retrospectively that the expenditure was justifiable? Can the expense be claimed this year on the basis of the assertion that it is a complying expenditure with the money then having to be paid back in subsequent years because it is not deemed to be a full restoration? It will not work. I have to say that at the moment the proposed clause is better this way.

         The other point I reiterate is that the amendment does not achieve its objective anyway because it is the prevailing view that, even if the existing clause were to remain, partial restoration would still be deductible. The essential point is that we do not want to have this as a proxy for the mining Act. I do not take quite as purist a view as Senator Watson, who says that we should not be using this for social policy purposes. I understand his argument; it is an orthodox argument of many people. People who are used to hearing me debate tax Bills will know that I do not take such a purist view. In some instances, I am prepared to support the use of not just the income tax laws but also the sales tax laws to achieve social and environmental objectives. So it is not that, as a matter of fundamental principle, that is a hurdle over which I am not prepared to jump sometimes. But it certainly is not and cannot be a proxy for proper State legislation with regard to mine site rehabilitation.

        I wish to make a very brief statement on a matter which would normally have been raised in the committee stage, but I was not at the committee hearing. I wish to put on the record the Government's position on the amendment concerning the rebate on inter-company dividends. As Senator Watson and others would be aware, there was some apprehension about whether we should move as far as we did in applying this particular amendment to discretionary trusts because of concern about avoidance. That concern lingers, but we felt that on balance the amendment should be made and it has been, and it has been supported, which we appreciate.

         I want to put on the record our view that if the amendments result in the trustees of discretionary trusts channelling rebateable dividends to Australian resident companies in preference to other beneficiaries, or otherwise result in tax abuse, the Government will introduce legislation to deal with the matter. It is important to put the Opposition on notice about that, although we do think, on balance, it is the appropriate amendment.

        Quite frankly, the explanatory memorandum is longer than the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill. It is certainly longer than the second reading speech. Even the several pages of amendments themselves simply make plain the lack of consultation that the industry has complained of and which we dealt with in speeches during the second reading debate. I understand that this Bill was in a draft form at the end of last year. Here we are dealing with it in May. It was not made available to the industry to discuss or to comment upon. There was great consternation about the way in which the agreement was entered into to allow the—

         I was saying that these amendments, which purport to be technical in nature, underscore the fact that the legislation was badly drafted. Like so much of the legislation that this Government brings in, we have to amend it subsequently to fix up the errors that were left in it.

         If we read the language of the outline and look at the nature of the amendments, we see that they are far from being technical. They are substantial and very important amendments. As I said, they underline the lack of discussion with the industry which was complained of and the way in which the system was brought into play prior to the legislative framework being in place. The whole thing has been quite slovenly done.

         I return to a statement that I made today when I was commenting on the Auditor-General's report. So much of the sloppy work that comes through in terms of what appears to be administration of government policy has to be sheeted home to the Minister. It is the Minister who is paid to be responsible. It is up to him to ensure that things are done properly. I am afraid that the situation is getting worse. Ministers will have to be accountable for poor legislation. In this case we have both the senior Minister in this place, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Button, and the junior Minister, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, Mr Beddall, in the other place. All I can say is that if either of them can be proud of the way in which this legislation has been presented and dealt with, they are not up to being called Ministers of the Crown.

         When this matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the Opposition indicated that it would certainly agree to the amendments. It attended to some of the things that we raised as being of grave concern, particularly a concern dealing with personal identification numbers—PINs. There are still outstanding concerns with regard to precisely how people are to maintain the right to manual access to the COMPILE system, as distinct from the electronic system. I have had at least one case brought to my attention concerning the pernickety attitude of Customs with regard to forms that have to be used, which has meant that it is refusing to make refunds. I do not want to see that occurring again. That needs to be tidied up on the administrative side.

         The agreement that will be entered into will be a fresh agreement. Mr Miller from the Australian Customs Service said earlier that the agreement that was entered into so that the system could commence operation in September was biased in favour of the Australian Customs Service. He said it was biased because the Customs Service was his client. I want to see that a fair and even-handed agreement is entered into subsequent to this legislation going into effect.

         The main point I wanted to make—I would like the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) to comment upon it—is whether the Minister thinks the way in which this Bill has come before this House—that is, near enough is good enough; hit and miss—will be the standard he will continue to have or whether he will up his game and start to say that we will have the legislation in its correct form prior to its coming into this chamber.

         —I wish to advert briefly to a matter that I raised in my speech on the second reading debate—that is, the representations made by the Customs Brokers Council about the optional port lodgment system. It raised the point that there is currently an inquiry in process with the industry to establish all the issues related to the introduction of optional port lodgment systems to ports in other States. The complaint was—I believe it is a justified complaint—that this Bill, as it stands, could be read to pre-empt the consultations that are being carried out in that inquiry.

         —I intend to move that the Committee report progress. That might sound like a very peremptory move at this stage but, while we are dealing with the substance of this amendment at one level, we are also dealing with a situation in which, as I understand it, there is to be a court hearing on Thursday. While the court hearing does not go to the substance of whether 37 of the detainees who have been held in custody for some considerable time are or are not refugees, nonetheless, the people involved have a case before the courts which goes to the matter of whether they should be held in custody or released.

         It seems to the Australian Democrats that to proceed at this stage and to cut off that line of appeal, while that matter is before the courts, is far more peremptory than the action I am taking here in foreshadowing a motion that the Committee report progress. I believe that this matter should be held over and considered after the passage of a bit more time. There are many people out in the community who have not had an opportunity to look at this legislation.

         While on balance I would come down in favour of the legislation, I concede that it is a very finely balanced judgment. To pass this legislation at this time, in the very hasty manner in which it has been brought forward, is, I think, unsatisfactory for those very many people in the community who are affected by it; more particularly, in relation to those 37 people, each of whom will have reasons—probably quite separate reasons—to have gone to court to seek their release from custody and their release into the Australian community.

         A characteristic of this Parliament should be not to seek to pass laws to cover up for mistakes which the Government has made. As for the actual hearings in relation to the status of these people, whether refugees or not, my understanding is that there was a flaw in the proceedings by which these people were being dealt with. That was corrected in the sense that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) has instructed the appeals committee to go back and review the procedures and to consider the appeals in the correct manner. Perhaps that in itself has led to some delay.

         To attempt to correct that situation by passing hasty legislation through this Parliament, and to close off a legitimate source of appeal which exists within the law as it is, seems to us to be quite unconscionable. It is for those reasons that we very strongly suggest to the Committee that it should not proceed with this legislation tonight but should allow a great deal more time to pass—at least until the next sitting period—so that those both within the Parliament and outside have an opportunity to look at it.

         —In that particular case, we all knew the outcome of the debate. Really, that was a matter of filibustering. In this case we have 37 people who have an appeal before the court. The matter is to be heard on Thursday and to proceed at this time, to change the law at this time, when those people have already lodged their appeals is without conscience. I believe that, for that reason, we should not proceed at this time. We should hold this matter over and consider it later in the next sitting period to allow a reasonable period of time for those both within and outside the Parliament to have a look to see just exactly what this legislation does and, in the meantime, not cut off that legitimate court action by those 37 people. It is for that reason I urge most strongly that the Senate not proceed at this time. Accordingly, I have foreshadowed a motion to report progress.

I would support the foreshadowed motion; that is, that we report progress. I am not debating that necessarily at the moment. What I wish to say to the Committee is, I believe, extremely important. It is this: when the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs gave a briefing to my office about these amendments, it did not mention in any shape or form the fact that there was a case pending before Mr Justice O'Loughlin of the Federal Court in Melbourne at 9.15 a.m. this coming Thursday—that is, the day after tomorrow. The Department did not indicate to me or to my staff that this was a major reason for these amendments.

If the Minister has not as yet tabled that report, I am prepared to table it in the Parliament tonight because I think it is relevant to this matter. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission raises several issues in its report. I will deal with just a couple of them. Paragraph 5 of the report talks about broader issues arising from conditions observed at Port Hedland. Bear in mind that 23 of the applicants, I think, have been held for some considerable time. The report states:

        Remoteness, isolation and long term detention. As has been noted, many aspects of the conditions and facilities at Port Hedland were particularly good.

        Most of the problems that have been identified have their basis in the very fact of detention—its long term nature and the lack of provisions for any alternative. This exacerbates the problems that have given rise to human rights concerns throughout this report and leads me to question the need for extended detention in any such centre, in particular, in an isolated location. Moreover, such detention itself raises human rights issues directly.

        The report talks about the Convention on the Status of Refugees. It also talks about the question of religion.

         I believe that the Committee is faced with a most onerous task tonight. The only other comparable situation for the Government's current action relating to detainees is that which was taken during World War II. That was under emergency and wartime powers when the foreign nationals were thought to threaten the security of the nation. Nobody would suggest that the security of the nation is threatened, least of all until Thursday morning when the matter comes before the courts. I would have thought that it is reasonable for the Committee to consider that question and to support the proposal that the Committee report progress.

Senator Coulter could come in here and argue that that person's rights would be affected by any attempt by government to legislate to cover this area. So I do not accept that it is a new issue, and I do not accept that the timing is inappropriate. As I say, no time is a good time. No time for the last two years has been a good time. No time into the foreseeable future will be a good time in terms of the criteria set by Senator Coulter and Senator Spindler.

If we had moved this two years and one day ago, he could have come in and said, `No, it's the wrong time; a person's rights are being affected'. The way the system is going at the moment, Senator Coulter could come into the chamber in five years time and make the same assertion. The Government is determined, as has been spelt out very clearly by the Minister, to ensure that there is an orderly assessment of claims, an orderly process, which does not prejudice or gazump those with legitimate claims.

         What does this legislation affect? It needs to be made clear that the legislation and the points that honourable senators have raised do not affect the definition of one's status—whether one is a refugee or not. That is the most basic question when one is trying to determine whether a person can or cannot stay in Australia. It is the definition of `refugee' and the processing of claims for refugee status which are vitally important. This legislation affects whether those persons who are making those claims stay in custody or are allowed to roam free through the Australian community. It has been a long-held principle that they stay in custody.

         The legislation also does not affect the application of the international covenant as it may be interpreted by Australian courts.

It would be interpreted in the way that it would otherwise be interpreted by the Australian court process.

This has been a problem and it has been acknowledged broadly in the community as being a problem. I feel sorry for anyone in the position of having to make decisions here. On the one hand, we get the sorts of interventions that we have had tonight and, on the other hand, we get claims that the Government is being too soft. The Government needs to put in place a process which is fair, which recognises legitimate refugee status and which recognises legitimate processes.

         It would be premature to make that report public when there are such matters in dispute. Not only would it be premature, but it would also pre-empt the process totally.

I would not be keen to see that report tabled tonight. However, I am keen to ensure that that process, as has been provided by law, continues down the course that this Parliament has determined and that, at the end of the day, we can get a final report that is sustainable.

I reiterate that there is no good reason for deferring the legislation tonight. In fact, there are many good reasons why we should embody in legislation what governments in this country have believed for a long time and what is imperative in order to have a process which can work, and that is the principle that if persons enter Australia in an unauthorised way, then they stay in custody until their status is determined.

On the admission of Senator Harradine, delaying the debate will not alter the merits of the discussion whatsoever. Senator Harradine is now very well informed. There is no doubt that initially he was not. It is a matter of some concern that, as it appears on the face of it, there was clearly an attempt to divert him from some matters of fact which happen to be very germane to the issue.

         It appears to me that the Government is totally right in adopting the sort of procedure it adopts in tax cases. If it sees a similar situation, it says, `Righto, we will chop that off as of now'. In many instances, it takes far too long to get the legislation right. This legislation certainly was not right originally. I can see no problems, neither in principle nor in terms of Australia's best interests, with proceeding to resolve this matter with the sort of informed debate that clearly can take place now.

         The Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) really proved our case because he said that the Government could have acted at any time in the past. If it was so important to ensure that people who have entered Australia without a visa or without any entry permit and who are not Australian citizens should be kept in custody, then why did the Government not act weeks ago, months ago, years ago? The point at issue in this debate is that this legislation is being rushed through tonight and gazetted tomorrow, when there is a court case in progress in which judgment is likely to be given on Thursday.

         This goes to the point made by Senator Baume that whether we debate the matter now or later, it will alter people's perception of its merit. It will not alter the merit of the legislation, but it will certainly alter people's perception of the merit of the legislation. Ninety per cent of honourable senators do not even know what we are now debating. We are debating matters of enormous significance to the fundamental human rights of individuals. We are about to set precedents which are most disconcerting.

Is it suggested that the new legislation would have some retrospective effect on the rights of a particular person? This is a similar situation in that a case is before the court. Applications have been made for release from detention. Presumably, it is argued that they are in detention illegally. It might be said by the Government that this legislation will not have an entirely retrospective effect; that once the Governor-General signs the Bill, it will have the prospective effect of retaining those persons in custody from that date. The fact remains that those people have not had their day in court and are entitled to it.

The Bill seems to be aimed specifically at these Cambodian people who are currently seeking to have the Federal Court hear their case for release.

         There has been something in the news lately that there is another boat on the way down from Indonesia. Maybe we will have a repeat—hopefully we will not—of the search that went on in the north west of WA last Christmas when 45, 46 or 56 people—whatever the figure was—walked across all that harsh country and, through good fortune, were all saved. Maybe something like that will happen on our doorstep again. If we give in and allow another seven days, there could be a boat in contact with Australia anyhow, because I believe someone is making some money out of dropping off these refugees. In another seven days we could be landed with another 22 refugees, and so it goes on.

         The simple question is whether this country is still subject to a rule of law or whether it is subject to the machinations of some politicians who believe that they have the right to intervene in the legal processes which guard the civil rights of citizens. I remind honourable senators once again of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which refers to `anyone' who is deprived of his liberty. It does not say a Cambodian citizen who is deprived of his or her liberty. It does not say an Australian who is deprived or his or her liberty. It sets up a general principle.

         The Minister, after recently acknowledging that the applications for refugee status had been bungled, agreed to a review of the cases, but is now seeking by this legislation to short-circuit any meaningful review by legislating these people out of sight. Why is the Government using such a heavy approach to this group?  After all, it made special provision for a great number of Chinese students after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and has special entry provision for people from Sri Lanka. Why is the Government seeking to make conditions more punitive and more distressing for people who have left their home country with nothing or next to nothing, often in fear of their lives, than it does for people who come on a visitor's visa and choose to overstay and then apply for residency?

         —I think most contributions were assertions and debate. As to Senator Harradine's first question, I will not make any assessment as to the viability or otherwise of the case, and nor should I. As to the second question relating to the dates, the first date of 19 November 1989 refers to the date of the arrival of a boat at Pinda Bay. The second date of 1 September 1992 is the date by which we anticipate having a new framework in place to handle these matters. That framework has been referred to in the Minister's second reading speech.

         I can understand Senator Chamarette asking about international covenants because she was not here at the start of the debate, but I made it very clear that the forums in this country that interpret international covenants and their application in Australia will still be charged with the responsibility of doing so.

         I feel that I have to reply to the last point. It is the simplest thing in this debate to be populist—to come in here charged with emotion and not with facts. It is the simplest thing in this debate to colour this subject. What Senator Chamarette has to understand is that there are a hell of a lot of people who want to come to this country. We have had for quite a number of years an orderly migration program. As part of that program, there are different categories. People wait for a long time to come to Australia.

         We are talking here about people who claim to be refugees. If their claims are proven to be valid and they are defined and interpreted by the courts as refugees, then they have rights to stay here. But until that is the case, they are to be treated in the same way as any other person seeking entry into Australia—and that is what this proposed legislation does. I think it probably best that we now move to the amendments.

         —Yes, and justice. I did ask the Minister a specific question about the Torres Strait Islander case, which involved the Queensland Government. If the Minister does not know the case himself, he should get some of his advisers to advise him about it. I asked the Minister how the action of the current Government—his Government—differs from that taken by the Queensland Government in 1985. That action was described by the High Court as `draconian' in that it purported to defeat the litigation that was pending in the High Court in reference to property rights. I repeat that we are not dealing with property rights here; we are dealing with the rights to liberty under the rule of law.

         —Before I formally put the motion, I would like to bring the Committee back to the very simple single point, because most honourable senators have strayed away from it. They have talked about the substance of the Migration Amendment Bill; they have talked about the amendments themselves; they have talked about all sorts of other things. For example, Senator Panizza talked about Australia having rights over who does and who does not come into the country, whether or not we need to guard our shores and whether we have rights in those respects—with all of which one can wholeheartedly agree.

         There is just one single very simple point that causes me to move that progress be reported at this stage so that we can then have a longer period of consideration of this legislation; that is, that there is a case that will come before the courts on Thursday.

         The amendments, if passed tonight, will tie the hands of the judge to the extent that he or she will be prevented from allowing that person to be released from custody—even if on all the merits of the case that judge thinks that that person should be released. The single important point which I believe lies very much at the heart of what we mean by justice is that the rules should not be changed midstream. A case will be coming before the courts on Thursday. In the consideration of the evidence in that court, this legislation which we are asked to pass tonight will change the rules and tie the hands of the judge. Irrespective of the merits of the case, those people, or one person who may have a legitimate case to be released from custody, will not be able to be released because the judge will be prevented from giving a judgment in accordance with the facts.

         I would like the Minister to explain in some detail why he thinks it is necessary that these designated persons, as so narrowly defined, should be kept in custody. There would be a lot of other people who would come into Australia in various ways who have not presented a visa and have not been granted an entry permit because they would not have a designation. I am a little puzzled; if there is a need for these people to be kept separate, why is the definition of them so narrow? Surely all those people who come broadly within the category of (b) and (c) in clause 54K should be kept separate. Is this simply another flaw in this very hastily drawn up set of amendments?

         Unauthorised entrants into Australia are kept in custody from when they are apprehended until their claims are processed. The Government has made it very clear, as has the Minister in particular, that this legislation deals with one category of unauthorised entrants. They are those people who have arrived in Australia, as one can see in the definition of `designated person', on a boat after 19 November 1989.

         In respect of those unauthorised entrants, as is the principle of the amendments to the legislation—I am sure Senator Coulter knows about it because we have spent the last hour and a half debating that particular point—the legislation provides for custody until their cases are determined in accordance with the law, which reflects international definitions of `refugee'. Like every other unauthorised entrant into this country, these people will be treated in a way that the law so provides and that is, until their cases are determined, they will be kept in custody.

It is only those designated persons who, according to clause 54J, shall be kept in custody. In other words, it is restricted to those people who have arrived by boat between those particular dates who fulfil the requirement for clause 54J.

         In the current circumstances an offer has been made by the charitable organisations and religious bodies to house these particular persons, some of whom, I remind the chamber, have been in detention since November 1989 and have suffered considerable stress as a result thereof. The Minister does not want me to table what the Human Rights Commission says about it. I will accede to his request, but I know and he knows that considerable stress and distress have been caused as a result of the long detention of some of these people. I am asking whether that definition of `custody' could include the Minister approving the offer made by those charitable organisations and religious bodies to house and be responsible for the persons until their refugee status has been determined.

         —I will be making only a small contribution to tonight's debate on the amendment that has come from the other place. It was my intention to make a more substantial submission in support of the action by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in bringing this legislation before the House. This is crucial legislation. It does not only impact on 27 people; it has an impact on the whole of Australia's refugee program. In the past couple of years that refugee program has been abused and brought into disrepute by the actions of a number of individuals—not only those detained in custody. A number of people—some with goodwill and others, I would suggest, with different motives—have sought to abuse the privilege of refugee status that Australia, as a nation state, can give to people.

         As has been mentioned on a number of occasions, some people have been interned in holding camps in Australia for a considerable length of time. It is not the fault of the Government, the Minister or the Department that those people have been confined for so long. Indeed, in some cases, it is the fault of the individual; in some cases it is the fault of the legal advisers that those people have engaged. They were not properly advised and sought to abuse the circumstances in which they found themselves by remaining in Australia—albeit in some form of custody—in the hope that at some later time they could mount the argument that, because they had been in Australia so long, they should be granted refugee status or some other form of permanent residency and so be allowed to stay.

         Every time a concession is made on a matter of immigration policy—and this happens in other areas of government administration—abuses occur. In this particular area we have seen a number of abuses. There are not only 27 people in custody at the present time; there are over 450 people—illegal entrants to this country—in custody. I believe that if they are given refugee status by whatever means—be it through the courts or by some other means—the floodgates will open and many more boats will appear on the northern and western shores of this country carrying people who believe they have a claim for refugee status.

         This is a very serious problem that must be addressed now. If it is not addressed now, it will be much more difficult to address when there are 4,500 people in detention, or when there are 45,000, because it is not unreasonable to suspect that the number might grow tenfold. It is an almighty dilemma that the Government is facing, and I believe that the Minister is acting quite properly in this matter. He is also acting under a fair degree of pressure. Earlier this year he admitted publicly in a very candid statement that he had been taken for a dill by some people. It is not too often that a Minister of the Crown is quite as frank and honest as that. He certainly was frank with the Australian community and I believe that the Australian community appreciated that frankness because it too is concerned about any potential problem that might be down the line.

         It has been suggested in some of the submissions made here tonight that this amendment is interfering with these people's rights to make an appeal following an application for refugee status. It does not interfere at all with any of their legal rights. Their applications through the Federal Court can proceed this Thursday, next Thursday or whenever the Court so determines. That application for appeal against an administrative decision of the Department can and, indeed, will proceed at the will of the Court.

For instance, when making this interpretation one has to take account of the fact that developed countries have seen a 700 per cent increase in asylum claims over the last decade; that Australia, because of its geographical and regional environment, is particularly vulnerable to boat arrivals; and that, while our obligations to refugees are very clear, the asylum route is being increasingly abused.

         As the Senate is aware, presently there are some 389 boat people in detention around Australia under the current provisions of the Migration Act and another vessel carrying 10 people is expected to arrive in Australia soon. Under the current provisions of the Migration Act, it is possible that the courts can release these people into the community. It is our very strong view that this should not be possible. Thirty-seven detainees are in the process of challenging the rejection of their claims and will be in court from 7 May to argue for their release from custody. This legislation provides—as an interim measure only—new custody arrangements which will deny courts the power to release boat people into the community. This legislation would have to be passed through the Senate today to enable it to receive the Governor-General's assent before the court case to release the 37 detainees begins.

         People who arrive in Australia illegally are held in custody pending the determination of any claims they may make for refugee status. Current detainees are in section 88 custody which pertains to those who have been arrested at sea in territorial waters and brought ashore by Australian authorities as prohibited immigrants, or in section 92 custody which pertains to those who landed as illegal entrants. This distinction between persons who are arrested before disembarking from a boat and persons who arrive by boat and enter undetected is a major weakness of the Act and is the subject of challenge by a further three detainees who arrived on the last boat.

         On 7 May, 37 section 88 detainees will challenge the rejection of their claims and ask to be released from custody. The new legislation is proposed to guarantee continued custody by providing a common custody regime for all boat people, whether they are in section 88 or section 92 custody. This will apply to all arrivals after 28 November 1989 and before 1 November 1992. The legislation will provide for a period of nine months detention for all current detainees to commence when the proposed legislation receives royal assent.

         Under the legislation for any future arrival a period of nine months detention is to commence on the date that an application for refugee status or other claim is submitted to immigration officials. Current provisions require a claim to be submitted within two months of arrival. If no submission is received within that period, the Act provides for the removal of that person from Australia. Future arrivals will be subject to immediate custody under the new provisions when they arrive in Australia and the nine months will not commence until they lodge an application. The nine-month `clock' will stop when it is necessary to obtain information or expert evidence to properly process a claim, or where a claim is subject to litigation. In effect, this can lead to exceptionally long detention periods, particularly if a case is taken through all levels of appeal.

         The new legislation will provide to the extent possible that a court cannot release persons who are in custody under the new arrangements. An appeal to the High Court on habeas corpus will be unlikely to succeed, since the custody arrangements are legal. However, it does not interfere with the High Court's original jurisdiction. The legislation will provide for the removal of detainees whose claims to remain in Australia are rejected and allow them to continue to be held in custody pending the finalisation of removal arrangements. We must recognise that this legislation is very tough and will not be unchallenged by a variety of interest groups, including the law councils, the Refugee Council and civil liberty groups.

         There is a strong need for these interim measures and subsequent revision of the Migration Act. The current powers in the Act to arrest and detain persons without authority to enter or remain in Australia are cumbersome, outdated and in places silent on important issues such as re-arrest. A major weakness is the spurious distinction between persons who are arrested before disembarking from a boat and persons who arrive by boat and enter undetected.

         If this legislation is not passed, the possibility that all detainees could be released into the community exposes Australia to the risk of a much larger influx of people. If these people were classed as refugees, they would be admitted—and Senator Chamarette can put her bottom jaw back into position. Our obligations to offer protection to genuine refugees as defined by the United Nations Convention and protocols is not affected by this legislation. It is designed to prevent abuse. Because of the strict provisions for legal migration in our migration program, migrants are increasingly trying to enter through the narrow window left open to grant asylum to political refugees.

         Developed countries have seen a 700 per cent increase in asylum claims over the last decade. Australia itself has witnessed an increase from 500 claims a year a few years ago to over 23,000. Although having no land borders and thus not subject to the enormous pressures being placed on borders in western Europe, Australia's geography and regional environment make it particularly vulnerable to boat arrivals. The journey from Asia involves only a fortnight's sailing and little serious danger.

         Once released into the community, location and removal are extremely difficult and, I might add, very costly to the Australian taxpayer. Where boat arrivals are motivated not by fear of persecution but by a simple desire to migrate, release from custody achieves de facto migration and sends a signal to others planning to follow the same route. This is an essential element of our determination to support this legislation.

         —I will answer that question very briefly. In regard to the passage Senator Spindler read out to the Senate, the question asked is whether the detention of someone is lawful. What that means is whether it is authorised by the law. There is a whole framework of laws in Australia, and in many other countries as well, to determine in what circumstances a person can be kept in detention. As I have said from the start of this debate, one of those circumstances in Australia is that any person who is an unauthorised entrant is held in custody until his or her case is settled.

         To that extent, I assert that `lawful' is defined as to whether it is in or outside the law. There is no inconsistency between what we are doing here and what is done quite often, not only in immigration areas but elsewhere, in providing for circumstances in which people are kept in detention. So there is no conflict. I think Senator Spindler has probably come at this question from three or four angles. If he keeps on trying, we will come up with the same answer.

This perspective was introduced by Senator McKiernan, who suggested to us that the whole of Australia's refugee program hinged upon this very amendment. As Senator McKiernan is not interested enough in the whole of Australia's refugee program to remain to see how it is resolved, I would like to take up the question that he proposed. If, as the Minister said in answer to Senator Coulter's question, the purpose of this legislation is to deal with this narrow designation of people, what principle can be transferred to the whole of Australia's refugee program?

After all, November may not come for this Government, and it may not have the opportunity to put in place the sorts of things that it is hoping to do.

         If honourable senators think the Timorese community is too close to the bone, then perhaps some religious or charitable organisation would take action to help these people. That would be a far more humane situation for those people pending the determination of their status. That is what we are talking about here, not the matters that the Minister raised just a moment ago. That is why I asked the question about section 11 of the principal Act and proposed section 54J of the Bill containing the definition of `custody'. The Minister's answer was that it was not possible to take that alternative action. I think that is unfortunate.

I understand that the mother is prepared to accept the definition of whatever status is applied to her, but she wants to have the child in Australia. If it were her desire—I am not sure whether it is—to have the child adopted in Australia, does that mean that that could not be done? Does that mean that under this legislation that child would have to be deported from Australia?

         Whilst I am on that subject, I want some answers from the Minister in relation to the Luo Hai Ling case. I think it is important for the Committee to hear from the Minister. It is the first time we have been given the opportunity to hear the Minister respond to some of the questions that have been raised about the Luo Hai Ling case. The one child per family policy in China involves inherent violations of human rights and it includes coerced abortions and sterilisations.

         I ask the Minister, in view of that, whether this regulation would require the immediate removal from Australia of a person if that person's application for refugee status has been refused. In the case of Luo Hai Ling, would that mean that these regulations would require her removal to China, knowing full well that she faced the real possibilities of being required to have an abortion for her unborn child? I am asking a very serious question. I would like the Minister to get some advice about that and respond to the Committee accordingly.

         —On the last point that Senator Harradine made, my best approach is to indicate to the chamber that the person's case is being reviewed at the moment. Any reflection I may have on it one way or another would in no way be helpful to that process. I say that knowing full well that if I were to make any comment, it could very quickly be brought into the process and it would be totally irresponsible for me to make such a comment.

         The other point that I would make to Senator Harradine is that the provision under the definition of `designated person', as it affects a non-citizen born in Australia whose mother is a designated person, basically ensures consistency

         —That is very alarming. I think the Committee should understand what we are doing here. That is a most alarming situation. The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) has indicated that, for example, in the Luo Hai Ling case, a case of a pregnant woman, if the application for refugee status by Mrs Luo is rejected and she has had her child in Australia that child, being a designated child, must also be removed as soon as practicable after the decision has been made.

         I refer the Committee again to the fact that under the one-child per family policy in China there is a real likelihood of that child not being able to obtain registration as an authorised child in China. As those people who are aware of the Chinese situation know, the penalties which those unauthorised children carry throughout their lives are quite stark. It is something that we ought to consider here tonight in terms of what we are doing. We are not giving the Minister any discretion at all in the matter. It might well be, as I indicated, that the mother wishes to have the child adopted out. Under this provision before us tonight we are not giving the Minister any discretion at all. That is very disconcerting.

         I should like to get some clarification of what the Government understands to be the situation in China with its one child per family policy. If the Government does not know what the situation is, I have a recently published 83-page document quoting Chinese sources and derived from Chinese official publications, newspaper articles and radio broadcasts, which shows in no uncertain terms that in particular provinces in China the one child per family policy involves gross violations of human rights through coerced abortions and sterilisations. Might I say, for anyone who has ears to hear and who may have been foolish enough to suggest that it merely means the withholding of privileges from families with more than one child, that is not the situation. The situation in many of the provinces is far worse. It is a coercive measure.

         As to the point on which Senator Harradine finished, I said that the Minister has no discretion once a person is categorised as not being a refugee. Senator Harradine should keep in mind that the Minister at all times has a discretion to determine whether a person is a refugee or not. It is just that once the determination is made that a person is not a refugee, there is automatic departure from the country. The Minister does have the ultimate discretion in terms of determining whether a person is a refugee and Senator Harradine should keep that in mind when making his point.

I would like the Minister to clarify whether the people who will be materially affected by the passing of this legislation are actually in the process of applying for refugee status. If they are in that process, are we not doing the very thing that he expressed abhorrence of doing in relation to another case where he did not wish to pre-empt a judicial process or due process that was under way?

Even if you order the release of these people from custody, it will be no good because they will still be designated persons and are required to be detained, notwithstanding what you say'.

The argument for this Bill attempts to paint the picture that every applicant for refugee status or every illegal immigrant will be released into custody. I want to assure people that this simply is not the case. Such releases are at a judge's discretion and are certainly not automatic. However, clause 54S actually prevents the judge from exerting that due discretion in each case.

         I can say two things about that objective. First, this is not soft legislation; and, secondly, the provisions that prevail here, as I have said consistently since 8 o'clock, ensure consistency between the boat people and others in that they are maintained in detention until their cases are processed and determined. That is the objective of the legislation. As has been made clear by Senator Baume, by Minister Hand and by other speakers tonight, the Government does not shy away from the fact that this legislation is tough.

         —Madam Temporary Chair, yes. I cannot say that you would act in that way. You would be the last person to act in the unprincipled and disgraceful way that this coalition of independents—so-called independents—and the Democrats are behaving tonight. It is just unbelievable that the sort of argument put last night by the Democrats is somehow not appropriate tonight. It was vital apparently for the Democrats that the legislation last night had to be knocked out before the Caucus meeting. Because of the time element, they were prepared to sell whatever principles they had left right down the gurgler. Their dramatic defence of free speech, the rights of the individual, and the rights of parliamentarians to talk, discuss and debate major issues meant nothing to them because they had an agenda.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Their agenda tonight is a different one. This time they want to stall. So all the principles that were so significant last night are totally different tonight. The Democrats are without clothes and it is not a very pretty sight. We will let them talk all night. We will stay here. We will not do to them what they did to us, because we have principles and they are demonstrating tonight yet again that they have none.

However, we are not stalling in order for a backroom deal to be done. We have no hope that some negotiation is going to take place while we stall. We are debating because this is of vital concern to people within our own constituencies—people who have begged and pleaded with us to speak on behalf of Cambodian refugees whom they know personally and have visited for two years while they have been detained in custody. They have worked towards helping them to go through due process. They are people who believe that our country still offers justice and humanity in its consideration of the plight of refugees.

        I will not continue with this. I realise that the patience of honourable senators is waning. We are proceeding with what we are trying to say in a fight for justice and truth and to let the cry of a certain group of the Australian public be heard. That is why the debate has been drawing on. It has also been drawing on because I had a faith that when honourable senators could see some of the issues that were being raised by this legislation it would cause them to think, it would cause them to pause, before they took this Committee down a path which is retrograde and draconian.

         —I want to raise briefly the matter of the Australian air traffic control system contract, which has been a matter of great concern for the Senate ever since its inception. I am prompted to do that by the incredible evidence that has been put on the public record in the last two hearings of the Joint Committee on Public Works on 8 April and 27 April. I commend a reading of those
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansards

         to all honourable senators. I think most people reading the evidence given
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         would come to the conclusion that what we are witnessing here is probably the abuse of the public interest by a public monopoly.

         The Public Works Committee was set up under an Act of this Parliament to look at the expenditure of funds beyond a certain level for public works. Essentially, what the Public Works Committee was looking into here was a request by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide it with a blank cheque for up to $50m to build two building complexes—one in Brisbane and one in Melbourne. The CAA gave very little justification for this and virtually no detail. The matter of accountability in this contract is of great parliamentary concern and it is a matter of great concern to the Senate and to the Public Works Committee. It goes right to the heart of public administration as we know it in this country.

         To put this matter in context, I will very briefly give an account of the air traffic control systems that exist in this country. They basically consist of a series of radar stations and the linking of ground stations to those radar stations so that information on air traffic can be provided. We have two very run-down facilities at Brisbane and Sydney, as is well referenced by the press accounts.

         The facilities at Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne were replaced in the recent past by the ATCARDS program, and we have had adequate publicity about the failures of the tender and of Thomson-CSF to fulfil the contract in an efficient and professional way. Since the ATCARDS program we have had the RASPP program with Cairns, Coolangatta, Mount Gellibrand and Mount Macedon. Part of that program is still in train. Again, we have had performance problems with the contractor who again was Thomson.

         The RADREP proposal had been put forward to replace the facilities in both Brisbane and Sydney. That had gone to tender when the Civil Aviation Authority appointed a new Chief Executive Officer, Mr Baldwin from New Zealand. He came in, threw the program out and instituted the TAAATS which is the program we are talking about now. This matter was analysed in part in the Public Works Committee hearings.

         In essence, Mr Baldwin instituted a new program for Australia without any cost analysis, without any design development or anything to justify the system. He just said, `We are going to have this' and proceeded to go through the selection process to bring this about. I do not wish to waste the time of the Senate by going through the shortcomings of the approach in selecting the type of management system proposed for air traffic control, nor by commenting on the difficulties of the hands off, turnkey approach which is also an inherent part of the system that is being proposed in this case. I again advise honourable senators to read their
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansards
         </emphasis>
         for the details of this.

         I will now deal briefly with the concerns we have had with the program. My initial concern was when, in May 1991, only six companies were invited to tender and no Australian companies were allowed to tender for the system. This was an arrogant, unwarranted and indefensible assumption by the CAA that no company in Australia could do it. Only a month before, in April 1991, the Government had signed the tender for the JON program—Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. The tender cost was $1,053m at April 1991 prices—something like four or five times the cost of the civil aviation program. It was a high risk program; there is much original and creative research in it. But the Department of Defence which was letting the contract had no inhibitions at all about allowing Australian companies to tender. It is a matter of record that two Australian companies—AWA and Telecom—were the finalists and the tender was awarded to Telecom.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The question I ask the Senate is: how can we grow as a nation if we do not treat our Australian companies as equals in the area of commercial contracts like this? The tender process that we have developed will sort out the inadequacies of those companies, but it is absolutely outrageous that Australian companies can be debarred from tendering for something like this relatively simple CAA contract. That was my primary concern, which was shared by most of the members of the Senate.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second concern that was raised in the Senate was when, in late March 1992, it was announced that Thomson was the preferred tenderer. The concern was about the very low Australian industry participation that goes with the Thomson bid, and it flew in the face of established government policy.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Again, it is a matter of public record that there was a bitter row with Senator Button, Mr Beazley and Senator Bolkus, Ministers who represented the three departments, who were outraged with the way the contract had been given to Thomson, in the face of higher Australian industry involvement by other companies. The Government is not using a crude argument. It must be understood that it is not a simple argument saying:  we want so and so to win this contract so that Australian companies can have a share on one occasion to fulfil this contract. It is a very sophisticated argument and it is aimed at developing Australian industry, not under one contract but for long term participation in world markets.

         If we look at Thomson's record—I will leave aside its technical inadequacies and deal with those in a few minutes—we will see that it has contributed nothing to the body corporate of Australia in the work it has done. It has moved through with its contracts like a plague of locusts, leaving nothing behind. It has not honoured the offset agreements that it entered into in the past. On one occasion, I am advised, it had to be forgiven by the Government because it had not fulfilled one of its offset obligations.

         It is not an Australian company. It is only a shell company of a French company. Adding insult to injury in this case, there was a $50m civil works program for these buildings which the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works inquired into. Apparently Thomson proposes to do that with a company called Beca, which is a New Zealand company. It is a shell company with no Australian substance to it at all. The final insult to injury is that it will use Beca, if it finally gets the contract, to satisfy offset requirements of the New Zealand Government for a New Zealand contract.

         The other finalist was Hughes, which has a very good record of Australian industry participation. It has written over $1 billion worth of work in Australia in the past 10 years. Not only has it entered into offset agreements and honoured every one of them, but also it is proposing to have a partnership agreement with its Australian associates—BHP, AWA and the Bassett group—to go on and tender for worldwide contracts. As I say, the record of Hughes has been absolutely exemplary in fulfilling its offset requirements in Australia.

         AWA was one of the companies associated with it. AWA has developed a voice switching apparatus for the air traffic control system. It has been a high cost, high value R&amp;D program. It is a quite good switch. AWA is looking for worldwide markets for this. I am advised that at the present time reports are coming back from Austrade in our embassy in Beijing that the Chinese Government, which is one of AWA's targets for buying this voice switching gear, is concerned that it did not win the contract on this occasion.

         It is very difficult for a company to market its products abroad if its own country has no confidence in it. AWA at present is tendering for somewhere in excess of $120m worth of aerospace equipment around the world. It has had a very heavy censure placed on it by not being selected with Hughes on this contract. While we cannot accept that in isolation as justification for the awarding of a contract, it is one of the things that has to be considered. Of course, that is why Senator Button, Senator Bolkus and Mr Beazley were so furious about what happened.

         The major concern that the Senate has with the latest CAA contract gets to accountability. This Parliament does have to account for the expenditure of public funds. Of course, that is the concern of the Public Works Committee hearings. I stress that this is not a party political matter. If honourable senators read the report, listen to the comments in the chamber and read the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         records of the inquiries of the Public Works Committee, they will see that this has unanimous support across the Committee. There is no division along party lines in questioning the CAA.

         I must say that in Australia we do have a system of assessing tender documents and selecting equipment in a way that is transparent and allows accountability to take place. We might end up with the wrong decision on some occasions, but there is never any criticism that somewhere or other malpractice has taken place along the way. I am at a loss to understand why the Civil Aviation Authority has on this occasion adopted the practices of a Third World country or a totalitarian regime.

         I return to the beginning of this matter. In May 1991 six companies were invited to tender. Mr Baldwin said that he knew who to invite, and he invited six companies. In the end only four responded. That raises serious questions about Mr Baldwin's knowledge and judgment of the industry. From there we moved to the selection process. As I said earlier, we have a set procedure for this. Following a series of public notices, we move through various stages until we come to a final decision. On this occasion the procedure set by Senator Bolkus's Department, the Department of Administrative Services—the calling of tenders—was not followed. The reason given by Mr Baldwin was that all this was far too complex—it could not be done in this case; one could not simply write a specification and go to tender through the normal practices.

         We do call tenders on some very complex things and some very high cost equipment in this country. The tender procedures are flexible enough to allow that to be done. At the end of the day it is rubbish to say that an air traffic control system cannot be tendered for through the accepted Australian procedures. An air traffic control system collects data in one sphere and processes it in another. There are no real unknowns in that. There are certainly a few difficulties in putting the thing together. Some companies such as Thomson-CSF never seem to get it right anywhere in the world. Most major companies such as Siemens Plessey, Hughes and Raytheon can. It is quite possible to write a specific tender for this situation. Without a tender it is very hard to fairly judge the competitive claims of people who are tendering to supply the system.

         The assessment has to be fair not only to satisfy the principal requirement, which is to establish that the interests of the Australian taxpayer have been met, but also to satisfy the companies themselves. On a contract like this they would spend somewhere between $600,000 and $700,000 in preparing a tender. They are entitled to a professional assessment of their bid.

         In my time in parliament we faced contracts for Defence that go right to the limit of technology, including the new tactical fighter when the FA-18 was bought, the Collins submarines and the Anzac ships. They involved billions of dollars, as against millions of dollars in this case. They are highly technical, on the fringe of technology. In all of them tender documents and stages were prepared and followed. There was never any suspicion that any malpractice took place anywhere along the line.

         As part of the assessment process in this instance, five assessment groups were set up. They were pretty broadly based. They had 25 air traffic controllers spread across the five groups, 25 engineers and technical people. They looked at the operational requirements, the technical side of it, the civil works, the finance, life cycle costs and project management. They made their assessment.

         The first company to miss out was Siemens Plessey, which in some ways was the front runner. It had a proven system off the shelf and was probably the cheapest. It was removed on the specious grounds, which I went through in this chamber some while ago, of having a high risk program for its flight data processing. That left Hughes, IBM and Thomson in the deal. The five evaluation groups that I have referred to all selected Hughes on every count.

         In November 1991 Hughes, IBM and Thomson were asked by letter for their final bid. Traditionally, when a company gets a request for a final bid on a contract, that is the end. It is the final price, the deal is over and everything is considered on that point. Hughes and IBM proceeded on the basis that this was the end. They made their bid, to be told, to their surprise, by Mr Baldwin—or his mouthpiece, Dr Edwards—on 20 December 1991 that the selection system had now changed and a decision would be made in March 1992. At this time Hughes was clearly ahead. The evaluation teams had all selected it. Its price was somewhere around $90m less and it was 11 months quicker to fulfil its contract. Despite all that, the CAA claimed that it was all too close to judge.

         The CAA sought time through deferment so that the goalposts could be changed and the bids could be altered by Thomson to make them competitive with Hughes. One of the things that the CAA did was to go to Hughes and say, `Look, your contract time is unacceptable to us; you must extend it by six months on the completion stage and by a further five months on the test and transition stage', which Hughes did. That made Hughes the same as Thomson.

         The reasons for the preferment given by the CAA were that Hughes essentially was a much higher risk and that Thomson had delivered more air traffic control systems around the world.

         The claim that Hughes is a high risk company is not supported by fact. It does have a much better system of coping with flight data processing as well as the radar data processing than Thomson. The importance of that is that something like 10 per cent of Australia's air space will be covered by radar and 90 per cent will be not covered, and that 90 per cent which is not covered is the flight data processing which comes from flight plans. It has to be integrated into the display system and the presentation, and that requires a very sophisticated software program.

         There were protests to the Public Works Committee about the selection process from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the Metal and Engineering Workers Union, the Association of Professional Engineers and Scientists of Australia, from Siemens Plessey and from Hughes itself.

         So much for the procedures; what about the price of the contract? The best information I have is that the initial bid from Hughes was $190m and that from Thomson $280m. When it came down to the November 1991 bid, Hughes lowered its bid to $140m and Thomson came down to $185m. In March 1992, when the selection was made, I estimate that the Hughes bid was around $150m and the Thomson bid was around $160m to $165m. There was always a very significant price difference between the two bids.

         In conclusion, I refer to one very important point, and that is the place of the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is very clear that the whole program was driven by Mr Baldwin, the Chief Executive Officer, and that all the advice that went to the board of the Civil Aviation Authority was filtered through Mr Baldwin's hands. This Parliament needs to see the reports made by the five evaluation committees back in November 1991, which all favoured Hughes, and compare them with the advice that was given to the board by Mr Baldwin at the same time. We need to see how well informed the board was.

         The directors of the Civil Aviation Authority must recognise that they bear a very serious responsibility. Directors' duties certainly are onerous these days but their obligations—even though they are in a government business enterprise—are exactly the same as those of the executives of any other commercial company. It might be that in the past they have worked in a low-key way, free from controversy, but the commercial law of Australia applies to them as it applies to the directors of any other company. They must protect their shareholders' interests; they have a fiduciary duty. It seems that they have failed to exercise the care and caution which is incumbent on them to satisfy themselves.

         The board of the Civil Aviation Authority is not endowed with any inherent technical expertise. Apparently, it accepted Mr Baldwin's advice without ever seeking any independent assessment of it. Two audits were performed, but they were performed at the direction of Mr Baldwin. There was no independent assessment of the advice that was given them. My advice to the directors of the Civil Aviation Authority is that not only are they in precisely the same position as directors of any other commercial company, they should also take very careful note of what is now happening to the directors of Compass. In that case there was a very powerful individual advising a board—of which he was a member—and the board members failed to seek independent advice. The risk for the CAA board members is far greater than for the directors of Compass because the liability of the Compass directors, in financial terms, will be considerably less than the liability that the directors of the Civil Aviation Authority are exposed to.

I happened to be discussing this with him during an Estimates committee adjournment earlier this year. I asked him to write to me with his concerns so that I could take action on them. Honourable senators will appreciate that the trigger to my speaking tonight was the fact that we met until 3.40 this morning. Dr Adams's letter reads:

In the first 10 years of Federal Parliament, only 23 Acts a year were passed. Now, the figure is over 200 per year with little change in sitting times. Consequently, the number of hours devoted to each Act has decreased from 25 hours in the first 10 years of our existence to less than 2 1/2 hours at present.

         I say `dilemma' because I found the sentiments and assumptions within the motion antithetical not only to my views but also, more importantly, to the concerns of the voters whom I represent in this place. Nevertheless, I felt that it would be discourteous and disrespectful to the majority view of this Senate to place myself at odds with it. I choose to retain the option of opposing the majority view on matters which cause me a much greater level of disagreement or disquiet than the matter raised by Senator Newman. However, I feel the need to express my qualifications regarding Senator Newman's motion from the point of view of the Greens and the many members of the peace and social justice movements within the community.

         The fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea should be used as a time of sober reflection on the futility of war. When we look back, yes, we can say that Australia's well-being was served and, yes, we can say that many firm personal relationships were forged. But we also have to look at the overall consequences. Thousands of lives were lost; extraordinary damage was done which cost millions of dollars; and now, 50 years on, the world situation is such that anything which looks remotely like a glorification of war can be regarded only as obscene.

         The US Congress recognised the ANZUS treaty, and we would want to say that the treaty, particularly in recent years, has been the means by which the US and, to some extent, our own country has sought to bully New Zealand, the third party to the treaty, into acting against what it sees as its own best interest. This is not the behaviour of a friend or genuine ally. The New Zealand decision against nuclear warships was translated into a boycott of the entire defence relationship, including intelligence exchange. Allies do not make or break relations according to differences which are stated in mature and rational terms. Is this the sort of treaty and friendship that we want to honour and promote; one in which the powerful members bully the less powerful; a friendship based on military expediency?

         We would also want to say that the extraordinary degree of cooperation noted in Senator Newman's motion did not apparently extend to the US informing the Australian public of the use of the joint bases in Australia to monitor Scud missile firings during the Gulf war, in spite of the Hawke Government's utmost readiness to support the US in its initiative in that conflict. Indeed, as Mr Ted Lindsay pointed out in the House of Representatives last week, the degree of information available, even to Australian parliamentarians, about the nature of the joint defence facilities is less than that available to the American public. Indeed, Mr Lindsay pointed out that the briefing offered to members of the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, FADT, was an unclassified one and that material readily available to the public in the US was not made available to members of the subcommittee. So much for the extraordinarily close friendship which Senator Newman's motion claims we share with the US!

         —Yesterday I gave notice of a motion concerning the retirement of Mr Jim Bell, AM, who this Friday retires as Chairman of the Australian Jockey Club after nine years at the helm. During the years that Jim has been Chairman I have come to know him well and on many occasions I have partaken of his hospitality—and I did so last Saturday. I have also had occasion to meet with him in my role as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. As honourable senators would be aware, the Senate undertook an inquiry into the racing industry and the AJC was represented at those hearings.

         Jim Bell's interest in racing and racehorses goes back a long way. He started his active interest in racing in the south of the State and was a member of the South East Racing Association which controls racing in this area. He was involved on that committee from 1968 to 1977 and, for most of that time, was also Chairman of the Goulburn Race Club.

         He was first elected to the AJC committee in 1977, became Vice-Chairman in 1980 and Chairman in 1983. During the time of his chairmanship he has also been Chairman of the Australian Conference of Principal Racing Clubs at biannual meetings at Sydney, alternating with the VRC Chairman. The Australian Conference of Principal Racing Clubs is the controlling body of racing in Australia—an industry which, by any measure, is a significant contributor to the economy. I believe it is the third largest industry in Australia.

         Anyone who has been to Randwick racecourse cannot help but be impressed by its magnificence. It is truly Royal Randwick and on a spring or autumn day there is nothing quite so splendid as that racecourse. Jim Bell's contribution as Chairman has clearly been evident in the number of improvements made to Randwick and to racing over the years. The increase in drug testing and the effectiveness of it through the new facilities at Randwick is one such indicator, as is the new $30m grandstand which was opened in February this year by Her Majesty the Queen—which definitely made the racecourse Royal Randwick. I looked over that grandstand last Saturday with Mr Tony Allport, a member of the committee, and Mr Bill Rutledge, and no doubt the Australian Jockey Club in Sydney has made sure that the ordinary punter who goes to the races to enjoy a day out and see the magnificent horses racing can do it in a comfort which is now even greater than the comfort experienced by the members of the AJC.

         In addition, the equine swimming pool at the Randwick racecourse has been completed. That is another achievement for Jim Bell. He has also been a great supporter of the stewards that control racing, and I know they respect him greatly. The Chairman of the Stipendiary Stewards, John Schreck, and the Chief Veterinary Surgeon, Craig Suann, have both been fully supported by Mr Bell in his endeavours to make racing in New South Wales and Australia better than anywhere else in the world.

         Having been involved in the Goulburn Race Club for so many years, Jim is concerned about the financial problems facing country race clubs. Over the years he has been a great visitor to country clubs and I know that quite often he has visited the show course of the north in northern New South Wales—my home race club of Quirindi. In addition, he has visited other race clubs such as the Tamworth race club where a turnover of $1m is commonplace. Last year on a cup day that club recorded a turnover of $2.3m. Many race clubs in Australia now have big prize money. In fact, 18 races in country New South Wales have prize money of $100,000 or more. This year the AJC decided that there was a need for some form of rationalisation of country racing. Of course, that is a fairly sensitive subject for country clubs and the NIMBY principle always abounds. The choice at hand is a reduction in the number of clubs, a reduction in the number of tracks, a reduction in the number of race days or a reallocation of funding.

         Of course, Jim Bell has provided the impetus for the rationalisation of country racing. He has been Chairman since 1983. At that time revenue from racing was $1.2 billion. Total racing revenue is now $3.1 billion, and galloping contributes something like $2.6 billion to the coffers of the TAB. Of course, a lot of that goes back into racing.

         I know that the rationalisation of country racing is a matter that concerns Jim Bell because, like me, he is a great supporter of racing in country areas. He is also a great horse owner, having owned a number of good horses including the 1979 Melbourne Cup third placegetter, Red Nose. I am sure that now he is retiring from the onerous position of Chairman he will be able to enjoy his racing more actively as an owner and a punter. He might even spend some time in New York, where he has been made a member of the New York Jockey Club—the first Australian to receive that prestigious honour.

         As he is a family man with grandchildren, he may prefer to partake of the hospitality of Royal Randwick or the local racing clubs around this area, which I know he enjoys a great deal. But I am quite sure he will be able to spend more time with his grandchildren and his family. I know his daughter has been of great assistance to him during his years as Chairman, as Jim's wife died at the time he became Chairman.

However, in accordance with the Annual Report Guidelines the Department provides in its Annual Report a range of statistics on training and development activities including those which relate to eligible expenditure under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. Extensive information on the Department's training and development activities is also available in the Public Service Commission's Human Resource Development Survey (1990-91).

        Under the Training Guarantee Act, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is required to expend a minimum of 1% of its annual payroll on training. The Training Guarantee Act strictly defines the spending which may be counted as eligible training expenditure.  In 1990-91 the Department's expenditure on eligible training was 2.61%.  It is expected that expenditure in 1991-92 will be at a similar level.
