        I do so because, although most honourable senators would claim that their particular petition on any day may be distinctive from the general run-of-the mill of petitions, in this case I would like to point out that this petition derives from Scottsdale, a town of some approximately 4,000 inhabitants. In a few days, some 1,321 of its residents readily signed a petition on behalf of a very fundamental component of their community. In doing so, they did not seek political attention, but rather just attention to the specific nature of the Materials Research Laboratory which is located there. I will not delay the Senate any further except to say that I think this matter needs to have attention drawn to it.

Accordingly, the committee recommends that the Order of the Senate, agreed to on 4 March 1992, be modified to provide that the committee present its report on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 on 5 May 1992.

       <para>
        This Bill seeks to repeal part of the Australian design rule No. 19.01 which deals with electrical connections on motor cycles.
       </para>
       <para>
        The aim of the Australian design rule which has come into effect as of 1 March 1992 is to force all new motor cycles that are sold from 1 March onwards to have the headlight wired in such a way that when the engine is started the headlight will automatically come on.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are dealing specifically with clause 19.6.106.9 of the Australian Design Rule No. 19.01 of the Motor Vehicle Standards Bill 1992 which we are moving to have repealed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government seems to have neglected to consult with the users regarding this new regulation. In my experience no one single motor cyclist has been pleased to have this design rule forced upon them.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been much research into the pros and cons of having lights wired on. The key point is that when you look for the research evidence, both in Australia and overseas, you find that what is lacking is conclusive evidence that this measure actually adds to road safety. What this means is that the government hastily made this decision without properly researching the issue and has gone ahead without properly consulting those most directly affected.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision as to whether to turn on the motor cycle light during the day should be up to the rider. A responsibility, as with other vehicles, that is up to the driver. The majority of cyclists do turn their lights on for part of their day riding but surely experienced riders, who are quite adamant that having the light on can add to the risk, should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding safety.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from the freedom of choice aspect there is the question of legal liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not clear whether or not this Bill will add to the liability of the motorcyclist who could be involved in a accident with a motor car. The difficulty lies in proving whether or not the light was actually on. The globe may have been smashed in the accident, it may have blown two minutes before the impact, or the day before. Along with the legal liability question there are the ramifications for insurance.
       </para>
       <para>
        This new design rule could also add a false sense of security. People could believe that by having the light wired on it will somehow make them safer. This, in many cases, could be the exact opposite. Questions arise concerning the ability of some motorists to judge the speed and distance apart of an oncoming vehicle with its headlight on, thus adding to the danger, not to the safety on the roads.
       </para>
       <para>
        But where this design rule is at its most ridiculous is with agbikes having to have their light wired on.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I support most vehemently every effort to increase road safety, I believe that this issue of motor cyclists being forced to have their light on is a misguided move by the Minister, further highlighting that this government is out of touch with the people of Australia.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In recent times we have seen the rapid internationalisation of financial markets. In practice, geographic and political boundaries are becoming more and more irrelevant to the way in which the world goes about its business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This trend towards internationalisation has led in turn to world markets becoming increasingly interdependent. Trends in one national market have immediate effects on other markets throughout the world. No better example of this interdependence can be found, Mr President, than in the stockmarket crash of 1987 which spread almost simultaneously through the world's established and emerging securities markets.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This process of internationalisation creates administrative, jurisdictional, detection and enforcement difficulties not only for the international aspects of trading but also for the regulation of domestic markets.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This in turn increases the scope for the pursuit of undesirable market practices across national boundaries and the penetration of domestic markets by undesirable operators.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Integral to the maintenance of investor confidence in, and the efficiency of, national financial markets must be the development of effective international co-operation between the national business regulatory agencies responsible for administering and monitoring those markets. This co-operation involves the capacity to seek from, and provide to, such agencies in other countries flexible, speedy and effective assistance.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This need for increased co-operation and assistance has been recognised in a number of international forums. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has called upon its member organisations to provide reciprocal assistance in obtaining information in respect of market oversight and prevention of fraud.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the Commonwealth Law Ministers meeting in Auckland in 1990, Ministers identified the need for mutual assistance in the area of business regulation. That meeting noted that voluntary co-operation between agencies needed to be reinforced by legislative provisions to enable powers of compulsion to be exercised in the fulfilment of requests in appropriate cases.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similarly, Mr President, the OECD, in its review of the impact of internationalisation on financial markets, noted the need to achieve world wide regulatory coverage of international conglomerates. The OECD recommended the development of arrangements for exchanges of information between national regulators which supervise different parts of financial conglomerates as one way of ensuring appropriate regulation of these bodies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In answer to these international calls for closer cooperation, Mr President, this Bill sets up the framework for Australian agencies, such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, to provide assistance to their overseas counterparts. As a result of the legislation, these agencies will be better placed to seek assistance in their own investigations from their foreign counterparts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In short, Mr President, the proposed legislation would enable prescribed Australian agencies, with the Attorney-General's consent, to compel the provision of information documents and sworn testimony in aid of requests from foreign agencies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The scheme established by this Bill will complement the obtaining and exchange of information between countries for the purposes of criminal prosecutions which is established by the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the proposed scheme for mutual assistance between business regulators applications by the foreign agency will be made to the Australian agency in the first instance which will make an initial assessment of the application and either reject or pass it on to the Attorney-General. In making this initial decision the prescribed agency will take into account amongst other things:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        If the Australian agency does not reject the application the Attorney-General may decide whether to authorise the collection of the information sought by taking the following matters into account:

         —When we adjourned this matter last night I was in the process of explaining that the arguments which were put in favour of this legislation, namely, that there was a shortage of logs and that this was due to the locking up of forests in national parks and in heritage areas, were demonstrably false. I was reading a quotation from the Resource Assessment Commission, and I will begin that quotation again. The Resource Assessment Commission said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An important consequence of the prolonged period of overcutting is an impending shortage in the supply of hardwood sawlogs—
       </para>
       <para>
        quite clearly identifying the overcutting as the source of the problems. The quotation continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This coincides with, and is caused by, the cutting out of most of the unreserved old growth well before significant numbers of regrowth saw logs reach harvestable size. This anticipated outcome is probably the main reason that milling quotas have been reduced progressively in all states. This reduction, rather than the inclusion of timber producing areas in national parks, is the main cause of the dwindling supply of hardwood sawlogs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Resource Assessment Commission also rebutted the ridiculous claim, which we heard repeated last night, that access to forest was being impeded by the Australian Heritage Commission. It concluded:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The listing of a place on the Register of the National Estate imposes very few legal restrictions on activities that may be conducted on that place. National Estate listing, for example, does not equate with the declaration of conservation reserve status, nor does it preclude logging in forests.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not an earth shattering finding, as anyone who has read the Australian Heritage Commission Act and followed its operation will know. Nevertheless, the truth has not been allowed to get in the way of a good story, and I am sure later on today we will hear that good story, false as it is, repeated endlessly—particularly by the Opposition. We are now debating a Bill which explicitly excludes the Heritage Commission from a continuing role in monitoring projects which have been granted so-called resource security.

         The National Association of Forest Industries backed up its complaints with a breathtaking claim that $4.8 billion of investment in timber and paper processing projects depended on the passage of this resource security legislation. According to Michelle Grattan, writing in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Age
         </emphasis>
         on 8 March last year, Senator Button—not in any way averse to embroidering the truth—claimed that as much as $20 billion of investment in resource processing projects might go ahead. It is hard to believe that Senator Button exceeded the industry's hyperbole by more than 400 per cent, but it seems that he did. In the same article, Senator Richardson was quoted as saying the debate was really about one Tasmanian pulp mill. It has become quite obvious that Senator Richardson was much closer to the truth, but even he has been proved to be optimistic. North Broken Hill has told the Government that passage of this Bill would not guarantee—and I repeat that, would not guarantee—that it would proceed with a pulp mill in northern Tasmania.

         In its draft report, the Resource Assessment Commission noted that neither the Association nor any other industry representative had guaranteed that projects would proceed if legislation were enacted, and that representatives of companies involved in the industry had stated that current capital costs and market conditions would prevent immediate investment. In other words, there is no urgency about this legislation at all. The same conclusion was drawn in a memo in October last year by the Deputy Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Sandy Hollway, to Mr Hawke and other Ministers, which stated:

        Contrary to the long and loud howls of the forest industries, the facts of the matter are that, firstly, national parks and reserves are not responsible for the loss of timber resource available for logging; secondly, the Australian Heritage Commission has not posed any significant obstacle to the timber industry; and thirdly, resource security will not produce an investment bonanza.

         In other words, the pillars on which this Bill rests are mirages. It should never have reached this chamber; it should have remained nothing more than a fantasy in the minds of those who want to wish away the environmental and economic realities of Australia in the 1990s. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the provisions of this Bill are anathema to ecologically sustainable development, to sensible economic policy, and to sound environmental management. The first stated objective of the Bill is to `identify, and facilitate the protection and conservation of, forest areas of significant environmental, cultural or heritage value'. This is supposedly to be achieved by a comprehensive integrated assessment process that involves consideration of the environmental, cultural, heritage, social and economic impact of the project. In other words, it is already predicated on the idea that there will be some intrusion into those areas.

         If one reads the fine print, all that is required is that the Minister `must be satisfied' that an appropriate assessment has been completed. This is a loophole big enough for several large logging trucks to drive right through. If all the Ministers have to do is show that they are satisfied, they have the discretion to simply accredit previous studies as meeting the assessment criteria, whether or not those studies are adequate. If their decision is challenged in the courts, they do not have to show that the assessment was thorough, but merely that they were satisfied that it was appropriate.

         This is not merely an academic point because the Tasmanian Government fully expects that the 1.1 million hectares of so-called multiple use forest which it has designated for logging will not be—and I stress `will not be'—subject to further assessment. This was made absolutely clear by the members of the Forests and Forest Industry Council of Tasmania at a recent Democrat seminar on resource security held in Hobart, despite the fact that at least some of those 1.1 million hectares had not been assessed at all—again I stress `had not been assessed'; for example, a large area adjoining the Mount Field National Park. A further 10 per cent of forest was included in the logging zone, against the recommendation of the Parks, Wildlife and Heritage Department that it be nominated for World Heritage listing. The Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council told our seminar that it had not been—again I stress `had not been'—consulted on resource security by the Federal and State governments. That surely underlines the weakness of that first criterion in the Act, which relates to the surety with which forest areas would be identified to facilitate the protection and conservation of those areas.

         Tasmania's attitude guarantees that a Commonwealth-State assessment process would be either a whitewash or a brawl. Given that the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is alleged to be a world-scale pulp mill, the odds would be heavily in favour of a chlorine bleached whitewash. The irony of this legislation is that a real commitment to up front, integrated and thorough project assessments would negate any need for resource security legislation under which the Commonwealth gives up its environmental powers. This is because a genuine assessment would greatly reduce the chance of environmental surprises springing out of the woodwork and preventing access to certain forest areas once the project is under way. I draw a strong contrast between this legislation and my private member's Bill on threatened species which would see such a comprehensive up-front assessment of areas with management plans put in place before—I stress again `before'—projects would be proposed.

         The major reason for the uncertainty which industry complains about is the lack of a comprehensive assessment process. If a thorough survey of the value of a forest area is not conducted before logging is approved, it is inevitable that surprises will result. Far from being the product of environmental laws which are too stringent, uncertainty in resource allocation is a result of laws which are too weak. We simply do not know enough about this nation's ecosystems. The surveys now being conducted are grossly underfunded and will take literally centuries to finish—by which time, as with the painting of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, we will have to start all over again because the Australian environment will have been totally transformed by the greenhouse effect and continuing human plunder.

         At the recent seminar in Hobart conducted by the Australian Democrats we put this view to members of the Forests and Forest Industry Council of Tasmania, who agreed that our view was logical but that logic would not solve the problem to which resource security had become the only answer. The Democrats reject the view that illogical legislation should be passed simply to appease a section of industry. The main reason why this Bill would be an environmental and economic disaster is that it would entrench the logging of native forests and lock out better alternatives for decades to come.

         The problems of the forest industries have not been caused by environmental laws or the environment movement, or even by the overwhelming majority of Australians who oppose native forest logging.

         The fact is that native forest logging is a dying industry. As the forest economist Judy Clark has documented in detail, it is dying because native forest hardwoods are increasingly being displaced in the sawn timber market by plantation softwoods from Australia, New Zealand and Chile. It is dying because the export woodchip market will soon be dominated by supplies from huge plantations of Australian eucalypts in such countries as Brazil, Chile, Portugal, Spain and South Africa. It is dying because of the woeful incompetence of State forestry commissions who subsidised an uneconomic interest at huge expense to the public purse.

         The Resource Assessment Commission's figures show—and I think the Senate needs to have these figures drummed into its collective head—that between 1927 and 1989 the forestry commissions ran up deficits of $4.4 billion, in absolute terms, not adjusted for inflation. To take their relative value, if those debts which were run up in earlier years were adjusted, it would make that figure much higher. These same forestry commissions would have an even greater role in forest management if this Bill were to pass.

         No amount of legislation will revive the prospects for native forest logging. What is needed is enough Government wit and vision to move the Australian industry into plantations for its own sake. What is also needed is for the Government to recognise that to encourage investment in large export oriented pulp mills based on chlorine bleaching is to place bets on the survival of dinosaurs. Ecologically sustainable development demands that we move to industrial processes that minimise effluent and resource consumption. The depressed state of the international pulp and paper markets suggests that the most sensible strategy is import replacement based on non-wood fibre.

         For the pulp and paper industry, the rational conclusion is to encourage the further development of medium scale pulp and paper plants employing relatively benign chemical processes and using recycled paper, plantation timbers to the extent that one has to phase them out, and non-wood fibre sources as feed stock. Judy Clark has documented numerous investment proposals that meet these criteria, yet the Government and the Opposition have failed to get behind these alternative industries as the best way to eliminate our pulp and paper trade deficit through the 1990s. I recently spoke to canegrowers in northern Queensland who would dearly love to build a kenaf based paper industry from the ground up, provided they could get some government assistance for development purposes. It is these opportunities that the Government should be looking at. It is these opportunities on which the Government has turned its back.

If the Opposition is seriously committed to these amendments, it has, in effect, abandoned its opposition to the Bill and will be exposed for its abject inability to hold a principled line in the face of interest group pressure.

         Having betrayed the resources industry on which Australia's economic survival depends, through the `prevent mining at all costs' decision regarding Coronation Hill, this Labor Government now presents a belated sop to the same industries. It was very disturbing to hear Senator Coulter's contribution a little while ago when he said that for the sake of the environment, and the economy, this Bill must meet its early demise. It is absolutely unbelievable to think that the Democrats can stand in here and honestly profess that they care about the economy or jobs or exports or Australia's income. That matters not to the Australian Democrats. If it did matter to them, they would be trying to make sure that this piece of legislation actually had some substance to it. It is a severely flawed piece of legislation and we have said that to the industry all the way along the line. Of course, the industry has now come out in support of the position that we are taking in trying to make this very seriously flawed piece of legislation somewhat better by amending it at the committee stage.

That is the committee that will be able to assess the evidence provided by the witnesses who will be affected by this. It will also be able to assess the evidence that has been provided by the States and by the Premiers. All of this is particularly important if we are to turn this country around.

         There is no security in this Labor Government as it continues to follow the example of Senator Richardson, who made it his business to buy green preferences at the expense of blue-collar jobs. If the electoral equation means short term vote gains for this Government, well and good. Of course, the Democrats are in exactly the same position. They have lost ground, they have no ground, they stand for nothing, other than for a few little trees that might be able to regenerate. They do not worry about the industry at all. They do not worry about the jobs that that industry will generate. We are talking about trying to make some legislation responsible legislation. To this end, the unamended Bill is deliberately framed to give the minimum anxiety to the extreme green lobby which, in spite of its public opposition to anything that appears to assist forest resource industries, can rest easy in the knowledge that this Bill will still enable a Labor government to intervene at any stage of a project. That is not what is desirable. It is not what is needed by the industry and it is not what is needed by Australians.

         Indeed, when introducing the Bill last year the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) acknowledged that there may be circumstances where the Government would wish to `take a second look at the way a project with legislated resource security is being conducted'. What does that mean, other than that the Government can and probably will interfere? It is not much use for the Minister to say that such circumstances would be `remote' and `unexpected', as he did. In recent years, through Coronation Hill and through the Tasmanian deal with the Greens, Labor has taught both business and resources employees that it cannot be trusted. That is a simple fact of life. We have seen these deals being done regularly for short term gain in votes, and we know where the Democrats stand in that area.

         But nor does it mean much to acknowledge and disclaim the `industry's feeling of uncertainty, engendered by fear of the Commonwealth using its powers to remove significant tracts of forest from productive investments'. That is also a quote from Mr Griffiths. This does not make sense. These fears can only remain and increase when constructive advice from the industry is ignored, and action can be taken under this Bill against approved projects because of `major physical impact' on the environment, an endangered species, or a significant Aboriginal area if such circumstances are `not foreseen'. Who are they trying to bluff? There is enough information, there is enough research, there are enough agencies and so forth prepared to investigate these things long before they are approved.

It is for that reason that the Australian Democrats must also be confronted and denied on a lot of issues for which they stand.

In general terms, it provides a balance between the needs of conservation and those of the timber industry over 2.5 million hectares of public land. I believe it was unfortunate there was no direct input from the timber industry when the process was commenced in September 1990. As a Western Australian, I would frankly consider that the Department of Conservation and Land Management needed no outside input in establishing sensible rules and procedures with the industry, as were laid down in a 10-year regional management plan of December 1987 that gave resource security while proposing 95,000 hectares of new parks and reserves.

         The amendments that we are talking about, briefly summarised, would be as follows: to extend the eligibility for resource security to areas involving an investment of under $100m; where resource security is lost because of unforeseen circumstances, to provide access to alternative resources; and to remove the provision of clause 23 of the Bill, in which it is stated that no compensation is payable.

After nearly a decade of this Government at a national level destroying the future of Australia and after 2 1/2 years of the most diabolical government combination ever in Tasmania, the situation there is absolutely desperate, and the people of Tasmania reflect that.

Whatever reasons they may cook up do not matter because we know they are opposed to it, and at least they come out and say so. The Government has yet to demonstrate its bona fides for even wanting resource security legislation. As far as the coalition is concerned, we totally support security of resource. It should not be necessary to have legislation to provide one of the absolute, basic fundamentals, but we do need legislation because of the antics of the Government. One has only to look back at the Evans spy flights and the Richardson fiasco over the Wesley Vale mill to realise that.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In conclusion, the NAFI attitude toward the current legislation can be summed up as follows: The Association could not provide full national support for the existing legislation but would not oppose its passage if it could provide the basis for a northern Tasmanian pulpmill. If, however, provision was made for the eligibility criteria to include scope to cover State or regional forest assessments, provided they were carried out to Commonwealth standards, and the compensation issue was dealt with satisfactorily, a great deal of public support would be forthcoming from the industry together with a lot more investment and protection of jobs.

        Of course, these included every one of the major paper companies, every one of the major timber companies and many of the leading union people in Australia—and the ACTU. On 19 February, NAFI put out a press statement which said, in part:

       <para>
        And that is a fact. This goes for me too: I will give this my absolutely total support and the coalition will give it total support—on the approval of this minor amendment. It is not a major issue. There is nothing in the philosophy of the Labor Party that says that this cannot be done. There is nothing in the new publication, whatever its name is, that says that we cannot do this. It is not contrary to Labor policy in any way. It completely fits in with the statement of the Minister back in March last year. Why has it suddenly become a major obstacle, if the Government's bona fides are not in question?

         Since the Gordon below Franklin fiasco, Tasmania has declined. We are now playing with an industry, the second biggest industry in Australia, that encompasses 250,000 employees. The Government is playing games with them. There has been a 120 per cent increase in timber imports since 1983-84 and not one step has been taken by the Government that is going to improve that in any way. In fact, the Government is only taking steps that cloud the issue even more, that take away any sense of security and that would make employment and investment absolutely unthinkable.

         The media, of course, are no help. They are always trying to go for the quick bash and the beat-ups and the sensations. They are trying to build these conflicts into the situation. In fact, I was not terribly impressed yesterday morning when a reporter of some sort rang me up and threatened me that, if I did not make a statement to him live on the air then, he would take certain actions against me. I think that is about as far down as it gets. I really believe that, when it gets to that stage—whoever it is, whether in the Government or not—of putting a journalist of this nature up to that sort of story, the game is going too far.

It represents no change to his Party's philosophy, but to the 250,000 employees in the industry throughout Australia, it would make all the difference in the world and give them some security.

         —The Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 came into being under the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. We know the reputation of the combination of Mr Hawke and the Minister presently at the table, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson). We are well aware that Senator Richardson was one of the prime movers in getting rid of him, but we are also well aware that both Mr Hawke and Senator Richardson—Senator Richardson, in particular—brought the green votes forward for Mr Hawke on the previous occasion that Tasmania wanted a paper mill. We understand that on that occasion what Senator Richardson did was to let down not only the Tasmanian industry, but also timber industries and development in this country for many years. What he did was say to the world at large, `Do not try development in this country because there will be no guarantee you will get it.'

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This Bill, of course, continues in that vein. This Bill is supposed to give security, guarantee of a resource. In other words, a company that is prepared to spend over $100 million in setting up a paper mill or any development that requires a resource of this country, should be able to look to this Bill to give it a guarantee that if it spends all that money it will have a resource at the end of the day when it starts up its business. This Bill deliberately leaves so many loopholes that, come the next election, as happened last time through Senator Richardson, the green vote will be given to the Government.

         Let me tell the Senate what it says. To begin with it concerns developments over $100m, so the 1,200 sawmillers across Australia do not get a thing out of this. They are expected to spend all their money on development in the hope that the resource will be available to them at the end. There is no guarantee at all; there is not even any pretence of a guarantee. So it does nothing for all those small sawmillers round Australia, nothing at all.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill supposedly gives the large companies, those spending more than $100m, some resource security. But let me explain just what it does do. It says, `Okay, we will give you this area, but we will only give you this area of forest for your resource if, even at the last minute, someone cannot find some sort of threatened species in that area. If they do, if someone can find some threatened species, no matter how small or insignificant, then at the last minute that reserve can be taken away from you and that resource will not be made available'. There is no guarantee, no suggestion, that a substitute resource would be made available. Indeed, a specific clause in the Bill says that no compensation will be available to a business that goes bust, even if it has spent all that money—over $100m—had the resource taken away from it, and been offered no other substitute resource. The Bill specifically provides that no compensation will be available.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As Senator Archer said, why will the Government not amend the legislation to take out the no compensation clause? It does not have to guarantee compensation, but it could at least remove the no compensation clause. The sawmillers and the smaller industries could then make plans knowing that if they spend $80m or $90m at least they will have some resource for the future. That is one of the amendments that we want.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Why will the Government not agree to such an amendment? Senator Archer said that to do so would not be contrary to Labor philosophy. I believe it would be very contrary to Labor philosophy because Labor philosophy says very clearly, `We have to leave the loopholes open for the next election so that if we want the Green vote we can grab it and bring it in'.

        That is what this Bill is all about. It is nothing to do with giving industry security or with creating more of the jobs that are so necessary. We have a million unemployed already in this country. There is nothing in this Bill that has anything to do with creating jobs. It is just an assurance of more votes for the Labor Party at the next election; if they need that Green vote they can call on it. That is all it is.

         is that it knows that back home in Tasmania APPM is urging the Government to pass it. APPM—one company—is urging it to pass it. For political reasons—because the Tasmanian senators might get a bit of a bashing over it—this Bill is kept on the

         As we have already said, there is only one group, one industry, one business, in the whole of Tasmania or Australia that is supporting the passage of the Bill, but even it wants it amended. APPM says, `If at the end of the day you cannot get your amendments through, then pass this Bill, no matter how bad it is'. Senator Archer has spoken about all the industries that have contacted us over the past 48 hours saying, `For heaven's sake, don't pass it without the amendments; for heaven's sake, get the Government to amend it so that it is genuine legislation'.

         Let me go through just a few of those companies; Senator Archer went through so many that I will touch on just a few. Kempsey Timbers urges the Commonwealth Parliament to support the industry and union amendment package regarding the timber resources security legislation being debated today. The National Association of Forest Industries and the unions have put forward the amendments I told the Senate about a minute ago, not just for big mills but for sawmills, too, with the no compensation clause cut out and additional resource available if the promised one is excluded. These are the amendments that all these people are asking the Government to support; we do support them. We have Kempsey Timbers, Australian Paper Manufacturers and the Victorian Association of Forest Industries telling us the same thing. We have the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia and Ford Timbers saying likewise. A Ford media release states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Ford Timbers has been operating now for almost 80 years and we have contributed a lot to the local economy. . . We want to see our future, and the future of our employees, protected by legislation which has been properly thought out.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

         Mr Ford said the implementation of the proposed legislation in its current form would offer no long term security to the timber industry generally and had to be amended if industry security was to be guaranteed.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        This is jobs we are talking about. The Government already has a million unemployed people, but it will not support these small timber sawmills.

         Let us understand that the timber industry is the second largest employer of people in Australia. It employs more than 100,000 people; one of my colleagues says it is a quarter of a million. This Government is just ignoring their pleas to retain jobs in their industry. Hardys urges us `to adopt the industry-union amendments to the Federal resource security legislation, which seeks to protect existing jobs and investment and encourage future investment in the sawmilling sector'. The Australian Logging Council says the same thing. It urges the passage of the NAFI and union amendments. CCSO&amp;M, the advertising agency, says that if the amendments developed by both industry and the unions are not included, it is a hopeless piece of legislation. Slater Contracting Company says:
        </tab>
       </para>

        Over the last few years we have let the business run down because of the insecurity of the timber industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        And why? Because of the action last time of the Minister at the table, Senator Richardson, letting down the timber industry and investors all over Australia, just to get the Green votes the Government needed to survive. So this small logging and earthmoving company with only 14 employees is going to the wall because the Government will not give it security to plan its future. Timber Investments Management says:

       <para>
        Again, people are not investing. How many does the Minister want on the jobless queues? Is he not satisfied with a million? Does he want more? What is the reason for not doing it, apart from votes?  New South Wales Forest Industries says the same thing—that the united industry-CALM-AHC agreement will be strongly opposed if the industry amendments are not included in this resource security legislation. We then come to Australian Forest Growers, who say:

        I could spend the whole of my speech quoting from the various groups that are pleading with the Government to allow them to develop, to allow them to have security, to allow them to employ people and to re-employ those they had to sack. This Minister, Senator Richardson, who is responsible for the last effort, ignores the whole lot because he wants to leave that loophole open.

         Come the next election, the Green vote will be able to be grabbed by the Government at the last minute. It does not matter about jobs. It does not matter that at the moment, because of that last election, we now have a million people unemployed. It does not matter that the leader he chose over Mr Hawke admitted that he deliberately caused the recession. He admitted that. He said it in his own words: `This is the recession we had to have'. He engineered it, and we had to get down as far as this before we could recover. He admitted that it was his responsibility that we now have one million unemployed. This is the leader that this Minister chose because he knows that, as he does himself, that Prime Minister will do and say anything at all to grab the votes that are necessary at the next election to keep the Labor Party in power.

Young people have been doing that, but they have not got the jobs, so they tend to sleep in a bit. Dad, who is getting up and is worried about retaining his job, says to the mother, `Why aren't the kids out of bed looking for a job?', and a brawl ensues because of the terrible tragedy of one in three of our Australian youth being unemployed.

That is what we plan to do. We plan to hold it up; not to hold it up deliberately, but to take it to a committee so that all these people's views can be put. We have all the letters. We can put the views of all these people to the Government members—because Government members will also be on that committee—and explain to them exactly what they are doing to the Australian people.

In the past 24 hours NAFI has said that the Federal Opposition and the Tasmanian Government have confirmed their support for the package of amendments presented to the Government last Friday. Just last Friday NAFI—the National Association of Forest Industries—and the unions presented to the Government this list of amendments that they want that will make this resource secure for them.

This legislation is supposed to be about employment and jobs; it is supposed to be about looking after our trade deficit and doing something about the imbalance in our trade in the timber industry at the moment, with about only $1.4 billion worth of exports, yet we are importing something like $2.3 billion worth of timber products; and it is supposed to be about security of investment, but it is not really doing anything about any of those things.

         Yet it is the first opportunity for this Government to show it is fair dinkum about the rhetoric of the One Nation statement. Given the chequered history of forestry in Australia—particularly in New South Wales in recent years—it is obvious that, for investment decisions to be made with any confidence, those wishing to invest be assured of the security of that investment.

         The Labor Government has once again failed to deliver. It has sat on this legislation for a long time with very little result. The Bill gives absolutely no assurances, no guarantees and no direction to the forest industries. There is nothing in this legislation that says, `Go ahead, create jobs and install plant and equipment, because we will not pull the pin on you'. The majority of the industry's employees are involved in small operations, and this legislation fails to recognise that.

         For the small operators there is no security of tenure, no encouragement to create wealth and no encouragement to create jobs for people in the community. They have been forgotten. Yet it is those small operators who have been affected the most by the constant interference in their industry—particularly by this Labor Government as it waxes and wanes in its efforts to woo the green vote. A new Minister at the table now, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, can take a lot of the credit for the problems associated with the timber industry in Australia.

         It seems that what the Government says is not always what it does. Even the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is responsible for this legislation, seems to have fallen well short of his own rhetoric. I will quote from a paper he issued in February 1991 on resource security. It read:

        Rather, resource security is a process to identify and protect the environmental and heritage values of our forests and importantly, to enhance employment through encouraging a thriving, secure forest products industry.

        He said that resource security is all those things. He said the reason we needed legislation was that:

        And he acknowledged that there was uncertainty in the industry. I will quote what his paper said about that. It read:
       </para>

        . . . there currently exists an unprecedented level of uncertainty in the industry to commit to value adding investments so necessary to address the crippling current account deficit attributed to this industry.

        The paper went on further about the benefits that would accrue from a legislative level of resource security. It read:

         It was February 1991 when that paper came out, and that was when the legislation was drawn up. In October last year it was put to the industry, which told the then Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Resources that the legislation would not do what it was supposed to do.

         For example, New South Wales—the State that Senator Richardson represents, that he has done so much to damage with some of his legislation passed in this place—directly employs 8,000 people in the timber industry, and that is a conservative estimate. Using the multiplier of about 2.2, that puts it up to 20,000-odd people affected. Communities that are 100 per cent affected and dependent upon this industry are places such as Grafton, Dorrigo, Wauchope, Casino, Woodenbong, Urbenville, Walcha, Glen Innes, Gloucester, Nimmitabel, Bombala and Eden. There are other places in my home State of New South Wales that are affected if we do not have the right sort of legislation. These are places such as Lismore, in which maybe 30 to 70 per cent of people are dependent on the timber industry. Also there are Coffs Harbour, Narooma, Moruya, Port Macquarie, Cooma, Newcastle and Murwillumbah. I would be failing in my duty to the people of New South Wales, including the people who live in those towns, if I did not stress to this chamber and to the people in the Government why there is a necessity to have a change in this legislation, and urge them to listen to some of the amendments that have been moved.

         To have had, in September 1990, a group of people circling this Parliament in some 383 trucks with an average $250,000 invested in each truck, with each of those owners spending $1,000 per day sitting here waiting for the Government to say they can continue to work is a big worry. Those people are still waiting. They are still waiting for the Government to decide whether they will lose all their investment. They are not big boys; they are not big investors. But an investment in a truck worth $250,000 is a very big investment. Those truck owners all have wives; they all have children; they all have people who actually have to be fed and clothed.

When the former Minister, Senator Richardson, was removed from the environment portfolio he changed very dramatically. We all knew that at that stage the green vote no longer counted to the ALP. This legislation is a mishmash which basically pleases no-one. The green vote says that it is unhappy and the timber industry says that it is unhappy. The amendments moved by the Opposition offer genuine resource security to forest development projects, irrespective of size, and they also give environmental security.

        Let us make it quite clear right from the start that this is payback legislation—nothing more and nothing less. It has been introduced by the Government to pay back for the crimes that have been perpetrated on the forest industry by the former Minister for the environment, Senator Richardson. We do not need reminding, but in the lead-up to the last Federal election the former Minister prostrated the Labor Government at the feet of the radical Green movement in a frantic attempt to gain Green preferences.

All he could see was green in one eye and green in the other.

         I remember a year or so ago, on one of my visits to north Queensland, going to Ravenshoe and having discussions with the families of the timber workers. I am pretty sure that Senator Richardson would remember his trips up there too. I talked to timber workers who had been thrown on the dole by the actions of Senator Richardson. Honourable senators may also remember the protest that occurred in September 1990 when 300 trucks surrounded this building, supported by almost 3,000 protesters who had travelled from all over Australia to express their concern about the manner in which they were being treated by this Labor Government.

         There is no doubt that the former Minister's anti-forestry industry policy has had a number of consequences for Australia. First of all, it has lengthened considerably our dole queues. It has also worsened the dramatic recession we had to have. But perhaps the principal problem has been the total lack of confidence which is now apparent in the forest industry. Over the years, while Senator Richardson was grooming the Green preferences, he left those people who had a mind to invest in forestry in Australia thinking that it would be commercial suicide to do that sort of thing. Investors in those areas were left in no doubt that, no matter how thorough their investigations and no matter how sound their investment, there was always a chance that the Labor Party would put their project aside in a search for the Green preference votes.

         Unfortunately, as we stand here today, the industry has been almost destroyed by this approach. It is certainly suffering from a lack of confidence.

Because its track record is so hopeless, we have this half-baked Bill before us today. Because previous Ministers have not been able to keep their promises, for whatever reason, unfortunately we must introduce legislation so that large wood processing projects which require a supply of natural resource over a period of time and which also require significant financial investment can proceed, knowing that their access to wood supply can be guaranteed. There certainly needs to be a requirement for State and Commonwealth governments to give undertakings that resources are available and the resultant products can be exported.

         Because the legislation is related so closely to what is happening in Tasmania, I believe it is important that we review what has happened in my State over the years in which this Government has been meddling in our forest industry. Just for the record, over the last 15 years, we have had 11 separate inquiries into the forest industry in Tasmania. This has involved all sorts of things, including a huge number of memoranda of understanding which have been tossed aside by the Federal Government when it has been convenient for it to do so. I also remind the Senate of the decision by the Federal Government not to log the Lemonthyme, which saw another valuable resource locked away.

         The most recent example of this Government's meddling in the Tasmanian forestry industry was in March 1989 when Senator Richardson made that great decision to block the Wesley Vale project.

         Forest industries are certainly a very vital part of the future of Australia. Around $4 billion of private investment is purported to be on hold because of this Government. At the same time, our external trade account for wood and wood products is in deficit, with imports exceeding exports by $1.6 billion in 1989-1990. This comprised total imports of $2,126m and exports of only $523m. The main categories of our imports were paper and paper board, which comprised $1,018m, sawn log of up to $463m and pulp and waste paper of $240m. Exports for the corresponding period were only $356m in woodchips and $1.8m in paper and paper board. This shows, without any shadow of doubt, that there certainly is a much needed opportunity for Australia to become further involved in the downstream processing of forest resources.

         Senator Sherry raised the question: what about Tasmania? I just point out to him that, in my State of Tasmania alone, this Bill ignores smaller sawmills and veneer mills which have been proposed for the south of the State, in the Huon region. Those proposals would gain nothing from this legislation. Recently, it was brought to my attention that the country sawmillers in Tasmania are suffering genuine need. That industry has been neglected but it is worth $64m to Tasmania alone. It processes around 170,000 cubic metres of sawn timber each year and employs up to 700 people. Yet it gets no consideration whatsoever from this Bill.

         —Yesterday during Question Time Senator Button embarked upon an outrageous distortion of and hypocritical attack on the Opposition's Fightback package. Senator Short, during Question Time and immediately prefacing his own question, sought leave to take note of the answer and to continue his remarks after Question Time. The President ignored that request. At the end of Question Time Senator Short again rose to seek leave to move a motion to take note of the answer and to make a short statement. There was then some confusion. He was—and I have read the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         Senator Button then rose and, without need to, sought leave and responded. I then sought also to make a short statement with regard to the answer and I was told by the President that in fact the request for leave was only to make a short statement. The
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

I place it on notice, Mr Deputy President, that I hope we will not see repeated the exhibition that went on yesterday when this confusion arose—and the confusion seemed to be the Clerk's confusion as well. When I said, `Well, in that case I seek leave', Senator Button simply said, `No'. The whole thing was totally unsatisfactory and I hope we do not see a repeat of that.

         Briefly, I am forced into the position today to make the statement that I would have made yesterday concerning the misstatements that Senator Button made about the Fightback package. I find it fascinating frequently as we sit here in Question Time to see that Senator Button seems to have no knowledge of the Government's own policies, but he seems to espouse the idea that he has knowledge of ours. I think it is important that we place on the record the correct statistics of the havoc that has been wreaked by this Government and its policies and the fact that the Fightback package offers hope.

         The first statistics I want to put on the record are these: first of all, we now have 218,000 children who live in families where nobody has a job at all. There are almost 250,000 Australians who have been unemployed for a year; that is a staggering 88 per cent increase in a year. There are now 500,000 children who are living in poverty and there are 75,000 children who have no homes at all.

         With that as a background, we look at the competing proposals to bring about recovery in the Australian economy and to see hope restored to the Australian people. The Fightback package promises to abolish seven taxes, which will lower the impost on business by $20 billion. It is a package that promises to give back to taxpayers $13 billion of their own money which is now collected by way of taxation. It is a package which, in fact, funds that restructuring of the tax system by the use of a goods and services tax.

         The whole of the restructuring of the tax system is prompted by two fundamental principles—the principles of logic and equity. There is no equity at all in the present tax system. It has resulted in an all time low ratio of savings and we have been forced to go into international debt. Because we have not had enough savings here to finance what we have needed to do, we have gone overseas and borrowed other people's savings.

          If we take the figures and analyse the impact of the wholesale sales tax, the petrol tax excise and the tariff tax, otherwise known as customs duties, that are imposed on this society, we see that overall they cost Australian families about $45 a week. We can directly say that tariff tax—and that is what all customs duties are—costs an average family about $16 a week and is responsible for collecting about 3.6 per cent of total revenue.

         To look at just how this impacts on families, I give the example of a pair of shoes that is imported into this country. That pair of shoes will be bought by a family at the bottom end of the financial spectrum—one of the 42 per cent who earn $20,000 or less who will get no tax relief under the so-called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          One Nation
         </emphasis>
         —better named the `No Nation'—statement. But these people are penalised by the way the tariff tax system works. A pair of shoes with leather uppers imported at a wholesale free-on-board price of $10 will attract a duty—under the base quota—of 50 per cent; that is, $5. If we then add in freight, insurance and handling costs of $1, a wholesale margin of, say, $3.20, and a retail margin of, say, $8.60, we find that the final consumer price is $27.80. In other words, the duty or the tariff tax that is imposed represents a consumer tax of 18 per cent.

         If that same pair of shoes were imported outside base quota—under tender quota—we would find that the tax would be anything up to 23 per cent. The people who need to be able to have access to low priced goods, who need to be able to buy shoes, clothes, children's shirts and dresses for their youngsters at a reasonable price, are being penalised. This Government talks about equity and justice, yet it has imposed upon the Australian family a harsh and unconscionable tax regime whereby, since it has been in office, it has ripped off the taxpayer by increasing the tax take by 34 per cent. No wonder we got a surplus in early Budgets: we got it simply because we wreaked more tax on the individual taxpayer.

         The wholesale sales tax has been put up three times. From that tax, the Government used to collect around $3 billion; now it collects $9 billion to $10 billion. Never once did the Government actually have the courage to go to the people at election time and say, `Our policy is to increase the wholesale sales tax and to increase the tax take and we would like you to judge us about that.' Oh, no, they were hidden. The Government has had its own GST for a long time. It has been the Government's secret tax.

         When the Government came to power the fuel excise was 9c a litre. What is it now? It is 26c a litre. We are giving it back, so that every time people go to the petrol station to fill up the family car with petrol, they will be about $10 or $11 better off; in other words, that is how much less it will cost them. Of course, the people who are in business will get a deduction of 26c a litre, because it will be an inputs tax and they will be entitled to a refund.

         The great lie that the Government puts around is that somehow the tax restructuring is merely to impose a new tax upon existing costs. Wrong! The restructured system will mean, once all those taxes we are abolishing are gone—and we are keeping the Prices Surveillance Authority to ensure that that occurs—the 15 per cent will be imposed at that much lower cost. Those who do their sums—some people are better at doing sums than the Government is—will see that the net result is 4.4 per cent. We can even read that down to 2.2 per cent, if we want to apply the implicit price deflator. But that is not something people readily understand, and so we take the conservative figure of 4.4 per cent. So that nobody is disadvantaged, the people who are getting refunds through the tax system will benefit by having more money in their pockets.

         Under our system a taxpayer with an income of $30,000 will get $30 back by way of a reduction in tax, but under the Government's `No Nation' statement all he will get is $15. Of course, if he earns $20,000 or less, he gets sweet nothing. Indeed, our incentive package will allow 95 per cent of all taxpayers to earn double the income of $30,000 and pay no greater rate of tax—incentive is built back and so is the will to save. Those people who are outside the tax system—those who depend on pensions—will be compensated by an increase in the pension rate of 8 per cent; and for special benefits, 6 per cent.

         The real point I want to make is about tariffs. We have said that we will reduce tariffs so that they have negligible effects by the year 2000. We have said that we will do it at the same time as we are reducing the costs of doing business—micro-economic reform—and that the reductions will be transparent and known about. I have said that the whole package is driven by logic and equity. Those are the reasons we want to see those people who need to have access to goods which are cheaper get access to those goods and not be penalised by the current tariff regime.

         There is nothing fair about the current tax regime. It has led to an all time low savings ratio. It has led to an unfair burden on sectors of the economy, with the wholesale sales tax being applied only to goods—things that are made—as distinct from services that are applied. We could understand that being the case in the 1930s, because most people were employed making things. Of course, these days they are not. Most people are employed in the delivery of services. So there is no logical or equitable reason why that should continue. Fairness and sense are our guiding principles, and the Fightback package stands up to those two tests on every test. The `No Nation' statement fails on every indicator.

         It was a deliberate political tactic by the British during the last century to publicise the Irish people as a race of people who had no brains, who were dumb, who were silly, and who could not be given control of their own nation. It was done with very distinct political motives and, to a certain degree, it was very successful.

That tradition has continued to this very day. The Irish national contribution has not been restricted to the Australian Labor Party.

         During the 1880s there was a heightened awareness of the distinguishing features of Australia and its people. This nationalism was most frequently felt by radical dreamers. Many of Labor's early leaders were born overseas, mostly in Britain, and they inevitably retain the measure of attachment to the land of their birth; however, nearly all were keenly aware that Britain denied them hope, dignity and opportunity. In their adopted country they could help build a new society without having to overcome centuries of tradition and class rigidities. Further nationalist impetus came from a discernible restlessness with the British government's handling of Australian affairs. Some wanted to sever links with Britain all together: there were a number of Republican groups like McDonald's association in Charters Towers.

         It is not a new debate that we are having in Australia. It is, in my opinion, long overdue. Indeed, I look forward to the year 2001 and the earlier referendum, when I am confident the Australian people will determine that this country will become a republic in its own right. Mr Cobb's article went on:

        Mr Keating's vote of no confidence in the Australian flag is a sad indictment of his inability to transcend petty bigotry. His desire to have the Union Jack removed from our flag is less about the need for Australian independence than his own need to divert attention from the real issues affecting our nation. Our national symbol is distinctive, well loved and has served us well.

       <para>
        He is wrong on that last part as well. Mr Cobb is wrong on a number of the assertions he makes in the article. The design of the flag, which has been altered since then, was the result of a competition that was run prior to 3 September 1901, when the designs of the winning flag were displayed in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne. It was a competition that was run by the Commonwealth, which donated #75 towards the prize; by a newspaper called
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The Review of Reviews
        </emphasis>
        , which also gave #75; and by the Havelock tobacco company, which donated #50. The prize was divided equally between five people, one of whom was from Perth, two from Melbourne, one from Sydney and one from Auckland.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I do not know who judged the competition. The winning design was announced by the then Prime Minister, Mr Barton, but it did not actually become official until February 1903, when it was announced in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Commonwealth Gazette
         </emphasis>
         that King Edward VII had approved the design of a flag for Australia—this is the British King—and also a flag for the Merchant Navy. In 1951 King George VI approved the recommendation by the Australian Government that the Commonwealth Blue Ensign be adopted as the Australian flag. It was not the people of Australia who made the decision at all.

         The flag needs some analysis. Generally, when looking at flags, the distinguished people who can break them down and give advice on them divide a flag into four parts. They call them the canton, the second quarter, the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The canton is described thus:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The place of honour in a flag is the upper half of the hoist. It is also called the First Quarter and sometimes the Upper Hoist.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the Australian flag, the thing that is displayed in the upper hoist or the canton of the flag is the Union Jack—the flag of the United Kingdom. That is not ours, and it is certainly the most dominant part of the Australian flag. On the third quarter, the lower half of the hoist, is depicted the seven-pointed star representative of the six States of Australia and the Territories. It is significant that the Union Jack is uppermost, and that the thing that depicts the country of Australia is actually resting below it. The other thing that is featured on the flag is the Southern Cross constellation, and that is actually broken up between the other two quarters of the flag.

         I welcome, and have welcomed for quite some years, the debate on whether or not Australia should become a republic. I am firmly of the view that we ought to become a republic and that we ought to do it sooner rather than later. I welcome the healthy debate that is happening in our community at the moment and look forward to the debate leading to a referendum long before the year 2001.

         McKiernan before I go to the substance of the remarks I wish to make today. I was interested to note that he singled out Mr Cobb for his attack on the Irish. I have not read Mr Cobb's article. Senator McKiernan is entitled to criticise, but he must ask himself whether he is not applying dual standards in this matter. I recall that it was Mr Keating who opened up the debate, with guns blazing on the English. I suspect that, if Mr Keating wishes to play it that way, the community will respond in like manner. That is one aspect of the debate that I think is rather unfortunate and it got it off to a rather poor start. I was waiting to see whether the honourable senator was going to apply a single standard or whether he was going to apply dual standards in relation to the behaviour of Mr Keating and the attack on Mr Cobb.

         One aspect that worries me a little is that we are bringing in a lot of the prejudices of the old world. I was interested to see whether Senator McKiernan could adduce any reason why we should change what is arguably one of the world's great constitutions. I listened carefully and all I heard was a fairly vigorous attack on the British, the English, and a bit of history. It was certainly interesting. I listened carefully to see whether he could adduce any reason, apart from any natural old world feelings he might have towards the British, why we should change what is by any standards a remarkably successful Constitution.

         I was reminded some months ago by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, that Australia is arguably the world's oldest continuing democracy. We have worked with our Constitution for 100 years. When one views the countries around the world that are trying to establish what we established almost a century ago, one wonders whether our founding fathers did not get it pretty right. Like Mr Keating, I happen to take a great pride in the history of our country and its achievements. I suspect that one of our achievements is our Constitution and its role in maintaining the unity of our nation. When people, in a fairly flippant manner and for totally fallacious reasons, attack this achievement, of course people are going to respond. I note that Senator McKiernan welcomes the debate. The debate will certainly continue.

         I wish to speak today about a matter that has some meaning to me. It concerns the death on Tuesday of F.A. von Hayek, who died at the age of 92. Hayek was an eminent economist, political philosopher and scientist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics in 1974. Hayek was certainly one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. He ranks with John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith as great liberal thinkers who have had a profound effect upon the development of the liberal democracies of the Western world.

         One of the great intellectual battles of the twentieth century has been between liberalism and socialism, between freedom and totalitarianism. As Marx was the inspiration for the socialists, Hayek was the great liberal thinker who helped stop and ultimately turn back the onrush of socialism. In a sense, as Marx was the founder of the old socialist states of eastern Europe, Hayek is in many ways the founding father of the new democracies in Eastern Europe. When Hayek wrote
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Road to Serfdom
         </emphasis>
         in 1944, socialism dominated the academic world. There was the view that capitalism had had its day. When one opens the covers of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Road to Serfdom
         </emphasis>
         , it is interesting to read that it is dedicated to the socialists of all parties.

         In the two years I have been in this Parliament, I have heard no-one defend socialism. The dedication that Hayek made has clearly been heard. I have to say that, to the extent that the Labor Party has managed to rid itself of the dead-end of socialism, its members should be profoundly grateful to Hayek. The more they have absorbed the philosophy of Hayek, the more likely the Labor Party is to have a future. It is now almost 50 years since
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Road to Serfdom

         One of Hayek's other great books,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Constitution of Liberty,
         </emphasis>
         published in 1960, is still quite widely read. Many of his statements seem particularly relevant to some of the problems we are facing in Australia. For example, on trade unions, he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Public policy concerning labour unions has, in little more than a century, moved from one extreme to another. From a state in which little the unions could do was legal if they were not prohibited altogether, we have now reached a state where they have become uniquely privileged institutions to which general laws do not apply. They have become the only important instance in which governments singly fail in their prime function—the prevention of coercion and violence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It cannot be stressed enough that the coercion that unions have been permitted to exercise contrary to all principles of freedom under the law has primarily been the coercion of fellow workers. Whatever true coercive power the unions may be able to wield over employers is a consequence of this primary power of coercing other workers; the coercion of employers would lose most of its objectionable character if unions were deprived of this power to exact unwilling support.
       </para>

        That is an extract from
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The Constitution of Liberty
        </emphasis>
        by Hayek. He made this quite prescient observation:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . .labour unions cannot in the long run substantially alter the real level of wages that all workers can earn and are, in fact, more likely to lower than to raise them. . .

       <para>
        It is interesting that one of the proudest boasts of the Labor Government under this accord is that it has been able to hold, and in a number of years cut, the level of real wages. Hayek was remarkable not only for the profound defence of the free society but also for his willingness to help organise to promote his views. In 1947 he formed the Mont Pelerin Society and he helped found an influential think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, in London. I can well recall when I was at the university—and perhaps Senator Ray can recall it, too—how avidly the IEA pamphlets were read.

         Hayek visited Australia in 1976. His visit was sponsored by the Institute of Public Affairs. Hayek and his wife stayed for a number of days at my father's home in Mount Macedon. He was at that time 77, still physically fit and intellectually vigorous. As an indication of Hayek's breadth of learning, my father recalls that he took a copy of Tolstoy's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          War and Peace
         </emphasis>
         from the bookshelves and commented, holding the book in his hand, that this was the best translation of Tolstoy's great work that he had read. He said that he had read
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          War and Peace
         </emphasis>
         in a number of translations and was about to read it again. As my father commented, most of us would have been pleased that we had read

          The Road to Serfdom

         , he encountered Winston Churchill at a function. Churchill told him that he had just read his book,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Road to Serfdom
         </emphasis>
         , and Churchill said to Hayek, `You need not worry, the British people will never travel down that road'. Churchill was wrong. The fact of the matter is that the British people did start to travel down that road. In Australia Chifley was determined to lead Australia down the socialist road which, Hayek warned us, would lead us to socialism and serfdom. Fortunately, there were individuals and governments prepared to resist this trend. Hayek's warnings were heeded.

         Another organisation closely associated with von Hayek was the Centre for Independent Studies in Sydney. Hayek was a member of the centre's advisory board from 1977. Greg Lindsay, a friend of mine who is Director of the Centre for Independent Studies and who happens to be a prominent member of the Mont Pelerin Society, was able to organise for that society the Sydney conference in 1985 and the Christchurch conference in 1989. Greg Lindsay acknowledges the great impact that Hayek's thinking had on him personally and on the work of the Centre for Independent Studies.

He said, `If Hewson is serious about 15 per cent tax, why does he not legislate?'. Let me inform Mr Tighe, and members on the other side of this chamber, that we are legislating for the 15 per cent. This says that we cannot trust the Electrical Trades Union to give a fair representation of the facts, in terms of the current economic packages before us, any more than we can trust the current Government.

         Once again, like the Electrical Trades Union, the Government has chosen not to make any allowance for the changes in wholesale sales tax, the payroll tax, the training levy or any of the other secret Government taxes I have already mentioned. The shopping basket that has been chosen has no direct wholesale sales tax on it. The union has tried to be too smart for its own good. It has not taken into account—and I am sure that members of the Government are intelligent enough to know it—the fact that under our package the indirect impact of the wholesale sales tax on the manufacture of these goods—butter, sugar, potatoes, bread, et cetera—flows through in the price. In addition, the wrappings that go around these items, whether it be the butter, the sugar, the potatoes, the coffee, the bread—one could go on—all have wholesale sales tax applied to them at different rates. So there is another total misrepresentation of the facts with regard to this matter.

         I want to make particular reference to Mr McLachlan because of my personal interest in farming and the close association I have with the mining industry. I point out very clearly that under our proposals, which are not included in the Government's One Nation program, we will be removing close to $2 billion of the input taxes from the farming and mining industries—the very people the Seamen's Union is talking about, the very industries that provide most of the wages that keep members of the Seamen's Union in their jobs. This five-dollar note is a total misrepresentation. In fact, it is quite bizarre.

By removing the input taxes such as the fuel excise, the payroll tax and the wholesale sales tax, our manufacturers will become more internationally competitive, whether they are manufacturing through value adding or whether they are manufacturing through mining or producing wheat, wool, cauliflowers or whatever the agricultural product might be.

Our exports particularly are what provide them with the opportunity for work. What they have done in this article is to send a false signal to investors into this country, saying that a coalition government would devalue the dollar and lower the value of any investment they might make in this country. That really is quite bizarre. It is quite unnecessary. It is the wrong signal to be sending out of this country. It is a totally irresponsible act. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation, Senator Collins, from the Northern Territory, who is at the table, has a very close interest in the capacity of the Northern Territory to export goods to get development investment into the Northern Territory and in a number of other matters. I hope he will dissociate himself from anybody who tried to present, incorrectly, to the Australian public or to the businesses of this country that there was an endeavour to erode the value of our currency and of our base.

I would say to honourable senators on the other side that there is no doubt in my mind that the Electrical Trades Union and the Seaman's Union are the stooges of the Labor Party. I have no doubt that they, or a number of them, and Mr Beazley in Swan knew that this misinformation was going to be put around. They have a responsibility, as elected members of the Australian Parliament, at least to bring a little bit of honesty to the current debate in terms of the economic direction of this country.

One need look only to the track record of this Labor Government in terms of honesty. We all remember the promises that no child would live in poverty by the year 1990, that there would be no recession, that we would have a soft landing, and the promise made by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, about a year ago: ` Don't worry. The recession will be over. It will not be too bad. It is only a bit of a downturn; she'll be right'.

I was horrified to read an analysis of the GST's impact on the north prepared by that well-known economic analyst, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Graeme Campbell, and a State candidate for the Australian Labor Party—although he is trying to hide the fact that he is a candidate for the Labor Party—a Mr Fred Riebeling.

All of those taxes come off. The people of Karratha do not even know that those things are taxed because this wholesale sales tax is a hidden tax. If this Government were dinkum, it would actually put the tax on the price tag to show the rip-off it is using. Of course, the Federal member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell—my namesake, unfortunately—and the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Ashburton, Mr Riebeling, may not know what price effect the tax has on soap and shampoo and these other toiletries. Indeed, they may not even use these items, so they may not care. But the tax is the important thing.

         The other very important thing for the people of Karratha to understand—and it is something I am sure that Mr Graeme Campbell would understand—is the impact of the coalition's taxation policies on the cost of transport to remote regions. It is something that does need close analysis. Indeed, the best people to go to for analysis of the costs are the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) or the Prime Minister. I asked Senator Button a question many months ago—in fact, on 19 December—and he gave me the response on Monday, which is about Senator Button's average track record at the moment. The question related to the impact of the wholesale sales tax on the transport sector. My own specific interest, and the interest of my Western Australian Senate colleagues, is in the impact of the tax on transport to remote areas, and I am sure that is a matter Senator Collins would have concern with.

         I raised the question with Senator Button because I had had faxed to my office—incorrectly, I think—a paper prepared by a Caucus committee on transport policy which sought from the then Treasurer, Mr Kerin, some guidance on whether or not the Government would seek to change its policy on the impact of wholesale sales tax on the transport sector. That report, which quoted some figures from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, showed some indicative figures of the impact of wholesale sales tax on transport. It showed that wholesale sales tax adds approximately 2 per cent to the cost of operating a two-axle rigid truck. It also showed that there is about a 3.8 per cent impact on large articulated trucks and 4.5 per cent for a triple roadtrain. That cost—the impact of the wholesale sales tax on transport—cascades through the system of producing goods and delivering those goods to the end consumers; and, of course, the impact is increased as we move further and further away from the place of production.

         In towns such as Karratha or Kununurra in north-western Australia, that wholesale sales tax has an enormous impact on the price of the goods when they reach the supermarket shelf, where the poor electors of Ashburton and the people who live in Karratha and north-western Australia generally—poor because of the impact of Labor Party policies over eight years—have actually to pay for the goods. More specifically, rather than talking in terms of percentages in relation to the impact of the tax on the price of food in the north-west, I spoke to one of the transport operators in Perth yesterday to ask what were the transport costs on food which travelled the route to Karratha. According to this transport operator, 22c per kilo of food is the transport component of getting that food up to Karratha.

         I make these points because it is very hard to analyse the specific impacts of tax proposals in far north Australia. But bear in mind that the wholesale sales tax system, on the admission of the Prime Minister, on the admission of Senator Button, and on the admission of the Caucus committee that is responsible for this, cascades through the system and hurts people who live further away from the place of production. Under this Government, we have a tax system, an indirect tax system, a hidden tax system, which severely hurts the people living in remote areas. With the goods and services tax, reducing income tax rates and placing the taxation emphasis on indirect tax has enormous benefits for the north of Australia. They are benefits that the Minister at the table will not admit because it is politically not sensible to do so.

         As I said at the beginning of this speech in supporting Senator Crane's calls for an honest and rational debate on the effects of the various taxation policies, it is indeed naive and stupid to suggest that this Labor Party and this Labor Government will allow any rational debate to take place. We must ensure that we fight fire with fire. If Ministers and Labor Party candidates in by-elections are going to go around to supermarkets and say, `This thing is going to go up by 15 per cent', then we as the proponents of the goods and services tax—the tax reform package—must go around to the supermarkets and say about cans of deodorant, toothbrushes and toothpaste, `These things will go down'.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) has long expounded the view that the special planning, development, construction and administrative standards for Canberra cannot be separated in either functional or geographical terms. On this basis, the NCDC argued that it would be impossible to hand over complete control of these activities to a territorial government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of the `duality of national and community interests', the Select Committee further stressed that, in the area of overall planning `there should also be involvement by elected community representation'. It said that it was therefore essential that there be adequate institutional arrangements for liaison and cooperation to closely coordinate and integrate the national community functions of the ACT.

         As has been noted in another place, the purpose of the amendment is to introduce a ministerial power of direction in relation to the draft Territory plan, where the Territory Planning Authority continues to object to any aspect of the draft plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority, and to allow regulations to be made enabling the NCPA to charge fees for planning and related approvals. This power is to be limited to the recovery costs reasonably associated with planning approvals and not to be set at such levels as to amount to a taxation.

An amendment proposed by the Opposition in another place was successful and provided for the Minister, rather than just making a determination where there was an impasse, to consult with the ACT Assembly.

         The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendments moved by the Government and the Opposition, which have been incorporated into the reprinted Bill before us today. An important factor that I think this Parliament needs to remember is that the ACT, having now been given self-government, must have some ongoing control of its planning activities. The Federal Minister cannot and must not act in splendid isolation from the ACT parliament. Therefore, it is vital that ministerial discretion be checked and balanced by the duly elected representatives of the Australian Capital Territory.

Other amendments are to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Norfolk Island Act 1979 and the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986.

         Very briefly, the Opposition has no objections to these amendments and will not be opposing them. However, there are some points which do concern us and which I should make. In the first place, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 is not an Act that has been around for a great deal of time and yet one notices, once again, drafting errors. Subsections 65A(1), (2) and (3) have to be inserted to provide the Agency with the standard taxation exemptions under Commonwealth, State and Territory law that were simply not given in the original legislation.

         There is also a matter I should raise in passing: new paragraph 70(1)(c) empowers the Agency to delegate the Agency's powers to `any employee of the Agency', as is now able to be delegated to the chairperson or the chief executive. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has some views on that kind of delegation, and I just mention that in passing.

         On the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act, new section 21B allows the Committee to approve a recommendation or report without the need to convene a meeting, and the new section requires all the members of the Committee, except those with a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, to sign the documents supporting the recommendation or report, with the recommendation or report to take effect on the date of the last signature. There is one problem about this: although the clear intention is that this should relate to those meetings of the Committee which take place on telephone link-ups, it does not specifically say so. In other words, there could be a situation, if this legislation is read as the words say, where people could agree in writing to a proposal, never having heard the case against it. That is simply intolerable and is not what is intended, as I understand, in the legislation.

There are various other matters I would like to raise; I have not got time. The Opposition generally supports this legislation.

Indeed, the results of that were seen at the time to the extent that they apparently frightened the Liberal Government from doing anything about tariffs over eight years. In so far as Government policy is concerned, the policy of the Government is articulated in terms of tariffs for TCF to the year 2000, for the passenger motor vehicle industry to the year 2000 and for other industry until 1996, reaching a level of 5 per cent for most industries at that time. There is no intention on the part of the Government to proceed beyond that point unless there is a dramatic change in circumstances in the international tariff regime.

         I recently described inflation at a metal trades industry forum as the worst enemy of Australian exporters. Inflation cannot be allowed to exceed that of our trading partners or we lose competitiveness. That is why the Government had an agreement with the ACTU to target wages to match the inflation rate of our major trading partners—a most important and historic agreement in terms of this country being able to face up to the challenges of the 1990s.

         Sadly, the Opposition would never be in a position to negotiate such an agreement. It has no wages policy, and would be forced to use higher interest rates to control inflation, as the shadow Treasurer, Mr Reith, recently admitted. The coalition policy of an independent Reserve Bank with a charter to target inflation at nought to 2 per cent is on the lunatic fringe of flat earth economics. That is the message which can be distilled from the speech made by the Deputy Governor. His words were:

         As I have already said in answer to an earlier question, the policy of those opposite throughout the last 18 months has been to condemn every cut in interest rates; that is what their Leader has done. Senator Tierney then gets up and asks, `Why is the real interest rate higher in Australia than in other countries?'. If those opposite had been in office, presumably nominal interest rates would have been higher. That is what his Leader has consistently said during the last 18 months. I suppose real interest rates would have been lower because their inflation rate would have been higher as well.

         In his question, Senator Harradine referred to the compositional change factors that affect this outcome. It is true that the effect of a recession in the labour force creates two clear changes. The first one is usually a tendency for workers who are full time employed on ordinary standard hours to be made part time as a prelude often, unfortunately—but not always—to redundancy. That, of course, reduces the amount of earnings that they receive. But they are, nonetheless, counted as an unit in the work force.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other compositional factor is that if there are retrenchments or redundancies in a workplace, the tendency universally seems to be to retrench those on the lowest pay first, meaning that the average income per employed person increases. They are compositional changes which affect the outcome of these figures.

         The increase in the average award index for November was 2.9 per cent. So we cannot say that there is a direct correlation between average weekly earnings and average award increases. Average weekly earnings include all earnings, such as overtime, penalty rates and things of that nature. Average weekly award earnings reflect the base rate earnings at the award level. Traditionally, in the run-in to Christmas—and this is again represented in these figures this year—there is an increase as overtime picks up in terms of average weekly earnings over average award earnings.

         —Senator Boswell might be able to guess; I referred to some very big players in the industry. They see rationalisation of the sugar industry as—pardon the Latin expression, I cannot think of another at the moment—a sine qua non for the growth and development of the sugar industry into a much more efficient industry than it is now. As Senator Boswell knows, the sugar industry is characterised in certain areas by farms with below optimum scale and a number of changes need to be made. Senator MacGibbon, who knows a bit about it, is nodding his head—he understands all this. It is important that we adopt a flexible, sensible and not mindless approach to the future of the sugar industry.

With the exception of the radio transmitter building, the rebuilding program at Casey was completed this year as part of a major program to upgrade Australia's Antarctic stations. The new facilities include the science building with its greatly improved laboratory facilities for biological studies, upper atmosphere physics, glaciology and geoscience.

         Since 1989, the Government has worked very hard to obtain the agreement of other Antarctic Treaty nations to establish a comprehensive environment protection regime for Antarctica. This culminated in October 1991 when Treaty parties adopted the Protocol and Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Annexe 3 to the protocol prescribes environmentally acceptable disposal and waste management practices for all Treaty parties.

It states that the costings in relation to that proposal include a reduction in Commonwealth payments to the States to leave the States in a budget neutral position. That is the relevance of my point. The extra revenue from bare day charges is offset by the cut in the grant, leaving public hospitals no better off. The Australian Private Hospitals Association's alternative proposal—the people the honourable senator has quoted—does nothing to actually increase the services that will be provided in the public hospital sector. There will be the combined effect of a reduction in revenue to the States, so they cannot help public hospitals the way they do now, and patients who need treatment will be required to pay very high insurance premiums. That is what the coalition will achieve.

         The 1991 figures are higher because of one particular distortion. That one distortion is called Premier Nick Greiner. The distortion arises because of the continuing confrontation of the Greiner Government which has pushed the number of industrial disputes in New South Wales well above the national average and well above that of the other most populous State, Victoria.

         In October there was a one-day union stoppage in New South Wales in protest against the repressive industrial legislation that the Greiner Government was trying to enact. The continuing confrontation of the Greiner Liberal Government created that type of social division and industrial upheaval in New South Wales. That is the solitary reason why the 1991 figures are higher. Therefore, it is not a reason that I, as the responsible Minister in a Labor government, regard as reflecting on the accord at all. In fact, it reflects on anti-accord behaviour and not on pro-accord behaviour.

         The new packaging that has been developed by CSIRO controls the atmosphere surrounding farm produce and considerably delays its ripening and eventual decay. A recent trial shipment conducted by ANL to Japan proved that the packaging was highly successful in keeping a consignment of freshly cut flowers in excellent condition after five weeks at sea. This advance in packaging technology has the potential significantly to increase exports of perishable produce to Asian and European markets from Australia by sea and to overcome the cost and space limitations that are associated with these perishable cargoes carried by air freight.

        Given that APPM spoke to the staff of the Minister informing them that APPM's employees, after the changes and conditions are made, will still receive benefits and salaries which are 25 per cent over the award payment, a shorter working week of 35 hours and an over-award superannuation contribution, I ask whether the Minister concedes that his statement on Tuesday was incorrect. Will the Minister also apologise to the Senate and to the company?

         Senator Patterson would be aware that a publicity and marketing strategy was always going to be a part of the disability reform proposal. It was recognised that it would be necessary to start planning the dissemination of information about the reforms well in advance of the implementation date—and the Senate will recall that the implementation date was very close to the time it got through the Parliament. That is why funding for this initiative was identified as far back as the 1990-91 Budget.

         The disability legislation to which Senator Patterson refers gave effect to changes to the income security system only. Since this was the case, it was appropriate to advance funds to the winning tenderer so that work could commence on the marketing strategy to ensure that the disability community would have adequate information on the general nature of the reforms before they were implemented. I am advised by the Department of Social Security that all due processes were followed in the letting of this tender. As far as the question of any conflict of personal interest is concerned, this matter is being looked at by the Minister for the Environment who is responsible for the workings of the ministerial council, and I shall report back as soon as I have an answer from her.

A moment ago he was deeply offended by the suggestion that he had acted improperly, but last year he defamed Robe River. Evidence to that effect was put before the Senate by Senator Crane. The Minister has said for months that he will investigate that matter and come back with a full report. He knows that he has now defamed APPM, but he is not prepared to come in here and admit it and apologise to the company and to the Senate.

Some time last year I brought up a matter concerning the Moora pulp and paper mill. One of the unions was trying to stop it from getting off the ground because it thought it might be in danger of losing some jobs in the city. I asked Senator Cook what he was doing about the matter. He said he would go away and find out. I asked him about it when I ran into him in the dining room one night. He said, `I will find out and get back to you'. He came in here with a brief and gave a union-type reply to my concern. At the end of his speech he said, `Perhaps you should have told the Senate'—these are his words—`how many shares you had in that company'.

There is still a shadow over me, in that it was said that I asked the question because of my supposed pecuniary interest in that company. One day I would like the Minister to answer. If the Minister has found that I own shares he should tell everyone; he should tell the world, tell the Senate. But if he finds that I, my company, my children or anyone connected with me has no shares I would like him to tell the Senate also, just as he accused me the first time.

         I am advised by inquiries initiated by my ministerial office to APPM that it refuses to enter into talks or negotiations with any of the unions covering the workers protected by the agreements from which they have now withdrawn. My action as the responsible Minister—in the face of those terms being withdrawn unilaterally on 30 days notice, the agitation created by that in the work force and the apparent likelihood of an industrial dispute—was to refer both parties to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission so that they would be in a forum in which disputes could be settled. That is a responsible action of government. I make no apology to anyone for that.

That at least means, in a powder-keg industrial situation, that both parties should be talking to one another about resolutions to the dispute.

For the Opposition now to try to find some nitpicking diversion in the words which, in terms of the brief and what I have uttered in this place, are so closely related as to see no crack of daylight between them, is in the first place a travesty and in the second place a reflection on the Opposition's political intent. Senator Bishop requires me to apologise.

The man has clearly no shame at all. The man has no concept of what it is to be truthful. At the very best, he is careless with the truth. In other words, as he read out letters that he obtained from a colleague, he simply proved that he misled the Senate on the previous occasion.

She suggested that this was due to confusion on the part of the Chair and that Senator Short had sought leave to move a motion and should have been allowed to speak to the motion. In fact, there was no confusion on my part. As I stated yesterday, Senator Short—having been granted leave after he requested leave to make a brief statement—in fact did not move any motion. The

       I did a similar thing today. I formally used the words, `I move that' and, indeed, Mr President, at first you attempted to say that I was seeking leave to make a statement. I made it clear to you that I was in fact not doing so, but was moving a motion. When Senator Short rose to ask if he might take leave to note Senator Button's answer, I asked you how it was possible to take note of an answer without moving a motion to so do? Although the honourable senator may not have used the words `I move', that was implicit in the statement he made. I would ask you, Mr President, to give me some guidance as to how one can take note of a question without moving to so do.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney on 26 March 1992 relating to interest rates.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Tierney's question was very straightforward. The question was: `Why does Australia have relatively high real interest rates compared with all other industrial countries?'. That is a very important question. A major factor behind this recession—the recession we had to have—was the very high level of real interest rates which absolutely devastated Australian industry. When one reads studies of the 1980s it is interesting to see that the interest rate levels in Australia were far higher than in other industrial countries.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The problem, which goes to the nub of the recession at the moment, is that interest rates in Australia are still very high relative to other countries. The Parliamentary Library pulled out some figures for me today which show, for example, in relation to corporate bond yields—and these are the latest figures—that interest rates in Australia are far higher than the 12 to 14 other industrial countries listed in the table. It is a very important question because it is one of the major reasons that it is so difficult to get industry to invest again.

      <para first-indent="16">

        What did we get from Senator Button? We got a very trivial, silly answer to this very important question. In broad terms, Senator Button said that real interest rates are derived by adjusting nominal interest rates for inflation. We all know that. But the question he was asked was, `Why are interest rates so high?' That question was put again by way of a supplementary, and Senator Button answered by launching into an attack on the Fraser Government. But the question remains unanswered. Why is it that in Australia we have corporate bond rates at the level of over 9 per cent, whereas in countries like Japan the rates are around 3.6 per cent, Switzerland 2.1 per cent, and Germany 3.6 per cent? Why is it that the level of real interest rates in Australia is so high? Senator Button did not give us the answer to that question today.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The cheek of the matter is that Senator Button has come in here on a number of occasions and alleged that under the coalition's Fightback package interest rates will rise. We know that the Labor Government's record is one of high interest rates over a very long period. The Australian people are entitled to know why that is the case. We know that Senator Button, his colleague Senator Tate and others are in possession of advice from Treasury which says that under the coalition Fightback package, interest rates will fall. Scare tactics were again used in Question Time today.

        I will put forward a couple of reasons why interest rates in Australia are at record high levels. First, there is the record foreign debt. The reality is that foreign borrowers are simply not convinced that this Labor Government has any strategy at all to deal with the massive and continually mounting foreign debt in this country. Secondly, I believe that real interest rates are so high in this country because of what economists refer to as `inflationary expectations'. In other words, people are assuming that inflation will get off the ground again, that it will start to rise, and therefore adjustments are being made to the level of interest rates at which lenders are prepared to offer funds.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Perhaps a third reason for the record high interest rates is the uncertainty about the Government's fiscal stance.

        There are concerns around that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will do anything to try to ratchet up the opinion polls and that he will expand spending. Of course, we are already seeing the Budget deficit blowing out. So the point I wish to make is that the question from Senator Tierney was very serious and very important. It was a question which Senator Button, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, should have been effectively addressing. What he gave us was a silly and trivial answer.

Public hospitals are being asked to provide more services with fewer resources, and the demand for the public hospital services is increasing dramatically.

        The private hospital system, now of the highest quality, is able to access only about one-third of the population. The situation is becoming worse day by day as Australians are forced to give up private health insurance or not take it up as the cost of private cover spirals in a time of economic recession. Only 41.9 per cent of Australians now carry private hospital insurance—down from 44.4 per cent only 12 months ago. This effectively means that another half a million Australians have been forced to rely on the public hospital system in the last 12 months, adding another $128m to the States' hospital bills.

        There are three fundamental concerns which are shared by the Australian Hospital Association and the Australian Private Hospitals Association. They are that public hospitals are under excessive pressure, private health funds are in a perilous financial position, and the rising cost burden of private health insurance falls unfairly on pensioners and people on lower incomes. They both believe that the Federal Government must radically alter the hospital financing system to ensure that pensioners and low income earners remain fully covered by Medicare whilst other Australians meet the full cost of hospital care through private insurance.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recommendation 1

        That the guidelines for both statutory and non-statutory authority annual reports be amended so as to require a section showing the pages of the report that conform with each requirement of the relevant guidelines.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the Committee noted in its report, the revised Guidelines for the Preparation of Departmental Annual Reports contain a requirement that departmental annual reports are to demonstrate their compliance with the guidelines. At paragraph 1.12 the Guidelines also invite statutory authorities to comply where appropriate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government notes the recommendation and will take it into account in revising the reporting guidelines for statutory authorities. To the extent that non-statutory bodies (NSBs) produce reports of their own, rather than forming part of the parent body report, consideration will be given to incorporating a similar requirement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recommendation 2
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That the practice of printing the letter of transmittal

        (containing an inaccurate date) within the annual report, be discontinued.
       </para>

        Recommendation 3

       <para font-size="-=2">
        That, on the occasion of tabling the annual report, the Minister provide a copy of the letter of transmittal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government agrees that agencies and Ministers should be able to demonstrate their compliance with the statutory requirement that reports be furnished to Ministers by a certain date and tabled within a certain period after the date on which reports are received by Ministers. Agencies, in furnishing reports to Ministers, may, if they wish, do so under cover of separate (dated) letters. As the Committee report noted, the current departmental annual report guidelines include a requirement at paragraph 3.4 that Ministers indicate the dates on which their annual report was furnished to and received by them.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the current guidelines for annual reporting by statutory authorities are revised, consideration will be given to incorporating a similar requirement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not feasible, however, to discontinue the practice of printing the letter of transmittal within the annual report. Whether or not reports are furnished to Ministers with separate covering letters, there remains a need for each report to incorporate a statement by the agency head certifying its compliance with (eg) section 25 of the Public Service Act. That statement should be signed and dated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An agency cannot accurately predict how long the interval will be between the date when the text of its report (including any letter of transmittal incorporated in it) is finalised and the date when printed copies are available to be furnished to the Minister. Nor can it be assumed that the date of furnishing will be the same as the date on which the Minister receives a report.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recommendation 4
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That non-statutory authorities comply with the guidelines for such bodies and only conform with the requirements for statutory authorities as an extra; their reasons for doing so should be made clear in each report.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government notes the recommendation, acknowledging that the current guidelines for departmental annual reports include specific requirements in relation to non-statutory bodies. These were set out in the Government response to recommendations of the then Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in its report, Non-Statutory Bodies. The response was incorporated in the Senate Hansard for 8 December 1987, pp2645-7.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The effect of that response is that information of certain kinds, which is set out in the guidelines, is to be made available either in annual reports of NSBs, if they produce annual reports of their own, or in those of their parent bodies. It is for the Minister to decide whether an NSB should produce separate annual reports of its own containing
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        required information, or whether that information should be contained in the parent body's annual reports. These requirements can be readily incorporated into the revised annual report guidelines for statutory authorities, imposing core obligations on NSBs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As there is no impediment to NSBs exercising a discretion to expand on the core requirements, the Government considers that any such additional information would be self-explanatory and would not require justification.

         The document that we are now discussing relates to three reports—the reports of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation from 1 October 1990 to 30 June 1991, the Sugar Research Council from 1 July 1990 to 30 September 1990 and the Sugar Research and Development Corporation Selection Committee. Much of the detail in this document concerns some very scientific aspects of the industry, especially the section dealing with the Sugar Research Council. In spite of that, it is interesting to read all three reports as they relate to an industry which is of vital and essential interest to my State of Queensland.

          From Mossman in the north, the sugar industry is one of the vital industries to Queensland towns along the long coastal stretch. Like most other rural industries, this industry has been under severe pressure not only from the elements—all rural workers know that this is of vital concern—but also from the vagaries of the international market. What makes things worse for people in the sugar industry now is that, compounded with these problems, over which they have no control, we see the constant bombardment from Federal Labor government policies, which are slowly choking to death one of Australia's major industries.

          Currently we have a situation where the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Research Economics—ABARE—has estimated that the value of the 1990-91 Australian crop was $752m. That represents a decline of 13 per cent from the previous season. This decline was caused by a 9 per cent decrease in crop production and a decline in the average value of the crop.

          What is of most interest to those studying the industry is that this decline is despite an increase in assigned land area of 13 per cent over the past two seasons. Part of the decrease in production has been attributed to the dry and unfavourable seasonal conditions for cane growth in most regions. In 1990-91 there was a production of 25.2 million tonnes of cane from which 3.5 million tonnes of sugar was produced. Furthermore, a strong increase in world sugar production in 1990-91 and the build-up in stocks has led ABARE to conclude that world sugar prices will remain depressed in 1991-92.

          On the international scene, we have seen world sugar production rise by five million tonnes to 114.2 million tonnes in 1990-91. This is the second year in succession in which world production growth has exceeded 4 per cent. This increase was far in excess of the increase in consumption, which grew at less than 2 per cent, causing stocks to increase and prices to fall.

         Distortion is an understatement. What it is doing, together with the blind faith this Government places on the fictitious level playing field, is not only distorting world markets, but also destroying Australian industries. Last month the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) spoke in the other place about the plight of the rural sector. He said:

          There is no doubt, though, that some farmers have lost their equity. Many farmers are trying to hang on. It is tough. We have to make sure that we get the broader economic position right and try to minimise the effect of a world recession. It has often been said by those on the other side that we have been blamed for the world recession. If Australia, with its 18 million people, created the world recession in the United States and Europe, it has much more power and influence in Zurich and Europe than I know of. The fact is that we are in a world recession. Commodity prices are bad because of corrupted trade markets. The world does not owe us a living. The world is a tough place. Aussies are good fighters and I think that agriculture in Australia is going to take on a bigger and better role.

         It is pertinent that he said that the world does not owe us a living. That is correct, but it also follows that we—and I stress `we'—do not owe the world a living. And that I regret is what we are currently doing. While agricultural producers throughout the world are being subsidised by their governments, being able to dump their goods at cheaper prices on our domestic markets, we are in fact supporting the world's farmers.

         The year in question saw the passing of the individual grains research funding body set up in 1986 and the birth of a new corporation to cover the activities of 14 councils and committees. It is interesting to note what the report has to say about the allocation of funds through the year. In reading the report, two items came to my attention. First, a subcommittee of the Wheat Research Council was appointed to monitor farm risk management projects being progressed in South Australia and Western Australia. This is vital in the present circumstances of the grain industries.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The second item that came to my attention was the Grains 2000 Conference put on by the Grains Council of Australia. Funding for this project was provided and a Council representative was appointed to the steering committee overseeing it. I would like to make one point about that. The conference was given very good and well researched material and it achieved a lot for grain growers. However, it was very expensive to attend. It was limited to those who had the money or who were given entree to it by being sponsored by the councils.

          If we are to have functions such as Grains 2000, ordinary farmers should be able to afford to attend. It is a little like the Outlook Conference that ABARE put on at the beginning of the year. Unless the people in the community who produce the products can attend these functions, the message will not get through to them. They have to be affordable so that people can attend and learn. The bureaucrats stationed here in Canberra can also learn. People from around the world can then have the chance to meet ordinary Australian farmers.

          The report states that the committee reviewed the projects being funded in research institutions in Tamworth and Wagga Wagga. Tamworth is very close to where I live. A magnificent job is done for the grain industry in that area. Wagga Wagga also does a great job. I commend the people who research and apply themselves to trying to make things better for farmers.

          I noticed also that the committee accepted greater responsibility for the wheat and barley research programs in Queensland. That was done as a result of committee initiatives. More research organisations submitted projects for funding. Points were also made about wheat research. The report talks about consultation with farmers in the community and that is of paramount importance. I noticed that a lot more research into chickpeas and faba beans will be done. These two legume crops are part of cropping rotations that put nitrogen back into the soil. They keep the rotation going well. The soil is looked after. As custodians of our resources for future generations, most farmers want this.

          In general, I commend the members of the committee—Mr Don Blesing, the Chairman; Trevor Flugge; Michael Furzer; Tony Gregson; Professor John Lovett; Professor Donald Marshall and Dr Barry White—for the job they do in spending the research dollar. I hope that they do in the future what they have done in the past—that they make sure that the money put in the research funds by the growers is spent in a worthwhile manner.

          —I want to comment briefly on the report from the Department of Employment, Education and Training entitled `Higher Education Funding for the 1992-94 Triennium'. The report outlines funding decisions for this period and states that the Government's policies will enhance quality in the system and diversity in higher education. That is, of course, a very broad and sweeping statement by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and his Department and it is blatantly incorrect.

          The education policies of this Labor Government are destructive, and the report clearly overlooks the chaos that has become the lot of the higher education system since the creation of Mr Dawkins's national unified system. As one would expect from DEET, this report claims that the enforced amalgamations within Australia's higher education system are a success. That is despite the continuing opposition from many institutions, such as the University of New England, and the intolerable overcrowding and overenrolment that exists in my own university at Newcastle.

          In this report the Minister felt it necessary to make a statement on overcrowding and overenrolment problems. He is like Pontius Pilate; he wipes his hands of this matter, lays most of the blame at the feet of the institutions themselves and throws them inadequate funding to then deal with the problem. In his statement the Minister says that the Government will simply not provide additional funding for institutions which are above their target load, but will provide some assistance where the problems that have arisen are beyond the control of the university.

          Firstly, the report states that almost all institutions are overenrolled. Secondly, I would have thought that the recession we had to have was definitely beyond the control of the universities. The universities could not have foreseen that this recession would have hit so hard and that, in a bid to avoid joining the 30 per cent of the rest of Australia's youth who are on the dole at the moment, so many people would have actually sought to continue studying. Here again, the Keating Government has let them down. A record number of 50,000 eligible students were turned away from university places this year. Surely the despair that would have been generated by this figure would be enough for the Minister and the Labor Government to see that their policies simply just are not working.

          With overenrolment in 1991 the institutions were forced to lower the number of offers. This report states that in 1992 overenrolments are now averaging 6.6 per cent. NBEET states that the problem is so severe that it is detrimental to the creation of a proper learning environment.

          The Labor Government will not give the universities the flexibility they need to deal with these problems. If the Government is incapable of providing adequate funding, why should students suffer because of outdated ideology which discourages universities from seeking funding from other sources. The Government wishes to increase places in universities but the institutions are not receiving the funding that would allow them to expand to meet the increased demand.

          Under the Labor Government the funding of our higher education system has slowly been reduced as a percentage of GDP. Due to the Government's recession and the pressure that has been placed on universities to take more enrolments, the Government is not giving out the money that is urgently needed for capital works. Universities around the country are starved of facilities and resources whilst bursting at the seams, yet the Government clearly does not seem to care.

          —by leave—The report that has been tabled today by Senator Faulkner on behalf of Senator Coates is a comprehensive report of the annual reports that were brought forward to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The report is well put together. It is a report for which we have to thank our staff—Peter Hamburger and his colleagues—for the work they have done and the advice they have given to the Committee in helping us to assess the quality of the annual reports which were brought forward.

          One of the reports mentioned in the report tabled today is from the Department of the Senate. In the context of the Committee's report, it found some pluses with that report, such as the promptness with which it was delivered. There were some other comments made that could be helpful in the preparation of future annual reports by the Department of the Senate.

          There were a number of very interesting bar charts in the report of the Department of the Senate which related to the number of questions at Question Time. As you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, this is a vexed question which is referred to from time to time in this chamber. The substance of those figures shows that during the last six or seven years the number of questions asked and answered in Question Time is low com-

         pared with the experience of previous governments. I have made this point on a number of previous occasions and I do not plan to belabour it today, except to say that the figures I have and which I hope to table—they go back to 1978—show that the performance of the Hawke-Keating Government in the Senate in relation to the number of answers at Question Time has been poor.

          If we had been able to achieve an average of around 28 questions a day—which other governments have been able to achieve, according to the figures—then Senator Sowada's colleagues would have been able to ask an extra question a day, and in a seven-day cycle that would have provided a further seven questions for the Democrats.

          Put simply, the problem is that, despite the efforts by the President—and he assures us that he is attempting to increase the number of questions being asked and answered in Question Time—the reality is that the Government's performance has gone back to the bad old days of around 22 to 23 questions a day.

         —by leave—The report that is being considered by the Senate today is the seventh annual report by the National Crime Authority since it commenced operations in 1984. Quite early in the report it makes the comment that there is very little, if any, contribution from the Intergovernmental Committee. I think this is a relevant factor. I will comment a little later on the fact that the recommendations which were made by the Parliamentary Committee in its report
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         With respect to the report, there is a number of matters I would like to raise briefly. One is the introduction of performance indicators for the National Crime Authority. This was one of the innovations introduced by its former Chairman, Mr Justice Phillips, who has just resigned. I believe it is a useful development. However, as this report indicates, we will have to wait and see whether the performance indicators which are being suggested—for an activity which is very difficult to measure—to establish efficiency and effectiveness are adequate. All we can say at this stage is that a start has been made in the development of a corporate plan and the setting down of some performance indicators.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think it is also worth mentioning that the statistics published in the report which the Committee comments on indicate that the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 is working very well. Some $29m has been secured or frozen by the Authority since this strategy was developed. Clearly, this is a strategy which should be continued in the future and which holds out a lot of promise in the fight against organised crime.

         Paragraph 23 of the report, on page 7, deals with some of the Committees's recommendations for amendments. The Committee notes a press report in which the `obsessive secrecy' of the Authority is slated. There are three chairmen mentioned—Mr Justice Stewart, Mr Faris, QC, and Mr Justice John Phillips. It is fair to draw attention to the qualification made by the Committee in that report—excluding the period during which Mr Justice John Phillips was chairperson of the NCA when  a great deal of cooperation was experienced by the Parliamentary Committee. Notwithstanding that, recommendations were made for amendments to ensure that the Committee—the parliamentary watchdog—can carry out its duties effectively. The Government's delay in coming to grips with the necessary amendments must be a matter of some concern. As I mentioned earlier, the consultation with the IGC appears to be dragging a little. That is at least one of the factors that are holding it back.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To summarise, it was the view of the Committee that its members must be able to obtain information from the NCA to enable them to make a proper judgment on the work of the NCA. It is also conceded by the Committee that there must be certain safeguards, which have been identified. In other words, information which identifies persons in a matter which could be prejudicial to the safety or legal rights of those persons, information which could prejudice legal proceedings, and information which discloses the operational methods of the authority must be viewed as material that is confidential to the extent that members of the Parliamentary Committee may not disclose it. To the extent that the majority report and my recommendations coincide on these matters, I trust that the Government will see fit to introduce these amendments.

         There was some divergence of view as to how a conflict of opinion could be resolved between the NCA and the Parliamentary Committee on whether certain factual pieces of information fall within one or other of these three exclusions. As I have set out in my dissenting report, I believe that a judge sitting outside the court system is the proper adjudicator in such a situation. I cannot see that the alternative put forward in the report—the suggestion that the Minister responsible for this area, the Attorney-General, should make the final judgment—is adequate since once again it brings the political sphere into the area of the judgment that needs to be made.

         —by leave—Like Senator Spindler, I want to make a few brief observations on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the NCA's annual report. I begin by commending Justice Phillips, who did an outstanding job as the Chairman of the National Crime Authority. His period of office undoubtedly represents a turning point for the Authority as one of Australia's principal law enforcement agencies. I am sure everyone on the Committee—and, indeed, in the Senate—is pleased to wish him well as the incoming Chief Justice for the State of Victoria. I also welcome Mr Sherman as the new Chairman of the NCA.

         As Senator Spindler said a few moments ago, Justice Phillips introduced many innovations in his period as Chairman of the Authority. Well do I remember the outlining of the program of the electronic courtroom which he oversaw a few months ago in Melbourne. Not only was the innovation valuable, but the electronic courtroom program was opened to the public and showed at first hand what the NCA was capable of doing as an agency that looked across the board in matters of law enforcement in Australia.

          Who is to Guard the Guards?
         </emphasis>
         , about the proper role of the Joint Committee as against the role of the Intergovernmental Committee, the IGC. There is no doubt in my mind that the appropriate body for monitoring the National Crime Authority is the Joint Committee rather than the IGC. I think that is demonstrated by the quality of the observations drafted in the report before the Senate this afternoon by the Committee secretariat. I join Senator Spindler in paying tribute to the staff of the secretariat, particularly Mr Andrew Snedden, the Committee Secretary.

         The IGC does not seem to have the inclination that the Committee has to work effectively as the monitoring body upon the NCA. There is no doubt that the relationship which currently exists between the Authority and the Joint Committee has not been better. I am sure that Senator Jones, who has served on the Committee longer than I, would endorse those remarks. Primarily that is a result of the NCA now being a much more open and accountable body. Much of that has to do with Mr Justice Phillips in a personal sense. As Chairman of the NCA he certainly made himself available to the media in the broad, responded to inquiries and questions, and was prepared not only to defend the Authority but to argue its case as a law enforcement agency.

         There is no doubt that the new corporate ethos of the Authority, as demonstrated by its performance indicators and performance plan referred to in the body of the report, has been impressed by the period Mr Justice Phillips acted as the Chairman. There is no doubt, as outlined in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the report before the Senate this afternoon dealing with performance indicators, that the NCA has now set a mission statement and nine clear objectives. There are now also criteria by which the Authority may be judged as a law enforcement agency. That takes into consideration the difficulties that exist in judging any law enforcement agency as against any private or government business enterprise.

         In the report for 1993 the Joint Committee will be able to make a judgment of the performance of the NCA. There is no doubt that its role is changing in the current climate. There is no doubt that the NCA has a role to play as a law enforcement agency dealing with the dilemmas of the 1980s and with the excesses of that period. I refer to the white-collar crime that is only too readily apparent and the corporate abuses that took place in some sectors of business, industry and commerce during the 1980s. It is not only the Australian Securities Commission that has an increased role to play; the NCA also has a very definite role to play in that process.

         I make one observation about a problem area which the Committee is in the process of identifying—an area of which the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) are only too well aware. I refer to the witness protection program. There was the murder of Mr Mick O'Brien in Sydney recently. I pass no comment on that, other than to say that it highlighted the need for the witness protection program to be the subject of increased scrutiny at both Federal and State levels. There is no question either that we need a greater degree of cooperation between the Federal and respective State and Territorial governments in making certain that the witness protection program is of the highest order, not only in terms of the protection it affords people within it but also in terms of its aims and objectives.

         There is no question that major breakthroughs have occurred in law enforcement matters in the United States as a result of the success of the American witness protection program. There is no question either that we can achieve results at least as beneficial to the community and as effective in terms of matters of law enforcement as the Americans have done through their various programs.

        To my mind, if a step is taken to remove the auditing function from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the proper place for it is the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. There is no question that the Committee agrees with that assessment. That is the most practical step that might be taken in the light of the removal of that power from the office of the Ombudsman. I commend the report to the Senate.

        Justice Phillips, during his chairmanship, laid down very careful guidelines for the way in which the Authority would open up its activities to the public.

         I believe that the newly appointed Chairman, Mr Sherman, will not only continue in the same vein that Justice Phillips started during his period of office but will continue during his chairmanship to extend the public role of the NCA so that the public can be more aware of the activities of the NCA. I believe that the cooperation that has already been shown by Mr Sherman will continue to be shown to the parliamentary Committee. The parliamentary Committee will also be able to examine the activities of the NCA much more easily as a result of the way in which Mr Sherman has laid down the way in which matters should be dealt with.

          From the reports of both last year and this year that have come before the Parliament, I have noted the observations made by the Film Board of Review. My examination of the observations made reinforces my view that more violence is coming through R-rated material and M-rated material than ever before. I shall give the Senate an example of some of the words that have been used in decisions by the Film Board of Review on appeals from producers of various films. For example, the Film Board of Review describes one such video as being `an orgy of violence with a grisly procession of blows, kicks, stabbings, shootings and graphic bone breakings' and having `no mitigating qualities'. That film was given an R-rated classification. The Board of Review said that some of the Film Censorship Board members thought it should have been in the M-rated category.

          The current paper, which we are considering here, also gives a description by the Film Board of Review of a film which was given an `R' classification by the Film Censorship Board.

This Committee has published a paper in the series on the cost of legal services and litigation as part of the cost of justice inquiry. It is Discussion Paper No. 5 and it is on legal ethics. I wish to comment on three of the matters that are raised by Dr Parker in that particular discussion paper.

          This report is an extremely valuable one, bearing in mind the wide-ranging and searching inquiry that is being undertaken by the Cooney Committee on this matter. It is important that we try to illuminate every aspect of the legal system that contributes to the costs that litigants are faced with. A review of legal ethics is, I believe, a particularly appropriate exercise, bearing in mind that the area of legal ethics has grown over the years, starting almost from the Middle Ages. Certainly, some of the practices that are currently being followed by the legal profession could well do with some review.

          Dr Parker raises in his report a whole lot of particular duties which, under the code of legal ethics, are intended to be observed by legal practitioners. I only wish to comment on those few in which I am aware some shortcomings exist. I refer in particular to the first item under the general heading of `Duties of Fairness'—the duty not to pursue hopeless cases, to enter hopeless defences or to cause unreasonable expense or delay.

        <para first-indent="16">

          I refer to a case that was recently brought to me by a constituent. The constituent had a legal dispute over an amount not exceeding $2,000, but the ultimate legal costs faced by her were of the order of $60,000. I believe that very much comes under the heading of `a duty not to cause unreasonable expense or delay'.

          There is another aspect involved in that which is relevant and that is the aspect of remedy. What does that particular solicitor's client now do, having been faced with this sort of a bill over a dispute involving an amount not exceeding $2,000? I might say that the case is in Victoria and the exact circumstances may differ from State to State. She has three options. First, she can accept what she would consider—and I would agree—an unreasonable offer of settlement. Secondly, she can apply to the Solicitors Board. But even if the Solicitors Board found that the solicitor was at fault or negligent, the limit of the remedy she could achieve would be $2,500, when she is faced with legal costs of $60,000. The third remedy she has is to engage yet another legal practitioner and go to court, charging her former solicitor with negligence or unsatisfactory execution of his or her duties.

          Clearly, these are not satisfactory options. I believe that the review of the legal profession's ethics needs to include an examination of whether self-regulation in that instance is really working. In my view it is not. Clearly, we need to look at establishing an independent tribunal that can judge when clients of solicitors or barristers have a complaint and whether that particular complaint can be dealt with in an impartial way.

          I turn to another duty that Dr Parker lists; that is, the duty to be loyal. That, on the face of it, of course, is a very admirable quality. It is also the basis of our adversarial system that a solicitor, a legal representative, pursues his or her client's case, right or wrong, particularly in, say, the industrial relations area or the area of family law. Another inquiry which is currently in progress has a lot to consider in terms of the costs that have to be faced by people who go through the Family Law Court system at a very traumatic time of their lives. So I think it is perhaps useful to look at whether our adversarial system works to the benefit of the clients of legal practitioners.

          Very often it may be possible—without making the whole change towards the inquisitorial system which is in place in Europe—to consider whether a mitigation of that duty to be loyal come what may could perhaps result in a legal practitioner acting for both parties in a mediator's role, trying to find a solution which overcomes the problems.

          The third item I wish to address is the suggestion that we should look for a code of settlement; for a legal culture which tries all possible means of ensuring that the dispute is settled before it takes the time of the court and before it fixes the client with considerable expense. It was instructive to be told that, while on a national basis 5 per cent of all divorces finish up as a dispute that has to be adjudicated in the Family Court, in Tasmania the proportion is of the order of 1.5 per cent. We inquired into the reasons for that disparity and very clearly the small community contributes—lawyers can meet on a fairly regular basis. They can address the difficulties in a constructive manner by simply discussing how the problem cam be solved, rather than how the other side can be trounced.

          The thoughts and suggestions that Dr Parker puts forward in this paper on legal ethics warrant the consideration of a much wider audience than just the Committee that is dealing with the cost of justice problems. It should be considered not only by the Senate, but also by the public in general and I am glad that the Committee has published this paper so that it may be circulated to a much wider audience.

          The other paper I wish to comment on briefly is a background paper prepared by Dr Ian McEwen from the Research School of Social Sciences and Pacific Studies at the Australian National University which deals with access to legal services and the role of market forces. Also, Dr McEwen lists a number of areas where the legal profession can or should review its practices. For instance, amongst those areas he lists the desirability to reduce the extent to which certain legal services are monopolised by lawyers, and recommends that one should give greater access to paralegals in many areas which are currently being dealt with by the legal profession. Obviously, conveyancing and uncontested divorce cases would fall into that category.

         I received a letter concerning this particular report of the inquiry by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into adult and community education, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Come in Cinderella.
         </emphasis>
         The request came from Dr Shirley Randall, who is the Director of the Australian Council of Adult Education in support of the Committee's recommendations. Having looked at the report, I make the comment that 75 per cent of the clientele for adult and community education are women. This provides an excellent service, especially for those who may have been out of the work force for some time or who are without previous qualifications.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The report, which makes the point that education is viewed as a life-long process, states that the Committee would like support for a national policy and national structures. The report has understated the importance of this educational sector for women. Administrators and organisers are mainly women, but they are not adequately recompensed for the work that they do. The majority of the students are women, but they do not receive proper credit for their studies. I would like the report to receive attention, particularly in light of its importance to women in our community.

         This Bill reflect one major problem—factionalism in the Australian Labor Party and all that that has caused. One only has to look at the developments which have been held up in this country over the last eight or nine years; the jobs which have been lost in the mining and forest industries; and the jobs that have been lost in the tourist industry as a result of the mishandling of the pilots dispute. The list goes on and on. In a sense, we are now facing the symbol of the problems that this Labor Party has in managing the economy.

On the other hand, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, Mrs Kelly, is charged by the Labor Party with keeping the extreme greenies on side.

         As a Victorian senator, I have been able to witness first-hand in my State how the anti-development policies of the Labor Party have destroyed jobs and prevented new developments in the timber industry. Over the last 20 years in my home State of Victoria we have had detailed land use studies to determine appropriate land use classifications. Indeed, the Land Conservation Council, which played a key role in these studies, was an initiative of the former Liberal Hamer Government.

         There has been comprehensive public consultation. The Victorian Government developed a timber industry strategy. But the intervention of the Federal Government in State land issues, notably in East Gippsland prior to the last Federal election, renewed uncertainty and undermined the State Government's own timber industry strategy.

         The history of the forest industry in Victoria under Labor is a history of lost opportunities, lost jobs and political hypocrisy on a grand scale. Let me give an instance of this. As a result of the policies of the Cain and Kirner Governments to burn residue wood rather than sell it for woodchips, Victoria has lost export revenue in the order of $100m a year. If this wood could be used in pulp mills, the value of these residue chips would be even greater. Royalties for the Victorian Government would have been in the order of $12m a year. A lot of education and community services can be financed from $12m a year, particularly in a State which has been bankrupted by the Labor Government. Yet, in order to appease the extreme environmentalists within its ranks, the Government has prevented the use of much of this valuable material.

         There is the other irony that while good pulpable material is burnt in Victoria, Australia is importing eucalyptus pulp from Brazil. It is interesting that after eight wasted years, Steve Crabb, the Victorian Minister for Conservation and Environment, reversed the policy of the Cain and Kirner governments. But by then, as Senator Brownhill would have guessed, the market had moved on, it had found other suppliers. The world economy changes and markets become soft. It will take some time to convince buyers that, based on our past performance, Victoria can be a reliable supplier.

         It is worth noting that APM has been woodchipping for about 50 years to supply feed stocks to its Maryvale pulp and paper mill. It is interesting that the timber industry inquiry, chaired by Professor Ian Ferguson, found that the regeneration of forest from which pulp wood was taken was superior to that from forest where it was left.

         We in Victoria can recall the Victorian Labor Government's attempt to look at the possibility of establishing a new greenfield pulp mill in East Gippsland. This plant would be worth in the order of $1.2 billion. A report found that both the Maryvale expansion and the new greenfield pulp mill could be supplied from existing sources. Indeed, major companies, including APM and APPM, were encouraged to prepare proposals at some cost to themselves. An office was established in Orbost.

         In 1989-90 the process was halted by the Labor Party after these companies had spent substantial sums. In summary, this great proposal to develop a major new greenfield pulp and paper mill had fallen through because of factional difficulties in the ALP. While the Labor Party dithered on the proposal for a new greenfield plant in East Gippsland, five or six new plants were built elsewhere in the world, including two in Alberta, Canada. Market position and the opportunities to create Australian jobs had been lost, and we continue to import more wood and wood products from other countries in the world.

         I am pleased to report that the amendments proposed by the Opposition are fully supported by the Victorian Association of Forest Industries. The Director of that association, Mr Norman Houn, put out a press release to that effect yesterday. Australian paper manufacturers have written to Mr Alan Griffiths urging him to accept the Opposition amendments. In a letter, APM announced last month that some $154m would be spent over the next four years to increase the capacity of its Maryvale plant. But had the Victorian Government shown the enthusiasm it now shows for enabling the expansion of Maryvale in the 1980s—in other words, it has done an about-turn again—we may well have had this major expansion up and running, creating import placement worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The Managing Director of APM, Mr McFarlane, said:

        Let us not forget that even if there is agreement by all parties for the northern Tasmanian pulp mill to go ahead, it will take anything up to two years for the environmental assessments that this Government demands to be prepared.

         The people standing in the way of these amendments are Mr Richardson and Mrs Kelly who are prepared to push an extreme Green line at the expense of jobs. We know that Alan Griffiths supports the thrust of these amendments. We have only to read his information paper on resource security, which he released on 19 February last year. What we do not know is whether Alan Griffiths has the courage and political clout to ensure that the legislation to encourage jobs will be passed in this chamber and to ensure that the intransigent position that elements in the Government are adopting do not destroy jobs.

         In conclusion, I would like to say that public attitudes towards the industry versus the environment issue are changing. The survey carried out by Brian Sweeny and Associates, which was sent to the Prime Minister just the other day, showed a remarkable shift in attitudes by voters on the vexing question of industry activity-resource versus the environment. A great majority—over 60 per cent—have now come to the balanced view that both can coexist equitably.

         I put it to honourable senators that this Bill seeks to ensure just what the public are now saying that they strongly support. We support the amendments which are proposed by NAFI. As I pointed out earlier in my remarks, a very comprehensive unity ticket supports these amendments, including Senator Sherry's mates in the union movement, and I will be interested to hear what Senator Sherry has to say. I urge the Senate to ensure that the amendments to the legislation are passed.

         The legislation that is before us has one dominant purpose and that is to ensure new investment of at least $100m to produce goods for export and/or import replacement. The legislation is not designed to protect the industrial status quo by providing security to any use of wood for any purpose from any region. It is designed to shift the industry towards export-oriented, value adding activities and to facilitate large projects of that kind. World-scale pulp mills are, of course, the paradigm case, and we want to see such developments at the earliest opportunity.

I will return to that issue later when I deal with the objections of the Opposition. In the legislation we have also recognised that significant large scale investments of the type we are endeavouring to encourage can and do arise when companies expand or extend their existing facilities, perhaps through modernising or upgrading their plants.

         The Government is determined to focus on investments of this size, that is, over $100m, in the context of this legislation because what the Government is offering to industry is not being done lightly. The Government is saying to industry, `We, as the Government of Australia, after conducting a comprehensive integrated assessment and satisfying ourselves that certain obligations have been entered into by the enterprise and the State Government, will tie ourselves by legislation not to use our statutory powers, except in exceptional circumstances'.

         It is important to examine this Federal legislation in the context of the recent legislation that was passed in Tasmania. Before I do that, I point out that the Federal legislation has the capacity to pave the way for a pulp mill in northern Tasmania, for the existing mill in Maryvale in Victoria to be upgraded and, over the next decade, for significant major projects in Western Australia and east Gippsland in Victoria. The legislation encourages strong development in a sectoral way by setting the parameters for investment in a particular section—a very important section of our economy—by encouraging export-oriented growth.

         In Tasmania last year a Bill called the Forest Reform Bill was passed; it is more commonly known in that State as resource security legislation. This legislation followed a two-year examination of every conceivable aspect of the forest industry in Tasmania, certainly the most comprehensive examination of the way in which the forest industry in Tasmania is conducted and probably the most comprehensive examination of a forest industry anywhere in the world.

         It is very important to bear in mind that the aim of this State legislation was to create an integrated approach to economic and environmental decision making, so that sustainable—I emphasise that word `sustainable', particularly for the Democrats' purposes—management of our multiple-use forests can be achieved.

         There was general agreement that changes to the present systems in Tasmania were needed if Tasmanians were to gain the maximum benefit from their forest, land, labour and investment resources. The legislation was ultimately passed last year after considerable political wheeling and dealing by the then Liberal Opposition, which attempted to enter into a marriage of convenience with the Greens to defeat that legislation—albeit for reasons different from those given by those who adopt a somewhat similar approach in this chamber.

         That Bill is the first part of changes in legislation that will include resource security as the method for defining how different forest lands should be managed in the State of Tasmania.

         Very briefly, the process that was followed examined every conceivable aspect of the forest industries in Tasmania, including the traditional concessions system. In the past in Tasmania vast areas of the State have been concessioned off to companies like APPM and ANM and they had a monopoly hold over those lands. It also examined industrial relations practices in the forest industry. It set aside further lands for protection in the form of World Heritage areas, national parks and State reserve, so that 27 per cent of the land area of Tasmania is now made up of State reserves, World Heritage areas and national parks. I emphasise that figure—27 per cent of the land area of Tasmania.

         That process also provided for multiple-use forests. Those multiple-use forests will take up approximately 15 per cent of Tasmania. Not all of that 15 per cent of Tasmania, which is categorised as multiple-use forests, will be logged. Significant areas of that 15 per cent of Tasmania will not be logged because, if there is to be minimal damage to the environment as part of this process of resource security in Tasmania, it must be carried out in a much more environmentally sensitive way through the preservation of significant tracts of forest around stream areas and on steep slopes, et cetera.

         It also looked at the way in which forest practices in the forest industry could be improved. The more intensive management of forests would increase productivity by the more efficient use of technology, scientific research and development, and by downstreaming or value adding. Again, this Federal Government's commitment is clearly illustrated by the developments that have taken place in the last eight years in the Furniture Research and Design Centre in Tasmania. I recommend that members of the Senate visit the Furniture Research and Design Centre in Hobart which produces magnificent furniture, again value adding for export.

         I would like now to turn to some of the objections that have been raised by what I term the Democrats-Greens in this place and in public debate on this issue over the last few years. The Democrats-Greens adopt a number of themes. Their first proposition is that there are declining jobs in the forest industry and that, therefore, we should not support this industry any more; we should not have it. I agree with their first factual analysis that the employment opportunities in this industry are declining, except in the furniture sector where there is a real increase in job numbers. But I do not agree with their conclusion that we do not have an industry. If we followed the Green economic lunacy—and that is what it is, economic lunacy—then we could come to the conclusion that because jobs are declining in almost every manufacturing industry in this country, on their logic we do not have manufacturing industry, which is absolute nonsense.

         The Greens-Democrats also advance another theme that we should say no to world scale pulp mills and instead go for the smaller, presumably more environmentally friendly, pulp mills. There is just one snag with that argument, and that is that no-one wants to build small pulp mills. The trend around the world is towards large world scale pulp mills that are technology rich and are not big employers of labour.

         The Greens also advance the argument that there should be no logging of old growth forests. The consequence of that argument is, in Tasmanian terms—and I speak of Tasmania because of my own knowledge of this industry in Australia and in that State—that no logging of old growth forests and a switch to plantations would be catastrophic. I
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         </emphasis>
         t would mean that the logging of most of the forests in Tasmania would cease. Whilst some persons within their own moral code, within their own ethos, might believe that that is a good thing, I put it to the Senate that 27 per cent of the land area of Tasmania cannot be logged, and that really represents a very adequate proportion of the State and a very adequate representation of the biodiversity that is contained within the State of Tasmania.

         To advocate no logging of areas outside those areas that have been preserved and reserved is quite a disastrous policy.

          It also ignores the fact that logging is an integrated activity. In Tasmania, when logging the old growth forests—hopefully, primarily, for sawlog—the inevitable fact is that there is quite a significant amount of waste because logs are round. The Democrats-Greens might have a problem with accepting the fact that logs are round. If one goes into a forest and recovers 30 per cent of that forest for sawlogging, at least 70 per cent of what is left is waste. On the logic of the Greens-Democrats that waste would lie on the ground and they would just burn it or leave it there to rot.

         This would be absolutely ridiculous for two reasons: first, it is a waste of a valuable economic resource that can hopefully be converted into pulp and paper; and, second, if they leave that resource—the waste—on the ground, then that waste will ensure, if it is left where it is, that the regrowth forest is an absolute shambles and mess. The waste has to be cleared away. The approach in Tasmania is to maximise from logging the high value-adding yields and the sawlog activity, and what is left is chipped for pulp and paper and, hopefully, processed in this country and not exported.

         The Greens-Democrats advance another argument, and that is that this logging activity in Tasmania is terrible because it discourages tourism. The tourism industry in Tasmania has gone through unprecedented growth over the last 20 years, even with significant logging activity. I put it to the Senate and to the Greens-Democrats that we can successfully have both activities. We can have the development of a comprehensive, sensitive, tourism industry and we can have the development of a comprehensive and environmentally sensitive forest industry, including the use of old growth forests.

         The reality of the approach of the Greens-Democrats was well summed up by a journalist last week. In fact, the Democrats were a bit sensitive about the description, but I am going to use it today—it is the moonbeam approach. That is the best way to describe the approach of the Democrats and the Greens. Little light and no substance—the moonbeam approach. If we are to stop logging and we are to stop integrated forestry in this country, that is a recipe for mounting debt, it is a recipe for not adding value to our raw resources and it is a recipe for increasing unemployment. I have to concede that when I talk to some of the Greens and Democrats about this issue some of them do put the view that we should not have economic growth, and some of them truly believe in that approach. I suppose, logically, if they believe that, then they are quite happy to put up with a situation of declining value adding and increasing unemployment.

         But significant sections of the Greens and the Democrats are not honest about that approach and they are not willing to admit that their approach will mean an end to forestry in this country; it will mean increasing unemployment and it will mean declining value adding. Because of our increasing debt, of which 10 per cent is in forest and forestry products, it will mean that all the things the Democrats want to do—and presumably fund through a much expanded public sector—will not be possible, because if we cannot have sustained economic growth, how can we have growth in the public sector and all the sorts of things that they advocate, many of which I share?

         But the Opposition has advanced a number of concerns about this legislation. I do not want to deal with the amendments one by one; I will just deal with the themes that have been raised. There are a number of amendments relating to the eligibility of State forest industry investment programs. The Government fully appreciates the important role which the sawmilling sector plays in the industry and its concern to have secure access to forest resources. The Commonwealth will provide a legislative level of resource security for the sawmilling sector. Indeed, in Tasmania, through the State resource security, we have considerable protection for small sawmillers. I will return to that later in the context of the Tasmanian Liberal senators' approach, because they know that this is the case.

         In addition to the legislation for the sawmilling sector, the Government intends to provide non-legislative resource security for investments which do not meet the $100m threshold. So the argument about the $100m threshold is a nonsense. Indeed, it is interesting and somewhat ironic that those opposite are suggesting that the Federal Government should become involved in the assessment of every forest project and sawmilling project in this country. The growth needed in the Federal bureaucracy to ensure a proper examination of every conceivable project in this country is a novel approach for the Opposition—indeed, a very new approach. I just wish it would consider the consequences if we remove the $100m threshold.

         I would like to turn now to the conduct of my Liberal colleagues from Tasmania. Last week in the other place during a debate which was not very illuminating, an absurd series of propositions were put forward by some honourable members. For example, Mr Miles, the honourable member for Braddon, stated two reasons for opposing this legislation. The first was that a company such as APPM does not have sufficient incentive through the depreciation schedules to provide for investment. All I can say about the comments of Mr Miles is that he obviously did not read the One Nation package in which we have put forward a series of new and comprehensive depreciation schedules, which have been welcomed by the industry. So he cannot use that argument. Indeed, Mr Miles's State Leader, Ray Groom, welcomed the improvements in depreciation schedules. So Mr Miles obviously does not listen to his own State Liberal Leader in Tasmania.

         In the media over the last week in Tasmania—and we saw it last night as well—the new Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom, urged Tasmanian Liberal senators to support the legislation. We often hear Opposition senators from Tasmania say that they are here representing Tasmania; that they will fight for Tasmania. They are being advised by their State colleagues, and particularly the State Premier, Mr Ray Groom, to support this legislation. What are they doing?  They are ignoring their State Liberal colleagues and they are ignoring the principles by which they often come in here and espouse States rights. They are full of rhetoric, but their rhetoric does not match their action on this issue. For example, in early March this year, Mr Ray Groom said that he was:

In the context of this Bill, resource security is designed to provide guaranteed access to precious assets at low cost for the benefit of large corporations and to the detriment of the global eco-system and to those employed in the timber industry.

         In Tasmania, for example, the major reason for resource security legislation was to provide industry with short term legislative guarantees to enable the forest industry to maximise its profit. As many are aware, native forest woodchipping will become uneconomic in less than 15 years when the large number of eucalypt plantations around the world will reach maturity.

         As other senators are aware, the recent agreement between the Conservation and Land Management Department of Western Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission has been proposed as the model for providing non-legislative resource security. The agreement was poorly conceived and confirms the conservation movement's fears that State and Federal governments are still willing to lock in unsustainable logging regimes around Australia. This will lead to the conversion of almost all of Australia's remaining ecologically diverse native forests into immature regrowth, which is of questionable environmental value. I regret that neither this Government nor previous governments took the opportunity to shift all sectors of the timber industry to a sustainable and secure footing, but rather they perpetuated the short term, profit-driven approach to resource development. All governments for the past 20 years have been willing to facilitate the unsustainable mining of our old-growth forests as a cash export crop, primarily for the profit of Japanese paper mills. No government has seriously facilitated any move to downstream process the trees that are cut down, despite this being a condition of woodchip licences since 1970.

         Along with the increasing power of the woodchipping sector as the driving force behind the industry, there has been a coincident loss in jobs within the industry. The Green movement could potentially be the greatest ally of the timber industry and its workers, since grown trees are the most environmentally friendly supply of packaging, furniture, writing and building materials. However, the Green movement cannot honestly support an industry while it actively supports the destruction of natural areas and the species they contain.

In fact, the Green movement has genuine concern about the way in which this Bill is presented because it does not meet the true needs of the workers or the industry in the provision of jobs.

         People have been heavily emotionally blackmailed by the threat that unless the timber industry is provided with all this free, old-growth native forest material, there will be no investment later on in downstreaming. There has been no investment for 20 years, so why should we believe that there will be now? Once our precious resources are gone, they are gone forever. Regrowth cannot compare with the thousands of years of native forests that we are sacrificing in the vain hope that industry will have the integrity to do something that it has been promising to do for 20 years.

         In the 200 years since Europeans colonised this country over 45 per cent of forest land has been cleared. Native forests are precious, safe houses for a diverse range of ecosystems and they must be protected at all costs. It is ironic that in the months leading up to the Earth Summit in Brazil, where many world leaders are set to sign a biodiversity convention, the Federal Government has felt obliged to introduce this archaic legislation which harks back to the golden years of exploitation of this country's resources. It also seems incongruous, in a year when the Government is moving closer to finally introducing legislation to protect endangered species, that it has introduced a Bill which seeks to destroy the forest habitats of many of those endangered species.

         Resource security seems to be entirely a flag-flying exercise on the part of the Federal Government. It arose largely because the timber industry decided that it was time to flex its muscles and show its international bankers that it does have the political power to force government to respond to its wishes. However, it is unlikely that any of the promised pulp mills will ever be built in Australia. The world pulp and paper market will continue to be flooded by cheap woodchips and pulp from Third World nations. Australia has lost the race to build any pulp mills based on a native forest resource. As a consequence, the major aim of this legislation will not be fulfilled. In other words, no investment and no jobs.

The cost to our community of resource security over publicly owned forests will be the total obliteration of our old-growth and native forests—all done for the scant hope that some transnational companies might make an investment in Australia by building a highly automated, low-labour pulp mill.

We are here because the old ways of protecting the environment, the old ways of centralised control and government control of vast tracts of land, and centralised control through planning authorities and environment protection authorities, have not worked. They have not worked for a good many reasons, but the main reason is that, when we want to protect a resource or an environment, the last person we would want to give that responsibility to is a politician or bureaucrat, because the forces that go to work on politicians and bureaucrats are not necessarily the forces that best protect the environmental values that all of us hold dear.

         It comes down to an issue of management. In Australia we have seen an enormous concentration on public sector management and public sector ownership of these forest resources. The alternative is to move totally to private sector management or ownership. I do not think the Australian people would cop all of the national parks and the forests being owned by the private sector. The obvious solution is to have a balanced mix. That is what is missing at the moment; there is no balanced mix between public ownership and private ownership.

         I want to refer briefly to one of the fundamental weaknesses of this Bill. It relates to a matter that Senator Sherry referred to earlier concerning the $100m cut-off and the fact that this legislation is designed to encourage the development of big—as Senator Sherry said—internationally competitive pulp mills. The real fact of this legislation is that in specifying projects of over $100m and providing only those projects with so-called resource security, we are actually picking industrial winners. The Government has made the decision that Australia's future in forest and timber products is related only to these massive $100m projects. It says that this is where all the employment will occur and this is where the future lies for Australia's forest industries.

Indeed, why pick on $100m projects when we could just allow the market to decide on whether we have one $100m project or ten $1m projects?

         The reality in the forest industries at the moment—I know this from my own personal experience in the south-west of Western Australia—is that the people who use the forest resource most effectively, the people who get the real value out of each log and who extract the most timber from each log, are the very small operators who provide niche markets. Why can we not have a forest industry that has hundreds of little forest operators in the forests all around Australia, some based on plantations, some based on original natural forests, supplying niche markets and coming up with systems and new techniques to extract the maximum value from the forest resource? One of the reasons why that does not happen is because the forest resource is, by and large, owned by the public sector. It does not price the value of either the logs, the forests, the other timber products or the other important values from forests—that is, recreational uses and habitat value and so forth—because the State Government sets the value of the forest resource. I put it to the Senate that we are not ending up with the proper, effective or efficient economic use of our forest resource. That is one of the reasons.

I think Australia and this Government should look at the private management of national parks—indeed, the Opposition will look at this. At the moment, national parks are managed by rangers and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. In many cases the national parks are very badly managed. I put it to the Senate that the management of many national parks and State forests around Australia could be contracted out to the private sector. Many of the objectives we have sought would be achieved more cost effectively.

Putting power and control into the hands of a few politicians and bureaucrats has dangerous consequences for the economy, for individual liberty and, very importantly, for the future of our natural environment. It is simply not possible for a centralised group of so-called experts to manage and control the extraordinarily diverse resources, decision-making processes and events that are crucial to the environment.

        The International Paper Company's wildlife program in the south of the United States is a prime example of how a firm can benefit from using forest resources to non-wood services. The International Paper Company employs specialists to oversee wildlife and recreation on its lands, including some 16 000 acres in the Southlands Experiment Forest located near Bainbridge, Georgia. There, research is carried out to develop forest management practices that enhance wildlife population as well as profits. White-tailed deer, turkeys, rabbits, bobwhite quail, mourning doves and other species are beginning to reap the benefits of new management techniques. Habitat is improved by controlling burning, buffer zones along streams and tree cutting practices that leave wild cover and plenty of forage.

         North Maine Woods Inc. controls access to the area through 17 checkpoints and access roads, where visitors were required to register, pay fees for different types of use, and obtain permits for campsites. In 1984, the fees ranged from $2 per day to $17 for an all season permit and were used by the association to construct and improve campsites, run a rubbish collection system and run public education programmes on use of the woods. Though the initial efforts were restricted by those who were accustomed to free, unrestricted access, the less crowded, clean, well organised system of recreation management is promoting cooperation between landowners and recreationalists.

         I think all of these examples, including the example as close to home as Dr Walmsley's project in South Australia, show that there is a real alternative to government ownership and control of forest resources. The alternative to the very centralised process we have at the moment is to encourage private ownership, to move towards—on a trial basis—the privatisation of natural eucalypt forests and the contracting out of management of national parks. We need to have property rights; the resource should be owned by the people who want to use them. Groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation could, instead of chopping down trees and spending millions of dollars on propaganda to push its preservationist anti-development views, actually spend that money buying tracts of natural forest and managing them for the conservation of the values that I have referred to previously.

        I put it to the Senate that this legislation is a classic example of a government imposing a centralised, bureaucratic system to solve a problem that really should be handed back in the States, back in the local communities, back in the forests, forest by forest, project by project. The amendments that the Opposition has moved in the Senate today make what is a terrible piece of legislation, a disastrous piece of legislation, into something slightly more acceptable. I commend the Opposition's amendments to the Senate.

         We need not look past Coronation Hill to find a classic example of the kind of commitment given by the Government. The then Prime Minister of this country made a commitment in writing to the Chairman of the Board of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd that mining would be allowed to proceed on Coronation Hill. There was a time, cute as it might have been, when the written word of a Prime Minister meant something. I take it that it meant something to Arvi Parbo, because BHP Gold Mines invested something in the order of $15m—a sheer bagatelle to this Government—of shareholders' money to explore, investigate, and examine the resource potential of the Coronation Hill area. Then it had a very extensive, very sophisticated environmental impact statement prepared which ran into hundreds of pages. It actually believed that the decision as to whether or not the mine would proceed would be based on the integrity and the resolution of that document.

On the one hand two of them saw the intrinsic merit in the legislation because they understood that businesses, companies and corporations would not continue to invest in Tasmania until black and white legislation was in place. Mrs Ros Kelly is carrying a brief for the conservation movement, and I do not mean `conservation movement' in the general sense of the word. I am referring to the extreme radical group which is anti-development and not pro-conservation. Members of that group did not want the legislation because they understand that legislation requires amendment by both Houses of the Parliament. However, a notional proclamation from a Minister without legislation is a much easier way of doing business.

If this were not true, this legislation would apply to every resource Act, but, of course, it does not. For example, special and unique federal legislation has never been required in respect of the iron ore industry. Iron ore is found in areas of intrinsic and natural beauty in Australia which compare with parts of Tasmania.

         The industry wants nothing more than clear and unequivocal guidelines about environmental constraints. Industry does not want to ignore the environment or put it aside.

         I conclude by unequivocally supporting the amendments. To the extent that legislation is necessary to bolster and buttress the integrity of this Government, I support the amendments moved by the Opposition and I particularly commend the integrity and fortitude of my colleagues from Tasmania and the contributions made by them. I ask: why is there a $100m criterion in respect to the trigger mechanism for this legislation? It is almost as if this Government—like every other spectrum of its political judgment—believes that big is beautiful. I understand one major sawmill operator exports something like $5m per year in non-value-added sawn timber products. The industry ought not be responsible merely for import replacement, but should create export earnings and a significant part of the industry will be denied that. While I do not suggest for a moment that exported value-added products contribute in any way to the non-value added exports, in terms of volume they have the capacity to be worth 10 times the amount.

Of course it has dismally failed.

         My understanding is that the overwhelming majority of the industry is totally and absolutely opposed to this legislation in its present form. The sadness for me is that it is a repetition of that which we have seen so often in other projects around Australia. Without going through a long list, I look at the projects in Western Australia which have been held up on environmentally related grounds. The problem is not with satisfying environmental demands but simply with finding out what those environmental demands are. This is true of mineral sands, uranium, gold, nickel and the whole spectrum of resource development in Australia.

        The principle is that providing adequate conservation is delivered by the legislation, and this is one of its major purposes, then all investments in value added industry whether it be for sawmills or pulpmills should be encouraged by resource security . . . Lack of such security is already causing industry to invest in countries other than Australia.

        The practicality involved here is that many large investments could and should be taken by the pulp and paper industry which involve investments less than the $100 million which is the cut-off in the proposed legislation. These investments will also be in jeopardy if the amendments to the Bill are not passed.

         I support wholeheartedly the coalition's position for one very simple reason: in Queensland we have paid the price of environmentalism gone mad. In Queensland, we have the wreck of a timber industry. This once great industry has been decimated by environmentalists locking up more and more and more of the forest, providing no security for investment, providing no security for jobs, and providing no security for industry.

         When we have, as we have at the moment, $1.8 billion of timber coming from overseas into this country every year, it is absolutely crucial for the future of our economy that we are able to turn that around. We need to be able to generate positive investment in the timber industry so that there will be jobs in the future and so that we will be able to avoid this continuing syndrome of import decline. It is therefore important that resource security legislation provide not just for the large pulp millers, but also for the small sawmillers. Unless we have that, the heart of our timber industry will be taken away.

         It is passing strange that the Government should oppose amendments to this Bill which are supported by the unions. What this is all about is providing jobs—providing jobs where there would otherwise be no jobs. In support of this proposition, I draw the Senate's attention to the impact assessment of the World Heritage listing which was conducted by the survey research and consultancy unit of the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of Queensland. It looked into what happened when the timber industry was closed down in north Queensland; and it looked into what happened when the World Heritage listing went through. Its finding was very, very clear. Over 645 jobs were lost directly as a result of that World Heritage listing—645 jobs in areas where these people have no other source of employment, where they will have no alternative but to be condemned to a long term future on the dole.

         I spent a portion of last week in the Brisbane Valley. I spoke to the sawmillers. I visited a sawmill which employs 18 people and which has an investment of half a million dollars. That may not sound like much on the scale of $100m but it is important to that town. It is important to the families of the 18 people who work there. It is important to the transport operators, and it is important to the region. In spite of the fact that the sawmill is small, in spite of the fact that its capital investment is only half a million dollars, it is very profitable because it operates in a niche market, producing mouldings and specialised cuts of timber—hardwood and softwood.

         —The Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 is supported by some sections of the timber industry; it is not supported by others, who believe it should have gone further than it has in the direction of providing resource security. On balance, I think it is fair to claim that this legislation has the support of the industry, if only for the reason that the industry believes it is better to have this legislation than to have nothing.

         My own view is that the system which has been adopted by the State Government of Western Australia under which specified, identified areas of land are reserved for timber production and other areas of land or forest are excluded from timber production—leaving aside whatever reservations one might have about the proportions of those two decisions about forest use—is a better strategy to adopt than the one adopted by this Bill. Under such a strategy, particular parts of Australia would be geographically identified and designated as areas either available or not available for timber production.

         Such an approach, of course, is stridently opposed by the Greenies because the Greenies are not interested in a compromise. The Green extremists want to close down the Australian timber industry. Nothing short of that objective will satisfy them. They are, therefore, completely opposed to any land or resource use legislation or measures which allow any identified part of the Australian continent to be used for economic purposes.

         This leads me to some of the fears I have about the specific clauses of this Bill. I will not read them at great length, but I refer to clause 16(3) and the consequential relevant references in 17(2), 17(5) and 17(6). These provide the opportunity, at least, for objection to be taken as to land which has been designated to be available for timber production, on the grounds that information not known at the time the designated Ministers made their decision has come to light and, therefore, the decision should be changed.

         I believe there is a real danger that those clauses will be exploited in a way that the Government does not intend by Green extremists. Green extremists will follow loggers around every part of Australia, and every time those loggers want to do a bit of logging and cut down a few trees the Green extremists will claim that they have discovered some endangered species, or site of special cultural or anthropological importance, which can only be dealt with by taking the area out of timber production. I believe that is a real danger. I will be happy to be proved wrong, but I fear I will be proved right.

         I will cite one example. The Green fanatic asserts that living standards and levels of consumption must be reduced. For example, we had Senator Chamarette in here yesterday saying that we do not need the mining industry because it gobbles up all the capital and does not provide many jobs. That, of course, expresses the views which are held by Green fanatics. They do not want the mining industry.

         What is even more directly relevant to the Senate is: how does Senator Chamarette, who is of course opposed to this legislation, believe that governments can afford to fund the sort of fiscal scam being perpetrated by her predecessor in the Senate, Senator Vallentine? Instead of the $85,000 lump sum payment to which she is entitled under the provisions of the legislation, former Senator Vallentine is attempting to obtain a lump sum payment of $165,000 plus a $16,500 pension indexed for life. How does Senator Chamarette believe that governments can afford to fund that sort of fiscal scam being attempted by her predecessor? If they followed her views, and the views of Green extremists in general, governments would be simultaneously closing down the industries that paid the taxes, to fund far more worthy areas of government expenditure than the fiscal scam which former Senator Vallentine is perpetrating.

But she does not just want to rotate the job; she wants to pick up, instead of the $85,000 to which she is entitled under the legislation, a $165,000 lump sum plus an indexed pension of $16,500 a year.

I invite Senator Chamarette to take the opportunity to make a personal explanation, either later tonight or tomorrow, as to whether she accepts that Green principle and, if she does, whether she intends to follow former Senator Vallentine's example and repeat the same fiscal scam which she is attempting to run right now.

         Let us look at what the Forest Conservation and Development Bill was meant to achieve. Firstly, the Bill is meant to provide for the identification of forest areas of significant cultural, environmental and heritage value, and to provide for the protection and conservation of those areas. Secondly, it is meant to facilitate investment in enterprises in major wood processing projects for the production of value added products for export, import replacement or both.

         The Labor Government, with this piece of legislation, has failed to address the real issues of the Australian timber industry. That industry urgently requires true resource security legislation that has been properly thought out—security that will provide for investment, security that will provide jobs and security that will provide a future for many people all over Australia who are tied to the timber industry. This Bill does not provide that security. It does allow an undefined or, should I say, an unlimited level of intervention by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy; it applies only to projects to a minimum value of $100m; and it results in bureaucratic duplication, regulation and red tape. Most importantly, however, it provides absolutely no security whatsoever for small businesses in the industry.

This exceptionally broad provision gives the Minister enormous scope as there is no definition of what comprises an unforseen event.

         The concept of resource security, which has been at the heart of much of what has been said about this Bill, has a basic illogicality about it. It is an illogicality which, I suggest, is derived from the colonial concept of land grants. Land was granted with freehold title to those who were already privileged enough to have sufficient capital to engage in what was then described as the fight to tame mother nature, to tame the land. But this was done for profit.

         While this may have been thought appropriate in the colonial period of our history—and there is even a considerable body of opinion to suggest that it was not appropriate even then—the fact is that this country is not now a colonial outpost, and such colonial attitudes are not appropriate. The concept that is embodied in what I have just described is supported and promoted in this very Bill. It is promoted by those people who wish to privatise all enterprises. I suggest that that is where the illogicality lies.

In other words, control over that resource, which has been defined, mapped and protected from the ravages of fire, flood and pests, at great cost to the community—a resource which has been nurtured by the community—will now be dedicated exclusively to the profitable exploitation of private investors.

In this Bill the resource is not subjected to market forces; rather, it is provided—I will have more to say about that word later—exclusively with guarantees to a limited select group of entrepreneurs. The Opposition rightly criticises the lack of consideration given to other potential users of the resource—the smaller sawmillers, the specialists or even smaller integrated enterprises.

         I will take some time to relate an anecdote which is most relevant in this situation. In 1987 I was lucky enough to be introduced to a carpenter who had successfully engaged in a building project which involved building five domestic cottages in a most idyllic setting in a seaside area of Hobart. The fascination of these cottages is that they were built from timber which had been described by Tasmania's Forestry Commission as non-existent. The cottages were built from considerably large section poles of celery-top pine, a timber which is renowned in Tasmania for its special qualities. It is an attractive timber which is durable, hard and strong and has a beautiful honey colour, such that it is often confused with Huon pine. It has a close grain.

         These cottages had been built out of celery pine logs and sections which have been described by our Forestry Commission as non-existent. They were non-existent because there had been a clear-felling operation and a firewood-gathering operation, a licence had been granted to craft-wood gatherers and there had been a regeneration burn over these logs. In other words, according to our Forestry Commission all gettable useful timber had been removed.

         The other anecdote that I would like to give is a very personal one. This week I was trying to have built for me an extension to my house, which involved a new kitchen bench. I thought it would be rather attractive to use some of this celery-top pine. I found that this attractive timber is not purchasable in Tasmania, the State in which it is endemic. It is not possible to buy sufficient celery-top pine in Tasmania to make one kitchen bench. It is available in Victoria. I would have to buy it in Victoria where it is being sent from Tasmania.

         Why has this nonsense perpetuated? Because small efficient local mills are unable to gain access to the resource. Even now, such enterprises have been denied access by those who control the forest resource. I believe this is next to criminal because the resource is not particularly scarce. As a matter of fact, in several places it is quite plentiful. It is unavailable in Tasmania because the timber gathering methods that are used, and the size of the enterprises needed to afford the machinery which uses those methods, prevails in such a way that the specialist timbers have become unattainable. I cannot buy that particular type of timber this week because of the very methods that are used in harvesting our timbers in Tasmania.

         The clear-felling mentality dominates our forest resource extraction methods. There is no longer room for the specialist miller who selectively logs for specific purposes. The only method that is used and endorsed by the Forestry Commission is to indiscriminately cut all trees and to categorise the logs so obtained. This is very much a mechanical process; it is not a labour intensive process. The typical machinery that is used in this process is able to cut, lop, strip, debark and load a log onto a truck. One machine and one operator are used.

I suspect that Senator Sherry is perhaps caught up in the romanticism of some of the timber worker pictures that he may have seen. The old pictures of the well-muscled timber workers who scale the forest giants and open the face with a kelly axe, stand on wooden planks with steel shoes that are magically stable and then heroically swish through the huge trunk with a two-man broadsaw should be forgotten. It does not apply any more; it is not there. That image has disappeared.

         The industry is no longer labour intensive. The efficient use of the modern tree-harvesting machinery requires that a uniform tree size and description is tackled. Smaller, larger, shorter or longer trees are actually a nuisance. I suspect that is why it is very difficult to buy specialist timbers. Different species get in the way. At this stage the price differential hardly justifies the effort required to recognise the species, to trim it properly and to place it aside. It has been said to me that it is more efficient to use the machinery to squash the minor species than to leave them behind as fuel for the infamous regeneration burn.

He described to us the benefits of private nurturing and developing of forests in South America and in South Australia.

         The omissions are well understood by most Tasmanians. I am surprised that the Tasmanian senators who have contributed to this debate so far have not mentioned this aspect. We in Tasmania should all be well aware of the fact that scenery is a resource. The tourist industry has been ridiculed for decades because it is seen as a soft industry. It is not one of those hard, driving, tough industries involving lots of noisy machinery and crashing, crunching and bashing about. It is not a macho industry at all. It is considered a soft industry. The fact that it was ridiculed for some decades is ridiculous. The tourist industry is a huge export industry.

         I conclude by repeating the basic observation which has been made so often about our forests. This Bill is entitled the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. The observation which has been made, and which I repeat, is that forests are not developed by clear-felling. To develop our forests we need to nurture them. That is not necessarily incompatible with proper, selective gleaning of the resources of our forests. I would never support the proposition that we do not glean resources from these forests.

         The gathering of timber, the processing of timber and the value adding of any of the resources is not incompatible with the nurturing of the forest as itself. This attitude is one which, throughout history, has been proven to be correct. We know of the cultural, sociological and economic development of our society that has been possible through entering forests to glean resources, not to harm the development of the forests but to protect them from the ravages of fire, plague or any other threats which might come to them and then to be able to revisit the forests to gain from them the resources which have been regenerated by the fact that we have been able to nurture them. Many previous generations of smaller sawmillers have followed those sorts of practices and they have nurtured and protected our forests without destroying them.

         The central theme of what I have said tonight in contribution to this debate has been that modern forestry practices and methods are the greatest threats to our forests. In my opinion, they pose a threat of turning what is now forest into monoculture. That would bring the hazards of any sort of monoculture: the susceptibility to pests; the susceptibility to fluctuations in world markets; and the danger of damaging the substructure of the soil which provides the basis for that culture.

That is a very bad aspect of this particular legislation. In that sense, it gives no security whatsoever. Of course, the flow-on impact of that down the line will mean that we will see, I believe, the most organised harassment of an industry ever seen in Australia.

         I wish now to touch on the other aspect of forestry that has developed in Western Australia, that is, on-farm forest production. I was fortunate back in 1986 to be involved with the manager of CALM and the then State Government Minister in putting together what is now known as the on-farm forestry policy. That policy developed a number of aspects. Probably the most important one that I wish to mention here is a model of a sharefarming agreement which allows, in conjunction with the Department of Conservation and Land Management and also with WACAP, sharefarming agreements to be put together, thus enabling private land holders to participate in forest production in Western Australia.

         The essence of these agreements is a joint effort between the farmer and CALM or WACAP. Trees are planted either by the farmer, CALM or WACAP and a system of payments is put in place, whereby the farmer can be paid an annuity per year for the estimated life of the forest. Through that operation, agreement can be reached, for example, over a 10-year period, which is the usual time taken. The farmer can take a 10 per cent annuity if he chooses on the estimated value of the forest at the end of the time or, if he so wishes, when negotiating that share farming agreement, he can take a 5 per cent annuity of the estimated value which would leave 50 per cent at the end of the 10 years. Then CALM or WACAP will share equally in the price that is obtained at the end of the 10-year period. That demonstrates quite clearly that commercial, private, on-farm forestry can operate successfully alongside those public areas in Western Australia that have been designated for forest use.

         I want to make some comments about the Commonwealth and its role and, in particular, the Australian Heritage Commission. Over the last 12 months the Australian Heritage Commission has looked at forest areas which have heritage value and has identified them. It has come to a very successful agreement with CALM or the State Government concerning those areas that have been identified. However, then it became greedy. It decided—without any discussion with the private land-holders involved—that it would list 300 farms under the National Heritage Listing. That meant that the contributions of all the farmers who had gone into share-farming agreements with CALM and WACAP, made an investment and planted trees were being put at risk. As I am sure all honourable senators know, the Australian Heritage Commission has enormous powers. Fortunately, through political pressure and other means, it has been forced to withdraw that heritage nomination.

         I wish to make the point that the Commonwealth Government should keep right out of this area. It should be left to the type of agreement and arrangements that we have in Western Australia. The action of the Australian Heritage Commission was an infringement of the rights of those individual private landholders—and this is where I disagree with some of the statements made by Senator Bell. He inferred that under private landhold arrangements and forestry their product would be safe. In fact, under the current Australian Heritage legislation, it is not safe.

         The next point I wish to refer to concerns the genuineness of this Government about this legislation. I suspect—and I have it on good authority—that Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, and also Senator Richardson, who sits in this chamber, would dearly love this legislation to be defeated, because they could then say to the Australian public, `We have tried', and yet at the same time say to the greenies, `Well, we have not really done anything. You still have the same situation as you had before'. I question the Government's genuineness and the Opposition will test it when we come to the amendments. The amendments will improve bad legislation.

         This is indeed a very bad piece of legislation. It is bad because it really does not offer the sort of security that it pretends to offer. It is a label without substance. It does not affect the Commonwealth's decision-making power in relation to world heritage and conservation, for example, and I refer to clause 25. It permits another Act to be put through this place that overrules the present Act and actually encourages those who are against logging to go out into the forests and discover species for the purpose of ending logging in that area. Currently, there are some very unacceptable provisions in clauses 9 and 23 concerning no compensation. However, I understand that some verbal undertakings have been given that these may be withdrawn.

         There are a number of reasons why this Bill is attracting so much attention at present. Since 1985 there has been a heated and often highly politicised forestry debate which has been waged both on the mainland and certainly in Tasmania. Speaking from Tasmania's point of view, I have to say that the Commonwealth Government has not had a very good record of upholding any agreements it has made with the Tasmanian forest industry, and nationally the industry is not prepared to invest in value added or other projects without resource security.

         In 1985, the Tasmanian woodchip industry, represented by APPM, Forest Products and Forest Resources along with the Forestry Commission put together an environmental impact statement—an EIS—for the industry. A number of environmental issues were looked at in putting this publication together, including how special areas should be managed. A number of working papers relating to the environmental impact study were also presented after a substantial amount of research. A lot of work was also done on the measurement of the available resource on both Crown land and private property.

         Once this EIS was complete, Mr John Kerin, on behalf of the Federal Government, signed a memorandum of understanding dated 12 June 1986. This memorandum of understanding ratified forest management systems in Tasmania and specified requirements for further research. This research has been ongoing. It is administered by the Tasmanian Forest Research Council under a person at the University of Tasmania and is funded by a levy on woodchip exported from Tasmania imposed by the Commonwealth.

         Whilst on the topic of Jackeys Marsh, let us dwell for a moment on its history. The area was nominated for National Estate in the mid-1980s and put on the interim list virtually straightaway, which afforded it National Estate status. The listing was finally gazetted in February this year, some seven years later—and then only after much review.

         The reasons for National Estate nomination as per the application to the Australian Heritage Commission were twofold: firstly, it was claimed that there were a number of rare and endangered plant species—this is one of the weaknesses of the Bill—which had made it worthy of listing. Secondly, and more generally, it was claimed that there were landscape and aesthetic values—this is already covered by the Bill.

The upshot of that, again in terms of forest management, was that, while there was and will always be further research needed, in general forest management was not producing unacceptable impacts on native forests and that the industry was efficient.

Not one inquiry has resulted in a more secure working environment for the industry, and that is indeed regrettable. What will it take for confidence to be restored to Australia's forest industry, and for that industry to feel assured of its future and start to plan ahead?

         I am pleased that the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 is to be referred to a committee because, as it stands, it is not a workable piece of legislation in terms of providing the needed security. The national bodies do not help because they seem to have three positions. Australia's forest industry, particularly in Tasmania, has been through a torrid seven years, and it is the Federal Government which has put it through this torrid time. I put on record that I strongly support the amendments that have been proposed and I trust that reason will prevail so that this Senate can deliver a proper Bill.

         APPM is indeed a very brave company at this time. It is important to note that it has allocated, through North Broken Hill, a sum of money for the development of a pulp mill. That amount of money will not stay there indefinitely because there are alternative uses in a mining group which can utilise effectively and efficiently those investment moneys. Therefore, it is up to the Senate to give the directors the confidence to proceed with a pulp mill which will make a great deal of difference in Tasmania.

That requires the cooperation of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) who is known to be not a great supporter of this legislation. So we will see further tension within this Government, further procrastination and delay. Even though we may get the resource security legislation, the Government still has this vehicle—this second tier—by which the poor old company has to wait while the Government completes its studies on the Tasmanian forests. The industry has been through seven torrid years, with numerous inquiries, broken agreements and still another vulnerable hurdle has to be overcome. Yet, to the credit of APPM, it is prepared to wait.

         It is important that the Tasmanian Government has placed its confidence in this project. Both the Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania have undertaken to enter into an intergovernmental agreement designed to ensure that alternative wood, at no additional cost, would be made available to the mill in the event that further areas of forest were to be locked up in the future.

         Let us hope that the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs which will be examining this Bill can put the Bill in order, after appropriate input from a wide range of participants and interest groups, to ensure that when this Bill comes back into this Senate next Thursday it will be passed. Thus, the forest industry will be given a measure—and that is all we can really say—of comfort which it is prepared to accept, so that it can concentrate on future growth and prosperity and, in Tasmania's case, the economic well-being of the State, instead of just having an inquiry or another series of inquiries.

         Tonight we are debating the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. It is an attempt by the forest industry and the unions to get some sort of working harmony that will allow development in the industry. The Government has said that it is not prepared to help, under any circumstances, unless people are prepared to spend $100m. So, in effect, the legislation before the Senate tonight will give resource protection to a proposed pulp mill only, the APPM, which I believe the Government desperately needs. The $100m threshold contained in the Bill is far in excess of any other company's investments in Australia. It is just another indication that the Government has really deserted the timber industry.

         The record in the timber industry since the Labor Party came to power in 1983 could only be described as appalling. In north Queensland, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen knows only too well because she has been up there a number of times, in the towns of Ravenshoe and Milla Milla on the tablelands, 3,000 jobs were destroyed; 12 sawmills were closed down. That area had been logged for 80 years. Sure, the area was not in its pristine condition but it was still there and it was still providing a base for 3,000 people who were drawing an income from that industry.

         A sum of $4.6 billion is involved in the processing of hardwood and paper pulping. In the sawmill industry $235m is being invested by 1,200 sawmills. Australia needs the timber industry and Australia needs the jobs that that industry provides. Australia needs import replacement, and it could have all of those if this Government accepted a commonsense approach. Because of the Government's refusal to accept the amendments, we will get less rather than more investment. Our sawmills are becoming uncompetitive against imported timbers. We are now importing 30 per cent of our domestic consumption, much of that coming from countries that are just clear-felling, ripping bulldozers through forests which will never be reproductive again.

         On 29 November 1991, the Government introduced this Bill, the Forest Conservation and Development Bill. In introducing the Bill, the Government thought there was some prospect of this Parliament hearing some rational debate on what clearly is a significant and important issue confronting Australia and this industry. But I must say that having listened to the more recent debates and the earlier debates on second reading, I have witnessed a contribution from the Opposition that has made it very clear that this chamber and Australia have lost the opportunity for a rational debate because of the irrational content of much of what the Opposition has said.

Because of this, the Government extended an invitation to the Opposition to meet and discuss the legislation prior to this second reading debate. But did the Opposition accept that invitation? The answer to that question, as the Opposition knows, is that it did not. Instead of an informed and rational debate, we have witnessed an ill-informed second reading debate on an issue of considerable national importance.

This Opposition, notwithstanding its facade of wanting to get major projects started in Australia, has adopted a duplicitous position of saying that it would on the one hand build Wesley Vale, but hypocritically is opposing this legislation which is so necessary to enable a northern Tasmanian pulp mill. Previous Government speakers have asked the Opposition these questions. Why is the Opposition forsaking the national interest for short term political expediency? Why will the Opposition not allow the world scale northern Tasmanian pulp mill project to proceed? The only answer to that question is that the Opposition is prepared to forsake the national interest because it mistakenly believes that there is short term political gain in adopting the position that it has.

         The Opposition's revised position can be summarised as these points: firstly, the legislation should allow for State forest industry investment programs which do not meet the $100m eligibility threshold; and secondly, the compensation provisions should be removed from the Bill and wood compensation arrangements provided through inter-governmental agreements.

         I would like to reaffirm the Government's position on each of these points. Concerning the first proposed amendment relating to the eligibility of forest industry investment programs, the Government fully appreciates the important role which the sawmilling sector plays in the industry and its concern to have secure access to forest resource. The Commonwealth will provide a legislative level of resource security for the sawmilling sector, provided it can form an enterprise to meet the eligibility criteria clearly specified in clauses 5 and 11 of the Bill.

         In addition to the legislation for the sawmilling sector, the Government intends to provide non-legislative resource security for investments which do not meet the $100m threshold. The arrangements to be offered by the Commonwealth through formal Commonwealth-State agreements are similar to the provisions in the legislation in that they include comprehensive, up-front assessment and provisions to accommodate changing circumstances of an exceptional nature.

         The type of project the Government envisages which could well use these arrangements is, for example, the hardwood sawmilling industry in the south east forests of New South Wales which at this stage cannot meet the $100m eligibility threshold. In this instance, the Commonwealth would require a number of provisions: that the enterprise must be willing to commit either to value adding investment or to industry restructuring; that the relevant State government must be prepared to offer a longer term, contractually based supply licence for sawlogs to enable the investment to proceed, such as has been the case in Victoria and Western Australia; and, thirdly, that the woodchip export company must have invested or be prepared to invest in other value adding activities in Australia, either in sawmilling enterprises or commercial plantations, and agree that domestic value adding of the woodchips has priority over their use for export.

         To the extent that the Commonwealth is involved in export licensing in the region concerned, it will offer a longer term export licence to the year 2000, and thereafter on a case by case basis, on the understanding that if the woodchips are required for domestic use then, subject to market consideration, they should be directed to that end. This should not detract from the Commonwealth's firm desire to achieve maximum domestic processing of woodchips by the year 2000 or soon thereafter.

         In relation to compensation, the Government believes that there are adequate provisions in the approaches outlined in the Bill to ensure that, even in the unlikely event of resource withdrawal, adequate resources would remain available for the projects.

         While the Bill explicitly rules out liability by the Commonwealth or a State to pay financial compensation, it does not prevent the provision of structural adjustment assistance, such as the Government has provided in the past in cases involving World Heritage listings of the forests of south-west Tasmania, the north Queensland rainforests and, most recently, in response to the cessation of logging on Fraser Island. Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislation which would preclude a State agreeing to make available alternative resources of equivalent quantity, quality and price in the event of the withdrawal of resources due to unforeseen circumstances.

         For all of those reasons, and based on what I have put in this closing debate to the Senate, the Government firmly believes that the legislation is sound public policy.

         —I do not propose to keep the Senate long because this measure, as I understand it, is to be voted upon tonight. I wish simply to indicate the way that I will be voting on this subject, and the way that I will be voting on the amendment moved by the Opposition.

         The Opposition's amendment has a number of features that recommend it to me. I wonder, though, whether it could not be adequately dealt with in the committee to which this Bill is going to be referred. My problem with it is that it indicates that the Bill should be withdrawn and introduced in an amended form. I do not see any reason to withdraw the Bill since it is going to a committee in any event and, as I understand it, is to be returned to this chamber not later than Thursday of next week. The Bill is here and, in my view, should not be withdrawn; we should persevere with attempts to improve the Bill in that committee and in the Committee of the Whole. Therefore, it is my intention not to vote for the amendment, but to vote for the Bill.

         In the final analysis, after all of the considerations are made by the committee, obviously one will have to consider this question in two ways. The first is the way it will impact on the industry generally within Australia. Obviously, one is elected here as an Australian senator to take the view of how legislation is going to impact on the nation as a whole. Secondly, one is also here representing the State from which one is elected, in particular. It has often been said that this is the States House, and it is important in respect of this legislation to recognise that, in the final analysis, my decision will depend on how I assess the impact of this measure on my own State of Tasmania, in particular.

         —I would like to make a few helpful comments to improve understanding about the industrial relations situation concerning APPM. The position is that the company has notified the unions concerned and all its employees that it has withdrawn unilaterally from all over-award agreements. However, the fact is that it will still provide several of the over-award benefits which had previously been the subject of those agreements, but only to existing employees. It is not proposing that future employees be granted those benefits.

        The point is that there was no doubt whatsoever that the company had withdrawn from all agreements. It is acknowledged that several of the conditions within those agreements were to continue for existing employees. I hope that this sensitivity to that point is a sign that the company does not intend to act in as much of a Rambo fashion as at first thought. If that is so, if that is a signal, that is good. All I would ask of the company is that it agree to sit down and talk with the unions as the workers' representatives. The unions have been, over some time, acting quite reasonably in discussing work practices and so forth at APPM and elsewhere.

         When I asked a question during Question Time earlier in the week, I referred to the company as one which was seeking government assistance. That is true. The company was pushing for resource security legislation. I will not transgress by referring to the earlier debate, but that is a fact that I will mention in passing. The company wanted that legislation, it wanted ministerial intervention in relation to its loss of the Telecom phone book paper contract. The company argued that it needed to pull out of these over-award agreements because of its costs and its need to become more efficient. That is not necessarily something that anyone would disagree with. But there is a way of going about that that ought to be more reasonable than the unilateral and confrontationist way in which the company has approached this.

         In relation to the Telecom phone book paper contract, I am told that the comparative figures for wages for a person at the Wesley Vale plant is $510 compared to $560 at ANM for the same job.

         I hope that this issue at APPM does not develop into a nasty dispute. There is the possibility of that happening. I am pleased that the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, has become personally involved in dealing with this matter. The ACTU is obviously taking seriously what could be a nasty dispute. I believe the unions concerned are acting very responsibly. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, has certainly acted appropriately in asking the Industrial Relations Commission to regard the matter as one subject to the public interest in the hope that the employer would agree to sit down and discuss the sorts of things that are on its mind about work practices, costs and so forth. The problem is that, on the face of it, the company is being highly confrontationist about it. It is in the same stable as the Peko-Robe River mine. It was the North Broken Hill Peko company which caused so much trouble several years ago.

         I think it is important, for a clear understanding of this dispute, that it be acknowledged that there has been this apparently confrontationist and unilateral withdrawal from agreements which were long established. As I said earlier, several of the conditions are to continue for existing employees. That seems to be out of the goodness of the company's heart, not because it has been subject to the agreement. The company has decided that itself because it does not intend to deal further with the parties to those agreements, being the unions representing the employees.

It has been conveyed to me that they were delighted with the report and would like to see it followed up in 1992.

         Australia has been slow in recognising the value of educational programs which are made available to adults who have returned after long breaks from formal study. In particular, women have benefited from this and represent 75 per cent of the clientele of this educational facility. It is important to the quality of life of adults of all ages to have access to such opportunities. It will benefit the productivity of our nation.

         Earlier, I mentioned some concerns about the omission from this report of the importance of the adult education program to women. There is a very high level of participation on the part of women, as I have already mentioned, and the benefits gained by women are substantial. Nonetheless, the organisers and administrators in this educational sector are not adequately recompensed for their work and the majority of them are women. The reality is that women in work in the community are still disadvantaged in comparison to men when it comes to fair and reasonable access to learning opportunities in adult life. I conclude by saying that I endorse the enlightened approach to education that this sector offers to the community as a whole, and to women in particular. It recognises the lifelong value of education and its aim of preserving, cultivating and stimulating our growth as human beings.

         —The speakers tonight have covered a range of subjects: Senator Boswell on trade; Senator Chamarette on women in the work force—a subject on which this Government has recently made a significant pronouncement; and Senator Coates on the question of APPM.

         I do not need to reply to all of the points made. But perhaps I should take this opportunity to say on the subject of APPM that earlier today Senator Watson asked me a question about this matter. I responded to that question. At the end of Question Time I added to my answer and I tabled my brief. Senator Watson in his question did pursue me, to some extent, on whether or not there was in the company's statement an undertaking by it after the cancellation of the over-award agreements to maintain benefits for a 25 per cent over-award payment, a shorter working week where it currently applies, redundancy payments and superannuation arrangements.

         As I think is my responsibility, when I returned to my office I inquired of my Department as to the claims by Senator Watson which were, to large extent, borne out by the letters given to me by Senator Devereux as I was responding to the debate. I asked my Department, firstly, whether it is true that those matters were maintained despite the cancellation of the agreement by the company and, if it were true, why they were not included in my brief when I answered in this place.

         The response has been that the Department was aware of those matters. The officers did not include them in the brief because they believed that the report, contained in the letters of the company to the unions, that the over-award agreements were cancelled, was in fact, on the plain face of it, true; that those agreements will not exist after the 30 days have expired; and that the then extension by the company of those four conditions was another matter again—another matter again which has been, I understand, in submissions before the commission and further modified to refer only to those current employees and not any new employees who would be engaged.

There is an apprehension that there may be a dispute because the unions are concerned that a major industrial event in Australia is being emulated in Tasmania. Whether they are rightly or wrongly concerned, they are saying that they are concerned. That goes to the question of the apprehension that there will be an industrial dispute.

         The whole issue was raised by Senator Watson as a matter of fact. The Minister said one thing, when the facts were another. Indeed, once we got into the debate we had Senator Crane again raise the issue of Robe River, on which the Minister misled the Senate, and we had again Senator Panizza, whose name the Minister besmirched. Senator Panizza asked for an apology, and that is not forthcoming either.

The Minister apparently thinks it is adequate to come into this chamber and say, `Because I misled the Senate you cannot blame me because it was all my advisers' fault'. If the Minister thinks that is good enough, the rest of the Senate does not. I still wait for the Minister to have the decency to apologise for having got it wrong.

        (1) The extent of post-tax changes to consumption and production decisions from hypothetical pre-tax positions depends on the own-price and the cross-price elasticities of demand and supply among all goods and services. This is a complex empirical question. Moreover, whether such effects are seen as distortions is in part a normative issue.

        (2) One cannot be certain, because of the complicated empirical and normative issues mentioned in (1), whether a uniform rate of tax on all goods and services would increase national production or improve the operation of the market. A further consideration to be borne in mind is that uniformly taxing all goods and services has not been achieved in any jurisdiction, and the administration costs of such an approach would need to be offset against any possible allocative efficiency gains from more uniform taxation of a broader base. Further, important equity issues have to be weighed in designing any taxation structures.

        (3) The existing sales tax can be expected to impact less heavily on services than on the production of those goods directly subject to sales tax, although a significant proportion of goods are exempt from sales tax. While the wholesale sales tax does not directly tax the output of the services sector, the service sector does bear the sales tax on any of its taxable inputs. As shown in Press Release No. P36 of 1 December 1991 by the then Treasurer, the contribution of the sales tax to the costs of service industries is typically of the same order of magnitude as for the goods-producing industries. Whether the resulting pattern of production is considered `supra' or `sub' optimal would depend on the complex empirical and normative issues noted above.

        (1) At January 1992 there were some 44,100 war widow pensioners whose rate of Social Security pension was being paid at the rate payable before 1 November 1986.

        (2) War widow pensioners with dependent children could, depending upon their private income and place of residence, receive a greater total amount of income support by surrendering their war widows pension and claiming sole parent pension in lieu, since the rate of Social Security guardian allowance ($28.70 per fortnight) exceeds the rate of Veterans' Affairs domestic allowance ($24.00 per fortnight) and sole parent pensioners may qualify for remote area allowance ($14.00 plus $7.00 per child per fortnight). War widows would need to have little or no other income above the Social Security income test free area to benefit from these arrangements. War widow pension is income-test-free. Although no information on numbers in this situation is available, total costs would be relatively small, especially since there are likely to be very few war widows with this combination of circumstances and war widow pensioners are free to seek Social Security payments if it is to their advantage. Most war widows are better off receiving war widow pension.
