       Senator Button has tabled an arrogant, two-paragraph letter refusing to accede to the Senate's instruction to table the note for file by two Treasury officers on the New Zealand experience with a goods and services tax. In this letter, Senator Button has not even deigned to spell out in any detail his argument for not complying with the Senate's order. We have to look at Senator Button's answer to the Senate on Monday to discern the reasons. On Monday, Senator Button told the Senate that the reason the note could not be tabled was that it contained confidential discussions between Australian and New Zealand officials. He then relied on Treasury advice, apparently, that releasing any more of the report would damage Australia's continuing interest in obtaining information from foreign governments and from non-official sources. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has apparently accepted that advice.

        Having told us how important this particular document was, Senator Button then went on to try to convince the Senate that it was of no particular consequence at all. Of course, we can recall the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, saying on the same day, `Who cares what the Treasury thinks?'. We could go on and say, `Who cares about the facts? Don't let the facts influence debate. Don't let anything compromise the Government's scare campaign'.

        Senator Button demeaned the Treasury officers by implying they had no particular expertise in reporting on the impact of the GST and its public acceptance. In my view, the more that governments try to suppress papers, the more that governments convince the people there is something highly embarrassing to hide. What a tangled web we weave when first we set out to deceive.

        Senator Button implies that the paper is inconsequential, yet the Government is determined that it will not be released to the public. Honourable senators will recall that a few short months ago the Senate demanded that the Marshall Islands papers be tabled. There were volumes of them. In the Kelly tape saga, the Government, after protest, produced a transcript of the relevant part of the tape, and even then the Government was censured by the Senate. Recently, the Senate forced a report on Medicare fraud to be made available. This was also produced to a Senate committee.

        Mr President, you have to go back to the loans affair of 1975 to find a case where the government has flatly refused to produce a document to the Senate. Of course, we know the background to that particular scandal.

        What is so special about these papers—this note for file—which did not apply in the Marshall Islands papers case that Senator Evans delivered to this chamber? As you can recall, Mr President, the Marshall Islands papers dealt with private correspondence, notes of conversations with government officials of a foreign country, memoranda, notes between senior officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and, of course, sensitive cables.

The rules which applied in respect of the Marshall Islands papers—papers which, I suggest, had serious consequences for this Government, and Senator Richardson can confirm that, and for the Government of the Marshall Islands—do not apparently apply, to use Senator Button's terms, to this inconsequential Treasury note, which he believes could damage Australia's ability to obtain information from foreign countries.

        If the ceaseless public attacks by Mr Keating and the Labor Party advertisements attacking New Zealand have not damaged relations between our two countries, what a fantastic notion it is to assume that this note has the potential to damage those relations. I happen to be a Victorian. Senator McMullan will be interested to know that the Labor Party, with its TV advertisements which were so highly successful in the Victorian election, spent the first week of its campaign attempting to tell lies, do damage to and spread deceit about the situation in New Zealand.

        In this chamber Senator Button said, again with some twisted logic, that he had not even read the Treasury note, which was very convenient, I must say. But, at the same time, he believed that the headline in the

        How else to explain Mr Keating's amazing performance over the Treasury paper on the effect of the GST in New Zealand? The study was commissioned in September last year, when Mr Keating was Treasurer in the Hawke Government. Obviously it was meant to provide ammunition against the Opposition's GST proposals for Australia. (And if it had, no doubt we would never have heard the end of it.)

       Even so, the paper represents a powerful contradiction of the line Mr Keating has been pushing on the perils of the GST. In the face of even the limited disclosure of the Treasury paper, he has reacted with uncharacteristic panic and confusion. He who has so often sought to bolster his own policies with evidence of Treasury support now says: "Who cares what Treasury thinks?" He who was presumably happy to see a Treasury team sent to gather information in New Zealand last year now says: "Frankly, as if you'd go to a Treasury team for a public view about New Zealand. I mean, the Treasury, whatever it is, it's not a public relations firm. . .

        The Government is not afraid of damaging its relations with New Zealand; it is afraid of something Mr Keating regards as being of greater importance. Mr Keating's fear is that the Government's lies and deceit on the GST will be exposed; that is why the Government is refusing to table this document today. This is the document the Australian people had to have. This is the document which contradicts Keating's scare campaign. We will seek further ways to ensure that this document is exposed to public view. The coalition does not accept this letter. We will continue by all possible means to secure the release of this document.

The fact of the matter is that one does not have to read the document to know the consequence of its release. It is quite straightforward. The arguments as to why it should not be released, which have been put by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and me in this place, still stand. They relate to the way in which the information in the document was gained and the implications not just for our relations with New Zealand but for our relations with every country with which we have confidential discussion. Those relationships will be undermined by any indication that the Senate can, by mere resolution, require the tabling of documents that may be contrary to the public interest and that may do damage to our relationships with other countries.

        It is absolutely true, as this Senate has resolved, that the freedom of information rules do not explicitly constrain the material that is presented to the Parliament. The Senate has resolved that, and there is no disagreement about it. But it is also true that where the element of the FOI principle that applies relates to the national interest, it is a fact  which government at least has to take into account and, I would have thought, the Senate would wish to take into account. If somebody wishes to argue that the national interest principles of FOI—to put it very broadly—have not been properly applied, then the forums to resolve that exist. If people want to examine it, they can choose to do so if they wish. That is not a matter for the Government to determine. It is a matter for the people who seek the information.

Every opportunity that the Australian people can get to debate the GST, we will take—here, in the public arena, anywhere. The Australian people are working out what they think about the GST, as the people of New Zealand are. The Government in New Zealand is rating even lower than the Opposition is rating in Australia.

        . There are important issues around about Liberal governments sacking people. Let us talk about those issues, issues that people are concerned about. Or let us talk about the substance of the GST, about what impact it will have on Australians, about the concerns of the unemployed about the impact of other aspects of Fightback. Let us get on with the business. If the Opposition wants to take note of the letter, of course we do not object. We will vote for that. But we will not be tabling the document for the reasons outlined.

In doing so, I express the disgust of those in the Liberal and National parties—and I am sure I speak for the Australian Democrats and the Independents as well; in fact, for all people in Australia who treasure democracy—at the outrage this Government perpetrates in the way it treats resolutions of a duly elected chamber of this Parliament. The Parliament asks the Government to do something. The Government simply ignores it and throws in the face of the elected people, of democracy, its refusal to comply with properly worded and properly passed resolutions of the Senate.

It is no wonder that the Government chose its most junior person to respond to this debate. It is fairly obvious why Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, came into the chamber but left straight away. He did not want to be embarrassed by this tragedy of democracy being perpetrated today. Senator Button was not prepared to stand here and face a refusal by the Government to comply with this request of the Senate.

        This Government is the most incompetent, ignorant and insensitive government that this nation has ever known. I call it a government. That is almost a misnomer.

Mr Keating has done anything but that. He has given an inordinate amount of unhappiness and unpleasantness to most Australians by putting almost two million of our fellow Australians out of work.

        This Government has been incompetent in its management. After 10 years, it has no solution. It has presided over the worst recession in Australia since the 1930s. It has no policy, no vision, and no idea of what needs to be done; it has taken a bandaid approach. There are almost two million unemployed or underemployed, a $162 billion national debt and record bankruptcies. People are simply giving up hope in this period before Christmas. I paled, as no doubt did many others, when I heard Mr Keating on the weekend trying to obtain some credibility by announcing that he was giving money to the poor. He is not giving money to the poor.

        The Labor Party will not allow the Treasury paper on the GST experience in New Zealand to be published. It is simply more of the campaign of Labor lies. It is not the first time that the Labor Party has not been well served by the Treasury. The Labor Party was running around saying that the GST will cost everybody 15 per cent more to live. Treasury quickly put paid to that lie of the Labor Party by saying, `The coalition's estimate of 4.4 per cent increase in the cost of living is wrong'—but it is wrong on the high side.

        I will quote Sir Roger Douglas, someone who, I think, comes from the same Keating school of economics because he, like Mr Keating, thinks that the GST is a good proposal.

       We introduced a goods and services tax which certainly put the price up of a lot of items, but some actually came down because we were removing wholesale tax. It's much the same as you'll be doing in Australia. . . But on the other hand, personal income tax came off. So, in New Zealand, it was very popular. We went from about 35 per cent support for GST prior to its introduction, to something like 65 per cent within the month of its introduction, because people felt good about it.

       Sir Roger is a member of the Labour Party. The New Zealand Labour Party introduced it. He knows why it was introduced, as does Mr Keating. That is why I think they must have gone to the same economics school. He and Mr Keating understand why it is needed. He said:

It is laid out to consider Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) together, where appropriate. For some departments there is an appropriation under both and, for the others, just the appropriation that is relevant. It would certainly help the smooth running of this morning's procedures if we followed the running sheet appropriately. It would also be helpful if we go through the running sheet so that we know where we are. The first Department we will look at is the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. I ask for any questions on program 1 before we move to program 1.1.

         —The Bills currently before the Committee of the Whole have been returned after consideration by Estimates Committee B. They seek to reallocate $150m in the current financial year which was previously earmarked in the One Nation statement and allocated in this year's Budget for rail projects, and also seek to reallocate $24m intended to be provided for electricity infrastructure. These funds are to be allocated to other infrastructure and short term job creation projects within the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, the Department of Transport and Communications, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.

         These Bills really mean that the much vaunted One Nation policy statement from February of this year, which was this Government's election manifesto, is once and for all dead and buried, that the August Budget has been blown apart before the ink has even dried on the Budget Papers, and that, as was admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) in the Estimates Committee hearing, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has replaced micro-economic reform, which is urgently needed to create real long term sustainable jobs, with short term political expediency by throwing dollars around in the departments to which I referred a few moments ago to create some short term mickey mouse make-work jobs which will evaporate after the election.

         While the Labor Party undoubtedly seems to understand the pressing need for decisive and critical change, election year frenzy sees it game planning so that next year we will see yet another trumped up accord with the Party's union backers with little real reform being achieved. It is fair to say that it is not only the Opposition which is critical of this failed Government's inadequate foray into reform; the report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade entitled

          Australia's business challenge: South-East Asia in the 1990s
         </emphasis>
         , produced by the Department's East Asia analytical unit, also seriously challenges the extent of Prime Minister Keating's commitment to tangible reform. It has come hot on the heels of the Industry Commission report which similarly criticises the speed of the Government's reform agenda. That Industry Commission report asserts most strongly that further gains are still needed in transport and on the waterfront, but this Government, through this legislation, is ripping out a substantial allocation for the current financial year from the land transport sector.

         The head of the Government's own micro-economic reform think tank, Industry Commission Chairman Bill Scales, actually named specific government services such as transport, power and the labour market as the top reform priorities. Yet, as we heard in that Estimates Committee hearing, the funds are being ripped from transport and power this year to be spent on other vote winning measures. In the light of the Government's claims that it is pursuing the micro-economic reform agenda, such reforms are seriously imperiled by this reallocation of funds, as are its claims that the reallocation is necessary following its review of the progress of expenditure allocated to infrastructure projects in the Budget to ensure the goals of its One Nation document are met.

         The excuses that were offered in the Estimates Committee hearings for siphoning off these funds from much needed reform areas were far from convincing. What we have is $150m being extracted from important land transport programs fundamental to transport reform across the country and given to other programs, and next financial year the same amount will be returned to land transport.

         The Government claims that logistical and design delays, as well as a changed demand for labour market programs, have prevented the full allocation of the $283m to the national rail system. But these lame excuses fly in the face of the Government's pace setting of micro-economic reform strategies. Recent bad balance of payments figures are quick to show that the need for pressing reforms remains crucial and nowhere more urgent than in the area of labour market reform.

         At the hearing last Friday, in responding to my questioning, Senator McMullan admitted that indeed these changes in funding arrangements were a setback to micro-economic reform as they would slow down the pace of reform.

        So there it is writ large. Micro-economic reform, which is so essential to increase our exports to reduce the massive $180 billion burden of foreign debt, to restart our economy and, above all, to create real long term jobs, is to be put on the backburner—to be sacrificed—so that the money can be used to create the short term illusion that unemployment is falling for cynical electoral purposes; the hope that it will win enough votes to return this destructive Government to another undeserved term in office.

You will suffer even more than you have suffered through this continuing recession that we had to have'. The Government's own bible for remaining in office, One Nation, offers free and open competition as being the engine which drives efficiency to be achieved through micro-economic reform.

         It further refers to micro-economic reform being the basic determinant of Australia's international competitiveness, essential to minimising the impact of our geographical isolation and the location of our national resources. One Nation went to great and laborious pains to stress the importance of having a first class, nationally linked rail network, and its supposed far-sighted content has long been echoed by the Prime Minister.

         Even the annual report of the Department of Transport and Communications, which was tabled only last week, highlights the $454m investment program to increase efficiency between rail and sea transport and to improve road-rail facilities. We are now told that this will be put on the backburner for 12 months. What happens to the Government's supposed grand concerns about the urgent necessities of introducing micro-economic reform? The Prime Minister's televised claims on 18 November that micro-economic reform is just about completed and that we do not have to concern ourselves about getting the Federal Budget back into structural surplus are absolute nonsense. This is demonstrated by the huge current account deficit, which has so far averaged $1.7 billion a month this financial year.

         Far from slowing down the pace and tapering off, at least in this financial year, as the Prime Minister is doing by removing this specific allocation from land transport and allocating it to the other departments, we need to move more quickly on structural reform. The reason we need to do so is brought out in the Industry Commission's annual report. The  Chairman, Bill Scales, has made the point well that to pause now with structural reform will undermine the process of change that is required to tackle underlying and persistent unemployment in Australia.

         The Government cannot afford to dally any longer. It must urgently build on previous structural and micro-economic reforms to deliver economic growth, jobs and higher standards of living. It must concentrate on delivering long term jobs which will be here in the future—not mickey mouse choices for training programs, not options which shunt the unemployed from one dispenser of money to another and not options which hide the real unemployed or which disguise the terrible disfigurement this community suffers because the Government declines to accept the reality that it is not creating real employment.

         This Government, with the launch of its One Nation plan, which it still hopes will save its bacon, is in the disguise business. It disguises unemployment figures by inventing a whole raft of courses and programs to temporarily provide respite for thousands of jobless. This is so those on training programs will not swell the true unemployment figure and the Government can say that unemployment has tapered off. Unemployment will be brought down only with appropriate policies which tackle micro-economic reform issues and assist in the restructuring of industries already overburdened with restrictive unproductive practices. The invention of temporary stopgap measures merely prolongs the agony of those waiting for the scenario to improve. This nation is in need of uncompromising hard action, and it needs that right now.

         With unemployment remaining high and a Federal election just around the corner, the spectacle of the Government dallying with fiscal stimuli and promising much in the way of economic growth is grim indeed. Australia simply cannot afford this cynical short term posturing for perceived political gain. Australia has to become a more flexible, efficient producer and, according to the Industry Commission, we can. The economy can grind up and our industries can grab a faster share of world markets without exacerbating inflation or running into the brick wall of balance of payments constraints.

         For the Prime Minister to claim that Australia is locked into the fastest growing part of the world and that our more open economic system is off and running is clearly nonsense. His further claim that all we had to do was to get the recovery phase moving and that our position in the 1990s from a low inflationary base was going to be very attractive are also quite overrated. The only inroads this Government has made in the micro-economic reform area have been essentially to place it on the public agenda and bring it to people's attention. But this is only a precursor to the reform process. Such limitations are obvious.

         The centralised control of the labour market has remained virtually intact. There are some improved efficiencies from the partial reform of the waterfront, but they have not been passed on to service users. The reform of telecommunications and aviation remains unbalanced. A duopoly arrangement will remain in place until 1997 and, with respect to airline deregulation, foreign carriers are prevented from competing on domestic markets. In other spheres, such as postal services, Labor retains monopolies in areas crucial to the effective operation of business.

         I return to my opening remarks that Labor has not adequately addressed road and rail inefficiencies. This ripping off of funding which was earlier allocated to rectify pressure in these two areas is nothing short of confirming that the Government is not at all serious about keeping up the pace of long overdue reform. It is deliberately slowing down the pace. The Federal election is just around the corner and, with a government which cannot demonstrate its total commitment to fast-tracking the micro-economic reform agenda to sustain the long term interests of this country, fortunately it will soon be the Federal Opposition.

         A number of points are related to the fundamental question we are discussing this morning; that is, where the $150m is being spent and why it is not being spent on the projects for which it was originally set aside. Senator Chapman made great play of the Industry Commission's report, which clearly he has not read. He is simply commenting on the press reports that emanated from that report, most of which were inaccurate. If Senator Chapman had read the Industry Commission report, he would know that the Commission not only gave credit to the Government's micro-economic reform program in the transport and communications area, but also talked about the dividend that Australia has received from it—and the Commission used the word `dividend'. Those areas that the Commission rightly identified as needing much greater reform were fundamentally those areas that require cooperation between the Federal and State jurisdictions. That is at base the reason why these appropriations have had to be altered.

         I know that this is distasteful to the coalition. I know that the coalition approached this debate from an uncompromising position—using the words of Senator Chapman, who said that the electorate needs uncompromising policies. I know that the coalition is led by a man who asserts those views—Dr John `if you get rid of the GST you will have to get rid of me' Hewson. I know that there will be no compromise on the part of Dr Hewson in respect of the policies that he is putting to the electorate. There will be no leapfrogging or backflipping—and I quote Senator Chapman again—in short term political expediency. They will press ahead without changing one jot or tittle of the proposals that they as an alternative government put to the electorate.

         But one of the fundamental problems with that policy, one of the cruelest lies that Fightback tells—its fundamental fraud—is contained in its employment projections. That is totally relevant to the debate here this morning because those employment projections are not based on an analysis of the Fightback proposals at all.

         In fact, even on the most optimistic scenario, the employment projection tables in Fightback are not two million jobs by the year 2000; they are, in fact, 1.6 million. But that is okay; those opposite just tack another 400,000 jobs on the top of that. But the most extraordinary thing about those projections is that they are not based on any analysis of the coalition's proposals as an alternative government. They are based, as the document tells us when we read the fine print at the bottom of the page, on an analysis of the Industry Commission reports we are talking about in debate this morning.

         An economist on my staff rang Access Economics. This was all public. My economist was not the only person who noticed this fraud. Indeed, a number of major Australian economic analysts saw it and wrote about it—Ross Gittins was one, from memory. The economist from my staff rang a fellow economist at Access Economics and said to him, `How could you have made employment projections in Fightback that are not based on an analysis of the proposals and, in particular, that did not take into account the imposition of a GST?'—which, of course, is the centrepiece in terms of revenue collection. I think today it is designed to raise something like $28 billion a year—of course, what it would raise after 18 December is something else entirely.

         The point I was making before is that the Commission rightly points to the requirement for much more reform. The reform required is correctly identified in the Industry Commission report. It is principally identified as those areas that require cooperation and agreement between the Federal Government and the States under our federal system of government. Indeed, one of the major thrusts of this Government's agenda in its fifth term in the portfolio of Transport and Communications will be to place far more attention on areas such as port authority operations, on the interface between the ports and the land system, where much of this inefficiency—as the Industry Commission report rightly determines—still remains.

         The fact is that one of the major reasons for the delays in these moneys being expended in the way in which they were laid out in the One Nation statement was the failure of the Western Australian Liberal Party, separate from its colleagues, the National Party in Western Australia, to support the establishment of the National Rail Freight Corporation—an initiative that is a hundred years too late for Australia. It was the dogmatic opposition by the Western Australian Liberals that held that initiative up for months. Not even their National colleagues would support that stand in Western Australia. I regret to say that the National Party Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Wal Murray, has taken the same head in the sand attitude in relation to road reform by opposing a sensible national road system in this country, which everyone else seems to support.

         There was no cleverness in the blatant abuse of the Standing Orders by Senator Collins, who spent 10 minutes attacking Fightback, attacking its employment projections and attacking the GST, none of which, basically, had anything to do with the matters before the chamber. I sought from the Chairman exactly the same lenience as he had given—on reflection, totally improperly—to Senator Collins, giving him scope to spend that time attacking the Fightback package.

         It is intolerable for a Minister to be given the opportunity to attack the coalition's policies without the coalition being given the opportunity to respond. It is on the basis of fairness, decency and the right of proper debate that I should be allowed to respond. I certainly do not intend to take 15 minutes; Senator Collins could be demolished in five. He failed to mention the fact that the GST exists basically to provide part of the funding for the removal of seven taxes, all of which are taxes on employment. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said that payroll tax costs 250,000 jobs. Senator Collins did not have the honesty to admit that that is one of the taxes that will be removed.

         Senator Collins's double standards are incredible. He is so `flexible' that even before the Budget is passed, he is changing it in this way and switching money out of failed programs. Yet he attacks the Opposition as being `inflexible' and `hard' when we suggest that the economy has now deteriorated so disastrously that further measures will be needed. The Minister's double standards are a disgrace. Quite frankly, the sooner we get the opportunity to debate this matter fairly in the real chamber—that is, outside the Senate, if it is to be run like this—and the sooner we get the chance to debate it in an election, the better.

The establishment of a tax deductible foundation would cut by half the cost to government of achieving those goals because it would simply provide the tax deductions which would cost half of what it would if the Government had to provide all the funds rather than private people providing those funds on a tax deductible donation basis.

The level of deterioration that is occurring there is a matter about which both Senator Chapman and I have expressed concern. We note from the Estimates hearing that the revenue to be raised by admission fees to this exhibition—the fit-out for which will cost $1.25m—is simply to go towards replacing the cost of about $1m worth of maintenance that is funded entirely by the Commonwealth at the moment.

         In other words, the revenue from using the old Parliament House will not go towards doing anything extra to preserve or restore it in any way. It is simply to replace some of the appropriation of about $1m being used to maintain it inadequately. That is the point I want to stress. The roughly $1m per year being spent on the old Parliament House does not maintain it adequately, according to all the available evidence. I understand that it is continuing to deteriorate and leaks are not being fixed. Senator Chapman is nodding, and that emerged from the evidence, as I understand it.

         This rate of deterioration is so great that the ultimate cost of finally refurbishing the building and getting it to a proper maintenance level has increased in recent years from $48m to $60m. I admit that included in that $60m is the cost of removing some of the later additions to the building, but what concerns us on this side of the chamber is that the $1m currently allocated is not adequately meeting the needs of maintaining this historic building properly and that further deterioration is taking place. It seems unreasonable that the extra revenue to be gained from this exhibition is not to be used to increase the capacity to do something to restore what is certainly Australia's most historic political building.

         There were those in this Parliament and this Government who were keen to see the building deteriorate even further to justify their ultimate decision, they hoped, to bulldoze it because the view of or from this Parliament House building was somehow rendered less attractive by the existence of this historic former Parliament House. That is not a view shared by the Opposition. We are totally opposed to any suggestion that that building be bulldozed. It is vital that it be restored, and restored properly. We regret that it has deteriorated so dramatically since the Government made its decision not adequately to fund its maintenance.

         In the ACT it is our policy and vision that tourism will ever increase and create jobs in this region of the Commonwealth of Australia. Tourism is one of Canberra's growing assets. It is one industry that we will be fostering, and one of the things that bring people to Canberra is the old Parliament House, which is probably one of the most historic buildings in Australia. It is historic for very many reasons. One that always appeals to me is that it was the venue of those momentous times when a previous Labor Government was got rid of. It is almost a shrine that many people come to for that reason alone to pay homage and thanks that those events happened there 20 years ago.

It is a much smaller building, but nevertheless an extremely interesting historical exhibit which is well frequented by tourists and Australians who are particularly interested in the political history of this country.

It is a thick wad of documents which contains among its pages a list of projects under the black spot program. It was one of the issues I raised in the Estimates hearing. I sought a full list of the black spot projects that would be funded through the additional funds provided in Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4. I ask whether the list that has been provided in these papers is a full list of projects, including those resulting from the additional funds, or whether it is the list which was approved prior to the reallocation of moneys. I notice that the press releases and so on which are attached to the list are dated in September, which would lead to the conclusion that the projects were the original projects approved, not the additional projects.

         —Before I ask my question, I will make a brief comment on what Senator Collins had to say about why the National Rail Corporation had been held up. Senator Collins should know as well as I do that the Labor Government in Western Australia was equally concerned about the agreement that Western Australia may or may not enter into to form the National Rail Corporation. In fact, the Western Australian Minister for Transport, Pam Beggs, expressed concern many times as to what that arrangement might be. The Western Australian Government was equally to blame. I do not blame the Government or the Opposition for the stand it took. Now that they are happy with the situation—they have an escape clause if they do not see that things are going right after six months—they have signed the agreement.

         I reiterate that the Government had the numbers in the lower House, yet it did not attempt to ram the legislation through in a short period. It waited to see what came out of discussions and, finally, all the parties agreed—some earlier than others—on how it should go. Minister Collins was a bit unfair in attacking the Liberal Party, and the Liberal Party alone, for holding up that agreement in Western Australia.

         However, in reallocating money away from rail, the main blame—and this is nothing to do with Western Australia—was placed on the lack of design or the fact that design and logistics were behind schedule. I ask the Minister how that could be, because preliminary design and logistic studies must have been carried out before anywhere near this amount of money might have been allocated. I cannot see why the Government, in moving away from the One Nation package, should blame the engineering section when it should have been on track—pardon the pun.

         —His question goes to the very heart of what this Government is doing with the One Nation spending, to my great delight as an Australian. Regrettably, the facts are that there has been no major capital injection into rail systems for a very long time indeed. What we stated was not a criticism of engineering departments at all; it was simply a statement of the sad fact that, until the very welcome initiatives that were taken in the One Nation statement to try to give this country, for the first time, a truly national rail freight system—after a hundred years of doing it wrongly—many of the corridor studies that are essential for the proper expenditure of the money had not been completed.

         That is not, in any sense, a reflection on the ability or the diligence of the engineering departments. It is a reflection on the failure of governments generally to put any significant capital injection of this nature into a national rail system. For that reason, those studies had not been done. They are being expedited now with the changes that were being taken in this package, which have been largely overlooked, in terms of reallocating this funding and getting the corridors approved. One essential part of that process is happening in the State of Victoria. The Victorian State Government is determining the alternative routes and where the track will go, as part of that national system in Victoria.

That is not just a matter, important as it is, of the employment that will be generated; it is fundamentally a matter of getting what we finally all want, that is, a standard gauge rail system that will run, in the first instance, at least, from Brisbane to Perth, connecting all our major freight corridors in Australia on a single national rail freight system.

It is significantly possible for something to create employment without being an employment program. It is obvious and self-evident that this program will create a lot of employment. That does not mean that its primary or sole focus is employment or particular unemployed people. It will create economic stimulus in regions, and most logically therefore in regions of highest unemployment because that is where the stimulus is most required.

This was done with the expectation that across the projects the average labour component would represent about 30 per cent of the expenditure on the program. In terms of the work being done at a rate of some $16,000 per year, that would represent some 13,000 six-monthly job opportunities generated by the program. That is how that figure was arrived at.

         As Senator Tierney would know, the Office of Local Government has now estimated, based on the sample of 56 councils in New South Wales, that the program will generate approximately 17,000 six-monthly job units over the two financial years. Obviously, with each project the jobs that are generated or sustained by the expenditure will be of different duration. But that is how the figure was originally arrived at. It has been refined in light of the New South Wales sample.

         —I think the term `generation' has to be seen in the context of the project. What was undertaken to be achieved—and which is being achieved to an even greater extent—was that local community infrastructure projects of enduring benefit which would otherwise not have been undertaken, because local ratepayers could not fund those particular projects, would be undertaken. Those projects are being undertaken and those infrastructure and community facilities are being constructed and, in the course of that, of course, jobs are being generated. The 13,000—or 17,000 as it is now thought to be—six-monthly job opportunities that are being funded would not have been available and would not have been undertaken apart from this expenditure. So it has generated that amount of employment activity. Whilst it is impossible to get all the figures from the councils broken down in the way that Senator Tierney would wish to see in great elaborate detail, the language used is appropriate to what has occurred.

The program was not meant to be one of those schemes which cynically manipulated the CES offices by simply saying, `Roll in people off the unemployment lists'. It was not that sort of blatant exercise which could have properly attracted criticism. It was designed in a different way. There is no doubt that in some areas day labourers will be taken on into council gangs and subcontractors will take on people in order to build a community facility. There will be other situations where, as Senator Tierney quite rightly pointed out, rather than day labourers being put off or subcontractors having to get rid of a person because they have no work currently, people will be kept on. In that situation, Senator Tierney's observation is correct, although the exact balance in any one municipality will differ from the one next-door.

It is a measurement which is also objective and can apply over municipalities—this anticipates some of the questions that might be raised by Senator Panizza or Senator Macdonald—which fall within a wide variety of Federal electorates where we certainly did not want to bear the accusation of any sort of political bias.

         The criterion was selected in an objectively defensible way by looking at the rate of unemployment in municipalities above the average rate of unemployment. One of several measurements of the relative lack of economic activity in an area is the unemployment figures, and that is why it was chosen.

If the program was not directed at job creation, what does the Minister have to say to those councils which have below average unemployment but under the way this program was funded did not receive a cent? Can the Minister understand why perhaps the council at Ku-ring-gai in Sydney did not receive a cent from all these different programs? People are unemployed in Ku-ring-gai, although not as many as in Bankstown, yet there is no assistance under this program to get unemployment down or, as the Minister has indicated, to maintain the current levels of programs by providing capital works in those areas that would support employment which already exists.

Of course, they are benefiting from the better cities program and other programs of expenditure which will stimulate economic activity in those regions in coming years. They realise that this is just one program amongst many being pursued by the Government which can stimulate construction and other economic activity in their regions.

Naturally, if there is high unemployment, it is likely that spending patterns and the circulation of goods and services paid for within a municipal region will be adversely affected by relatively greater unemployment than in a neighbouring municipality which has relatively better unemployment figures. I suppose a variety of indicators or criteria could be taken. This was a reasonable one to take and, in any case, was the criterion selected and applied to this program.

Not only have individual councils complained, but also, as a general rule,  peak bodies have written to the Government complaining about the inherent unfairness of the scheme; complaining not about the people who have benefited as a result of the scheme, but about the fact that it was simply unfair.

         —We have had that shift in ground. Later Senator Tate might be able to explain why the ground has shifted so much. Since the beginning, I have expressed the view that although I disagree with the allocation of money to individual councils, I have no argument with the allocation itself because it creates activity. I have said all along that the money would go to people already employed via contractors or into materials. Nothing Senator Tate has said has disproved that.

         After Senator Tate shifted ground further, he went on to say that the money was there to stimulate the economy. I ask Senator Tate: is there not a simpler way of stimulating the economy than by upsetting certain councils of Australia through allocating money to some and not to others? I can point to four marginal Federal seats in Western Australia where money has been allocated because this Government is trying to hold the seats, and another four seats in other States which were allocated money because the Government is trying to either hold the seats or win them back after it lost them in the last election. Would it not have been far simpler to even it out over all of the local governments in Australia, even if they are just above or below that line? Wanneroo—in the electorate of Moore which is held by Paul Filing—got zero. Alongside that, the electorate of Stirling, which is held by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, got $5m.

I ask the Minister once again: when will we get some definite figures—even with regard to sustaining jobs, let alone creating them? The Minister has shifted ground from `creating' to `sustaining', so I suppose we cannot get him any other way. When will the Minister tell us how many jobs have been created and how many jobs have been sustained?

It is just borrowing it, ticking it up on the international Bankcard. The Government says, `Get us over the election. Let the kids and grandkids pay for it in the next generation'. Bearing that in mind, instead of just spending $345m, why did we not spend a couple of billion dollars? That would have not just kept the job level as it is but it might have got a few more people employed. If the scenarios I have painted are correct, why did we not do that?

         So I do not accept the blanket description of the job situation that flows under this program that Senator Macdonald put forward. But that is not really his major point because we have been through that; we have rehearsed that all morning. Senator Macdonald asks why the Government did not spend another $2 billion on this particular program if we think it is so good. This is a fiscally responsible government. We have decided to give this stimulus to local areas where they need to see economic activity generated at a greater level than would otherwise be the case. It would not be responsible simply to throw another $2 billion at municipalities. Therefore, this figure was arrived at as part of an overall package in the Budget. I believe that it is justifiable. I do not believe that $2 billion would have been justifiable and, for that reason, no doubt it was never considered.

Mr Chairman, so far as Senator Macdonald was concerned, you made the very astute observation that his question was very much along the same lines as the question which he posed immediately before and which I answered. The moneys that we have provided within the Budget for this particular project were considered to be a responsible allocation of funds. To provide money in the dimensions that Senator Macdonald referred to in his previous version of the question would not have been responsible, and for that reason the Government did not pursue it.

I can see the embarrassment that is caused by having to answer some of these difficult questions. There are two particular issues which I raised before Estimates B to which I still have not got a clear answer. I would like to test Senator Tate to see whether an answer has come forward. If Senator Tate has had a chance to read the transcript, he will know that there was enormous confusion in Estimates B—Mr Calvert and Senator McMullan were there—as to how many jobs were to be created.

The fact is that we have answered this question by describing how the Budget figure was put together, based on the expectation of 30 per cent of the expenditure being spent on employment. At a rate of $16,000 per annum, that worked out at about 13,000 six-month job units. Since then a study has been undertaken by the New South Wales Municipal Association in which I think some 56 councils participated. The conclusion to be drawn from that is that some 17,000 six-month job opportunities will be generated under this program. That is what we are operating on. It has been modified upwards since the Budget on the basis of the experience in New South Wales.

         There have been press reports indicating that maybe there is a bit of political stuntsmanship occurring in the way this program is being handled, and that the intention is really to try to keep Mr Keating in his job, as distinct from the 13,000 six-monthly jobs—or the 17,000, as has been stated. One of the newspaper articles drew attention to the fact that a number of Labor members of parliament are being asked to hand out some fat cheques, get a bit of press and all that business.

I do not believe that other complementary activities, which might involve the stimulation of infrastructure or the creation of activity within the local municipality, were taken into account as a separate factor either to modify the major factor or to substitute for it.

         —I am aware that this Government has been very rigorous in the giving of grants to local government, as I am sure Senator Macdonald would endorse. There are very rigorous formula. The various grants commissions are involved in ensuring that funds flowing to local government are equitably and fairly distributed throughout Australia. Therefore, it concerns me that the Minister is not able to indicate that any form of assessment was done that drew on a similar type of assessment, particularly where these funds are again flowing through the agency of local government. As Senator Macdonald has said, certainly the delivery of the services through local government should be complemented.

         It is a matter of concern that the Government has not drawn upon the normal and traditional Labor Party principles of equity and fairness in this distribution. I would be very keen to know why the Government chose to move away from its traditional areas of support in the assessment of the way grants would go. It is obvious from a number of the local government areas that were chosen that the Minister cannot sustain that the assessment criterion was purely one of employment because many of the 500 councils or municipalities that did not receive funds are also well known for their unemployment problems. Therefore, it should be recorded that it is a matter of major concern that there was not any degree of equity and fairness in these grants.

Certainly I have had representations from various councils in Tasmania which see the cycle paths as a very good project, not only from a health and recreational point of view, but also from a safety point of view in allowing persons within their municipalities to move along the bicycle paths rather than being subjected to the hazards of ordinary traffic on the roads. So in many ways these cycle paths can be properly characterised as providing a facility for the local area of enduring benefit. I would be surprised if Senator Tierney were to think otherwise.

         —Today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published retail trade figures for the month of October. As I always do, I caution that monthly figures have to be treated with a little circumspection. But I have to say that this is the strongest monthly rise in retail sales since January. They are now running at 4.3 per cent above the level of October 1991. This is consistent with the Government's view that recovery is taking place in the economy, although at a slower rate than all Australians would like. The combination of lower interest rates, the One Nation statement and the employment initiatives in the Budget are helping promote growth in Australia, despite the huge difficulties in the international economy where unemployment rates, growth rates and so on are in an extraordinarily bad situation.

         The Government does not believe in massive U-turns in economic policy. If one reads the serious economic commentators, one will know that that is true. There is an enormous amount of difference between flexibility in policies and U-turns. Until yesterday, Dr Hewson was at least being consistent. He consistently opposed interest rate cuts throughout last year, and he said that he would not change Fightback whatever people thought of it. Today that has all changed. He is going to learn that one cannot wrap a dead cat in silver paper and make it good.

In the same period New Zealand, with its GST, had a one per cent drop in retail sales. This shows what the economic policies in New Zealand have done. That, plus a range of other policies which are included in Fightback, has had that effect on retail sales. The Opposition has to face up to the fact that this economy is growing; New Zealand's is not.

         —Mr President, I ask a supplementary question—in the light of that meaningless tirade from the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He has once again refused, as he has done on every occasion in recent months, even to attempt to seriously answer a question. Does he agree that, excluding our overseas assets, a tenfold increase in Australia's net debt to the rest of the world over the past 10 years as a result of the Labor Government's policy failures represents a fundamental structural problem? I ask him again: if he does agree, what new policies will the Government adopt to reduce that debt?

I know the Minister has a problem with this area. The question is simple: is the international debt a problem; and does the Labor Party have a policy to solve it?

If those opposite want me to say that Australia's overseas debt level is something that has to be seriously considered by all governments, the answer to that question is yes.

         —The GST as proposed by the Opposition includes a number of offsets to reduce its impact—offsets by the reduction of payroll tax, petrol excise and sales tax. But, even with those offsets factored in, the domestic airlines in Australia say that the impact of the consumption tax is to add $250m per annum to their operational expenses. Treasury estimated that that is an 8 per cent increase in domestic air fares. Overall, allowing for the offsets, there will be a $250m increase in operational expenses.

         While the major domestic airlines will of course be hurt by that, the airlines that will be hurt most are the regional operators, the smaller airlines, that do not have the economies of scale and are not able to offset the huge impact of a consumption tax of this nature. Of course, the tourist industry has said the GST will strangle domestic tourism in Australia; and for the domestic legs of international air travel there will be a further charge as well.

         We do not propose, as a government, to introduce a goods and services tax as the Opposition has proposed. But the car   manufacturers have complained about the GST, the textile, clothing and footwear industry has complained about it, the building and construction industry has complained about it, the tourism industry has complained about it, the sugar industry has complained about it, the banking and finance industry has complained about it, and the aviation industry is complaining about it; not to mention St Vincent de Paul, ACOSS, the Catholic Social Justice Commission, the Uniting Church and consumer organisations—and if we believe the polls, most Australians have complained about it. It will be interesting to see whether the legitimate complaints of the domestic aviation industry will be met in any backflip the Opposition does on its tax.

         We have reduced significantly the costs to the airline industry by a number of the major micro-economic reforms that we have introduced. They have made significant savings to the operations of the airline system in Australia. One of the reasons why we will not be introducing a goods and services tax is that we want Australians to have the advantage of the savings we have made and not have to pay, according to Treasury estimates, 8 per cent more on their domestic airline tickets.

The charges by the Civil Aviation Authority have been decreased in real terms every year since the CAA was established in 1988. This year alone the Civil Aviation Authority has passed on reductions in airways charges of $96m in real terms, and a reduction in the costs of safety regulation of about a further 30 per cent. This represents an effective 16 per cent reduction in overall charges in real terms.

My point of order relates to standing order 184, the standing order under which you keep control in this chamber. As I understood your remarks on an earlier point of order, you indicated that it was clearly disorderly conduct for a senator to use newspaper headlines to gain access to the television coverage of Question Time. Less than 10 minutes after that ruling, Senator Cook deliberately did just that. In other words, straight after that, he deliberately defied your ruling. Accordingly, Mr President, you have discretion under standing order 203(b) to name him for having committed an offence. I am at a loss to understand why you did not do so. I ask you to clarify in my mind and for the benefit of other senators why you did not enforce your own ruling.  Or can Government senators do what they like but you will enforce it on us?

Secondly, will he provide details of when and how this analysis was done and, in particular, whether it was compared with the net benefits to Australia from Arnotts' own plans already under way, firstly to expand exports and then to directly enter Asian markets through joint ventures? Thirdly, why has the Government favoured Campbells' assurances regarding expansion into Asia and not Arnotts' assurances, particularly given Campbells' record of not complying with undertakings given to the Government and Australian shareholders in 1985 when it was first allowed a stake in Arnotts, and given the evidence that in terms of technology and distribution networks, Arnotts is already miles ahead of Campbells?

         —First of all, it has been widely reported that Campbells gave undertakings at the time it took a shareholding in Arnotts some years ago. There were no undertakings given by Campbells to the Foreign Investment Review Board; rather there was a scenario as to what Campbells thought would happen as a result of its equity investment in Arnotts. That scenario, I suspect, has not been met, but it is a different matter from talking about undertakings.

         The net benefits to the Australian economy are very difficult to determine at this stage, and it is the function of the Foreign Investment Review Board to determine these issues. The Treasurer has approved the proposed takeover and has imposed a series of conditions designed to ensure that Arnotts' activities remain centred in Australia. These conditions are that Arnotts will continue to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, that the majority of Arnotts board members will be Australian citizens, and that the headquarters and manufacturing operations will continue to be based in Australia. Under amendments made to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act in 1989, these undertakings are now enforceable. They were not enforceable prior to that legislation being introduced.

         I do not want to enter into the public debate about the structure of the Arnotts company, the position of minority shareholders and what percentage of authority they can hold in the overall deliberations and conclusions of the company. But there are legal battles, as I understand it, over these issues and they have to be resolved between Campbells and Arnotts. If the takeover does go ahead, Campbells' experience in the food industry and its financial strength could assist Arnotts in its export strategy. I think I said that in answer to a question from one of Senator Lees's colleagues a week or so ago. The Treasurer took into account a number of matters of advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board in reaching his conclusion on this matter. Conditions of the bid announced by the Treasurer were volunteered by Campbells in discussion with the FIRB and they became conditions as a result of being volunteered in the way they were.

         I say to the Democrats generally that the question of foreign investment is probably something which we are quite apart on. There is insufficient capital in this country to develop the industries we would like to develop and we probably have a quite different point of view about all of that.

         —I do not know the answer to the second part of the question, but I think it would be ridiculous to try to impose that condition—requiring the use of raw materials from Australia in relation to biscuits made in Asia. That is just a ridiculous interference in the affairs of a business. A business that wants to be competitive will run itself in the way in which it is best suited by the cost of raw materials and so on. In fact, it is Arnotts which has proposed to manufacture overseas; it is not Campbells that has proposed that it do that. Its undertakings relate to manufacture in Australia. In so far as any breach of those undertakings is concerned, that would have to be dealt with under the 1989 legislation.

Will the Minister make sure that the Department gets its act together as a matter of urgency to ensure, first, an effective tender process, and, secondly, that successful tenderers are notified without further delay to allow them to get their programs in place for 1993, so that the victims of the recession that we had to have are actually able to get the help that the Job Club program was set up to provide?

We have a number of policies in place to do that, and the results are reflected in the continuing growth and diversification of Australian exports year by year, particularly in the last two years. These figures have been commented upon by the OECD and others as being quite extraordinary in terms of the change in the pattern of Australian trade.

It is the 20 per cent that diverts that I would not adopt as current Government policy. The reason for that is that what it really does is spend, spend and spend. It is not funded anywhere in Opposition policies. Not having the funding to do it makes it irresponsible to make those sorts of policy promises.

         My Department has done a proper costing of the Opposition policy. Its analysis shows that over the period 1993-96, the shortfall in funding is between $895m and $930m. Over three years that is almost $1 billion wrong. This is also taking into account the fact that the Opposition made a mistake in counting the recurrent savings only once. We have counted them right through the program—to be very helpful towards it. That is an enormous hole in the Opposition's policy. If it ever happens to win office and starts to implement this policy in the first months of government, it would lead to absolute destruction in the defence forces.

As I have said in previous answers on this issue, if emergency circumstances were to arise and Japan requested Australia's assistance, the Australian Government would consider such a request in accordance with the international law applicable to ships in distress. In the case of port access, it would be within the discretion of the Australian Government to determine whether port access would be granted. Port access is normally granted to ships in distress but safety would be a paramount consideration in deciding whether to grant access to the ship and, if so, which port might be the most suitable for such access.

         As to Senator Bell's second question, it is the case that the ship rounded the Cape of Good Hope earlier this month heading eastward through the Indian Ocean. The Japanese Government will not depart from its clearly stated intention, for security reasons, not to advise any other countries of the precise route. If the ship continues to sail eastward, however, then on normal sailing times it would be about mid-December before it came anywhere near Australia.

         In regard to the costs of responding to any emergency, the Japanese Government has said that any nuclear liability arising from the plutonium cargo is insured by the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation of Japan—PNC—which is a government owned organisation which, according to Japanese law, takes responsibility for nuclear liability. If that nuclear liability was not fully covered by PNC's insurance, the Japanese Government has made clear it would assist PNC financially, so there would be no limit to the nuclear liability. As regards non-nuclear liability, I understand the

We will continue to monitor this total situation and, as I told the Senate on 25 November, I will keep honourable senators informed of any developments, especially in regard to the safety and security of the shipment which might affect our position in any way on this issue.

        The Leader of the Government today seemed to be trying to imply that if we looked at Australia's net debt situation, we would see that it is not as bad as the gross figures indicate and that, somehow or other, the coalition was ignoring the net situation as distinct from the gross. That, of course, is totally wrong. We have said time and again—and these figures are beyond dispute—that the net level of Australia's borrowings abroad is now $162,000m. That compares with a figure of about $25 billion at the time that this Government came into office. In other words, that is well over a sixfold increase in Australia's debt in that period.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The increase in gross debt has been even more than that; it has been closer to a tenfold increase. Indeed, if the Leader of the Government is saying that the net debt position has in any way improved, I refer him back not to the last 10 years but just five years. If he looks at his own official statistics, he will find that Australia's net liabilities to the rest of the world at the end of the September quarter this year were more than $209,000m, and that compares with a figure of only $120,000m only five years ago.

         The Leader of the Government is so interested in this subject, he is so interested in a proper, rational debate in the Senate on this, that he gathers up his papers and walks out. That is typical of the performance of this Minister and this Government over recent years. He is not prepared to sit down and debate the actual figures and the real issues facing this country. He seems to regard Australia's debt to the rest of the world as a bit of a joke, as if it does not really count. He does not seem to believe that every Australian owes the rest of the world the equivalent of $11,000—$44,000 per average family in Australia—and he seeks to deny all those figures.

         More importantly, or at least as significant, is the proposition that he is putting—and he has been peddling this for years now and he knows it is wrong—that there is somehow such a fundamental difference between foreign debt from private sector debt relative to public sector debt that the total level does not really matter at all. That, of course, is an absolute nonsense. It is the total level of debt that is of concern. To consider just how bad that problem is one also needs to look at the uses to which the borrowings have been put and who is doing the borrowing.

         Time will not permit us to pursue the matter today because it needs a much fuller debate; but Senator Button is talking about a massive fall in public sector debt. I do not know whether Senator Button knows that, as a result of the absolute runaway situation in the Budget over the past couple of years, official public sector debt has blown out enormously. Indeed, since 1990-91, that is less than two years ago, we have had a near doubling in the public sector debt to the rest of the world to almost $30 billion. That is a matter that the Government has to address as a matter of urgency.

         What the policy says is that no-one who has participated in appropriate training programs and demonstrated a willingness to find work but who is still without a job will be denied access to assistance. That assistance, that special benefit, will be the same as the Jobsearch allowance or the Newstart allowance. So what the Government is saying is totally untrue. It is peddling untruths. It has no policies of its own; its members do not have a policy in their brains. They have sent this country down the tube.

         We now have over one million people unemployed and many more underemployed. We have a foreign debt which is insurmountable and which our children and our children's children will be paying back. They will be working their insides out to pay back the debt that this Government has left this country with. That is the legacy it has left us with. Government members peddle lies. They have no policies. All they can do is tell untruths about our policies. I find it unacceptable, and I do not know what we are going to do, but somehow the public will realise at some point that the lies that they are peddling are what they are—lies—and that they are telling newcomers to this country in their own language that we will leave them to starve to death.

         —I support the comments of Senator Short in taking note of the most unsatisfactory answer of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. The very simple, straightforward question was this: we have an international debt of $162 billion net, and I want to know, and Australia wants to know, what the Government's policy is to reduce that debt. Clearly, there is no policy. Again and again the Minister abuses individuals because they have the audacity to ask him for the Government's policy. Senator Tate was honest the other day. He said that the Government did not have a policy. It is important that we put on the record some of the more, shall we say, profound statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) over the years as that debt has grown. Perhaps we can start with this one. In the Budget Speech 1985 the then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, said:

        By this stage the foreign debt had risen from $23 billion to $51.2 billion. Each year it went up—to $75 billion and then to $82 billion. In 1988, he said:

         The Keating Government's economic strategy is to accelerate recovery from recession and at the same time build a stronger Australia. It is a four year plan. It begins now, with an immediate boost to spending and employment. It ends in 1995-96 with a Budget back in surplus and dramatically reduced marginal income tax rates for most Australians.

        In other words, every year the statement that the Prime Minister has made both in his capacity of Treasurer and then as Prime Minister simply is untrue. He reverses his position. Look at the myriad of so-called policies we have had on the run in the communications area and the pay television area—back-flips, reversals, changes of mind, roll-overs in the party room. You name it; it has happened.

         Finally, here we are trying to find out what policy the Government has to reduce the now $162 billion debt. What answer does it have? Nothing, except to criticise a fine policy, the Fightback policy, which has long had a heritage and a tradition of being subject to monitoring by the Cole Committee, with various announcements being made from time to time. We are moving in a most deliberate, systematic and logical progression, taking account of a million unemployed and an international debt of $162 billion—and a Prime Minister who tells fibs.

We have seen in previous weeks severe castigation of members of the Opposition, who have had the temerity to suggest that there might be changes to their policy. I am particularly reminded of the criticism that was heaped on the right honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair, by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he dared to suggest on 19 or 20 November this year that Fightback would be doctored, that there would be changes, and that certain things would happen if the coalition won power and was not doing terribly well in presenting its policies. The right honourable member for New England was roundly criticised by his Leader, but it now appears that Mr Sinclair was correct.

         Mr Sinclair, being the wily old politician—and I say that with the utmost respect; he is someone who is venerated and respected—obviously had grave reservations about the GST. In Bathurst on 19 November he said that some changes to Fightback and the GST would be necessary. He went on to say that the coalition plan to remove many existing taxes and replace them with a flat rate system must be subject to finetuning to meet the needs of the time. That, of course, is the key thing that those opposite will say—that they are meeting the needs of the time and are finetuning.

         The other argument we heard from the other side was, `We have these other assets overseas'. Let us talk about some of those other assets that we are supposed to have overseas. When we look at things other than loans, we will find that our net foreign liabilities have risen to over $209,000m during the term of this Government. While we talk about net foreign liabilities and assets, let us take it straight home. What did this Government do just yesterday? It approved the takeover of one of our great Australian assets, Arnotts Biscuits. What will that do to our net foreign assets? It will increase our indebtedness and our obligations to people overseas, and it will further worsen the real asset position of this country, because this Government, when it had the opportunity to stop that taking place, did absolutely nothing.

Senator Short has basically said to every interest group in the Australian community, `Come and see us in the next 10 days and we will amend Fightback to take account of your needs and your interests. We know we are doomed to lose the next election because all the polls in the last four weeks have turned round and we can't win'. For the last 13 1/2 months Dr Hewson has said that there would not be the slightest change in Fightback, and that it would stand. He said, `I will resign rather than change'. Yesterday, he calmly announced—but there was a note of panic—after some pressure from the jellybacks in the Liberal and National parties, `We are going to review the policies. We are going to make changes to make Fightback more acceptable'.

The only person not concerned about servicing any debt is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Not all of us have made $4.2m in six weeks. We understand that and that is a debate which will obviously proceed. We understand that Senator Schacht's leader is not concerned about the servicing of foreign debt.

         In 1987 the great promise was that no child would live in poverty. Do those opposite remember that? Senator Schacht and Senator Evans walked around and constantly reiterated that promise. That was certainly dumped. Does Senator Schacht remember back in 1985 when they said what a terrible thing it would be if Qantas were privatised? He would easily remember that. Of course, it was said that Australian Airlines could not be privatised. And what happened to the Commonwealth Bank? Boy, did the Government fight those privatisation policies hard. It warned the Australian public that if they elected a coalition government these great assets would be sold off to the private sector. What has the Government just done? Senator Schacht should not come in here and talk about backflips.

So Senator Schacht should not come in here and lecture the coalition on backflips. We have done the responsible thing. There is a major crisis in this economy. There is the major problem of unemployment. A million-plus people now cannot find work.

         —In the minute or so of time remaining to me in this debate, let me puncture some of this pompous rhetoric that is coming from the other side by making two swift points about our debt. The first point is that the significance of any country's national debt depends, first of all, on its composition. The composition of Australia's overseas debt, whether we are talking about gross or net, is overwhelmingly private rather than public. The overwhelming proportion of it is debt that has been chalked up by the private sector in order to improve our domestic productive capacity. Only a small proportion of it is public and, of that, only a very small proportion is in the Commonwealth sector from either the Commonwealth Government or the Reserve Bank.

         The second point I would make is that the significance of any country's debt depends, if one is trying to attribute economic significance to it, on whether or not one can service it out of the flow of returns that come from the export of goods and services. In that respect, the story is a very simple one. The debt servicing ratio—our capacity to service this debt—has been dramatically declining. It is down to 15.4 per cent from 19.1 per cent last year. That is an improvement to the lowest rate since 1988.

          —This response from the Government to the report by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts is welcome, except for one aspect from my point of view. I will come to that in a moment. The inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the positive drug test on Mr Alex Watson grew out of the drugs in sport inquiry—that is a fair enough way to say how this inquiry arose. I note on the record—as I think we have done before—that, in large part, we need to acknowledge the input of Senator Crichton-Browne in bringing this initiative to attention.

          The concerns were two-fold as far as the Committee was concerned. Firstly, what exactly constituted caffeine drugging for the purposes of performance enhancement? It is certainly of concern to the Committee—and of concern to me—that the Government has not supported the Committee's first recommendation which states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That until the performance enhancing effects and the likelihood of athletes exceeding the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Caffeine limit are clarified, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) recommends to the IOC the removal of Caffeine from the list of proscribed drugs.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         I think that leaves the difficulties that confronted the Committee when it first examined this whole question of caffeine drug assistance in sport exactly where they were before. The second recommendation—which the Government supports in principle—states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That the Australian Sports Drug Agency commission research into:

        </para>
        <para>
         I think it is not unreasonable to say that until we get back the detailed research we should withhold recommendations about whether caffeine should be a proscribed drug. It certainly seemed to the Committee that, as in the case of Alex Watson, considerable injustice was possible if the caffeine limits were left as they were.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Secondly, there is much confusion about what is a proscribed drug. The definition includes that it be performance enhancing, but caffeine as a drug sometimes has exactly the opposite effect: it makes performance less good. I do not see the International Olympic Committee or those official organisations which are testing against the use of caffeine making the distinction. If caffeine is actually a disadvantage we would not bother measuring it; as opposed to when caffeine can be said to be an advantage and it should be measured.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There is a lot of room for very much tightened definitions in this area of sport and drugs. In the meantime, I am very pleased that we have this report as a test case and a warning, if you like, to those organisations which have the responsibility of dealing with drugs in sport. They need to make sure that they practise natural justice. If there is doubt about a definition I believe the definition should be tightened before any more challenges or charges are brought against people for using particular drugs.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One of the matters I have raised in this place which is of enormous concern to me is that if we are looking at the definition of a proscribed drug to mean that it is performance enhancing, what business do people have testing for drugs which are not performance enhancing? The example I have cited before in this place is the testing of football teams for marijuana which, by any definition, is not performance enhancing—quite the contrary. A lot of organisations and drug testers seem to have their morals confused with performance enhancing drugs. As a matter of natural justice, we should be looking very much to clear up the definition of proscribed drugs and what we mean by `performance enhancing'. In particular, in the context of this report it is important to determine what those two criteria mean when it comes to the use of caffeine.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The report also pointed out that it was very odd indeed for caffeine to be listed as a proscribed drug and, at the same time, be freely available for athletes during their performance. So we recommended:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . caffeine beverages not be available at Olympic Games competition venues and athletes be advised of the possibility of exceeding the proscribed limit by simply drinking coffee.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government's response is that this recommendation has been noted and brought to the attention of the Australian Olympic Committee. Bringing it to people's attention is one thing, but if we are very concerned—as we were in the Committee—that caffeine is a proscribed drug, that athletes could be found guilty of exceeding the limits for that drug and that very significant consequences could flow for their future in sport and their life generally, it seems very odd indeed, in fact positively contradictory, to have caffeine beverages freely available. Subsequent testing has shown that it is possible to exceed the proscribed levels of caffeine merely by drinking coffee.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Committee discovered that there are very significant differences from one person to another in the body's capacity to absorb and break down caffeine. A dose that would take one athlete above the proscribed levels might not necessarily cause another to reach those levels. So, again, the difference between individuals needs to be taken account of. Levels need to be set so that some people are not inadvertently caught. At the same time we think it is very important that athletes be provided with full information about the effects and impact of caffeine, particularly—as we saw in the case of Alex Watson—when the consequences for an athlete found to have breached those limits are very significant.

          The Government supports recommendation No. 3 recommending comprehensive drug briefings for Australian Olympic athletes both at the time of selection and again immediately prior to departure for future Olympic Games. There may be a very significant time lapse between the time of selection and the time of departure and, with so many things on athletes' minds, the fact that drinking coffee could take them over a proscribed level may slip from the front of their brains. So we recommended that the athletes be reminded of this fact prior to departing for the Olympic Games, wherever they may be. Indeed, they will not have to depart for them, if they are held in Sydney. We are pleased that the Government supports that recommendation because of a concern by the Committee that natural justice be done in providing for our athletes.

          The Government has noted recommendation No. 4 and tells us that it has also brought it to the AOC's attention.

          Much was learnt by the Committee in examining what happened to Alex Watson, who was the first Australian athlete to breach those rules.

Again, our Committee made this recommendation because it was very clear that to give a first offender, as Alex Watson was, a life ban was extraordinarily severe, particularly given the internationally accepted stepped levels of penalty.

         The Government's response is to support this recommendation in principle. Sports drug definitions and procedures are still in their infancy. Therefore it is very important that the organisations or institutions with a responsibility in this area provide as much information as possible. Firstly, there is a need to assist the community to recognise whether there is a problem and, if so, make recommendations to deal with it. Secondly, we need to know whether the process established in Australia—which is one of the leading processes in the world—is dealing with the difficulties in a very fair and satisfactory manner. So it is interesting to note that the Government supports this recommendation in principle.

          I wonder whether we give too many directions to organisations or departments about what should be in the substantive parts of their annual reports. I would have thought that it is not unreasonable, given the early days of the drug and sport establishments in Australia, that we should expect a report about that from the Australian Sports Commission. The Australian Sports Commission can also report on any other matters related to drugs in sport in Australia.

I start by observing that this response is to the final report of that Committee euphemistically known as the `Committee into Drugs in Sport'.

          The main manifest consequence of the findings of those reports has been the passing by this Parliament of legislation setting up the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The purpose of that legislation in setting up that agency was to provide and put in place a statutory body whose functions and responsibilities were to establish and implement a drug testing regime in Australia. The effect of that legislation and of ASDA has been to ensure, as far as possible, that all elite athletes are, by and large, drug free and compete on their merits.

          A further and perhaps more important long term effect has been to change the ethos and culture in Australia towards drug taking in sport. Until some years ago, there has been the view that taking performance enhancing drugs was legally wrong, but morally right; that, because the overwhelming majority of athletes at elite level took performance enhancing drugs in one form or another, it was appropriate for everybody else to take them—and that in itself was to create the even playing field. I think it is now clearly understood and accepted by Australian athletes that to take performance enhancing drugs is to cheat upon their fellow athletes and to seek to take an unfair and distinct advantage.

Those athletes—both retired and contemporary—who gave honest and frank evidence of their own drug use and drug use by other competitors were vilified, first of all by sports officials and then, to a lesser extent, by other athletes.

When the Committee identified the personal cheating of one favoured Australian Institute of Sport athlete, who had been living on taxpayers' funds by way of scholarships for nine years at the AIS, a campaign of cover-up and vilification was waged against the Committee. A senior sporting official directly involved in that conspiracy to cheat was described by his contemporary senior officials as committing a potential error of judgment.

The official supervising the pool was a Chinese official and his athlete was not tested. The gold medal winner was not tested. But the Australians were tested.

          —It is very interesting to watch Prime Ministers and Ministers when they are with sportsmen and women. They seem to develop an ingratiating and obsequious style and manner. I do not want to be political about this, but I often think about Bob Hawke when he is around Greg Norman. He seems to get even shorter, but in his own way he is all the more puffed up like a little blowfish. Or if Ministers are at the tennis and rubbing shoulders with Pat Cash or whoever the contemporary of the day is, it seems to give them a permeating glow, as if the adulation awarded the athlete is in some way radiating onto the member of parliament and advantaging him politically. As I said, sport should not be political.

          In conclusion, I propose to continue to campaign in the face of some sort of undercurrent by certain officials determined to ensure that their conduct is justified and what they wish will be. If I had a choice of being able to influence whether Australian athletes went to the next Olympic Games competing on an even playing field or competing in Sydney on an uneven playing field, I would vote the former every time.

          —China's reputation for drug use is not particularly attractive at the moment. There are a lot of complications in respect of China but they are matters that can be addressed properly by the IOC. One of the difficulties with having impartial second country teams testing some of these athletes is in being able to identify them. With 1.25 billion people, it has been put that they could serve up Mr X and say he was Mr Y and he could continue to test clean every single time, but we would have the wrong athlete. Identification is a very real problem in some of these countries.

Those that have not been accepted have been referred to the AOC, which is the proper body to deal with them, save for one which, in some respects, goes to the heart of the problem. The proposal of the minority report was that caffeine be a proscribed substance. The reason I argued that was because scientific evidence has now been provided that one can breach the proscribed level of 12 micrograms per millilitre by consuming two or three cups of coffee over 24 hours.

Caffeine is not like drugs of another nature which have a more precise effect, it varies according to people's metabolisms. There is a whole range of factors that influence levels in relation to consumption of caffeine. It is particularly dangerous and unfair to have a proscribed level of 12 micrograms per millilitre, because some people can reach that level with two cups of coffee whereas others can take 10 cups.

          It seems to me that the sensible thing to do is to proscribe it completely. Then, as occurs with the ratio between testosterone and epi-testosterone and with some drugs in the category of cold tablets, such as ephedrine, there is a limit which is considered to be inadvertent. If caffeine is proscribed completely and an athlete tests positive, he can appeal on the grounds of it being inadvertent. If his range is so low that it is clearly inadvertent—and so low that, of course, it would have no performance enhancing effect—then there would be no penalty. That recommendation was rejected by the Government—for reasons which are not clear to me; although I take it, it would have taken advice from somewhere else—because it is all too hard. The response to this recommendation states:

         Proscribing any level of Caffeine in the urine would create many difficulties for testing agencies. If this were to be enforced, it would inevitably lead to a vast increase in the number of athletes testing positive through inadvertent use of Caffeine, and therefore create an unnecessary drain on the limited resources of testing agencies.

         That is the whole point. We get to the point where we say that a little cheating is all right because to impose the proper discipline would unnecessarily drain the limited resources. It seems a poor old excuse for not doing it properly. If, as with ephedrine and other drugs, we are able to have mechanisms to cope with inadvertency, there is no reason why we cannot have them for caffeine.

          If it is argued that caffeine is a normal social drink and, therefore, is not normally illegal, and one would expect athletes to take it, athletes will have to do what they do with other substances which are bad for them when they are training or exercising or when they are competing: they will just have to stop taking it. If athletes stop having a normal intake of caffeine through the normal processes, there will not be any problems. Athletes who inadvertently pick it up by eating chocolate or drinking Coca-Cola—

          —Yes, tea—to a lesser extent than coffee, but certainly in tea: if a level is detected, it would be ignored. If it comes within that category where it is obvious the athlete has had a very small intake, the testing officials would say, and put it down immediately to the fact, `It is clear that he has had a cup of coffee or has eaten a bar of chocolate'. They would ignore it. That does not seem to be a problem. It is only when one gets past that level that the testing official would then deem the athlete to have tested positive.

          Athletes are not positive automatically because they have breached the proscribed level. They have to be deemed to be positive. It is a deliberate, affirmative action. I see no reason for doing that. At this very moment Alex Watson, who did nothing more than socially drink coffee but who was banned from the Olympic Games, in the eyes and according to the level of law of the International Olympic Committee is still guilty because it does not happen to have an appeals mechanism. All he did was have a few cups of coffee on the day of the competition. If it wants to ensure fairness and ensure that athletes do not cheat, it will put mechanisms such as this in place.

          But to get the IOC to do these things is not easy. It can spend $50m on a museum in Lucerne; it does not give one single dollar for out-of-competition testing. There are nations in the world that cannot afford it, to start with, but the reason I am arguing that the IOC ought to fund it is that it makes hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Olympic Games these days. It should set up these testing regimes around the world and say, `If any athlete tests positive, he or she is banned from the next Olympic Games'. That would soon put a stop to it, but for reasons best known to the Olympic movement it refuses to do so. As long as it is left to international sporting bodies, there will not be the will, the commitment and, in many cases, the resources. I support the government response, save for the Government's failure to support the recommendation that really mattered—that caffeine be proscribed completely.

        The Government notes the Committee's endorsement of the policy which has given rise to the Balance of Family (BOF) Test and the Committee's wish not to undermine the controls in this class. However, the Committee has also expressed the view that the test results in an injustice and operates harshly in circumstances which are set out in the report.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        It is necessary to consider the Committee's comments in the context of the objectives of the policy. The BOF Test was introduced to tighten the former generous entry concessions for parents which had resulted in growing numbers being approved for entry, evidenced by a 43% increase in the three years from 1983/84 to 1987/88. The decision to introduce the test was also made in recognition that parents make a heavy demand on public health and welfare services. This cost is harder to justify when there are stronger family links overseas than in Australia. Further, settlement experience indicates that there is less likelihood of family breakdown and reliance on the social welfare system where parents are located with the balance of their children.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The BOF Test has been constructed to operate as impartially as possible across a wide variety of cultural backgrounds. For this reason the test is concerned only with the numeric and geographical disposition of the children of the applicant, the applicant's spouse and former partners of either. It is independent of the social values of the applicant, the relative economic position of the children and the quality of the relationship between parents and their children.
       </para>

        The Committee has recommended that the Minister amend the Balance of Family Regulation to provide that the following children are not counted against the applicant for the purpose of the BOF Test:

        In the cases described in the Attachment to the Special Report No. 1, the recommendations would have a beneficial effect, that is, they would assist the applicant in meeting the BOF Test.

        An issue raised by recommendation (ii) is that the quality of relationships is not easy to assess, particularly within a family unit. A relationship that is estranged may previously have been, or become, under changed conditions, close and nurturing, and may at times be again estranged. It cannot be assumed that a step-parent child relationship discontinues or weakens after death, divorce or other separations as the Committee's recommendations would imply.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The Special Need Relative category was introduced as a concessionary category to enable an Australian citizen or permanent resident to sponsor a relative for migration where that relative is willing and able to give substantial, continuing assistance to the citizen or permanent resident in circumstances of special need. These circumstances are defined as a permanent or long-term need for assistance because of death, disability, prolonged illness or other serious circumstances affecting the citizen or permanent resident personally, or a member of his or her family unit. The definition also requires that the assistance cannot reasonably be obtained from any other Australian relative or welfare, hospital, nursing or community services in Australia.

        The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is not able to provide figures on the number and incidence of cases with the Campbell case profile. As the Committee has identified, in these circumstances, the child's need for contact with, and support from, the divorced parent falls outside the interpretation of the meaning of "special need" contemplated by subparagraph 2(1) of the Regulations. The Government considers that in these circumstances a child's needs for parenting are not well covered by the term "assistance". The period of a child's greatest needs for access to both parents is also, of course, not permanent, nor in many cases long-term. Policy guidelines specifically exclude from approval within this category applications based primarily on love and affection and the wish to be reunited with relatives in Australia. Also excluded are applicants who seek solely to provide assistance with child care, financial, emotional or moral support and companionship.

        The Committee was undecided whether such cases can be appropriately dealt with under the Minister's residual discretion or whether fine tuning of the Special Need Relative Regulation is required. The Government considers that no fine tuning of this Regulation is warranted based on the issues raised for the Committee by the Campbell case and similar cases which have been brought to the Committee's attention. Such circumstances would be more appropriately handled via the Parent migration visa class which provides for the sponsorship of a parent/s by a minor, or where appropriate, by the exercise of Section 115 and Section 137 Ministerial discretion.

        I refer to the issue you raised in the course of debate on the Migration Reform Bill 1992 on 10 December 1992 on the subject of access of the Cambodian boat people to humanitarian consideration. I am writing to confirm the position outlined by Senator Tate in response to your questions on the issue, namely that under the present Act and Regulations persons who make unauthorised entry to Australia do not have such access.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The procedures currently in place for allowing refugee applicants access to humanitarian consideration are complex. They rely on a power of the Minister to grant individuals an entry permit, in this case a domestic protection (temporary) entry permit, in spite of the fact that criteria for that permit may not have been met, in certain exceptional circumstances.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Migration Act provides that applicants are entitled to be granted an entry permit if they meet the criteria set out in regulations. Conversely, the Minister is specifically enjoined from granting an entry permit where the criteria are not met. There are only two circumstances where the Minister may grant an entry permit to an applicant who does not meet the regulatory criteria. This is when an application for a permit has been rejected either at internal review under section 115 of the Act or by the Immigration Review Tribunal under section 137 of the Act. In that case, the Minister may grant the permit if he or she considers it would be in the public interest to do so.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The current mechanism for allowing some persons rejected for refugee status to stay in Australia on humanitarian grounds makes use of the Minister's powers under section 115. In essence, the Minister grants applicants a domestic protection (temporary) entry permit in spite of the fact that they have been found not to meet an essential criterion for the permit, namely that they have been determined to be a refugee. The key point is that to access the Minister's powers, an entry permit review application must have been rejected. A refugee status review rejection does not trigger the Minister's section 115 powers. This reflects the fact that at the time section 115 was drafted, refugee status decisions were not formally incorporated in the Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Cambodian boat people are designated persons held in custody under Division 4B of the Migration Act. Previously their status was that of prohibited entrants held under section 88 of the Act. No review rights attach to any entry permit or visa application made by a prohibited entrant or a designated person. As a result, the Minister's powers under section 115 or section 137 cannot be engaged in respect of any such application.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As applicants who have not entered Australia, in the strict legal sense in which the term entry is used in the Act, there are a limited number of visas and entry permits for which the Cambodians can be considered. It would seem that the only permit for which they might qualify is the domestic protection (temporary) entry permit. If the Cambodians are not found to be refugees it is likely that they will not meet the regulatory criteria for any entry permit or visa. If this proves to be the case, neither the Minister nor any officer of the Department will have the power to grant them an entry permit or visa under the law as it presently stands.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In your remarks to the Senate on this issue, you drew attention to the Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System, particularly paragraphs 5.4 and following. In those paragraphs, the Committee outlines its understanding of the operation of the present mechanism for granting humanitarian consideration. Although I cannot, of course, speak for the Committee, I think it would be fair to assume that the paragraphs in question were not intended to be a full and complete description of that mechanism. As it happens, the Committee has quite correctly set out the procedures which apply for the normal case. The Committee apparently did not feel it necessary for the purposes of its report to note that these procedures do not apply in all cases. As noted above, in the case of a designated person or a prohibited entrant, the Minister has no power to accede to a recommendation to grant an entry permit on humanitarian grounds.

        My question was about whether the provisions of the new legislation, taking effect from 1 July 1993, will enable the Minister to exercise the discretion to enable a person to have the benefit of lawful presence in Australia in accordance with humanitarian principles; that is, persons who entered Australia—I use that term not in a legal sense—in the same way as the Cambodian boat people did. I want to make this final point: these individuals entered Australia after coming from a war-torn country. They entered Australia in a traumatised condition. They came from a country not then recognised by Australia. Many of them have been in detention ever since. Some have been in detention for over three years, suffering further trauma and hardship. They are fearful of what might occur to them on their return.

         I believe that humanitarian considerations should now come into play. The 36 or 37 refugee status applications have finally been refused, notwithstanding that those refugees have been in detention for more than three years. The High Court decision yesterday made it clear that, had these people been properly afforded their rights of appeal to the Federal Court, they would have had the right to have their case heard by the Federal Court as to whether they were unjustly and unfairly detained.

         That right was refused by legislation which was pushed through this Parliament two days before the case was to come to court in May. The day before the High Court decision they received their notices from the Minister's delegate that their refugee application had been refused. So the only thing left is for humanitarian considerations to come into play. In this letter the Minister is saying that, under the present Act and regulations, those humanitarian considerations cannot come into play. The Minister does not have a discretion in this matter.

         However, I point out to the chamber that the reason why the Minister has no discretion is that this was not included in the May legislation. The people are designated persons and, therefore, once those processes have been finalised, as they have been, the Government has tied the Minister's hands—put him in a straitjacket where he cannot move.

         It seems odd that the Minister can now say that he can do nothing about it when it was the Government itself, on the Minister's recommendation, which adopted procedures which ensured that he could do nothing.

         The annual report of the Industry Commission for 1991-92 is from one of the Government's key economic advisory bodies. It could not be a report more damning of this weary and policy paralysed Government's pathetic performance on micro-economic reform. The stark facts are laid bare by the Commission, which has rightly taken the Government to task over its record on micro-economic reform. The report states on page 11:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The imperative is to act quickly and to tackle reform on a broad front. . . However, in light of what governments must do to lift Australia's economic performance, reform initiatives have been lacking in number and scope.
        </para>
        <para>
         Yet only last month the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that the `great micro-economic reform agenda' had been almost completed—just one more lie from a man who has turned public misinformation and colourful but empty rhetoric into an art form. The Industry Commission report exposes those vacuous claims by setting down the directly contradictory facts.

          —Yes, I did use the word `lie' in relation to the Prime Minister's statement, and accordingly I withdraw. The Industry Commission report exposes those vacuous claims by setting down directly the contradictory facts. I must say that the Government, and in particular the Prime Minister, rarely seem interested in facts nowadays. The report stated the reverse of the Prime Minister's statement. Page 15 states, `Clearly, much more remains to be done'. So much for the Prime Minister's statement that the great micro reform agenda is mostly completed. Quite obviously and quite patently it is not. The report makes it clear that not only is the Government's agenda not broad enough, but also it has let many promised reforms slip, including backtracking by the National Road Transport Commission, increasing assistance for footwear, delayed reforms in the sugar and dairy industries, and many more. The report makes a strong case that, without accelerating the pace of micro-economic reform on a broad front, unemployment will remain at high levels for the rest of the decade, even if growth strengthens, which seems most unlikely given the policy paralysis evident from all in this worn-out Government.

          There are many other direct criticisms of Government policy in the report. For example, in what can only be seen as a not-so-veiled criticism of the ridiculous training levy to which Labor is committed, but which we will abolish when in government, the report states:
         </tab>
        </para>

         The task of upgrading skills and increasing flexibility through training requires broad, comprehensive and far reaching reform . . . Reforms need to lead to an education, training and retraining system sensitive to emerging opportunities for skilled employment.

        <para>
         In other words, one blanket rule for everyone will not suffice. A flexible and sensitive training regime is needed to get people into jobs that will last. The report places labour market reform, the policy which is the biggest `no go' area for this Government, right at the top of its priority list for needed change. On page 11 it is stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Much more is to be gained from extending reform . . . particularly removing impediments to the efficient operation of labour markets.
        </para>
        <para>
         In what could only be interpreted as a direct endorsement of the coalition's industrial relations policy, the report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Increased flexibility in wages and conditions would allow current and prospective employees to judge where skill shortages are greatest and where there would be pay-offs to additional training.

        <para>
         The report goes on in like frame. They are the recommendations of the IC. They are also, of course, the Fightback policies which will get Australians back into jobs and back into work. Faced with these facts, the Prime Minister and the Government have decided that they will turn their backs on the only road to real solutions. That is obvious from looking at the last 10 years of hard Labor.

          a report of a statement made by Nugget Coombs who has advised successive governments in the economic area in this country for a long time. Among other things, the article stated:

         It seems to me that one of the institutions which have been corrupted by this is no less than the Industry Commission itself. When the Industry Commission was set up, it replaced the Industries Assistance Commission. The Australian Democrats sought by amendment to ensure that this would not happen, by insisting that one of the commissioners be a person with experience in and knowledge of the environment and that environment be a constant reference for the Industry Commission.

          Unfortunately, we have to recognise that, with the very rare exception of matters like the report on the fishing industry and the fisheries Bills which we dealt with last year, most of the Industry Commission's reports have very little to do with the matters that are of clear concern to Nugget Coombs. He said that the real job of the economy was to provide for the livelihood of people. One can only say, `Hear, hear!' to Nugget Coombs. It is a great pity that the economists of later generations, as Michael Pusey pointed out, do not have that broad education which Nugget Coombs brought to his job as an adviser to successive governments and as the head of the Reserve Bank for quite a long time.

          In this report repeated attention is drawn to the standard of living without qualification, as if the material consumption of individuals equates with standard of living. That runs right through the document. It fails to recognise that material consumption does not equate with standard of living. As per capita GDP in Japan is considerably higher than it is in Australia, one should pose the question: who in Australia would change places with those who are living in Tokyo? Many things need to be taken into account, quite apart from the material standard of living.

          Another matter that the Industry Commission totally fails to recognise in its report, despite the fact that it is comprised of these economic rationalists, is that the first step which needs to be taken into account in properly representing prices in the market system is to internalise the externalities; in other words, to put into the cost of production the cost of pollution, the cost of industrial accidents, the cost of occupational health and so on and so forth. Throughout this report there is an overemphasis on the stripping away of all regulations and all taxes. This is precisely the way in which, in a properly run market economy, one would represent those prices so that those people who consume the goods and services which come out at the other end of the productive process get the right price signals.

          I am afraid that this report simply confirms again that the Industry Commission is on the wrong track and that it has not learnt anything in the couple of years that it has been in existence. Economic rationalism is discredited. It is about time that the Commission recognised that, as many other countries have already recognised it. For a long time they have pursued interventionist policies. That is now the name of the game.

         High rates of unemployment have persisted for more than a decade, pointing to an underlying structural problem that recovery alone will not solve . . . The bulk of the recent increase in unemployment was caused by the recession, with structural reform playing a relatively minor role.

This nation's economy is in desperate need of reform, and it is in desperate need of reform that is going to create jobs for people. It is all about creating jobs for people. There are some people who would argue that we need an interventionist approach to create those jobs, and they are perfectly entitled to have that view. But the danger with that view is that, basically, it is a case of picking winners. Those people are saying, `We will go to the races with your money, we are going to put your money on some of the nags out there and we are hoping that we can pick the winners'. Of course picking winners never works.

          I think this is a very dangerous path to take because, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President—although I understand you are not a gambling man yourself—there are many who are gambling people and rarely do they end up more profitable at the end of the day than they were at the beginning, because picking winners is a very difficult task. What we are saying in the coalition is very simple: the best way to create jobs is to create jobs in the private sector by policies that improve profitability.

          My quibble with the Industry Commission is very simple. Sometimes I think the Industry Commission is too willing to reallocate the profits of some of our struggling primary industries. For example, when they take money off the sugar industry and recommend the abolition of price pooling in the sugar industry, or an end to assignments, there is a very real financial cost to the people who have to bear it. What we believe in the National Party, quite simply, is this: this country does need reform, but it needs reform in an intelligent way which is going to take into consideration the fact that there are certain industries where all the benefits of the so-called reforms that are advocated by the Industry Commission will not flow to this country but will flow to consumers overseas.

          For example, if one were to accept the recommendations of the Industry Commission—the National Party does not, in so far as sugar is concerned, and the coalition has given a commitment not to implement the Industry Commission report regarding sugar, because it is flawed—about abolishing the export powers of the Queensland Sugar Corporation, we would throw away the advantage to Australian producers of having one export seller for sugar. Instead, we would pit something like 1,600 sugar farms up and down the east coast of Australia against each other, selling to three multinational buyers. At the same time, we need to recognise the fact that those international buyers—such as Tate and Lyle, for example—have become quite fat on the subsidies that they have received from EC sugar production, so they are definitely in a position to exert enormous power over Australian producers.

          As far as the Industry Commission report is concerned, we are saying: yes, we do need those reforms, and we need them urgently. But we need to ask ourselves: who is going to get the benefit of the reforms? If those reforms are going to lead to lower prices for Australian producers, to benefit being passed overseas and not retained in Australia, when this country is struggling in the grip of a recession into which this Government has thrown this nation, obviously we have to seriously question whether those ideas are correct.

          I suppose the real acid test as far as the Industry Commission is concerned is this: if the Industry Commission has its way, who on the Commission is willing to tie their income to the income of cane growers over the next 10 years? It is very easy, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you well know, to sit in Canberra and make recommendations, but it is the people who have to live with the consequences of those recommendations and who know the real price—just as the people who have lived with the consequences of this Labor Government's failed economic policies know the real price. The people who are unemployed know the real price, and the people who have been bankrupted by high interest rates which this Government subjected us to know the real price. It is only those opposite who make the recommendations, who do not have to live with the consequences, and who never see the human face of recession in Australia, who are oblivious to the pain that is being caused in this country now.

          —I wish to address briefly the 1991-92 annual report of the Industry Commission. Let me comment equally briefly on the case put forward by Senator Parer who was waxing lyrical about the work of the Industry Commission. What he left out of sight is that the current Government's policies, which have resulted in a million unemployed, have actually been based on the advice of the Industry Commission. I wonder whether Senator Parer has realised that the advice coming out of the Industry Commission was based purely and solely on financial considerations. It did not take into account social consequences, it did not take into account cultural consequences and it did not take into account environmental consequences.

          I wish to address a particular aspect of this report, but before I do let me just agree with what Senator O'Chee said. If the report by the Industry Commission on the sugar industry were implemented in total the effects would be calamitous. Another report, the dairy industry report, suggested that the whole 13 per cent in support given to the dairy industry should be removed totally. If that happened, thousands of dairy farmers in western Victoria and East Gippsland—Victoria has 90 per cent of Australia's dairy industry—would have had to walk off the farms. Fortunately—

          There is a proposal that the Industry Commission actually have an inquiry into public housing. That suggestion fills me with trepidation, because if the Industry Commission follows its usual method of operation—of looking at efficiency only, of looking at financial factors only and not taking account of the social consequences—we will finish up with a report that is a total waste of money on the one hand and which would be quite destructive were it ever to be implemented on the other. This statement says that the Industry Commission is to look at the management, allocation and rental of publicly provided housing. It is going to look at public rental housing, community housing, crisis accommodation, emergency relief and, last but not least, housing for Aboriginal people. If the Industry Commission applies nothing but its normal standards of financial efficiency, I fear for the social priorities. I fear for the client groups which need to be looked at in terms of their priorities. How will the Industry Commission take account of priorities in terms of the money that is to be spent on public housing? I believe that it is the last body that should be looking at the provision of public housing in Australia.

          It seems to me that the Industry Commission report is plus cum ultra—the best example—of the approach that has taken us down the wrong path in the 1980s. For example, if we were to look at the Australian economy and ask what went wrong in the 1980s, apart from banking deregulation which was done too prematurely and without proper arrangements set in place to modify excesses, we would say that the second and more important factor is the absolute lack of capacity that this country has had—and, I might say, the willingness as well—to value add to our primary industry base.

Yet the very companies that have made billions of dollars out of the primary industry area—from the sweated backs of the farmers; those poor people out there who are living on negative incomes, and have been doing so for years—have put nothing back into value adding to those primary industries. Those companies took the raw materials overseas and got what they could for them. They then took their profits and put them into television networks, beer companies, and everything but the very area where they made their money.

          The evidence the Committee received showed that there is widespread concern that uniform registration charges will lead to increases in costs for operators of heavy road transport vehicles and threaten their viability. There is also concern that additional costs will be passed on to users of these services and will lead to higher prices in communities, particularly in rural and remote areas. It is generally acknowledged that the proposed charges will in some locations lead to increases in costs of road freighted goods and in others to a reduction in costs.

          —The Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure had referred to it about 12 months ago for inquiry a matter relating to aspects of heavy road vehicle charges. The issue particularly related to the impact of heavy vehicle charges on isolated and regional communities, and of the full recovery of road costs incurred by heavy vehicles. It further related to the level of taxes and charges paid by the members of the road transport industry and whether adjustments in these charges would be warranted with the implementation of full cost recovery measures. The Committee received 117 submissions and heard evidence from 87 witnesses in many locations around Australia. During those hearings, members of the Committee had the opportunity to see heavy vehicles in use and to hold frank discussions with many involved at the coalface of the industry.

          The Liberal and National parties have long been concerned at the very high level of taxes on the road transport industry, particularly the level of taxes that it has had to endure under this Labor Government. It has been acknowledged that those taxes amount to some 3 1/2 times the taxes paid by other industries. Many of the witnesses appearing before the Committee were extremely concerned that many road transport operators would be forced out of operation, particularly having to meet that excessive level of taxation during a period of deep recession.

          Recommendation 5.2 of the Committee's report recommends that the National Road Transport Commission extensively publicise that it is continuing to seek input on the charging schedule. I believe that this is an extremely feeble and inadequate position for the Committee to have taken on this particular issue. It merely seeks to appease people living in isolated and rural areas. This recommendation fails to address the real issue that the industry already pays more than its fair and equitable share of the tax burden. In the three years leading up to July 1995, when the new charging system will apply, many operators may already have been forced to leave the industry as a result of the excessive burden of taxation that they are already bearing.

          Recommendation 5.4 relates to the establishment of a database of information on the industry, and particularly with regard to taxation of the industry. But that recommendation fails to acknowledge that a timeframe for the establishment of the database is a fundamental requirement of the utility of such a database. There should have been a recommendation from the Committee with regard to the establishment of a specific deadline for the setting up of that database.

          Every single one of the 117 submissions to the Committee expressed concern with the levels of taxation levied on the industry, yet the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee report which has been tabled today do not reflect any attempt to redress those inequities. Overall, the report is impotent and, in effect, a whitewash of the Government's overtaxing of the road transport industry. The report fails to address, in the strongest terms, a call for an immediate, extensive and full inquiry into all taxes levied on road transport operators.

          When we return to government, the Liberal and National parties will remove many thousands of dollars of the tax burden inflicted by this Labor Government on operators and, as a consequence, reduce the cost of road transport for all Australians. This report does not fully and adequately address the inquiry's original reference points. Firstly, the likely economic and social impact on isolated communities was passed over; secondly, no assessment of the total input taxes and charges paid by industry members appears in the report; and, thirdly, whether adjustment to the general level of taxation applying to the road transport industry would be warranted with the full implementation of full cost recovery has been totally ignored.

          The Australian Democrats warrant a mention with regard to this inquiry. The Democrats originally refused to support the coalition's move to lay this legislation aside so that a full inquiry into taxes and charges could be held. But the Australian Democrats, although they did attend some—I would say only a few—of the hearings of this Committee during the inquiry, did not bother to attend the meeting at which the final draft of this report was nutted out by the Committee. For a party whose forebears and founders claim that their role was to keep the bastards honest, they appear to have strayed a long way from the beaten path.

          —The original inquiry was set up mainly to look at the effect of the National Road Transport Commission's uniform charges into rural and remote areas. Those of us from the Opposition who were on the Committee had a different sort of reference in mind. But the Government decided on the reference that the Australian Democrats wanted. It was a simple whitewash. These references were accepted by the Government to avoid the fact that the NRTC was set up without inquiring into what the road industry was doing or expecting and, most importantly, without inquiring into how it would affect people in remote areas.

          Everywhere we went in Australia we received evidence of the effect full cost recovery would have in all areas, whether city, regional or remote. Of course, the remote areas felt the biggest effects of the lot. Evidence confirmed statements made by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, when he said that the road industry was taxed three and a half times any other industry. Yet, no recommendation was made whatsoever to recognise the fact that the industry is already overtaxed and should not be taxed any further.

          I will now turn to the impact of full cost recovery on rural and remote areas. I have already said that evidence has indicated that those areas will be affected the most. All the Committee as a whole could say was that in some cases freight rates would go down. They would come down in New South Wales because registration charges in that State are already high. So freight rates may drop and the benefits of that may be passed on. But if freight rates in New South Wales drop and even if the benefits of that are passed on, that does nought for remote areas in Western Australia. The Committee ignored that point altogether.

          Because of the higher registration charges in New South Wales, trucks are being licensed in other States. New South Wales is used as a corridor; when travelling from Queensland to Victoria and from Queensland to Western Australia, trucks cross New South Wales. New South Wales is not getting revenue from the registration of those trucks but it has the cost of repairing its roads. If New South Wales agreed to uniform registration charges, the trucks that should be registered in New South Wales would be. Evidence to the Committee suggested that this would happen.

          The main part of the inquiry concerned the effect of such charges, but the Committee totally ignored that issue. We have had evidence on top of evidence that higher registration charges would increase freight costs by 3 per cent, 5 per cent, 7 per cent or 8 per cent, depending on the State. Those increases do not seem very much, but when it comes to the effect on net profit they have a vast effect. For example, an increase of 6 per cent or 7 per cent in oncosts could wipe out a farm that is running at a 2 per cent profit.

          We also stated that the NRTC should look at the full effect of total taxation on the road transport industry and reflect that in its registration charges. The only recommendation in the main report was that the NRTC could publicise widely that it is looking for more evidence of the effect of such charges on the transport industry. I believe that is a very weak suggestion. The Committee should have recommended to this Parliament that total taxation be taken into account. I believe that the Committee should have recommended that the Government remove some of the unfairness in the road industry where, for instance, only 7c of the 26c a litre fuel excise from fuel sales goes towards improving roads.

          All in all, I certainly enjoyed the inquiry. It confirmed many things that I already knew. I enjoyed seeing some of the city based senators and the city based secretariat getting out into some of the remote areas such as Meekatharra, Cue and Bunbury—although Bunbury is not quite so remote—to see what those areas do for Australia and Australian exports. Hopefully they learnt something about what those people and those industries do. Once again, I condemn the Democrats for their non-action. They took the moral high ground in this case and did nothing whatsoever. They are not even here to listen today.

As my colleagues have said, one of the real problems with infrastructure in Australia, and one which impacts upon so much of Australia's being, is that the transport industry, which is so important in distributing Australia's wealth to those of us who live in the more removed areas, has enormous taxes place upon it. In fact, that brings me to one of the complaints we had with the NRTC—although it got around it a bit by going outside its charter, one might almost say, to do what the Opposition wanted it to do, even though when the Bill was going through the Parliament the Government would not accept our amendment on the point. The Government did not want the NRTC to fully look into all of the taxes on the transport industry that currently exist. In fact, the NRTC did some of that of its own accord.

          —It is $38,000. Under the coalition, that goes. It has this effect: the leasing costs on that $250,000 truck are, from memory, about $6,000 a year. If one takes off the $38,000, that brings the cost of the truck down. The leasing payments decrease to about $5,000. I am sure of this figure: leasing costs are $1,000 a month less when the sales tax is removed. In the case example that was done, the fuel tax saving amounts to some $26,000; the sales tax saving on tyres and repairs amounts to another $4,000. That truck operator can save some $44,000 every year if sales tax and fuel tax are removed. That is what we think should be done. We think the transport industry is overtaxed. That is why we were required to put in this minority report.

          Whilst not disagreeing with a lot of what the majority report said, we did go on to recommend that the Government should, as a matter of urgency, address the inherent unfairness of a fuel tax that collects 26c a litre from fuel sales but spends only 7c a litre on road construction. We further recommend that, in relation to the overtaxing of the transport industry, as part of overall tax reform, taxes should be removed from the transport industry by the abolition of sales tax from trucks, tyres, parts and other transport equipment. The minority members of the Committee certainly recommend that Government look at those things, that it adopt those sorts of policies, because that would result in a much fairer distribution of the tax burden and it would be a real boost to the transport industry and all of those people who rely on it.

         —The Imported Food Control Bill 1992 introduces point of entry inspection procedures for imported foods to ensure that they meet Australian food standards. Under Australian law, all Australian primary producers and food processors are required to meet very high food standards. This carries a considerable cost. Australian companies have been complaining that imported foods are cheaper because they are not a source of animal or plant disease and the States were responsible for inspecting food on supermarket shelves under their health authorities.

         In July 1990 the current system of food inspection, which covers only about 10 per cent of imports, was introduced under the health provisions of the Quarantine Act. It focuses on a small group of products assessed as high or medium risk to human health. Most imported food is not subjected to any inspection. Little is known about how it is grown or under what conditions it is processed. While some countries maintain an effective control over food production, others, which represent a significant proportion of our imports, do not. Allowing this sort of product onto our shelves before checking is a risk that should not be taken. It also gives imported products an economic advantage over product that must meet certain standards.

         Even the existing imported foods inspection program with only seven inspectors has found a significant incidence of non-compliance with food safety requirements in the limited amount of food it covers. In the first year, the program found that 8.4 per cent of risk categorised food failed for microbiological contamination, the presence of microtoxins and excessive levels of chemical residues. In the year just ended it was 6.8 per cent.

         Products found unacceptable overseas have been redirected to Australia because of our lack of point of entry monitoring, and products rejected in one State have been sent to another State. The National Food Authority, a joint Federal-State body which the coalition supports, has concluded that this is sufficient concern to warrant extending point of entry monitoring to all imported foods to ensure the same safeguards as local produce is subjected to. The States have also agreed. Australian exporters are also subject to very strict food standards imposed by the United States of America, Canada, the European Community, Japan and other countries—often at considerable cost.

         This legislation does three things. Firstly, it extends inspection coverage to all imported foods. The focus will remain on public health, but enforcement of other food standards requirements will be included. Secondly, there is provision for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to negotiate certificate arrangements with overseas authorities where AQIS is satisfied that they operate equivalent production control arrangements to those required of Australia. This would largely remove the need for inspection on arrival, although some inspection for auditing purposes would remain. Thirdly, the legislation provides for AQIS to negotiate quality assurance arrangements directly with overseas suppliers aimed at meeting Australian food law requirements.

         Monitoring intensity will reflect a food's compliance performance. Current arrangements where high risk classified foods are withheld from release until results of analysis are obtained, and medium risk foods allowed release, subject to possible recall, will continue. About 35 inspectors will be employed and they will come from existing AQIS staff. The inspection will be user pays; money being collected from the importer. The current cost of inspecting imported food is about $2m. It is expected that this Bill will add a further $4.5m to the cost. The total cost is only estimated to add about one-third of a cent to every dollar's worth of imported food.

         Importers will pay 100 per cent of all costs, which is identical to the charging of export inspection. The new import inspection system will overcome the problems in a point of sale monitoring approach by the States and local government bodies. It will also improve the present unsatisfactory labelling situation for imported food. However, the States and/or local authorities will be responsible for both food standards and labelling of domestic product. I know that this issue is very close to a number of important policy considerations that have been pursued in this Senate for some time by my colleague Senator Boswell, and I am sure that he will comment on it in the debate today. The new system will bring Australia into line with other Western nations.

         Last financial year, that is, 1991-92, Australia imported foodstuffs and skins worth $2.366 billion. This is up $42m from the 1990-91 figure. Of this $2.366 billion, $1.2 billion was for fish, live animals, tea, coffee, spices, beverages, hides and skins, while the remaining $1.1 billion was for food.

For live animals, the comparative figures are $73m in 1990-91 and $59.6m in the last financial year. Tea, coffee, cocoa and spices: $308.7m in 1990-91; in 1991-92, $309.2m. Feeding stuff for animals, in 1990-91 the figure was $65.2m; it is now up to $90m. Meat and meat preparations rose by nearly $6m in 1990-91; in 1991-92, the recorded figure was $42.5m. Dairy products, birds and eggs rose by $9m in 1990-91; for the financial year 1991-92, the total figure was $135m. Fish imports in 1990-91 were up by $30m; for 1991-92, a total of $474.5m—a very interesting figure. Cereal and cereal preparations in the last financial year reached $112m. For sugar, sugar preparation and honey—I am sure Senator Boswell would be well aware of this—in 1991-92, $59m worth was imported into Australia. Miscellaneous edible products and preparations for 1991-92 were $306m; and oilseed, which was recorded at $58m in 1990-91, reached $60m in 1991-92.

It is interesting to consider some of the import figures and from where they are derived: $12.3m from New Zealand; $7.8m from Spain; $4.7m from Canada; $3.4m from Thailand; $2.3m from Greece; $1.9m from Italy; $1.6m from China; and $1m from the USA.

         —The Imported Food Control Bill 1992 provides for the inspection of foods at their point of entry into Australia to ensure that they comply with Australia's very high food standards. As the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) pointed out in his second reading speech, under the current system only around 10 per cent of food imported into this country is actually inspected. The overall failure rate of food last year because of the presence of excessive chemicals or toxins was 6.8 per cent. So we agree that there is a need for a more stringent inspection system. This Bill is largely welcomed by the Democrats.

         The Bill provides for imported food to be rejected on a number of grounds, ranging from failing to meet labelling requirements to failing to meet public health standards. Under the Bill, there are three choices available to importers whose food is rejected: they can rework the food by reprocessing or relabelling it and then represent it for inspection. Alternatively, the food can be destroyed, or it can be re-exported to another country which may not have such stringent standards or inspection procedures.

         The reworking of food is a viable option when food fails on the grounds of such things as country of origin labelling. It is vital that both the nutritional and country of origin labelling on foods is accurate in order to give consumers as much information about the product as possible. Indeed, along with Senator Boswell, the Australian Democrats have long argued for tougher country of origin labelling so that consumers who choose to buy Australian-made products can do so with confidence.

         The Democrats recently proposed a new system of labelling which would leave consumers in no doubt as to how much of the product was actually made in Australia. We have recently begun a trial of this system at supermarkets in Adelaide, and it appears to be working well. So although proper labelling is important for consumers, it is a relatively simple matter for importers to correctly relabel products that have failed on those grounds and then to apply to reimport them.

         Food that fails on the grounds of not meeting our public health and safety standards is another matter. As the Minister points out, there have been disturbing reports of food that is contaminated by bacteria and micro-organisms, food with high levels of pesticides and toxic metals and food containing illegal additives and preservatives entering the country and going onto our supermarket shelves. Food that fails public health and safety standards cannot be reworked as easily as changing a label. Some of it can be made into food products for animal consumption and some of it will have to be destroyed, and the Bill provides for this.

         It is the third option the Democrats are most concerned about—the re-exportation of food that fails our public health and safety test. The food that has failed our tests can then go to a country which may not have such a high standard or such tough port of entry inspections. In a manner similar to toxic waste, some foods travel the world looking for a home or looking for entry at the weakest ports of inspection. Food actually goes port-hopping until someone takes it or until it can be reworked. It is not unusual for failed food to be reworked in Europe, normally by the process of irradiation, and then shipped off to another port.

Importers who do not want to risk having their food destroyed will soon learn to comply with our standards.

         Australian primary and manufacturing industries have taken a battering in recent years from imported food products. Imported food last year amounted to $2.366 billion, and that was up $42m on the previous year. To give some examples, vegetables and fruit imports increased last year by $86m to $469.1m; meat was up by $6m to $42.5m; dairy products were up $9m to $135m; fish was up $30m to $475m; and oil seeds increased to $60m. With orange juice alone, last year imports were up to $23m from $9m the previous year, and apple juice jumped from $5m to $13m. I think Senator Tambling mentioned some of those figures. Frozen vegetables increased in one year by $7m to $24m, and pineapples went up to $16.2m. That does concern me very much as a Queensland senator. With Golden Circle, we have a very fine pineapple industry in Queensland. Peanuts stood at $13.8m, and dried grapes increased from $8m to $13.8m.

Under these conditions, it is vital that all imported food be inspected at the point of entry into Australia. At the moment, imports go port-hopping.

The import market is growing at 30 per cent a year, but Australia supplies only 6 per cent of this market. Thirty-two per cent of Japan's imported processed food comes from the USA.

         Australia imports some $2 billion worth of food each year. The current system of imported food inspection, introduced from July 1990 under health provisions in the Quarantine Act, covers only around 10 per cent of this trade. It focuses on a small group of products assessed as high or medium risk in human health terms. I regret that it does not address the broader requirements of Australian food law. The Bill has been introduced to try to remedy that defect. At present it does not cover the importation of Canadian pigmeat. Australian pork producers are vitally concerned that the importation of subsidised Canadian pigmeat is undercutting prices and introducing disease into our market. It is producing a situation which gravely threatens to undermine the financial viability of the pork industry in Australia. Currently, the quality of Australian pork is now the highest in the world. We have no disease in it and we want to keep it that way. I believe that this Bill should take action to make sure that this happens. If we continue to import Canadian pigmeat, it will be open slather on the Australian market. As far as this Government is concerned, there will be no health inspection except for document checks.

         When the Government had these concerns raised by pork producers right across the country, all it said was that a limitation of 17,000 tonnes would be put on imports.

It is bad enough just trying to make ends meet working on the land in the current economic climate. Producers do not need to have their livelihoods threatened with the possibility of increased demand from inferior quality and disease-ridden products from overseas. However, the major problem the industry faces is that most other overseas pig producing industries receive the benefit of government subsidies.

        Consequently, the Pork Council of Australia put its case to the Australian Customs Service. That case was rejected earlier this month. The decision by Customs has made a mockery of the Government's claim of having the fastest and the best unfair trade protection mechanisms in the world. This decision absolutely refutes that claim and must act as a warning to all primary producers that the system does not work and will not protect Australian producers from subsidised imports. Customs said that it was satisfied that subsidies were paid or granted to Canadian producers which had a bearing on the prices paid by processors. However, it reasons that only a small proportion of that subsidy is added on in lower prices.

         The National Health Amendment Bill 1992 seeks to redress a current anomaly in the nursing home benefit payments scheme by enabling the recovery of overadvanced benefits. In addition, it introduces a legislative mechanism to protect the rights of the Commonwealth and prospective purchasers of nursing homes in relation to money owed in the form of overadvanced fees. The coalition supports both of these initiatives. Given the time constraints placed upon me by the Government's inability to manage its business, I am unable to add any more than that. I will leave the details to be dealt with by my colleague the shadow Minister for aged care, Senator Newman.

         I think it is important to reiterate the coalition's concern about nursing homes which are in financial difficulty because the Commonwealth can pursue them for overadvanced funding allocated prior to 1 July 1993. This is really a direct result of the Government's failure adequately to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and to carry out regular reviews. By clawing back funds advanced as far back as 1987, the Government is jeopardising the quality of care provided by some homes and putting their existence into doubt.

This Bill provides statutory confidentiality to information obtained from quality assurance activities and immunity from prosecution for those engaged in conducting these activities. My colleague Senator Herron will speak in depth on this Bill and outline the coalition's concerns about proposed clause 106N, which empowers the Minister to authorise disclosure of information about conduct that may constitute an indictable offence. It is widely believed that this discretion will substantially reduce the effectiveness of quality assurance and quality assurance activities and may undermine the primary purpose of this Bill. I have in fact referred one aspect of this particular clause to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills; I hope that it had time to look at that this morning. I will not speak further on the Quality Assurance Bill except to foreshadow that the Opposition will move an amendment in the committee stage to eliminate this ministerial discretion.

A Federal election must be called by May 1993 and this Bill is nothing, I believe, but a last gasp attempt by the dying Labor Government to force its own failed health policies onto the States for yet another five years. One must ask why the Government is so desperate to have this legislation enacted and the agreement signed. There is one reason, and one reason alone, why the Government wants to lock the States into its own failed brand of health care, regardless of whether it maintains power in Canberra.

He described Medicare as `the most inefficient and ramshackle hospital funding system one could imagine'. It is a very serious thing when a Minister resigns. A Labor Minister resigning at State level when there is a Labor government in power at the Federal level is absolutely amazing, but that is what happened. That is how bad he thought it was. He thought much of the rest of the health policy was bad, too. He raised a number of issues and concerns about the ramshackle system he was dealing with.

         If the Government had any courage at all and if the Democrats were really on about what they say they are on about, then we would allow this Bill to lie on the table and get on with the business of explaining to the public how these new agreements—that is, the Government's health policy—will address the crisis in our health care system. The Government would explain how its health policy would eliminate public hospital waiting lists, which are now between 70,000 and 100,000. It would explain why age pensioners are forced to struggle and save to pay for private health insurance and spend thousands of dollars every year on health insurance while somebody, for example, on $70,000 a year pays no health insurance and utilises space that could otherwise be better used by somebody who is in need.

It would explain why people who choose to pay to look after their own health care rather than relying on the public purse are given no incentive to do so—none whatsoever. They do it—many people over 65 in particular—because they are so afraid. They have seen what has happened to their next-door neighbour. They have seen what has happened to that lady who goes into my local news agency week after week deteriorating, requiring a total hip replacement. That is what they see.

         If the Minister went out and talked to people in hospitals, both private and public, as I have done around Victoria, he would hear them saying, `What we need is a system to encourage people to move into private health insurance'. The public hospitals are saying that as well as the private hospitals. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has stated that an election could be called at any time, the Government should not be allowed to force an even harsher form of its own failed system of health onto the States and Territories, as I said, for another five years. Instead, it must tell Australians why it persists with a health policy that has caused so much pain and hardship in our community.

         These are the real reasons why this Parliament should not blindly follow the Government, which is trying to force its inequitable and unfair system of health care onto the States and, as I said, onto Australians for yet another five years. The majority of State and Territory Ministers have recognised that this legislation will not achieve the desperately needed structural reforms of our ailing health care system. That was what Mr Wilson was talking about; he wanted real structural changes, real structural reforms.

         The problem is that the much needed structural reforms of our health care system are the last thing on this Government's mind. There is an election to win, and Labor believes that if it can run the myth that Medicare is an accessible, universal, free health care system, then it might just win that election. The Government wants to use the rhetoric in this Bill to perpetuate this cruel myth. It does not matter that the health care system that this Bill envisages is financially unattainable. This time last year, almost to the day, we saw a real change in health, a real structural reform; that was the introduction of the Medicare co-payment. We saw the distinct and real possibility of putting in a price signal for medical care, of getting a better service and of reducing overservicing, with the acceptance of about 70 or 75 per cent of the Australian community according to a number of studies. What did we see? A grab for a few votes, and Mr Keating does a backflip. Who should have the hide to talk about backflips?  For a couple of votes, one or two votes here in the Senate—maybe even one—overnight, a year ago today, we had a major structural improvement in health care overturned.

         The contents of the Bill show the real motivations behind the Government's attempt to force the new agreements onto the States prior to the Federal election. Currently the Government provides money to the States and Territories for public health care under the 1988 Medicare agreement. New five-year agreements to replace the current agreement which expires in June 1993, as we all know, are being negotiated. This Bill provides a framework under which these new agreements will be negotiated and moneys appropriated. It defines the categories of funding provided by the Commonwealth and stipulates the conditions to which the States and Territories must agree in order to receive the funding.

The Bill provides for five categories of financial assistance to the States and Territories: a base hospitals grant; a hospital bonus payment; a hospital incentive package; a mental health package; and other health service funding.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This financial assistance will be paid only if the States and Territories sign a formal agreement with the Commonwealth which complies with the heads of agreement at schedule 2A of this Bill. Among other things, this stipulates that funding be used for the purposes of providing public hospital services and that the States encourage the more effective provision of health services. Statistical information must be furnished to the Commonwealth, and a public patients hospital charter describing the application of Medicare principles to public hospitals must be distributed to the public.

         The Bill also provides that financial assistance will not be payable unless the States and Territories give effect or make reasonable efforts to give effect to the Medicare commitments and principles enshrined in this Bill. States and Territories must agree to pass complementary legislation in the terms of the commitments and principles in this Bill. These principles include: that eligible persons must be given the choice to receive public hospital services free of charge as public patients; that access to public hospital services is to be on the basis of clinical need; and that to the maximum practical extent a State or Territory must provide public hospital services equitably to all eligible persons, regardless of where they live. States and Territories must endorse two further Medicare commitments to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of hospital services delivery and to make available information on the public hospital services that eligible people can expect to receive. While laudable, these principles and commitments are hardly attainable under the existing Medicare scheme.

         At a time when the public hospital system cannot cope, both New South Wales and Victoria have expressed grave concern that the principles fail to recognise the important role that private health insurance has in the provision of health services—and that is not to be enshrined in this legislation, which is an issue, of course, in its own right—and the fact that individuals ought to have the right to choose to be treated in a public or private hospital supported by health insurance. These two States represent 60 per cent of all public hospitals and public patients in Australia. They have stated that they will not be signing the new agreement or enacting legislation complementary to the commitments and principles in this Bill. These two States, with the increase in the Medicare levy, stand to pay a huge amount but to get nothing back.

         It is estimated that over the life of the agreement the net loss to New South Wales from this initiative will be $544m, while Victoria will lose $711m. I think the claim by the Government that this incentive package will reform the State public hospital system is farcical. Equally ineffectual is the estimate of $70m over two years to reduce public waiting lists. We saw that happen before from 1987 to 1989. We had a sum of $50m matched dollar for dollar by the States in an attempt to reduce the waiting lists in public hospitals for elective surgery. Like its predecessor, this latest initiative is doomed to fail, because what are needed are structural reforms. The Government has been told over and over again, by Ministers of every colour, that we need structural reforms in the health system. This Bill confirms that the Government is unwilling and unable to implement the reforms that will deliver quality health care to Australians.

         The Bill sets out the statutory framework for the Government's quality assurance program, which aims to improve the quality of the delivery of health services within hospitals. There is little direct Australian data on the quality of patient outcomes—that is, the actual results of health care as far as the patients are concerned—because, until recently, we have had hardly any scrutiny of the quality of care in our health services, and we have not developed much direct evidence about patient outcomes. This is a particular problem when we want to examine adverse outcomes for patients. Unfortunately, when we start to look at when, where and how things went wrong, much of what we have to base our information on is really just anecdotal evidence.

         , the Health Issues Centre identified two reasons why we find ourselves in this situation. Firstly, we have within our hospital and health services an inadequate infrastructure on which quality measures can be built. Secondly, there is continuing antagonism from some very vocal sections in the medical profession towards any independent form of quality assurance. But things are changing. There is now a recognition within the health professions that quality of care is an issue that cannot be evaded. At present, a range of measures are in place to address the issue of quality in the delivery of health services. These range from formal to informal activities. Some have been instituted by governments and others by the health professions themselves.

         This Bill aims to encourage quality assurance activities by providing statutory immunity to any information or documentation which becomes known or is created specifically and solely for quality assurance purposes. This is an attempt to overcome the reluctance of some health professionals when it comes to reporting problems or poor processes in hospitals because of the fear that they may be sued.

         Many consumer groups have been highly critical of this move towards immunity. They argue that granting immunity turns what should be an open and accountable process into a closed and very defensive one. They also argue that the obsession with obtaining immunity reflects a narrow, very medical approach to quality assurance where specific medical treatment practices are examined. But other quality issues, which may be just as important to consumers, could be easily ignored—for example, the availability of interpreters; issues relating to informed consent; and issues such as discharge planning. Immunity is also seen by some as reflecting an overriding concern on the part of hospitals and doctors with avoiding litigation, or at least minimising the risk of it, at the expense of ensuring better community accountability to consumers.

         Those concerns are valid, but we have to acknowledge the day-by-day reality of medical practice in hospitals. The reality is that the assurance process will not work and, therefore, will not be successful in reducing adverse patient outcomes unless there is some level of statutory protection. The way that the immunity is structured under the Bill is such that the Minister will be able to declare, by disallowable instrument, the Act to apply to a particular quality assurance activity.

         A person who acquires information which becomes known solely as a result of declared quality assurance activity must not make a record of that information or disclose it to another person or a court. Similarly, a court cannot require a person to produce any documentation which was brought into existence solely for the purpose of the declared quality assurance activity. In other words, material which becomes known or is created specifically for quality assurance purposes cannot be used anywhere else. Other material which exists independently of the quality assurance activity—which includes all sorts of information on file in hospitals; it may be pathology reports, X-rays, et cetera—may still be used in court.

         However, the Government is not putting up a total immunity for quality assurance activities. It is proposing an exemption to the immunity. This is where I come to clause 106N. That clause states that if it appears to the Minister that the information relates to conduct that may have been a serious offence against a law in force in any State or Territory, the Minister may authorise the information to be disclosed for the purposes of law enforcement, a royal commission or any other prescribed purpose. A serious offence is defined as one being punishable by imprisonment for more than a year. The Government has put up an amendment which purports to make it clear that the Minister's authority to disclose is limited to factual information and will not extend to statements of opinion or general comments.

         The exemption from statutory immunity has provoked very strong arguments both for and against its inclusion in the Bill. I have talked with several individuals and organisations and there are certainly very convincing arguments on both sides. Those arguing in favour of dropping the exemption and providing a blanket immunity for quality assurance activities say that giving the Minister this discretion will undermine the quality assurance programs themselves. They believe the process can only be effective where practitioners are able to freely discuss their actions with their peers, assured of absolute confidentiality. They argue that in practice, where any sort of fairly serious problem arises, a practitioner will contact the Medical Defence Fund and will be advised: `Say nothing. There is no total statutory immunity, therefore, do not get involved'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, those supporting total immunity argue that such protection does not prevent likely offences from being pursued. Information and data on files and records which have not been raised in a quality assurance activity are still available to be used in other ways, for example, through hospital credentialling, professional disciplinary tribunals, criminal investigations or civil litigation.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On the other side of the fence, we have equally strong arguments for leaving the exemption in place. Probably the most compelling of these is that the exemption really represents an attempt to balance public interest considerations against the value of confidentiality in the quality assurance process. Despite some fears by doctors, the exemption really does not open up the quality assurance process to any great and alarming extent. If a practitioner has committed a serious offence, the argument goes, then he or she should not be permitted to hide behind quality assurance activity and there must be some alternative avenue through which information can be obtained for the possible legal processes, and it can be responsibly used.

         Those arguing against total immunity say that, while it is appropriate to offer protection within the quality assurance process where a practitioner has made a mistake or an error in judgment, it is not appropriate where a criminal offence has been committed. Unlike negligent acts or omissions, a criminal offence requires an intention to commit a specific act. Criminal negligence does not involve a strict test of intention, but the elements of the offence involve a reckless disregard for human life. Why should practitioners who intentionally commit serious offences, or are guilty of criminal negligence, be provided with total immunity as part of the quality assurance process? Indeed, I do not think the general public would support that total level of statutory immunity.

         In the end—and I must stress that we devoted a great deal of time to this in discussion—we have decided not to support a blanket immunity. I think there is an overriding public interest consideration which basically says that quality assurance is there for the consumers of health services, it is not there to protect intentional criminal activities by health professionals. Having said that, I am still concerned about the purposes for which disclosure can be made by the Minister. I do not have any great difficulty with disclosure for the purposes of law enforcement on royal commissions, but I am not happy at all with the other part of the exemption; the part which will allow for any other prescribed purpose.

         It is one thing to say that people participating in quality assurance have protection if the matter needs to go before the law or a royal commission, but what exactly does `any other prescribed purpose' mean? Presumably such purpose will turn up in regulations at some point, but unfortunately tonight we do not have those regulations before us. Health professionals would, I believe, be entitled to feel rather edgy about the potential size of the hole that could be blown in the whole quality assurance process by this particular wording.

         I now turn to the Medicare Agreements Bill 1992. This Bill is a significant piece of legislation which lays down the basis for the Commonwealth Government to enter into new Medicare agreements with the States for the provision of hospital and other services. It seems that the Commonwealth is having some difficulty in getting all States to sign the new agreement. I understand that until recently there was an insistence that the agreement had to be signed prior to the release of $50m allocated in the 1992-93 Federal Budget. This was specifically allocated to cut waiting lists.

         Following approaches from both the New South Wales Government and the Victorian Government, as well as several other organisations interested in this issue, the Democrats agreed to refer this Bill to a Senate committee. I need to make it very clear why we did so. It is not because we have any great sympathy with the desire expressed by some governments, particularly New South Wales and Victoria, to have the role of private health insurance formally incorporated into the Medicare principles. We do not have any problem at all with doctors and other health professionals practising in a private capacity and do not have any problems with hospitals being privately owned or operated. But we do have a problem with private health insurance being seen as anything other than a supplement to Medicare and we do not believe that it is appropriate for formal endorsement of private health insurance to be incorporated into Medicare.

We have to ask, `Why the hurry?'. Surely, the Parliament should have proper opportunity to examine this legislation. After all, it is setting down parameters for agreements which will have a very significant impact on the delivery of health services in this country up to the next century.

I am aware of claims in some quarters that the New South Wales and Victorian governments are just running their own agendas. Indeed they may well be, but they certainly have the right to be heard and to put all their information on the table. Then, of course, we will have the right to ask the Government whether we should be basing our decisions on these sets of figures.

         The third concern is about the conditions being imposed on the States in order to actually receive funding under this agreement.

         The opposite point of view is that the Commonwealth should be much tougher on the States and should have strings attached to such large amounts of money. There are some groups in the community which have been arguing to us that the strings should be much tighter. One such group is the Chelmsford Victims Action Group in New South Wales which has pointed to that State's Health Care Complaints Bill. It states that this Bill appears to be seriously flawed, but it would be sufficient for New South Wales to meet fairly general obligations to establish a complaints mechanism as set out in this Medicare Agreements Bill. The Chelmsford group—based on its own horrific experiences of inaction by both the medical profession and a series of State governments—argues that the Bill should really be detailed in a very codified form to compel the States to follow very specific sets of terms and conditions.

         As we have stated before, the Democrats are not interested in a system which hands over funds unconditionally to the States. We believe the Commonwealth Government has an obligation to taxpayers to ensure the States spend Federal funds responsibly, as well as an obligation to all those people who are currently on waiting lists. Contrary to what the anachronistic States rights lobby likes to imply, the States are not little independent nations who can run around and do their own thing without any obligation. Indeed, sometimes I think we do not work as closely together as the countries of Europe are now trying to do; after all, we are supposed to be one nation.

The Democrats can see no reason to support any call for Federal health funds to be simply handed over to the States with no questions asked and no strings attached. I do not have time to go into the particular principles and commitments set out in the Bill.

It spends 12.4 per cent of its GDP on health while we spend around 8 per cent. Per capita expenditure on health is $2,566 per year, which is more than double the amount we spend. The United States has 4.7 hospital beds per 1,000 people; we have 9.8. Its infant mortality rate is exceeded amongst OECD countries only by Turkey and Portugal.

It would ensure our hospital system remains one of the best in the world and that it continues to be funded via taxation rather than through contributions to private insurance funds.

There will be no businesses left in the country; there are not too many left now after 10 years of Labor rule. If we were ever in a situation of having the Democrats rule, God forbid! I think we would all go to Macquarie Island—the penguins would be preferable.

         I rise to speak as the shadow Minister for the aged—I will not be addressing the health issues—on the National Health Amendment Bill 1992, which amends the National Health Act 1953. It comprises two distinct elements: firstly, a fundamental revision of the nursing home benefit payments scheme; and, secondly, a legislative mechanism designed to protect the rights of the Commonwealth and prospective purchasers of approved nursing homes.

         If we look at the nursing home benefit payments scheme, we see that both the present home funding system and the previous system which existed pre-1986-87 were and are based, to an extent, on cost reimbursement. Funds are advanced to proprietors during the year and at the end of the year that advanced funding is acquitted against the costs incurred by the nursing home in providing that care. This means that, where a proprietor spends less on providing nursing home care than was advanced during the year, the amount of unspent or overadvanced funding must be repaid to the Commonwealth. However, these overpaid or underpaid moneys are not legally characterised as recoverable debts or entitlements, and therein lies the problem.

         An idiosyncrasy of the principal Act means that such debts can be recovered or paid only by fee loadings and not as debts which can be pursued through the courts. This means that proprietors who accrue a liability to the Commonwealth for overadvanced funding and then sell their nursing homes cannot be pursued for that overadvanced funding following the sale of the nursing home. There is, however, a statutory duty to recover that benefit from the fees of the new proprietor. This Bill seeks to change the system so that the person who accrues the liability can be pursued for the money, even though he or she no longer owns the nursing home. Unfortunately, the Bill changes the system only prospectively. Any benefits paid prior to the introduction of this change will not be subject to its provisions.

         While the amendment is welcomed by the industry—and also by the Opposition—there is some concern about the fact that the Bill changes the system only prospectively. Many nursing homes around the country have suddenly found themselves liable for huge debts—sums of $96,000, $150,000, $250,000 and $300,000—all because the Commonwealth says that services rendered several years ago by the home, often under the management of a different proprietor, cannot be proven. Overadvanced Commonwealth funds are now being clawed back. I believe it verges on immorality, but that is perhaps for a wider audience to decide.

         The basic problem is that it is only now that the Commonwealth is carrying out across-the-board assessments to see whether money advanced to the home as far back as 1986-87 can be substantiated by receipts. Any reasonably minded person would ask: why has the Commonwealth not been doing these validations and assessments every year?  Why has it been allowed to go on so long, with the result that so much is deemed to be owing for such a long period?  I think taxpayers are entitled to know that the government of the day is monitoring how it is spending its money. Of course they are. Nursing home owners could continue their operations for the next year with full knowledge of their financial situation. That is surely only reasonable.

         Let me give the Senate some examples which highlight the problem. A nursing home operated by the Association for the Blind in Western Australia has recently been presented with a bill for $250,000 for overadvanced benefits dating back to 1985. Where has the Government been all this time?  That money is now being clawed back from the Association for the Blind at the rate of $5,000 a month. Talk about taking pennies off the eyes of dead men!

         As a result, the nursing home is operating at a deficit because it refuses to compromise on the standard of service. Would anybody in this chamber expect the home to reduce the standard of service to blind, elderly people in its care?  Of course not. Yet this Government is clawing back $5,000 a month from the Association for the Blind because this debt—if it is agreed to be a debt and that is still in doubt and being disputed—goes back for so many years. Despite 15 months of representations to both the political and the bureaucratic system by the Association, this matter is still unresolved. The Association has now, rightly in my view, sought legal advice.

         Let me briefly give the Senate another example. A nursing home in Sydney was purchased last year. The new proprietor is now being hit with a bill close to $150,000. Although the Commonwealth had to approve of the purchase of the nursing home, the new proprietor was not advised by either the previous proprietor or the Department of the possibility of this debt hanging over her head. The Commonwealth is reducing the daily per resident subsidy until it reclaims the $150,000. That proprietor is taking legal action against the Commonwealth.

         Let me turn to the mechanism to address the sale or transfer of a nursing home. The mechanism provides for a requirement to give notice of a sale of a home; the identification as far as possible about standing overpayments and fee loadings prior to the sale; the disclosure of such financial information to prospective buyers—thank goodness, at long last; and the recovery of overpayments at the point of sale and from the proceeds of sale. Proprietors, who are the vendors in the transaction, will be required to give notice of sale and will be deterred from completing the sale within 90 days of giving notice. Purchasers will also be required to give notice of their intent to purchase.

         The period of notice will enable the vendor's claims, books and records to be scrutinised so that prior to completion a fair estimate can be made of any overpayment and any anticipated fee loading which relate to the period up to the sale. Prior to or at completion of the sale, the purchaser will be required to pay to the Commonwealth from the purchase price the amount of the estimated overpayment. Such payments will be deemed to be paid to the vendor as consideration under the contract of sale.

         If the amount paid by the purchaser is less than the estimated overpayment, the vendor will be required to make up the difference. The amount of any anticipated fee loading will be advised to both parties so that appropriate provisions can be made. Immediately after completion of the sale, the actual overpayment relating to the period up until the sale will be determined. Any amount held in trust by the Commonwealth will then be acquitted against the actual overpayment. If a greater amount is held in trust, the balance will be paid to the vendor. If a lesser amount is held, the outstanding amount will be recoverable as a debt. These changes are intended to afford greater protection to the rights of the Commonwealth to money owed to it—properly so—and the rights of the purchasers to information about the home they are buying and to a home unencumbered by liabilities accrued by the previous owner.

         Both the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals and the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association believe that this proposal is sensible and that it will certainly avoid repetition of the situations I have described that have led to these enormous debts hanging over the heads of nursing homes. However, while agreeing with the general principle, both those organisations are concerned with the technical approach taken to fundamental contract law. I suppose only the implementation of the legislation and seeing it working in practice will determine whether their concerns are justified. Unfortunately, so many changes in the aged care area seem to have been based on a `suck it and see' arrangement. It is also unfortunate that so many of the changes that have been made have turned out to be not all that satisfactory in practice.

That is not to say that there is not support for this legislation. Clearly, there is a recognition that it is fixing up an area that has long needed fixing up. I only regret that the Government has not seen fit to move to redress the situation of those who have incurred these debts, for want of a better word, or these liabilities—perhaps that is not the word either. Nevertheless, the people who owed money to the Commonwealth prior to the date of this legislation being implemented are in the same position in which they have been all this time.

         It is unsatisfactory. I think the Government should look again at these enormous burdens which are being placed on proprietors who have had this liability and see whether something cannot be done to ease the burden. The example that I gave the Senate of the Association of the Blind in Western Australia, I think, is unconscionable. I fail to understand why it is that the entreaties of the Association have been met with such intransigence, both from the departmental advisers to the Government and from the Government itself.

I cannot imagine how the Minister can explain away the justification for removing that money, because clearly it will affect the care that is given to residents in that nursing home today purely on the basis of care that was given to previous residents in that nursing home in the past. I do not think there is any argument that the care was given. The Commonwealth claims only that that money should rightfully be back in the Commonwealth coffers.

         It sounds like a pretty cold-hearted government to me that would rob the blind, but there it is. It has not moved to take any action to help that nursing home or the others which are also in difficulties as a result of the existing legislation. At least we can be glad that the legislation is now being amended so that it will not be able to happen in the future, but for the sake of those who are already caught in that trap I urge the Government to look very seriously at what it can do to help them in their current difficulties.

Mr Deputy President, you know as well as I do that Queensland has had a free public hospital system for 50 years. Senator Jones, who is in the chamber, is also aware of that. For 50 years, people have been able to go along to a public hospital and get free treatment. In 1973 the now Governor-General presented his Green Paper, which was the progenitor of Medibank. Some public servants in Queensland might not have been born then, but the Queensland public hospital system was the model that developed in Mr Hayden's mind to be unleashed on the rest of Australia.

Once the patient has that appointment and is seen by the orthopaedic surgeon, if he decides that the patient needs a joint replacement, have a guess how long it takes to get that joint replacement. If the patient is lucky, it is 24 weeks before the date of the operation. That is providing it is not over Christmas, because the orthopaedic department closes down over Christmas. A patient is lucky if it is not over Easter. So the waiting period will probably end up being a year.

         I hear Senator Lees talk about how the Democrats would do it. I can tell the Democrats that it has been done in the world. I was in France a couple of months ago, and I investigated the French health system. Everybody loves it. Every patient loves it because there is no difficulty of access. All the doctors love it because they can treat people unfettered by the constraints of money. There is only one problem. This year France is already two billion francs in debt. The country cannot afford it. I have with me some of the posters being put out in France. It is appealing to its patients. The posters read, `Dear Patient, do you really need to go to the doctor?

         Having said that, I again was amazed that Senator Lees has just found out about quality assurance. Quality assurance has been in existence for at least 300 years that I know of, with the formation of the royal colleges and in particular the royal colleges of surgeons. Quality assurance is what medical care has been all about ever since it was institutionalised. The peer review processes, the mortality meetings that occur and the grand rounds that have occurred in all the major teaching hospitals of Australia are evidence of that. It has been going on for centuries.

         —Yes, indeed, I want to talk about an outrage. Some years ago Harold Wilson, who was then Prime Minister of Great Britain, was credited with making the statement that a week is a long time in politics. I am quite sure he was not the first to say that, but he has got the credit for it. Since that time it has been endlessly paraphrased by people saying that a day is a long time in politics. Indeed, that paraphrasing is far more accurate because a day is certainly a long time in the life of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr John—`If the GST goes, I go'—Hewson. Yesterday morning, at 8.45, Dr Hewson appeared on the Rod Henshaw program and was asked the following question:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . at the moment you're considering changes to the Fightback! package, specifically exempting food from the GST. What can you tell us about that, how about a scoop?
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Hewson replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well, there's been a lot of speculation over the entire time since the package came out, and some of it's wishful thinking on the part of some people. What we've said is that we'd keep the package constantly under review . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage, Mr Henshaw broke into the interview and said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that's political double talk by saying anything could happen, isn't it?
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Hewson replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well, no. I mean, at this stage we're not making any substantial change, but as I say, we keep it under review. More importantly though, there are parts of the package we are yet to announce. There are elements of the package that we foreshadowed, the detail of which we haven't announced. Now, that that sort of thing we've been doing quite a lot of work on and hopeful of saying something about that fairly shortly . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The interviewer interrupted again and said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Could exempting food from it be one of them?
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Hewson replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No, What I'm really talking about is some of the other changes in relation to depreciation, child care, some of those areas where we hadn't specified the detail.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yesterday morning at 8.45, Dr Hewson categorically ruled out any exemption of food from the goods and services tax. Later in the day—that is, at 2.20 p.m. on the same day—Dr Hewson conducted a doorstop interview after meeting Archbishop Hollingworth. During this interview, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I'm going to take an opportunity on 18 December. I've booked the Press Club and I thought at that occasion I would review the year and review the progress we've made with Fightback. I draw attention to the fact that the recession is deeper and more protracted than the Government has admitted and I think, quite frankly, than most people thought.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later Dr Hewson was asked:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Do these new initiatives include any variations on the GST policy?
       </para>

        Dr Hewson replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We will make some changes . . . but the focus won't be on the changes so much as it will be on the new initiatives that we'll announce in the context of the worst recession in 60 years.

        was correct  this morning—which I knew, having heard the interview yesterday. Dr Hewson has done a total double backflip in 24 hours. Yesterday, at a quarter to 9 in the morning, he categorically ruled out any exemption of food from the GST and today on

         Senator Tambling made an extraordinary statement on ABC radio in response to a question about the effects of a GST on isolated communities when he said, `The price of just about every product on the shelf in every shop is going to be reduced'. I notice that Senator Tambling has come into the chamber now. His partner on the ticket from the Northern Territory, Mr Arthur Palmer, was caught out very badly by Dr John Hewson and Tim Fischer on national television telling an untruth. Arthur Palmer said on the public record that he had been privately briefed by Dr Hewson that the GST would be set at 12.5 per cent. Dr Hewson and Mr Tim Fischer on national television categorically denied that they had told Arthur Palmer any such thing.

         We now have a situation whereby on ABC radio the shadow Minister Senator Grant Tambling has publicly claimed—obviously not realising what his colleagues had said—that he had been consulted by Dr Hewson and knew about these changes and what they were to be, despite the flat statements from Mr Howard that he had not been; from Mr Reith, the shadow Treasurer, that he had not been; and from the Leader of the National Party in London saying that he had not been consulted. I think Senator Tambling has an obligation to clarify the public record.

         It is interesting to reflect on the prescience of columnists such as Gerard Henderson, who could not be accused on his worst day of being a one-eyed supporter of the Labor Party. In a column he wrote on Fightback on 10 December 1991—I referred to it today in Question Time—headlined `Hewson digging his own policy grave' he pointed out the fraud contained in Fightback over the employment projections. He said quite accurately—of course, it is contained in the Fightback document—that the analysis that has been made of the employment projections in Fightback is not based on the Fightback document at all, but in fact is based on projections made by the Industry Commission in a number of its reports on the job projections it predicts if all of its recommendations in respect of micro-economic reform were implemented. Gerard Henderson stated:

         In other words, the firm warranty that some 2 million jobs `will' be created and unemployment halved by the end of the century is just a guess. Well meaning, no doubt. Yet a hypothesis just the same. What is more, the AEM model on which this overtly optimistic promise is based does not take into account the inflationary impact of the Coalition's across-the-board goods and services tax (GST). It is all pie in the sky.

         I would hope that Messrs Hewson, Reith and Fischer can create an economic climate where 2 million and more jobs are created. But it is a matter of record that the evidence for this expression of faith is not to be found in almost 600 pages of Fightback! documentation.

        The extraordinary double backflip performed by the `immovable, inflexible' Dr Hewson—to quote him—in 24 hours in wanting to dump the Fightback policy and change its basic structure has got nothing to do with Archbishop Hollingworth. It has nothing to do with any rational approach to economics. It is a very familiar—to a fellow politician—attempt to try to shore up and protect a highly endangered leadership. What happened between yesterday morning, when we were told there would be no change and no exemption, and today is quite simply that some Liberal Party colleagues of Dr Hewson said to him—and I can understand this happening—`John, if you don't agree to soften up, if you don't agree to backtrack, if you don't agree to make some changes, we'll take you up on your invitation that if the GST goes you will go'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The reason Dr Hewson cannot enumerate what changes are to be made in Fightback is that, at this point in time, not only do his senior shadow ministerial colleagues not know—I quote Mr Howard again specifically saying, `Frankly, I don't know'—but Dr Hewson does not know, either. Between now and 18 December a number of consultants will have the computers working flat out to try to work out how a new model can be produced and, at the same time, make the figures add up.

         The reason I am speaking on the adjournment this evening—and I have referred to the very prescient comment of Gerard Henderson some time ago under the headline `Hewson digging his own policy grave'—is that this rewrite of Fightback, which is occurring under fairly panic-stricken conditions at the moment, will give the Opposition an opportunity now to do what it did not do in the original document. The reworking that is going on will give it an opportunity to restructure the economic model that it uses; to use an economic analysis—a computer analysis of `son of Fightback', or whatever it calls this new approach—to actually produce a real projection of the likely economic growth and the likely employment growth of its new model.

         —The Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, is obviously very indicative of the changes that have happened today in the Labor Party and how it is reacting to the fact that the agenda has moved. The Labor agenda has again focused back to the principal areas that were very important on 21 November last year when Fightback caught the imagination of the Australian community. Many things have happened in that 12-month period. But most importantly, of course, we need to be reminded of what has happened to the economy in that period. We need to be reminded of just how bad it has become and the number of things that the Labor Party has just not been able to address. In fact, it has compounded the problems in the community.

Let me quote from the transcript of that particular interview that I gave this morning. I will refer to two comments, one by Senator Collins here just a few moments ago and one today in Question Time by Senator Button when he obviously drew on comments that were passed on to him or thrown to him by Senator Collins.

         Senator Collins made a great deal about the fact that I was consulted by Dr Hewson. I would hope that I am regularly consulted by the Leader of the Opposition, whose team I am proud to be part of. I am a member of the front bench of the Liberal and National parties shadow Ministry. I engage in regular discussions with all of my colleagues, particularly as they affect my portfolio. Let me just read from the transcript a question I was asked this morning. At the end of the interview, the reporter, Clare Martin, said:

        It is very clear that I have certainly been consulted in respect of all of the policy directions of the Liberal and National parties in the last 12 months. In all of the developments that are currently going on, I am part of that process and proud to be so. Similarly, this afternoon at Question Time Senator Button was obviously reacting to some sort of dig in the ribs from someone else. Senator Button, in responding to a question from Senator Hill, said:

        Senator Button also would do very well to look at the transcript of the interview. A large number of issues were addressed in that interview this morning. It went, I think, for eight or 10 minutes. Following on from some earlier questions relating to the introduction, the reporter asked me:

I make no apology for the statement that Senator Collins attributed to me that every product on every shelf in every shop in Australia has its price increased at every stage of production by Labor's hidden indirect consumption taxes and other taxes. Of course, the flow-on effects right through will compound those costs, particularly for people living in remote and rural parts of Australia.

         The cost of food will get a tremendous fillip from the impact of the Fightback initiatives. Senator Collins, despite his portfolio responsibility, did not comment on the transport costs and the changes that will accrue and flow through to people living in remote and rural northern parts of Australia. Under Fightback, we will abolish the petroleum fuel excise and its flow-on effects will mean that the cost of freight in country areas will be slashed.

They will all have a dramatic and major impact. Senator Collins did not mention one of those issues. He did not stand up for the electorate that we both represent.

Well might the Labor Party be terrified because Fightback has been very well accepted by the community. At least it is a platform on which we can go to the people and say, `We will clean up the mess that we are in'. We did not create the one million unemployed. We did not lift the debt position from about $32 billion to over $200 billion, as the Government has. That is the fear of the Labor Party.

         Senator Collins carried on for approximately 20 minutes about the fact that the Liberal Party is exercising a responsible position which is eminently defensible and is reviewing its policies with respect to the Australian community in 1992-93. When we wrote Fightback, we had no idea that we would have one million unemployed or that we would have a balance of payments situation that would be totally out of control and very dangerous for the standard of living of the Australian community. We had no idea that we would be faced with a Budget deficit this year of at least somewhere between $6 billion and $8 billion. That is why we are changing our policy, and that is why, when the policies are out, a Liberal government will be returned at the next election.

One particular piece of the Minister's own work which fascinated me was his obvious compassion and sensitivity and his awareness of the views of leading church people around the country as evidenced by the fact that on not only one, but on two, occasions Senator Collins referred to `Archbishop Hollingsworth'. I would have thought that anyone in this chamber would know that it is Archbishop Hollingworth, without an `s'. For someone who, only a matter of a couple of minutes ago, took exception to what he thought was a slight mispronunciation of the name `Hewson' not to even understand the Archbishop's correct surname, I think gives us an insight into the Minister's true sensitivity in that area.

The Government has not laid a glove on them; we have not heard boo since that time; and they have gone down very well in the industry and the wider community.

         Senator Collins put it on the table and what happened? He was called in by the Prime Minister and told what he thought was the new model. This has nothing to do with what the Committee or anyone else might have thought. This was simply policy making on the run of the highest order. The extraordinary thing was that the media was actually captivated by this for a few days and thought it was all great stuff. One does not bother consulting, looking at the facts or researching all the issues; one simply comes to a conclusion.

Therefore, it is quite obvious that he does know what is going on in his area of responsibility.

         Senator Collins may be the grand exception. I have no doubt that he regards himself as an expert in every field with a view on every issue that he would be more than happy to proffer. That is probably another very good reason why the Prime Minister would not even bother consulting him in his own area, which he did not do on pay television, let alone in any other area.

         So to somehow suggest that John Howard is only aware of what might be in the package in relation to industrial relations is to show the paucity and poverty of Senator Collins's argument. It demonstrates that he is absolutely desperate; he is very sorry indeed that he did not take what he might now regard as a golden opportunity; and he is very twitchy about the fact that it is a whole new ball game. I can assure him that it is.
