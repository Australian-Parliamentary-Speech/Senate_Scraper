         The Opposition has learnt, I think, from the public horror at the GST proposal and has hidden the details of its GST and other taxes. It has yet to answer the Treasurer's call for details. I hope the Opposition will make more information available before the election, or will it let Sir William Cole's secret GST office, staffed by the big accounting firms, determine the taxes? Senator Hill knows what it wanted to tax; it wanted to tax non-prescription drugs, artificial limbs, hearing aids, wheelchairs and crutches—more purist ideology on the human factors. When that leaked out, the Opposition had to exclude the lot from the GST list.

         What else does the GST office have in mind that the Opposition wants to keep secret until after the next election? There are numerous taxes which could be imposed, of course, on all sorts of things from swimming lessons to school excursions, the food component of school boarding fees, bicycle helmets, school uniforms, wedding rings—a whole lot. We heard all about this in the Senate in relation to the wholesale sales tax and now we are starting to hear about it in relation to the GST.

It is an agreement similar to the one negotiated in 1991 with SPC. The agreement is a win-win outcome; it is a win for the employers and a win for the unions and the workers that those unions represent. The agreement will introduce into that company a degree of profit sharing and it will introduce a consultative committee to sort out management-worker conflict—a consultative committee comprising management, workers and their unions. It is an agreement that will introduce a degree of flexibility in terms of the taking of rostered days off, and a career structure and new classification structure which will simplify the old more complicated classification structure.

         This is an example of our industrial relations policy working. This agreement is currently before the Industrial Relations Commission for endorsement. It is not an example of the Opposition's big bang theory, by which it wants to turf everyone right out of the industrial relations system and it would be possible to get back into it only with the agreement of the other party. This is an example of a company and its workers working together.

         There are now several hundred such agreements in Australia. The silent revolution we are seeing in industrial relations in Australia is typified by this agreement and by many others. It is being achieved cooperatively, without dispute. It is not the old industrial relations policy that honourable senators opposite presided over during the Fraser years and would wish to reintroduce, were they ever to have the chance of occupying the treasury bench. I commend it as a good example of the sort of workplace agreement now taking place around Australia.

         As I said, it was an agreement negotiated by the management and the unions on behalf of the workers concerned. It should be noted for the record that the SPC management has been full of praise for the role that the ACTU played in these negotiations and for the cooperative approach of the unions in meeting the particular needs of that company. I think it is currently before the Industrial Relations Commission for ratification.

         I conclude by saying that the role of the Industrial Relations Commission here is to ensure that this is a fair agreement. It has to look at the criterion that an agreement does not lower conditions below those provided for in minimum rate awards of the Commission. So it has to be fair to the people it covers. The Commission, in considering an agreement, has to be sure that the people covered by it feel bound by it and will honour it, and it has to be sure that there is a dispute settling procedure built into the agreement. In other words, it has to be a fair and reasonable agreement.

         That has to be contrasted to the Howard-Hewson Kennett-Gude view of industrial relations in which it is the law of the jungle—the strong will prevail while the weak will suffer, the exploiters will overcome the exploitees and there will be no standards at all to ensure elementary fairness. Our approach to resolving industrial matters is a best and fairest approach. It provides the best economic outcomes and the fairest results for all concerned.

It is stated clearly that the Government would consider reforms to the domestic interest withholding tax, the scope of the prescribed payments system and the fringe benefits tax system. In the circumstances in which I have outlined and which are described fairly well by what I said in Melbourne a few weeks ago, which Senator Hill quoted from in his question, those things were mentioned in the Budget documents.

He drew attention to the difficulties which, for example, the abolition of payroll tax would have for small businesses at that time. The point of the question is that small business would be amongst the biggest losers under a goods and services tax.

         Even in the hands of the most articulate Opposition spokesmen—and there are not too many of them—the goods and services tax revolves around a trade-off between the new tax paid for the abolition and the reduction of other taxes. This is something which small business will oppose. People running small businesses have to ask themselves how many of the taxes which would be abolished under Fightback or any other GST proposal they actually pay. This was the point Senator Short was making some years ago. There are 830,000 businesses in Australia. Most of these are small businesses. All of them would have to fill out GST forms. Compare that with the number of people who currently have to handle the paperwork generated by other taxes such as payroll tax and wholesale sales tax. Of all our businesses, more than 700,000 of those 830,000 do not pay payroll tax.

The Opposition tries to compare itself with the rest of the world; it should look at the equivalent taxes which are paid in Europe and North America in respect of employment of labour.

         —Why does not Senator Macdonald shut up for a minute, instead of interjecting all the time. Abolishing payroll tax and replacing it with a GST is not a sensible response. In fact, a GST is a much heavier burden on employment because a GST is a tax on the value added of labour, each step up the productive chain. It is a distraction. It has been elevated to crucial importance by the Opposition. It is essentially a switch in the tax base from income to expenditure.

         It is a centrepiece of a policy which assumes, wrongly, that industry competitiveness is driven exclusively by price related factors. It is a magic wand policy and magic wands do not work in the real world. The whole issue of the impact of GST and the Fightback proposal on industry is that Fightback just assumes that the competitiveness of industry is related entirely to price factors. Everybody out there in industry land knows that that is not so. The Opposition's narrow ideological commitment, which enables its Leader to see through a keyhole with both eyes at one time, has led it down this silly accountants' track.

Thirdly, does the Government accept that the growing trend towards separation, transportation and stockpiling of plutonium poses a serious threat to the non-proliferation regime, which has already lost credibility for its failure to prevent the illegal nuclear weapons programs of such countries as Iraq, Israel, India and Pakistan?

         Japan has not asked Australia for assistance but it has advised us, and it has also stated publicly, that the shipments of plutonium from Europe to Japan will not, in principle, be routed through other countries' 200 nautical miles exclusive economic zones, nor will they make scheduled port calls. For security reasons, Japan will keep the routes of these shipments confidential. If emergency circumstances were to arise in the course of a shipment and Japan requested Australia's assistance, including access to Australian territorial waters, the Australian Government would consider such a request in accordance with the international law that is applicable to ships in distress.

         As to the second question, Japan does have longstanding plans for a nuclear fuel recycling program, of which one element is the use of plutonium in mixed oxide fuels and light water reactors. The Japanese Government remains committed to that recycling program as part of its policy of reducing dependence on energy imports. It does not seem to be dissuaded unduly by the economics of it. The Australian Government would not support the stockpiling by Japan or, for that matter, any other non-nuclear weapon state of plutonium in excess of that required for its energy program. On that point, we are reassured by Japan's clear and frequent statements that as a fundamental principle it will not possess plutonium beyond the amount required for nuclear electricity generation.

         As to the last question, the rate of plutonium separation and the use of that plutonium is increasing but not at anything like the rate which was forecast 20 years ago when there were predictions that plutonium would replace enriched uranium as the main nuclear fuel. Separated plutonium does pose nuclear non-proliferation risks, but these have long been recognised and measures have been taken with the IAEA safeguard system to develop and implement appropriate safeguards for the reprocessing and utilisation of plutonium. There are also strict guidelines, as Senator Coulter should be aware, on plutonium transportation and physical protection.

         It is worth saying, though, in answer to some of the suggestions in the first part of Senator Coulter's question that the non-proliferation regime has not, as he asserted, lost credibility. The disclosures of Iraq's clandestine nuclear program obviously did reveal some areas where the regime needed to be strengthened. But in the last year, the international community has taken a number of measures to achieve that objective, particularly in regard to the strengthening of safeguards and the tightening of nuclear export controls.

To the contrary, I strongly believe that all members of those communities are to be very warmly congratulated for their restraint and maturity, as has been shown in their reaction to the tragic conflict in their homeland. Apart from what have really been a few isolated incidents, their moderate conduct does speak volumes for the success of Australian multiculturalism because these communities do act as Australians first, and have not transferred these ancient disputes to their new homeland.

The fact is that there has been no prime ministerial or ministerial interference in these matters, nor have there been any suggestions to AQIS from the Prime Minister or any other Minister. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has ongoing discussions about all these issues with a variety of countries, looking after the interests of farmers in Australia—not concerned with the interests of the National Party—on an ongoing basis. There is nothing in Senator O'Chee's little story. Perhaps he could go up to Queensland and tout it around up there for a while and it might win him one vote, but that is about all he will get out of it. There is nothing in the story at all—I am sorry.

From the feedback I have received, that measure was largely welcomed by the public and certainly by the staff who have to fly with the airlines.

From the comments that have been made to me, even those people who do smoke have considered that this is a reasonable restriction. The FAC, in placing this ban on smoking, was particularly concerned about the staff who have to work all day inside these facilities and their right to be shielded—despite the objections from my colleagues from the rear—from passive smoking being forced on them by people ignorant enough to smoke when other people do not want them to.

         Recent workers compensation cases relating to the effects of smoking have also placed a considerable responsibility on the FAC, as an owner of public buildings, to ensure the safety and comfort of terminal users. The Chairman of Qantas has advised me that, from 1 January next year, the company will implement a total smoking ban in all of Qantas's Australian ground based workplaces. The issue of international flights by Qantas is a far more complex area. The Commonwealth is not in a position to comprehensively impose smoking bans on all aircraft flying in and out of Australia without the support of foreign governments—support which we hope will be forthcoming.

The Democrat party, led by Chuan Leekpai, has won the highest number of seats with 79. The other parties which opposed Suchinda—namely, New Aspiration, Palang Dhama and Solidarity—produced between them a combined total of 106 seats. In addition, however, a major partner in the Suchinda Government, Chart Thai, also polled well to become the second largest party with 77 seats. Former Prime Minister Chatichai's centrist party, Chart Pattana, has obtained 60 seats. Bearing all those figures in mind, negotiations have commenced on the composition of the new coalition government. While it is still too early to predict the outcome, it certainly does appear that Chuan Leekpai is the front runner to lead the new government.

         The Australian Government, like the rest of the international community, has taken great encouragement from these results. If the expectations that I have just outlined do come to fruition, they certainly augur well for the continued reassertion of democratic processes in Thailand. This is in addition to the credible accounting which has taken place for the horrific May violence and the recent reshuffle of key senior military figures responsible for those events, in which regard I think it is very appropriate to pay a special tribute to the interim Prime Minister Anand's leadership. It is also significant that the 13 September election was apparently conducted with relatively few incidents compared with recent Thai elections.

Will the Government take heed of the Privacy Commissioner's call for an investigation into the proposal, as well as his warning that the Health Department should properly inform the Australian public about this proposal? Unlike with the Australia Card and the pharmacy black box proposals, which were shrouded in secrecy and dumped on the laps of an unsuspecting Australian public, will the Government ensure that there is a full and open debate about the need for and the desirability of this computer network?

         Might I say more generally that Burma's human rights record does continue to be a cause for very great concern. Although 408 political prisoners have been released since April this year, there are still about 2,000 remaining in detention including 38 elected representatives and, of course, Burma's most popular political leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Ethnic minorities in Burma have also been subject to oppressive measures, including forced resettlement and conscription as porters.

We will again play an active role in supporting a strong resolution on Burma at the UN General Assembly in a few weeks time which encompasses human rights concerns. These steps are in addition, of course, to our existing embargoes on aid, arms sales and defence contacts and are all designed to ensure that the momentum, to the extent that we can sustain it, of international pressure on Burma is maintained.

Senator Boswell should read the letter from AQIS which he tabled in the Senate. It refers to prime ministerial interests in the middle of 1990. That is not the man Senator Boswell is after; Bob Hawke was Prime Minister in the middle of 1990. That is not the bloke he is after. Senator Boswell had better brush up his footwork.

         The fact of the matter is that there has been no prime ministerial interference in this matter at any stage and no ministerial interference in this matter at any stage. Senator Boswell can speculate as much as he likes about memos between officers of AQIS and various pig companies and God knows what else in relation to the issue of the importation of live pigs. There has been no intervention by Ministers or the Prime Minister at any time. That is a fact.

         Senator Boswell asked what meetings took place between the appropriate Ministers and AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, over a period of time. I have got not a clue about that. The fact of the matter is that it is not relevant. Any Minister doing his job as portfolio Minister will have discussions with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. In fact, when we—I would have hoped with the honourable senator's support—raised the standards of food import inspection by the Quarantine Service, the Minister would have had a discussion with AQIS about it. That is an important thing for a Minister to do. But to do with this issue the honourable senator is not on the pig's back, if I can put it that way.

Honourable senators opposite are supposed to be a hands off government, if they ever get elected. That is what they are going to be—a hands off government. Senator Boswell's coalition temporary allies who do not agree with him about anything come in here and ask me, the Minister for Industry, to find out why a relatively junior officer in the Quarantine Service made a mistake in a minute he wrote. I do not know why he made a mistake. I have no idea. Perhaps he did not understand. But subsequently he corrected it. That is a good thing to do and he gets a lot of marks for that.

         Because of the changes that have been made to Question Time, yesterday's procedures demonstrated a clear imbalance. We had a series of two-minute answers about which 10-minute speeches were given in debate on motions to take note of them. We spent virtually two hours debating one hour of Question Time and we even had people dragging up motions to take note of answers given to questions asked several days before. When we sought to achieve some sort of agreement about the amount of time that people might take in discussing these motions relating to questions without notice, either I was told, `I will take about 10 minutes' and the person then spoke for an unlimited time or, as in the case of Senator Boswell, I was told, `It will take just about as long as I take'—which was a very helpful and cooperative attitude!

         Given the rigour that people are seeking to apply to the procedures of this Parliament, we might as well start by applying a bit of rigour to this new area of motions to take note of answers. Just so that there is no doubt—and in case this has not been drawn to the attention of Independent senators—if the suspension is carried, I intend to move a motion in three parts providing that: first, motions shall relate only to answers given to questions without notice that day; secondly, a senator may speak for not more than two minutes on such a motion; and, thirdly, the total time for debate on all motions relating to answers to questions without notice on any day shall not exceed 30 minutes. That is the motion I will move if the suspension of Standing Orders is carried.

         My concern about this whole idea of placing a time limit is that I believe that it discriminates vigorously in favour of the fast talkers and against the slow talkers. It discriminates in favour of those who are slick and against those who may stutter from time to time. It is absolute discrimination. The basis for any such motion should be the number of words that are contained in the question or the answer, not the time that it takes for a person to get the words out.

          Senator Teague raised a second aspect with me. Let me give this clear response: if someone wants to move a second motion to take note of a supplementary answer, that is a second motion and that person can speak to that for two minutes. It is up to the President to interpret the motions, but that seems to me to be the clear implication of the wording.

          —Mr President, the coalition agrees with the general thrust of the motion but we have considerable difficulty with some aspects of it. First of all, I refer to the question of the right of senators to take note of answers. Whilst acknowledging Senator McMullan's admission that leave would not be denied, we believe that logic would dictate that for a motion such as this, senators, as of right, should be able to take note of Ministers' answers. Therefore, we would propose that the preamble to the three conditions should read: `That for as long as the current limitations on the length of time for questions and answers in Question Time are in force, senators shall be entitled to move a motion to take note of Ministers' answers to questions without notice in accordance with the following conditions (a), (b) and (c)'. We will be moving that amendment to the motion.

          There are three conditions in the Government's motion. The first one is that motions shall relate only to answers given to questions without notice that day. That does impose a considerable inhibition and limitation on the ability of senators to take note of Ministers' answers. It is not uncommon for relevant material required by a senator who wants to take note of a Minister's answer not to be available immediately after Question Time or immediately after a Minister gives his answer. Therefore, a senator may not be in the position until at least the following day to take note of an answer in an intelligent way and to give the type of response that is required. So I believe that this part of the motion does impose an unnecessary limitation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The second condition is that a senator may speak for no more than two minutes on such a motion. Two minutes is a very short time to respond to an answer from a Minister because the response to answers is a very different kettle of fish to Question Time itself. It lends itself to some debate because more than one senator may wish to participate in the debate to take note of an answer. Therefore, we believe that two minutes is far too short.

          The Opposition will move for four minutes. Ideally, I think it should be longer, but I understand that the Democrats may be prepared to support a proposal that the two minutes be amended to four. I will be moving that because I think it is important to get a shift from two minutes. Four minutes is logical in the sense that Ministers now, in fact, have four minutes to answer questions if they are given—or seek, if it is a dorothy dixer—a supplementary question. They get two plus two minutes. Therefore, at the very least, I think the senator taking note of the answer should be given up to four minutes to respond to the answer.

          The third condition that the Government has laid down in its proposal is that the total time for debate on all motions relating to answers to questions without notice on any day shall not exceed 30 minutes. We believe that that is too short a time. We fully accept the Government's intent and wish that there be at least some limitation put on the length of time for which such procedure can operate, but 30 minutes is a very short period of time. Even on the basis of yesterday's Question Time, when we had 33 or 34 questions, of which about 24 were original questions and 10 or 12 were supplementaries, at a maximum of four minutes for each speaker, 30 minutes allows for only seven speakers. So even if there were only one speaker taking note of each answer, at most, only one-third of the answers could be responded to. I believe that that is too short. Therefore, I will be moving on behalf of the coalition that `30 minutes' should read `60 minutes'.

There is no need, because of their indolence and stupidity and poor tactics, for those opposite to extend it into the general debate.

I am very happy to have an MPI three days a week, and we will take our 120 minutes. We will all take as much time as we are entitled to.

So this is seen to be some clever Dick trick to gag this chamber. Under this proposal we will go from having 30 minutes in which to speak to two minutes. We presently have five minutes at the very least because, in the event that the Government refuses to give leave, we can move for the suspension of Standing Orders under the contingent notice of motion that is sitting there and we can debate that for five minutes. The question of the relevancy is another issue.

          The Government is proposing that we take three minutes out of the five which would leave us with two. In real terms, when leave is granted, we have 30 minutes.

Unlike the House of Representatives, this is not the Executive's chamber.

          Of course I support Senator Short's amendment to make the time restriction four minutes, which I understand is likely to be supported by the Democrats, but I do it with a great deal of reluctance. As Senator Short said, there is a great deal of difference between answering a question that requires a simple `yes' or `no', or answering a question in four minutes, which may only take two minutes if proper dedication were put to its substance; and a debate on the manner of a response, the substance of a response and the relevance of a response. To imagine, in some perverse way, that four minutes for the question and four minutes for the debate are equal, is like comparing apples with oranges. It is not logical to me, although it seems to me that the Government is trying to kick a goal to cheer up its own side. This proposal has no merit.

          —I, like my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne, support the amendment moved by Senator Short. It is a pity that this debate has come on. Taking note of an answer to a question has been one of the most effective innovations in this chamber over the last year. Its effectiveness is such that the Government now wants to restrict it; that is how effective it has been. In my view, we have seen in this Parliament under the Hawke-Keating governments a constant abuse of Question Time. One of the ways to redress this balance has been to take note of answers to questions, so that when Ministers ramble on during Question Time, they are required to come back and debate the issues that they have raised. My view is that this measure has been used in a responsible manner.

          It is interesting that people have spoken on this motion before the chamber but nobody seems to have pulled out any key data. For example, no-one seems to know how many of these motions have been moved and what time has been taken up with taking note of answers to questions. During the last hour I pulled out a few statistics, and I would certainly not want the chamber to assume that they are correct; they would certainly need checking.

          By and large, we have given up MPIs. MPIs typically last for around two hours. I understand that there have been 44 sitting days since the start of the year. Of those 44 sitting days, there have been 14 days on which an MPI or an urgency motion has been moved. It is fairly clear from the statistics that I have on hand and have cited that the longest time spent in taking note of answers has been around one hour and 50 minutes, which is still shorter than having a debate on an MPI or an urgency motion.

          It is important when we evaluate this that we pull out all the relevant data and look closely at what has happened over the last year. I am not one for saying that things cannot be improved. I have pulled out some statistics for the last 12 or so sitting days on the time taken up with taking note of answers to questions. For example, on 18 August, 30 minutes were taken up; on 19 August, 20 minutes; on 8 September, my figures show 15 minutes; on 9 September, 42 minutes; on 10 September, no time was taken up; and on 14 September, an hour and 20 minutes.

So it is my view that, in an interesting way—and I put this to Senator McMullan—the taking note of answers has in fact saved time in the chamber, not the reverse. Certainly in the past I suspect we were far more inclined to use urgency motions or matters of public importance.

In my view, this chamber by and large does its job fairly well. I think it is important that the figures be pulled out to see just what time has been taken up and how this procedure can be further improved. I agree with Senator Short: I think that, by and large, 30 minutes is too short; I think that putting a time limit of 4 minutes is too short. On the other hand, I think there is an argument for the provision of an hour after Question Time for honourable senators to take note of answers should they wish to do so. I think that it ought to be taken in conjunction with looking very closely at how often we are prepared to use the procedures of the MPI and the urgency motion.

          So I put that to you, Mr President. I think this has come on somewhat precipitously without proper consideration and evaluation of the figures involved. It has come on by and large because the Government sees Mr Keating and his Ministers down in the other chamber being all macho and protected by the Chair. However, when they come up here, it is a different ball game and Ministers have to be more accountable to the chamber. As I have said, this is a procedure which I think has been effective. It has forced more accountability onto Ministers. I would urge, before we adopt this as a permanent measure, that we look very closely at what has happened to see how it can be improved but always—and I put this particularly to Senator Coulter and his colleagues—with the central principle in mind that the principal role of this chamber is to make Ministers more accountable to the people, and we should be very wary about restricting in any way that accountability.

If these measures were in place, how would they have got on? I was not here when Pat Kennelly was in this chamber, but I knew Pat reasonably well. W-where w-would Pat Kennelly have g-got to?

          Leaving all that aside, it is a matter which goes particularly to the rights of members of this place to exercise the expressive function which has been given to them by the people of Australia. I understand that there is a need—on the Government side, the Opposition side and our side—to see that measures go through with a reasonable progression. Surely we are sensible and mature enough to get together between now and tomorrow to consider these matters and to see whether some sensible arrangement can be made. I think Senator Kemp has made the point that we could also have a look at the statistics to see precisely what has occurred over the past six months since this idea of taking note of answers to questions has cropped up. Therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

          —Yes, I think that is the case. But I will give a considered answer to it and look to a resolution. It is silly for someone to have an advantage by a quirk of the way the answer is given. So I will have a look at the drafting. Someone has implied that perhaps an amendment that Senator Short has would cover it, although I think not in a way that we would be happy with. But one way or another we can examine that and see whether we need to do anything and, if so, look at the drafting.

          —by leave—The point that Senator Macdonald raised is important. It is one that we mentioned in our earlier concerns about the proposals because condition (a) does say that `motions shall relate only to answers given to questions without notice that day'. I did express concern about that but I did not foreshadow a specific amendment. I would like now to foreshadow—because we have had some subsequent consultation—that, depending on Senator McMullan's consideration and our further discussion on this tomorrow, we will move an amendment to add the words `after that day or the previous sitting day' to Senator McMullan's condition (a). Let us leave further consideration of it until tomorrow. I just wanted to foreshadow that now.

         First let me commend the Auditor-General for the timeliness of his report on the Australian National Audit Office for the year to 30 June, dated 11 September 1992. I hope that other departments of the Government follow that excellent lead.

          This is an astounding report. It is condemnatory of the Government in some particular respects. When the Auditor-General is prepared to be as critical of the Executive as he is in this report, this Parliament should take note. I want to read a section from this report. I quote as follows:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Despite continuing warnings during the year about the effects of inadequate audit and review of the management of some bodies in public sectors, I have found little understanding in some areas of the Commonwealth about the importance of public audit of public bodies and have had to report twice to the Parliament about potential erosion of public accountability.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General is clearly pointing to events in Victoria, for example, where people will soon have the opportunity to judge the level of competence and the amount of public accountability in that State. But the criticism the Auditor-General makes of the Executive of the Commonwealth Parliament—of this Keating Government—is well deserved and astounding. He goes on:

         should in themselves have stopped such attempts at avoiding proper and effective parliamentary scrutiny in the Commonwealth. But sadly this has not been the case.

         That is absolutely damning criticism from the Auditor-General of the Keating Government. I repeat:

         That is the Auditor-General talking about the Keating Government. It is absolutely incredible that the Government has been so cavalier in its approach to the Auditor-General that the Auditor-General felt compelled in this report to present this level of criticism of the Government. It is unprecedented to my knowledge. Other honourable senators might have a view as to whether an Auditor-General has ever felt constrained to attack the Government for its behaviour towards him and his office in such a way. He goes on:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The general provisions of the Australian Public Service are not always relevant to auditors. If we have poor performers in auditing, the ANAO does not have other avenues for their productive employment.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Auditor-General needs contract conditions to appoint auditors, with appropriate remuneration to offset the lack of tenure. The constraints imposed by the Public Service Act and associated legislation which determine the terms and conditions of employment of ANAO staff, particularly in relation to remuneration, discipline and efficiency matters, inhibit my ability to meet the ANAO's professional needs.
        </para>
        <para>
         He gives this serious warning:

It is professionally unacceptable to employ incompetent auditors on audits.

         One begins to wonder whether this Government really wants an effective Audit Office bringing about effective audits of this Government's activities. Clearly, I suppose, from the criticisms of the Government and many of its agencies that the Auditor-General has made, the Government perceives it to be in its best interests to do nothing to assist the Auditor-General in his vitally important job of servicing this Parliament. I want to get back to that in a minute because it is this Parliament that the Auditor-General reports to—not the Government. I guess one could make the distinction between the employer of an auditor in a public corporation—and that should be, of course, the shareholders—and the directors, about whose management the auditor reports to the shareholders.

          I would like to deal with the disgraceful situation in which the Government put the Auditor-General's Office and the Auditor-General himself—a serious situation of embarrassment over the political stunt involved in forcing the Auditor-General to occupy the head office building of the Australian Labor Party. We have heard all about the disgraceful nature of that stunt, hidden behind a facade of respectability, where the Auditor-General's Office, apparently, had no idea that the ultimate owner of the building was the Labor Party and where a leasing deal was done which appears to be totally out of line with the appropriate levels of the marketplace in Canberra.

Acceptance of the JCPA recommendation would have avoided the concerns referred to above.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, the Auditor-General would not have been put in the embarrassing situation of being the apparent fall guy in a stunt aimed at ensuring an excessive rental to the Labor Party for its head office.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There are some other matters in the Auditor-General's annual report that I would like to raise. In the first place, I think the Parliament should note and commend the Auditor-General on the fact that there have been benefits of efficiency audits which, although they are difficult to measure, do show potential savings to the Commonwealth. Eight efficiency audits have been estimated at between $68m and $86m, although the cost of all the efficiency audits undertaken last year was approximately $4.8m. So it is not a bad rate of return or success rate for the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General also goes on to say:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Audit Office's vision for the future is to be valued as a source of independent and apolitical audit assurance and advice to the Parliament and community on the integrity and performance of all Commonwealth public sector organisations. Excellent professional auditing services and public reports provided by the Audit Office will encourage and assist public sector organisations to achieve higher standards of delivering their services to the Australian community and maximise value for money.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is a pity that this Government does not share the Auditor-General's enthusiasm for improving the quality of performance, reducing the cost and maximising value for money. Its continual obstruction of endeavours to improve the capacity of the Audit Office to perform its functions is counterproductive—except in political terms, because apparently the Government takes the view that, the less the capacity of the Audit Office to supervise, the less the risk of critical comment about the Audit Office.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There are a few other matters that I think I should mention. The Auditor-General naturally expresses concern about the question of an outside auditor of the National Rail Corporation Ltd. He notes:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Notwithstanding the Commonwealth Government policy that the Auditor-General be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities, it is understood that a private sector auditor has been appointed as the Corporation's auditor under the Corporations Law. Accordingly, the Corporation is not subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Ultimate responsibility, of course, rests with the Government, but corporatisation should not be used to weaken public accountability, nor to cloud ministerial responsibility for public sector activities.
        </para>
        <para>
         I would certainly agree with that. There is a clear need for an effective auditor. There is no doubt that, despite the limitations on the Auditor-General by way of the Government's refusal to provide him with adequate facilities, the Audit Office has demonstrated its effectiveness by qualifying 17 of the 55 audit reports on financial statements of departments. Something like 31 per cent of the reports issued were qualified under section 51(1) of the Audit Act. These qualifications related to failure to keep accounts and records in accordance with section 40 of the Audit Act, financial statements not prepared in accordance with the financial statements guidelines, non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution and the Audit Act and various other matters pursuant to paragraph 51(1)(d) of the Audit Act. That seems to be a pretty high failure rate—31 per cent. I hope that departmental officers will endeavour to improve that.

It matches the indifference and contempt with which this Government, in many instances, approaches the Parliament itself. As the Executive gets stronger and stronger, and particularly as the House of Representatives becomes little more than a voting college for the Executive, this Government becomes more and more arrogant and the need for an Auditor-General to ensure that the arms of the Executive are properly investigated and their functions properly audited, becomes greater and greater.

They should be supporting in their entirety the issues raised by the Auditor-General to ensure that the rights of the Parliament remain paramount in this democracy. I believe that we are approaching a crisis situation where the Auditor-General is forced to go public with the sorts of vigorous concerns that he has expressed in this report today. I commend him for it and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

         —Today we saw the pathetic spectacle of the third highest Minister in this Government coming before the Senate confronted by voluminous material which has shown that there is something highly suspicious in the manner in which the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service has been forced to deal with a request from Danpork and its Australian connections—including Mr Paul Keating, who happens to be Prime Minister of this country—in relation to the importation of live pigs and genetic material from Denmark.

         It was a pathetic sight because we saw Senator Button, normally a man of integrity and wisdom, foolishly coming before the Senate and saying, `There is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary at all'. Why did he say that? Because he was confronted with what he could not answer yesterday. He was confronted with the fact that two letters were sent by AQIS—which, I understand, were not some scrappy little faxes, as he described them, but were, in fact, letters—to the Pork Council of Australia, the prime industry body in this nation. They said that the reason why the importation of live pigs from Denmark had become a high priority issue was that it was raised at prime ministerial level, and subsequently, it had been the subject of Minister to Minister discussions between Australia and Denmark.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Senator Button came before the Senate chamber and tried to dismiss these things by saying, `They are just scrappy little bits of paper, don't read anything into them'. We are not reading anything into the documents at all; we are just reading what is on the face of the documents. These matters have become a high priority out of nowhere because of various ministerial discussions. Yet Senator Button comes into this chamber day after day, like some wind-up doll, saying that there was absolutely no ministerial discussion at all.

       <para first-indent="16">

         There was obviously absolutely no ministerial thought given to the answer that Senator Button gave to this chamber because the facts are that there has been ministerial interference. How else does he explain telexes such as the one which I tabled in the Senate today. A Department of Primary Industries officer in Brisbane sent an urgent telex to AQIS, Canberra in respect of pigs from Denmark asking, `Could you please tell me. . . Why does this have a priority 1?'. This telex was sent on 5 March 1991, yet the Minister is unable to explain it. He says, `It's just the normal process of government'. All of a sudden something that has been sitting on the backburner for over five years becomes a priority 1 issue.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Similarly, Senator Button is totally incapable of explaining correspondence which says that if the importation of live pigs and genetic material is to become a high priority issue, the priority should not be for Denmark but, instead, should be for live pigs from the United Kingdom, the Irish Republic and the USA. But under this Government, what ought to happen is not what does happen, because under this Government we clearly see that pressure has been placed on AQIS to do something that it did not want to do. One can almost hear the honest, decent members of AQIS squealing, dare I say it, like stuck pigs at the fact that they have been forced to raise to a high priority—the highest priority of all the work that they do—the possible importation of live pigs from Denmark.

         —As Senator Boswell quite rightly interjects, they have been told to drop everything and hop onto this. Why has AQIS been told to drop everything and suddenly start looking at live pig imports from Denmark? The answer is contained in a cablegram which I tabled in the Senate today, and I believe that it is important that we read exactly what this cable says. It says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        AQIS has been approached by the Danish Government and the Confederation of Danish Industries to undertake assessment of imports of live pigs and pig semen. Higher priority was, until recently, being placed on these tasks as imports of genetic material were linked to a joint venture proposal between Australia and Danish industry that was being forged during 1991/92.
       </para>
       <para>
        Which joint venture proposal might that just happen to be? None other than the joint venture proposal belonging to our estimable Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul J. Keating.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is why AQIS was forced to make this a priority 1 issue; not because there was any intrinsic urgency in the matter, but simply because it was the subject of a joint venture proposal between Danish industry and a company associated with the Prime Minister. The paragraph in the cablegram from which I have quoted is also revealing for what it goes on to say. It says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, it now appears that these import proposals may be a lesser priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why is that a revealing statement? Because this cablegram, sent as it was in July this year, came after Senator Boswell and I first raised the issue of the importation of live pigs from Denmark. It came after Senator Boswell was perspicacious enough to realise that the answers lay in the Government's own papers—in the Department's own files. Senator Boswell made a freedom of information request and all of a sudden, goodness gracious me, we are going to drop it all. Why? Because the information on the Government's files pointed a finger at those who had sought to improperly interfere with the running of AQIS. The information on the Government's files pointed the finger at the joint venture company belonging to Danish industry and, indirectly, at our estimable Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul J. Keating.

         There is no doubt that AQIS reviewed import protocols for Danpork's benefit but not for the benefit of this nation. There is no doubt that in reviewing its import protocols for Danpork's benefit, it did so to the advantage of the Prime Minister. Yet, we have the pathetic spectacle of Senator Button coming into this chamber and saying, `It is a pathetic conspiracy theory; it is a pathetic attempt to paint what is a very serious matter as a conspiracy theory'. But there is no theory; it is only fact.

         Why in this outward cablegram is the matter referred to the Department of the Prime Minister? I do not know. Hopefully Senator Button will be able to tell this chamber. Hopefully Senator Button might suddenly realise that this is not an issue which will go away if he keeps saying that there was no ministerial involvement. It is an issue which should be properly answered by the Government. It is an issue which he should answer during Question Time, instead of trying to run away.

In so doing, he did not do himself a service; he did not do his friend the Prime Minister a service. In thinking that he can stonewall the chamber and by pretending that black is white and white is black, he did a disservice to this chamber. We do not accept that.

         In answer to Senator Boswell today, Senator Button said, `Well, there was no ministerial contact but if a Minister had been doing his job properly I am sure there would have been some ministerial contact'. The fact that this is a glaring contradiction itself seems to have eluded Senator Button. He said, `Well, you know, we raised the import standards on food coming into this country'. Of course, he did so with our backing. He went on to say, `When we did so, it was as a result of ministerial discussions with AQIS'. Well, congratulations, Senator Button, on stating the obvious.

         Senator Button was wrong in drawing a parallel between raising the import standards on food coming into this country and lowering the import standards on live pigs and on genetic material coming into this country, bringing with it, as it does, the risk of disease. It is quite simply ludicrous to suggest that lowering the standards to the detriment of the Australian industry can be compared with raising the standards required of food imported to this country.

         If Senator Button were attempting in that statement to try to vindicate any ministerial involvement in this affair then he is just digging a deeper hole for himself and the Government. Senator Button must answer these questions—the Government must answer these questions—because they go right to the heart of the Government. They go right to the heart of the executive process of this nation. And they go right to the heart of the integrity and the trustworthiness not only of this Government but also of the Prime Minister, who is the most senior member of the Executive. They go right to the heart of the highest power in the land. We on this side of the chamber do not believe that the Government can allow the matter to drift on any longer.

         In June we asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) whether there was any move to bring in live pigs, genetic material, breeding material, semen or embryos. We were told that there were no ministerial or prime ministerial decisions or implications in the matter.

        So the first letter had a mistake in it; now the second letter has a mistake in it. The second letter did not retract that there was ministerial involvement. The interviewer said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But that's a very very serious mistake—especially when the current Prime Minister has interest in a pig company—to make such a mistake—how could it occur?

        Mr Landos answered:

        Yes it was one of those slips—it was a slip that occurred through the drafting of a letter—look it was bad slip—I admit that—and it shouldn't have happened—but we did our best as soon as we noticed, to correct it on paper and in a very factual way
       </para>
       <para>
        It took from 3 June with the first letter to 21 July to correct it. This matter was raised continually in the Senate by Senator O'Chee and I during this time. We asked questions on it over a period of four or five days. Then, six or eight weeks later the letter is refuted and another letter is conveniently put out. That letter says, `Well, look, it is all a terrible mistake'. How can anyone make a mistake like that? How can anyone say that the Prime Minister was not involved when the Prime Minister had an interest in a piggery and when that piggery wanted to bring in genetic material, live pigs or breeding material?

         Again, the industry is exerting pressure. The whole industry is saying, `Look, we do not want breeding material coming in from Denmark. There is disease over there. Why do we want it?'. The New South Wales farmers said that they do not want it. Some of the top breeding firms have said they do not want it. The Western Australian pork producers said that they do not want it.

All of a sudden someone has told him that it has top priority. Who has the capacity in government to make something top priority? Is it the Minister?  I believe that it is one of the Ministers.

         Then we get another memo going around saying that the industry has stated that if AQIS persists with the question of live pig imports, priority should be given to the UK, Eire and North America as the source of animals. No-one in the Australian pig industry, including AQIS, wants to import pigs from Denmark—either live pigs or genetic or breeding material. All the officers out in the field are saying, `What the devil is going on?', and they are all sending memos saying, `Why does this have top priority?'. After this memo was released Senator O'Chee and I made inquiries in the Senate and then, on 7 July, we had a backdown. This cablegram states:

        `Do not worry about it, boys, because high priority is off.' Why is it off? Why has the priority been changed?

         These are matters of fact. The papers Senator O'Chee and I refer to were tabled in the Senate today and yesterday. It is not good enough for Senator Button to come in here, as he has the capacity to do, and denigrate the issue and the National Party and think that because he has a glib tongue the issue will disappear. It will not disappear because the National Party has tenacity and it is prepared to follow this issue right through. Senator Button can come in here every day and make fun of the issue, but he will not escape it because the issue will be raised until we get answers to these problems.

         I do not know whether Senator Button realises the implications but, if there has been pressure on AQIS to change the protocols in regard to Australia's importation of live pigs and pig semen from a country in which there is disease, this importation could expose Australia's total herd. That is the most serious charge that can ever be levelled at anyone in government because that is the most serious mortal sin that can be committed in this place.
