          What people often fail to recognise is that any assistance we give is decoupled. That means that it does not distort production. It is assistance to farmers such as the rural adjustment scheme—the RAS scheme—which not all farmers have access to or utilise. It is not utilised by all wheat growers. It is assistance that the Government may give in matching finance with marketing and research and development. This scheme is very different from any of the sorts of schemes through which farmers are actually paid money to produce or, in some cases within the CAP, not to produce products.

We must continue this work to make sure that agriculture stays as it has now been placed under the GATT regime and that we actually get these countries looking at how they can wean their producers off the subsidies which are not decoupled.

          It is a falsehood to say that our Ministers have not been active on this. It was in fact Australia that forced this particular EEP decision to be taken to GATT with the support of other GATT members who are affected. It is also a falsehood on the part of the United States to say that it is not interfering with our markets, that EEP is not having an impact. Everybody in this country knows that that is not true. Everybody in this country knows that the United States putting its red wheat into India when we wish to put our white wheat there—our harvest is about to commence in some areas—must have an impact on world prices to some extent. It has an impact because there is so much more wheat floating around, but EEP is providing US farmers with a subsidy, a price and an income which is not able to be matched by many other places.

One wonders, when clauses like `to the extent possible' are included, just how committed the United States is to its claim that it will protect the interests of non-subsidising exporters.

They can understand the EC doing it to them and they can understand the hardships of a trade war. But what they cannot understand and what is completely frustrating to them is that their friends, the Americans, would do this to them. There is no-one more loyal to the American alliance than Australian farmers and primary producers. This is why they find it totally unacceptable that a friend could stab them in the back. They cannot understand it. I want the American Ambassador, Mr Sembler, to pass back to the appropriate authorities in America the sentiment that this chamber unanimously disagrees with the actions that the Americans have taken on wheat subsidies.

          On 16 September the US announced that it was going to offer $32.56 a tonne subsidy for 220,000 tonnes of grain that was to be sold to Pakistan. The Americans traditionally had 1.1 million tonnes of that market. Australia had 600,000 tonnes and Canada had 600,000 tonnes. We shared that market which was not EEPed or subsidised. The Americans then came in and EEPed our 600,000 tonnes. They took 220,000 tonnes at a subsidy of $32 a tonne, despite the fact that there was never any indication that the EC was going to target that market. The Australian Wheat Board, with its market forces on the ground and its intelligence operation—it does an excellent job—said that there was never any chance of the EC attacking that market. Yet we have lost 220,000 tonnes.

          The ironic part of this is that the Americans are cutting their own throats. They are subsidising other countries with their taxpayers' money when they would have had those markets anyhow. The US would have sold into both the Indian and the Pakistani markets at commercial prices, but it has effectively EEPed its own taxpayers. It never achieved a higher market; it undercut its own market. Who had to pick up the bill? The American taxpayer. The Americans never got one extra sale. They cut their own price. An elementary lesson of selling is that anyone can give a product away.

In 1984 or 1985, when the American farm bill started to EEP American wheat, Australia had 19 per cent of the world market. At the start of 1991, that 19 per cent was reduced to 13 per cent.

I was one of its supporters two or three years ago. I was told by some very experienced ex-politicians that it would never work, and I decried that. In an answer the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) gave me yesterday, he said that the window of opportunity is about three weeks, and that if the Uruguay Round is not concluded in that three weeks the window of opportunity will be lost. If that window of opportunity is lost, Australia will have to decide what it is going to do with its wheat growers. It cannot leave them out there on a limb undefended and unprotected, at the whim of these two mighty superpowers, and unilaterally disarm our farmers. If that happens, we will not have a wheat industry in the future. None except a few of the bigger farmers can withstand this attack on their industry, on their living standards, and on the industries the Australian wheat growers supply, such as the milling industry.

It gives them $55,000 to buy a new home and move to the metropolitan area, where they are not trained to do anything, where they do not know where they will get a job and where they will join the unemployment queues.

          Again, I appeal to Mr Sembler, because I believe he knows the problem in Australia, to make representations to the US Department of Agriculture and the President and tell them the damage they are doing to their friends. It is going to be a race to see which happens first: whether we get the American election over with or whether the wheat industry stays. We cannot continue to take one hammering after another, losing one market and then the next market, with the price going down every time an EEP sale is made.

          —I will not keep the Senate long because a number of my colleagues also wish to contribute to this debate. The debate has come about as a result of a resolution of this Senate protesting at increases in the US EEP, which is basically a subsidy, at the expense of Australian producers. The American Ambassador has responded to the Senate's protest and in effect has asked us to be patient, saying that the purpose of the EEP is to bring the Europeans to heel. He has also stressed in his letter to us that the United States will do what it can to avoid hurting innocent producers, that is, fair traders—Australian traders, Australian producers—in the course of its program. In other words, he argues that it is not directed against us; it is directed against the Europeans because it is part of the Americans' tactic to try to reduce international subsidies by applying pressure to the Europeans.

          I do not dispute that motive. Certainly it is the original purpose of the export enhancement program. There is no doubt that the European subsidisation of agriculture is at extremely high levels and there is no doubt that it has done international damage to fair traders.

          The trouble is, however, that in doing that they are—whether it is their purpose or not—severely damaging fair traders, that is, producers such as Australia. They are doing that by forcing down the price of product. The further restructuring of EEP, the new announcements regarding the expansion of the program—certainly to the degree to which the product is subsidising the United States—will have that effect in this country also. The consequence will be, therefore, to hurt Australian producers. The Senate is certainly acting properly in protesting to the United States about that development, and it should continue to do so.

          That is the point I wish to make. It is vital that, despite the fact that we have such an important relationship in all respects with the United States, we continue to protest this policy it has which is having a detrimental effect upon our producers. We should do so as a Senate; the Australian Government should do so; and we as an Opposition should do so. In that light, I have to say how disappointed I was that when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) quite reasonably protested at the extent of protectionist policies in the United States and the EEP in particular, and he was condemned by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Keating, for doing so. How that can be in the best interests of Australia is impossible to see. Mr Keating should have commended the Leader of the Opposition for taking this issue up to the Americans, for bringing it before them. Dr Hewson made the point that, despite the fact that we have such an important relationship with the United States, in this instance, the US has a policy which is harming our producers and we protest that policy. Quite contrary to the action taken by the Prime Minister, what he should have been doing was supporting Dr Hewson in protesting this protectionist policy of the United States that is harming Australian wheat producers.

          Realising that he got it wrong, what did the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, do? He went to Japan and protested American policy. I cannot think of anything more diplomatically improper than the Australian Prime Minister going to Japan protesting the policies of a third nation. That is not the place to do it. The place to do it is in this country and through our mission in the United States. I regret that action by the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, which does not help Australia's interests at all. In fact, it will be counterproductive. It makes it even more difficult for us to effectively protest these policies that are harming our producers.

          What I also sought to do with these US bureaucrats was start talking through with them whether there are not alternative policies that the US could adopt that might have a greater effect upon Europe in the way that the US claims that the program is designed. In other words, the subsidisation of the US wheat crop is not, in my view, a way that is effectively going to bring Europe to heel. I said to Mr Censky that if his argument is right, surely the logical progression of that argument is that the US should further increase its subsidies. I asked, `Should it double it? Should it treble it?' Of course, the answer I got was that, no, they did not think that would be desirable. I am pleased to hear that. But that really means that they, in effect, acknowledge that it is not working. There is no suggestion that the US EEP has had any effect upon European policies and European subsidies at all.

This was a program the Australian Government commenced but abandoned almost as quickly as it started because a bit of pressure was applied from Europe. Nevertheless, the US has the capacity to put in a lot more resources. Looking at the extent of resources it is putting into subsidies, it could be putting those resources into a program to communicate the damaging effect of subsidies within Europe. That is an alternative they could be considering. I raised that with them and discussed it with them. I also raised with the United States whether more programs might be developed to retaliate more directly against specific subsidies in Europe, something that can give the effect of these subsidies greater focus.

          Much is being made, quite correctly, of the fact that this part of the EEP is directly related to the current American presidential election. However, I well remember putting to Jim Parker, the American Agricultural Attache—I think it was in 1987-88, when the EEP was in place—exactly the same arguments we went through the other day with Mr Steven Censky about what the Americans were doing to the Australian wheat industry.

What the Americans did then and what they are doing now by their actions is depressing world wheat prices by approximately $30 a tonne. They depressed them then by up to $50 a tonne and they are doing it again now.

          Australia will sell all its wheat. We learnt in the years from 1969 to 1971, when we tried to introduce quotas and store wheat in Australia, that those measures did not work. Firstly, it was impossible to get equity between growers with quotas; but, more importantly, with Australian climatic conditions, we could not successfully store wheat because of problems with moisture and weevils in storage. Since then, Australia has met the market price and we have sold our wheat. As far as our wheat industry is concerned and the types of wheat we produce—whether it be the hard wheats or the soft wheats—in meeting the world markets we also have a quality advantage that other countries do not have. That has always put us in a favourable position for clearing our stocks.

          If I could talk for a moment about some of the recent programs, the Indian sale is very disturbing. The Pakistan situation is also disturbing, but for very different reasons. Since this latest program has been put in place wheat has been sold to Bangladesh, Pakistan and Egypt—598,000 tonnes to Egypt, 10,000 tonnes to Bangladesh and 220,000 tonnes to Pakistan. Under the Indian program it is envisaged that the Americans will sell 1.5 million tonnes. There has been a subsidisation of approximately $US30 a tonne, which is almost the direct impact on the world wheat price. One has to understand—I am sure it is something the current Australian Government does not understand—that approximately 100 million tonnes per annum of wheat is traded in the world. About 15 million tonnes of that is white wheat and the remainder, approximately 85 million tonnes, is red wheat.

          Australia produces about 10 million tonnes or two-thirds of the traded white wheat in the world. Europe does not produce any traded white wheat, America produces a small percentage of it, and the rest is spread around a number of countries. When America moved into Pakistan, Mr Censky tried to justify this by saying that the Europeans might go into Pakistan. It was not that they would go into Pakistan, or that they were in Pakistan, but that they might go into Pakistan with their red wheat. It is a well known fact—and this is where I believe the Australian Government failed in terms of the announcements on EEP and the additional countries it was said were being targeted—that on that day our people, at ministerial and prime ministerial level, should have been making the right noises, letting the Americans know quite clearly before the action had been taken that, in terms of the Pakistan market, it was not a market that had been under threat or was traditionally under threat, nor was there much potential for it to be under threat by the actions of the Europeans, because of the very nature of the product that is grown.

          The other point that needs to be made is that while the US share, as a percentage of the traded world wheat market, has decreased, its actual tonnage of world traded wheat has marginally increased. While it says that it has had markets taken from it, the world traded wheat market has expanded over recent years. As I said—and I repeat this; this is the message that needs to be spelt out very clearly by the Government to the Americans—its tonnage of world traded wheat has increased, not decreased.

          I now turn to the Indian situation. The Indian situation is quite tragic in terms of the further development and expansion of EEP. India is not a traditional market for wheat for anybody, or has not been in recent years. India has been basically self-sufficient and has in fact been a net exporter of wheat. So any claim that the Americans were regaining part of their share of what the Europeans may have taken in terms of the Indian market is absolutely and totally false. Had the Americans, as the Australians and others have done, gone in there under the same market conditions without subsidising the product into India and further depressing world market prices, they would have been able to obtain their fair share of that market, as it is an opportunistic market in terms of wheat that can be sold to India.

          It is worth noting that there is a very significant difference between the markets in Pakistan and India.

If America or any other country wishes to give aid to a particular country at a particular time because it has had harsh seasonal conditions, then it should be done in such a way that does not distort world trade and does not depress world prices.

There is a whole range of things that can be done internally that have nothing to do with the Americans, the Europeans, or anybody else for that matter, but us. Those are actions that can be taken here and now.

          This letter is very disappointing in its content. It is no different from what was being said five or six years ago. The American position on EEP and what it was supposed to do has not won back part of the so-called loss of market share that they lost to the Europeans, although one has to question that having regard to the fact that American sales in tonnes have not fallen on world markets. Australia has to look at every option in bringing pressure to bear both on the Europeans and on the Americans for the injustice that they have perpetuated on Australian wheat growers, who, as I said in my earlier comments, do meet the market and sell their grain but take the depressed price.

         This has gone on for a long time. It started even further back than that. On 5 September I led a group of National Party parliamentarians and others to the American Embassy to protest what was happening. I took a letter from Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, carrying a formal resolution to the Embassy to say that we were very concerned at what was happening. At our conference in Canberra on 5 September, we were worried about the dramatic extension of the export enhancement program for wheat, which had the potential to corrupt world trade to the same extent that it had in 1986 and in 1990 and which would further depress the prices received by Australian wheat growers. That point has already been very clearly made by Senator Crane and others in this debate; indeed, it was made by Senator Bishop when she led the debate last night.

          Other parts of American programs have also concerned Australian primary producers for quite a long time. They include the increased use of export subsidy programs for dairy products, the extension of the EEP to canned fruit and possibly to other grains and agricultural exports from America, and the further reduction of Australia's access to the US sugar market. We export to America some 97,000 tonnes, which is down from 168,000 tonnes two years ago and 800,000 tonnes 10 years ago.

          Let me make this comment to those friends of ours overseas also. Let me be clear. This action is aimed at those who subsidize, not at those such as Australia and others who do not subsidize. And today's wheat EEP initiatives will give farmers, exporters, and buyers more certainty about market opportunities.

         It might be all right for the Americans, but it is not too good for Australian export industries. As Senator Crane made quite clear, we export a great proportion of wheat. About 100 million tonnes of wheat is traded around the world. If America through its EEP subsidises 30 million tonnes, which is about a third of that, it is obviously going to cause problems even to our white wheat exports. If nothing else, this will depress the price.

          I think it is important for us all to address why America is doing this. The Office of the Press Secretary of the White House said on 2 September that the problem that the US wheat producers face is the highly subsidised competition from the EC. The European Community's wheat export subsidies average about $125 a tonne; the export subsidies from the United States are only going to average about $40 a tonne. But I wonder whether two wrongs make a right. I wonder whether this is going to bring a quicker resolution to the GATT Uruguay Round. If it does not, all it is going to do in the meantime is further corrupt our world trade, and that is something that I believe will cause further problems down the line.

          A lot of people do not understand what EEP is. We know that the Americans are doing this because they want to have a crack at the Europeans. As I have been saying for the last few years, there is no doubt that the Europeans are the baddies. But just because the United States has a crack at them does not mean that the Americans are the goodies. The United States is just as bad as the Europeans if it wants to corrupt the world trade as well.

          But what does the export enhancement program do? It enables the US exporters to meet prevailing world prices for targeted commodities and destinations. Under the program the USDA pays cash bonuses to US exporters. The bonuses make up the difference between the US domestic price and the world price, which is often lower because the European Economic Community and other subsidising exporters dump surplus production into the world markets. Australia, a good trader, trades into those markets. Obviously this will distort the market and cause problems for the Australian wheat growers.

          Let us have a quick look at the problems for the Australian wheat growers. In 1970, a tonne of Australian wheat bought 2,200 litres of fuel. By 1991, a tonne of wheat bought only 200 litres of fuel, and it buys approximately that amount at the moment. It is well for this chamber to note that a recent study by ABARE suggests that, over this period, the agricultural sector has increased productivity in Australia at double the rate of the other economic sectors, which is great for our farmers. In the last two decades, the annual productivity growth in the broadacre industries has increased 2.2 per cent compared to 1.3 per cent in the manufacturing sector.

          The farmers of Australia have bust their guts and done everything they can to increase productivity and to work more efficiently. This article by the National Australia Bank makes it very clear that the long term trends imply that technical progress in the rural industries will continue at a satisfactory level. However, more recent trends, particularly in the cropping industry, point to an alarming decline in inputs over a prolonged period from 1982 to the present. This is mirrored by a sharp fall in some of the outputs since 1986.

          In a survey of 106 farmers in southern New South Wales, 72 per cent reported static or declining crop yields and 67 per cent claimed static or declining livestock production. We now have the problem of having to be leaner than lean and meaner than mean to try to compete against these countries that are distorting trade around the world, of which America is one. That will cause horrific problems to the Australian wheat growers in the next year or so while we try to compete against an American coffer which will continue its EEP program.

          In conclusion, this chamber is angry and cranky about America's actions because Australia sold 500,000 tonnes of wheat to India just recently and had been hoping to pick up some more sales there. Senator Crane made it quite clear what happened: the Americans have now put one million tonnes of heavily subsidised wheat into India. With that assault on our market there, it does not look like there will be much left for us to be able to sell to India. The bottom line of all that is that the European Community has hardly put a load of wheat—it might have put one—into India in the last few years. So this action will not hurt the European Community; it will hurt only the traditional allies of the United States of America, one of which is Australia. That is where my anger lies.

          If President Bush was fair dinkum when he said that he would not hurt Australia, being an ally of the United States and a country that did not subsidise—he spelt it out in his speech in Humboldt—surely he would say to the Americans, `Why don't we target some of the markets that the European Community is putting its wheat into and not the markets that the Australians are putting their wheat into'. I support the motion moved by Senator Bishop yesterday to take note of the reply of the United States Ambassador. I hope that this Senate very clearly sends another message to the Embassy that gets sent back to Washington which says, `Listen here, fellows. Do not hit the Australians with the back swing of your baseball bat. Go back and play in your own league. Hit the Europeans over the head, because they are the real culprits'.

          —I thank Senator Patterson. The response to the resolution of the Senate really manifests all the problems of this issue. This issue is brought to us by the recent US sales to India and by the fact that the President of the United States is 20 points behind in the polls and fears that he will not be re-elected. He has gone to the mid-west of the United States trying to buy votes. The tragedy is that it does not seem to be working. Ultimately, we are paying an awful price for his endeavours. Without wishing to preach to the Americans, every dollar that subsidises the US wheat growers is either another dollar onto the American deficit or another dollar taken away from appropriate budget outlays.

          Putting aside the immediate sales into India, the truth of the matter is that the Americans are not the primary enemy in this matter. The Americans did not start this war and George Bush is doing little more than responding to the gross and obscene politics of the European nations. That is driven not by economic judgments but again by political judgments. Because the French farmers have such enormous muscle, along with the Germans and, to a lesser degree, the British, they are able to drive the political agenda for the EEC. That has been the exclusive reason that we have not had any breakthroughs in GATT or the Uruguay Round or any other negotiations.

          The tragedy for Australia is that we have highly efficient, effective and unsubsidised farmers who are now having their markets tainted by the United States retaliation against the Europeans. It is related to both politics with the EEC and domestic politics with George Bush. There is no sensible, logical or good reason why the Australian markets should suffer collateral damage as a result of the conflict between the EEC and the United States. The United States could wage its war with the EEC without visiting any of our markets. However, for political reasons, it has chosen not to.

          This conflict shows one thing—that is, that the words proffered by George Bush when he visited Australia were thoroughly hollow.

The truth is that foreign affairs is driven by self-interest. What is in the interests of one nation will reflect in its attitude towards its allies and its enemies.

          I conclude by saying that I do not agree with anybody who argues that there ought to be any linkage on economic or political grounds between this matter and the matter of US bases on Australian shores. If it is wrong for defence reasons and if it is wrong because it creates a threat or a perceived threat in the minds of some, that does not change because of an economic dispute between Australia and the United States.

          I am appalled that John Malcolm Fraser or anybody else would now seek to make that linkage on the basis of economic arguments. If economic arguments were ever capable of influencing whether the bases ought to be on Australian soil, surely they ought not ever have been here. If the bases are here for our security, for world peace, as is properly argued by all of us, that premise cannot be shifted simply because there is a dispute between the American farmers and the Australian farmers. If we can say that the bases are negotiable now, it means that they are negotiable on any term, and if they are negotiable on any term, save for defence and security arrangements, it was the wrong judgment to have them here in the first place. It is obscene to make that linkage.

          I can understand the Democrats making that linkage. They have argued all along, with some purity in their argument, that the bases should never have been here. All they are doing now is using this argument to reinforce their earlier argument. But for anybody to now say that they ought to come into the equation as a political element is simply destroying the fundamental argument upon which the bases have previously been founded. It adds nothing to our relationship with the United States, it adds nothing to the economic debate and it adds nothing to the defence and security arrangements debate to somehow argue that because the Americans are dumping wheat in traditional Australian markets we no longer need security and defence arrangements with the United States in our own interests.

I thank him for raising the issue of the Democrats and the bases, stressing that we have always opposed the bases. But he is slightly wrong in drawing the conclusion that, if the argument for the bases originally was valid, it remains valid today. Circumstances have changed considerably. We have seen the end of the Cold War. The need for the bases has shifted quite substantially. Given those circumstances, and given the fact that many of us believe that the bases were more to do with American defence than with Australian defence, they are more negotiable today than they ever were. It is in that context that we have argued that perhaps one should reconsider the position of the bases. Indeed, a number of farmers around Australia have been making those suggestions. In Western Australia, where I was the week before last, there is very considerable hardship among the farming community, not least because of the activities of the Americans and the Europeans in relation to support for exports. The additional EEP scheme is simply the latest blow to Australian farmers.

          It is clear that the Australian Government has been tardy in offering support to Australian farmers. We have argued very considerably that there should be a guaranteed minimum price for wheat which should underpin the wheat price when the price falls—not that we want to return to the sort of support which was given to the wool industry, where the minimum price did not remain a minimum price but followed the world price up as it increased, leaving us with considerable stockpiles of wool. We support a minimum price which guarantees to farmers in times of depressed world prices a price which returns to the farmer the cost of planting the wheat and which at least guarantees that there will be a crop next year so that during those troughs in the market farmers are not wiped out. We strongly urge on the Government the reintroduction of such a scheme.

          The third point I make very briefly is that one thing which this present debacle does show is that Australia is manifestly stupid in pursuing a policy of zero tariffs, of stripping away all protection, all support, for our own industry, while other countries are supporting their industries. We need to learn a lesson—the Opposition certainly needs to learn a lesson—from the damage being done to Australian wheat producers by this scheme, damage which they have very strongly attested to in the debate this morning. It needs to learn that in a world where there is still very substantial protection—indeed, where most of the OECD countries have increased protection for their industry—it is really stupid for Australia to pursue the alternative path.

They could all be reasons for changing our defence arrangements. What does not change the original premise is the dispute between two trading partners or an economic dispute between allies. That corrupts the original argument. I accept that there is an argument to be had that we may not need bases in certain circumstances, such as where the Americans have pulled out of Subic Bay. They are pulling out of a number of their foreign bases around the world because of changing circumstances in the world, changing perceptions of threats.

          —in reply—In exercising my right of reply in the debate on the motion I moved last evening, I take the opportunity to answer one or two of the points made by Senator Coulter in his last intervention and then to perhaps restate some of the salient points of the debate as it relates to a motion that was passed by the entire Senate.

          Firstly, in my view, the bases question is a stand-alone question and is not related to a trade question. Secondly, however, Senator Coulter used this debate as an opportunity to advance his Party's high taxing policy—and, to the other taxes that he would impose upon the Australian people, he adds an additional tariff tax. He wishes to see tariff taxes, which he talked about in connection with the general issue of so-called `protectionism'—a word that I choose not to use because it is a warm and fuzzy word, when what we are really talking about is tariff tax where we tax that group of people over there and give it to this group of people over here because they are special.

          Indeed, our farmers, about whose plight we are all concerned, are people who are forced to pay tariffs; but, as tariffs will be reduced to the 5 per cent level under our policy, they will benefit enormously. When we couple that with micro-economic reform in terms of transportation costs, the farmers will again benefit. Until Senator Coulter's intervention, none of the arguments canvassed in the debate had dealt at all with the question of a minimum price, such as the Democrats wish to impose, except for Senator Crane, who dealt with the question most adequately when he explained that the attempted quota system which had been used previously penalised the farmers themselves. In other words, if we have giants fighting, as would be the case with a large dispute between the United States and the European Community, it is not an area where we can compete with subsidies in any way, shape or form.

          The whole strength of our argument is that we are efficient farmers. We want the right to compete internationally in the market where we have a competitive edge. Indeed, we still will sell our wheat, which is a point that has been made again and again by speakers in the debate. But the issue is this: the United States action in extending its export enhancement program will mean that our farmers' profit, which they were entitled to earn by diligence of hard work, effort and efficiency, will be denied them because the price that the international community will pay will be lowered by the action of the United States Government.

          Very simply, as I said right at the beginning in moving the motion, we do not accept that the reason for the extension of the EEP is to attempt to bring the economic community to the GATT table to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the Uruguay Round. We all aim at seeing the Europeans come to the sensible conclusion that the CAP, the common agricultural policy, has to alter; that there has to be room for people who are efficient agricultural traders to see the benefit and seek rewards for their effort.

          If the Europeans wish to implement a system of subsidies for their farmers, which in fact is a virtual social welfare policy to maintain certain populations in different parts of their countries, then they should please not ask us to pay for it. If George Bush wants to attract votes from the mid-west, with Governor Clinton appearing even more anxious to use the same technique, they should please not ask us to pay for it. If there are policies of subsidies which countries wish to use, then they must bear the cost of that subsidy themselves and must not impose it upon the international trading system, as it distorts not only the trade in that particular area but all trade.

          We are a nation that says the whole world benefits when there is free trade among nations. The post-World War II period has shown that the bringing down of tariff levels worldwide has enabled enormous world growth to take place. That growth has enabled newly industrialising economies to take off, developing countries to get a start to grow into more substantial partners, and the OECD countries to enjoy greater trading benefits.

          Anything that impinges upon the ability of world trade to grow and for more and more countries to give a higher standard of living to their individual citizens, to my way of thinking, is a policy which stands condemned. That is the basis upon which I moved this motion to take note of the letter from the United States Ambassador last evening to say that we simply do not accept that subsidising a product and thereby distorting international trading practices is acceptable. The argument that the United States perpetually uses, that it is only there to fight the Europeans, just does not add up.

          As I pointed out last night when I mentioned that I had read the remarks from Mr Baker, whereby he told the Australians to stop whingeing, not only is the policy to extend the EEP penalising efficient traders such as Australia and individual farmers but it is also exacerbating the problem in the United States because once subsidies are introduced the price of land is altered, the status of mortgages is changed and very often banks are put at risk because when that subsidy is taken away the reverse occurs.

          So there are many aspects to this question which are pertinent not only to the Australian farmer and the Australian nation as a whole but also to the farmers and to the economic system within the United States. The spectacle of the two candidates for the presidency of the United States, President Bush and Governor Clinton, trying to outbid each other on how much subsidy they can pay to farmers, which in turn distorts the world market, is a most dispiriting spectacle indeed.

        The lie to what she said is adequately demonstrated by the fact that, when the Federal Government removed the guaranteed minimum price for wheat, the Western Australian Government immediately legislated to put back a guaranteed minimum price for wheat, which allowed the farmers to go to the banks under that guarantee and plant next year's crop.

         This, of course, is a very important issue in Sydney. The third runway, as honourable senators would be aware, has been a very contentious issue. It has been a very contentious issue in the suburb in which I live, Bondi, and certainly across Sydney there is widespread concern, and has been so for some time, about the construction of the third runway. I am sure that that concern will be heightened now, in light of the recent accident in Amsterdam which tragically caused so much loss of life.

We saw it attempt to do this successfully with the support of the Opposition back in June of this year in a move which was greeted by outrage by State governments all across Australia. Here the Federal Government, with the collusion of the Opposition, is once again seeking to put its own activities above laws which would otherwise apply.

         A lot of concern has been expressed about the environmental impact statement produced in respect of the third runway. It is worth mentioning and noting that that EIS was produced under Commonwealth environmental planning laws, not State planning laws. The concern that Botany Municipal Council and other councils have raised before the Land and Environment Court is that really this issue should have been assessed under the New South Wales planning and environment laws which are in fact much stronger than those in place at a Federal level. That has not happened.

         A lot of concern has been expressed about whether the EIS has in fact dealt with all the concerns raised by the community. For example, it has been cited that the draft EIS is inadequate on a number of points, including its failure to take account of a $400m reduction in property values caused by new and added aircraft noise. It is believed that the draft EIS has failed to take into account the need to spend at least $300m at Kingsford-Smith Airport if downgrading the east-west runway is not realistic, as appears to be the case.

         It has been suggested that the EIS fails to take into account the need to spend at least $100m to satisfy the Civil Aviation Authority call for land reclamation to avoid the greatly increased risk of bird strike causing aircraft crashes.

         Of course, the issue that the Botany Municipal Council is most concerned about is that of the dredging of Botany Bay where it has been revealed that some 15 million cubic metres of sediment will be taken from Botany Bay in order to assist with the construction of the runway. That may have absolutely devastating effects on the environment of the Botany Bay region. The FAC wishes to go ahead and dredge Botany Bay despite the fact that previous dredging of the bay in the region of the Penrhyn Estuary was stopped by the Department of Public Works because it contained toxic waste. This waste included heavy metals.

         The concern of the local community groups is that this issue has not been adequately covered by the environmental impact statement. The 15 million cubic metres of material that the FAC intends to dredge may well include similar concentrations of toxic material. The dredging of the bay will also destroy an area which is recognised as the second largest fish breeding area in New South Wales and one of the largest oyster farming areas in the State. That is an enormously important primary industry to the region of Botany Bay which could be totally destroyed by the dredging of 15 million cubic metres of sediment.

         I do believe that it is time to reassess the validity of having a major airport in a metropolitan area in light of the recent crash which occurred in Amsterdam. This was a very tragic accident which saw at least 250 people killed.

         That was a tragic accident, but it is the sort of accident that community groups concerned about the third runway have warned could happen here in Australia. Yet we are considering increasing traffic at an airport located effectively in the middle of a major city. It is important that that issue be reassessed in the light of this tragic accident. The Citizens Airport Environment Association put out a press statement yesterday claiming that such an accident was highly possible in the Sydney region. The press release states:

        The EIS for the third runway points out that, rather than reducing risk north of the airport, residents of Marrickville, for example, will be subject to a risk of death from an air crash about 2.5 times greater than at present.

       <para>
        That is if the third runway is constructed. The press release goes on:
       </para>

        In working papers for the draft EIS, Marrickville was shown as having a current risk of 42 fatalities per million per year by the year 2010 if a third runway is constructed. This risk would have increased to 103 per million per year.

         The paper specifies that the risk criteria for residential land use is one fatality per million per year. We are now talking of a possible increase in fatalities to 103 per million per year.

Hospitals and schools will have a risk imposed upon them 200 times greater than the guidelines recommend.

        These statistics do not take into account possible multiplier effects such as a crash into the huge chemical and petrochemical storage sites adjacent to the airport. It should be recognised that an air crash into those important petrochemical facilities would be absolutely disastrous, not only for Kurnell but for all of Cronulla and that region of Sydney as a whole. That is something that I think local residents have every right to be very concerned about.

         It is our concern that, if these regulations were passed, State environment law would become irrelevant. They establish a precedent; in fact, that precedent has already been established by the passage of the ANSTO Amendment Bill last June. It establishes a precedent for circumventing environmental legislation requirements for any project, any time, anywhere.

The public was denied an opportunity to comment on what is one of the major urban environmental issues in Australia. It certainly is the major environmental issue facing Sydney at this time.

         I do that for a whole host of reasons, the principal one being this: in looking at sensible airport planning in Australia, a decision has been made to develop a third runway at the Mascot airport, but not at any cost. If this is done, there should be sufficient environmental safeguards and protections to ensure that the local environment, particularly that of Botany Bay, can be reasonably protected in the circumstances.

         This is an important development, and one which has a huge economic impact for Australia. Sydney is the major gateway to this continent for all overseas travel. The facilities at Mascot can be upgraded at reasonable cost to ensure improved safety standards above the very high safety standards that already operate for that airport. In that way, the most reasonable outcome for the community can be achieved. That is a sensible planning-project development-air traffic management option.

         But we do not do these things simply because all those criteria are satisfied; we as a government have a serious and demonstrated concern about the environmental impact of development. We have conducted an EIS—an environmental impact statement—to see what the impact of developing a third runway at Mascot will be. Having said that, the environmental impact statement has returned a finding which enables us to proceed to develop that third runway with confidence and a huge degree of security based on scientific research and understanding. The environmental impact will be minimal, and the dangers forecast by those who oppose this development are not real.

         In this case, the circumstances can be fairly described as these: a group of people, mostly Sydney residents, are, in many cases for understandable reasons, opposed to the development of the third runway. Without being trite, those reasons are the NIMBY reasons—the not in my backyard reasons, or the do it somewhere else but do not do it here approach. Stemming from that motive, a whole array of oppositions have been argued. The Federal Government has considered those arguments and decided that, in all the circumstances, the best way to proceed is by extending that third runway at Mascot.

         We are supported in that belief by the New South Wales Government. I point out in passing that we are a Labor government, it is a Liberal government and we are both of the same view on this issue. From the point of view of what is the most sensible development, we can claim a majority position between us. In managerial terms, this is a most sensible position. Nonetheless, citizens and local government authorities are mounting a legal action to prevent the third runway from going ahead. In those circumstances, any argument that can be used as an obstruction is seized upon, thrown up and then used to try to block development.

         A lot of the environmental arguments, with the greatest of respect to those who have propounded them, ought to be approached from that point of view. Their arguments are being utilised as convenient arguments, not necessarily to deal with the problems they are alleged to stem from but to prevent the development of the project at all. In saying that, I do not want to be uncharitable; I am sure that there are a number of people who have raised the environmental arguments out of serious and conscientious concern for the environment. Those people who have done that would raise those arguments anyway because, in the main, they believe that almost any development has an adverse impact—as I have said, every development has some impact of some sort—and that those developments should be set aside. We do not have that view. We recognise their view; we respect their right to hold it. We disagree and, being a government, we intend to implement our governmental authority in these circumstances.

         The argument is centring around the question of whether or not an appropriate environmental clearance has been made. That argument has particular force because there are three levels of government in this country—national, State and local. We have conducted a Federal environmental impact study considering all of the issues. The argument now being raised is that it should have been a State one because there are conflicting areas of authority between the Commonwealth and the State; Botany Bay is a State jurisdiction, so it should have been a State EIS. Doubtless, if that argument fails, as may be the case, there will be contending arguments that there was some local government involvement.

         What this argument is about in one respect is twisting on the horns of the dilemma of the three levels of government who has the authority and which is the right governmental agency to make these decisions. It is exactly because of those reasons that the Commonwealth conducted its environmental impact study in close collaboration with the New South Wales Government. The plan that springs from that study exceeds or matches State standards in every respect. Mostly it exceeds all of the State standards; it never goes below any of the State standards.

         The environmental impact statement—I speak as a former Minister for Resources and someone with some knowledge of these things—was one of the most comprehensive ever conducted in Australia for a major project. We are a government that is proud of its green credentials and its environmental position. We do not want to lose that pride by shoddy workmanship. We set very high standards for this environmental impact statement. It has matched very high standards. It is one of the most comprehensive ever. The statement has dealt with coastal hydrodynamics, the effect of the development on the tide flows in and out of Botany Bay, the impact on water quality within the area, and—the question raised by Senator Sowada in her address—the issue of the disturbance of sediments, including heavy metals.

         Those matters have been scientifically studied, analysed and reported on. Conclusions have been reached about them which do not justify what I might, with respect, call the alarmist view that there are serious concerns about the spread of heavy metals. The findings do not support that alarmist presentation. We have looked at the potential damage to the seagrass beds in Botany Bay and made evaluations. We have looked at—this was a matter raised by Senator Sowada—the impact on fish species and other marine fauna and organisms. The conclusions—these are not conclusions by government or by politicians acting out of political expediency; these are the conclusions of the scientists who have made the study, so to that extent they have to be seen as scientific—are that, with safeguards, it is reasonable to proceed with the development of this runway. When all the evidence is in, as it now is, I think we are bound to do that.

The proposal for development is consistent with those findings.

         In those circumstances we would be in contempt of our responsibility if we did not then proceed. It is hard to escape a conclusion that the reason why some of these matters are being raised now is to delay the process, making the project less economic and causing a consideration of having to do other things as stopgaps. The eternal reality remains that Sydney is the gateway to Australia for most international flights. There is an obligation to ensure that the airports can accommodate that traffic. The best and most reasonable way of doing it is by developing a third runway.

         That leads me to the horrific crash in Amsterdam. The issue that is being raised by Senator Sowada is that, by concentrating airport movements over Sydney at Mascot close to or in part of the metropolitan area, we will risk in Sydney an Amsterdam type crash. I do not want to take from the Dutch in any way their proud record of air safety. But Australia's record of air safety is better than or at least equal to any in the world. We do not need to doff our hats to anyone when it comes to the level of air safety in Australia. So we have a very proud record to stand by, a record enforced by very competent technical people.

         What is the truth, in any case, about Mascot? The third runway will enable more take-offs over Botany Bay, a non-residential area, than over the residential areas of Sydney. The recommendations are that there will be 86 per cent more take-offs and landings over Botany Bay than there would have been without the third runway. That is a pretty impressive change. It means fewer aircraft over residential areas and a lessening of the risk. If there is an air mishap, in such grievous circumstances it is more likely that it would be over the sea in Botany Bay than over a metropolitan area in Sydney.

         So, from the point of view of the Amsterdam argument, the best way of preventing an Amsterdam type crash is to develop a third runway. It is certainly not to withhold the development of a third runway. The likelihood of a crash in a densely populated metropolitan area will be less with the option of a  third runway than it would be without it. I think that is an important consideration.

         There are perhaps a number of other points I should make, but in general terms the major issues here have been summarised. It is fair to say that the Federal Airports Corporation's regulations established a licensing regime to ensure that contractors working on the third runway construction site and dredging sites in Botany Bay are required to comply with the findings of the EIS. They are required by law to do that. That enforces those standards and ensures that the work will be done properly with due regard to the sensitive environment.

The environmental standards demanded of the contractors working on this project, as I said before, are at least equal to and, in many cases, exceed the requirements that would apply under the State laws.

         The Botany Bay environmental management plan stage 1 was developed by a steering committee comprising the Federal Airports Corporation and the New South Wales Department of Planning—joint Federal-State cooperation. A key feature of the plan is a range of specialist environmental studies that were undertaken which provide baseline data to assist in the development of strategies to manage any environmental impacts during the construction phase and in the longer term. The study of the third runway represents one of the most comprehensive undertaken. It deals with all of those matters that I have referred to. It deals with a broad range of issues, including a thorough and extensive examination of the environmental effects of dredging sand from Botany Bay.

         Because the environmental impact statement on the third runway was prepared in accordance with Federal environmental assessment legislation, not State legislation, the Federal Airports Corporation's regulations are also intended to remove any doubt about the extent to which New South Wales laws apply to the construction of the runway. The draft environmental impact statement provided a statement on the relationship between the Commonwealth and New South Wales environmental assessment processes. It summed up the position by stating that the State legislation would not apply to the construction of the proposed runway on Commonwealth or Federal Airports Corporation land.

         —A few minutes ago the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) made reference to the possibility that Senator Sowada's motion was simply another delaying tactic in what has effectively been a very long saga. That was my concern as well. There has been an extraordinarily long gestation period for this airport. It goes back to 1983 when the Hawke Government cancelled the coalition plans to commence construction of a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Then six years passed and we had the Hawke Government announcement in March 1989 that:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the economically rational option is to build a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport, subject to an environmental impact statement, and proceed with the development of Badgerys Creek but not on a fast track basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, on 20 September 1990, we had a draft environmental impact statement released for public comment. On 18 January 1991, 1,897 submissions were passed to the Federal Airports Corporation for consideration. Then, also in September 1991, a supplement to the draft environmental impact statement was presented. In November 1991, the Government finally announced approval for that third runway.

       <para first-indent="16">

         I do not need to canvass that environmental impact statement in great detail. The Minister gave it a fair amount of consideration in his speech and broadly I would agree with most of the things he said about it. Looking at the question of dredging, which has been a major issue under debate, the Commonwealth has moved to give the Federal Airports Corporation the right to dredge for the runway without having to comply with the environmental assessment processes of the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. But, as the Minister said just a minute ago, the draft EIS said that the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act of 1979 does not apply to the proposed construction of a third runway on Commonwealth or FAC land.

         There seem to have been submissions which suggested that this was not correct, but in fact it is the case that the Commonwealth has, if you like, the right to overrule the State laws. But, in fact, that is not the way it has turned out anyway. The dredging issues were considered in part E of the supplement to the draft environmental impact statement which, as I say, was released nearly 12 months ago. That part included consideration of the fill requirements, the on-shore sand sources and the impact on Botany Bay, including the coastal hydrodynamics of Botany Bay. It looked at the potential erosion of the foreshores as a result of changes to wave climate caused by dredging and runway construction. It looked at the marine ecology of Botany Bay. The Minister mentioned fish, but it included references to the impact on water quality, sediments and seagrasses as well as fish, and it looked at dredging generally.

         Just how much more in the way of such studies do the Democrats demand? Perhaps they will not be satisfied no matter what happens. Let us look at the provision being developed for the environmental management plan. It is to be implemented by the Federal Airports Corporation and the relevant State agencies. For instance, it says in appendix C:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Environmental Management Plan will be developed and implemented jointly by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) and relevant State agencies.

       </para>
       <para>
        It could not be much clearer than that. It says further:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The objectives of the environmental management plan are to project, restore and enhance, as appropriate, the environmental qualities of Botany Bay (especially the water quality and the aquatic and terrestrial habitats for flora and fauna in and around the bay) in relation to any adverse impacts of the Third Runway.
       </para>
       <para>
        So all of these things—the environmental impact statement and the processes that went into the consultations and submissions, and the establishment of the mechanisms for the development of an environmental management plan, its objectives and the way it is to operate—still do not satisfy the Democrats. Once again, they are finding that their principles are flexible to the extent that, while they are not normally concerned about such parochial matters as States rights, they suddenly discover that State rights are an important issue to flog in relation to this airport—despite the fact that the New South Wales Government is keenly and actively contributing to the establishment of a third runway and is very keen to see it happen.

Just why are they trying to delay this vital project? One just has to wonder at their motives. They seem insistent on joining Labor's troglodytes in their opposition to the third runway. In saying that I am referring to such people as Messrs McLeay, Punch, Brereton and Baldwin, and also to the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Ms McHugh, all of whom have seen it to be in their personal political interests to oppose that runway.

         The construction of that third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport is the most important infrastructure decision of the Federal Government to date. Goodness knows, we in the Opposition have been very critical over a long time of the paralysis of this Government in developing major infrastructure projects. On this one, it may have taken nearly a decade but it finally got there. If the third runway is not built by 1995, Sydney will be unable to handle effectively any further increases in passengers, so the whole economy of Australia will suffer. Sydney Airport must expand to cope with the forecast growth in tourism. The third runway will reduce the forecast aircraft delays by 90 per cent by the year 2010. If nothing is done, those aircraft delays could cost airline operators $695m a year by the year 2010.

         We have heard hearts and violins today coming from the Democrats about aircraft safety. It seemed to be quite a convenient moment to refer to aircraft accidents. Perhaps they are not prepared to acknowledge, as the Minister has just done, that aircraft safety will be enhanced by a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport.

In addition, there is the contribution by international visitors in badly needed increased spending in our country.

        I do not wish to delay the Senate longer. I sum up by saying that the coalition's position is basically that the third runway should commence immediately because of the demands of the aviation industry, the need for growth in tourism, and the safety requirements as well. Those aviation and tourism concerns are vital to the revival of Australia's economy and our country's future.

         I was very surprised to hear the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) argue in relation to an increase in safety, a matter that has just been taken up by the Opposition spokesperson on this matter. Senator Sowada earlier pointed out that the estimate is that the risk would actually increase as a consequence of the increased number of flights. I was also surprised to hear Senator Cook talk about taking off over Botany Bay. I think he would know that in the Amsterdam crash the aircraft took off quite successfully and circled around and was in the process of attempting to re-land when the accident occurred and it crashed into that building.

         I was also rather surprised to hear Senator Cook dismiss the figures given by Senator Sowada of the risk of 100 deaths per million population. As Minister for Industrial Relations and certainly as somebody formerly in the trade union movement, he would know that in occupational health, when people are exposed to hazardous substances such as carcinogens, the recognised standards are between one in a million and 10 in a million, or one in 100,000. That is the recognised standard. In that situation, the worker who goes into that potentially hazardous occupation understands that there is a risk involved. He also understands that there is some benefit in being exposed to that one in a million or one in 100,000 risk.

         In the case of the risk in relation to air crashes over Sydney, most of those people who are exposed get no benefit whatsoever. They are simply people who will be arbitrarily under a flight path when an aircraft is in difficulties. Under those circumstances, I think the figure Senator Sowada quoted of 100 per million, or roughly one in 10,000, is somewhere between 10 and 100 times higher than would be expected in occupational health. In those circumstances, I find Senator Cook's acceptance rather strange.

That is why this particular result is so pleasing, because one of the depressed areas for some time has been international aviation. In the face of those results around the world, it is particularly pleasing that today Qantas has announced an after tax profit of $137m for the 1991-92 financial year. Most importantly, the airline group achieved a pre-tax profit before abnormal items of $103m compared with a loss of $158m the previous year.

         This major turnaround has been achieved largely as a result of significant cost reductions and increased productivity resulting from the major restructuring of the airline group. The performance by Qantas is also commendable, given that it was achieved against a background of a highly competitive operating environment which was significantly affected by depressed international trading conditions. Most other international carriers have recorded major operating losses over the past year.

The Australian international scheduled airline passenger market grew by 7.2 per cent in 1991-92. Although the result cannot be directly compared with ICAO traffic reports, it can be noted that the latest ICAO estimate for 1991 indicated an overall decline in passenger traffic of 3.5 per cent on the previous year. Therefore, Australia's growth performance is even more creditable when viewed against this background.

Is the Australian Federal Police aware of investigations linking Daikyo with a Japanese investor, Mr Kotani, a bankrupt, who is facing charges in Japan of manipulating stock prices and attempted blackmail? Did Mr Kotani control a company called Kohshin and has the Daikyo chairman, Mr Yokoyama, ever been a director of Kohshin Australia? Finally, is this the same Mr Yokoyama who was identified in the Brisbane District Court last year as giving over $110,000 in political donations to the then Queensland Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, shortly before the 1986 Queensland election?

I emphasise that they are aware only of Japanese stock exchange investigations. I think what lay behind the question was some sort of inference that perhaps the AFP itself was conducting such investigations. AFP investigations have not linked a senior executive of Daikyo with a high ranking Yakuza member, as was alleged or implied in some questions asked by Senator Kernot a week or so ago, and to which I will give answers after Question Time.

         In general, it has to be said that the responsibility of the Minister for Justice is to deal with those matters which the AFP might be investigating because it is alleged that a Federal offence has occurred. That is the role of the Australian Federal Police and Federal authorities. It has become apparent over the last few weeks that this chamber is being used, perhaps because of a lack of Democrat numbers in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, as a vehicle for raising matters which are properly matters of State jurisdiction. Therefore, I think Senator Kernot will continually be disappointed in the scope of answers I am able to give her because so much of what she raises falls within State law enforcement jurisdiction.

         —It is an important question because the AIA report, which was published a few weeks ago, came out at a time when there were some ill-informed criticisms of the car industry in relation to quality issues—criticisms which were absolute nonsense. One of the main aims of the Government's automotive industry plan has been to improve quality levels because until recent years we had not been making cars of good enough quality. Indeed, some of the perceptions from the 1970s are quite wrong.

         In the past there was a quality gap between locally produced and imported cars. In its report on the state of the automotive industry for 1991, the AIA said that the gap had narrowed significantly. Now the Authority has reported that survey data for this year shows that the gap no longer exists on some models and continues to narrow across the Australian industry. That is a 34 per cent improvement in quality, in terms of consumer response to vehicles, between 1988 and 1992.

         The export facilitation scheme for the automotive industry, which the Opposition rejects, was a crucial factor in Mitsubishi Australia winning the right to produce Magna wagons for sale in North America and Europe. That would disappear with zero tariffs and so would export programs such as the Mitsubishi wagon.

Merle Mitchell is one of those at the forefront who can see through the Opposition's policies and can see the merit of the policies of those on this side.

         There is one way to handle the long term unemployed and there is one way not to. The way not to is to cut off their benefits after nine months or deny them adequate training, because that goes directly to the viability of families in the long term unemployed group. The Opposition wants to cut off their benefits after nine months. Where is the equity and compassion there? Where is the equity in those opposite stopping the economic activity that we are generating in the economy by cutting back on public expenditure?

         I also think it is important that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has decided on a scheme whereby protection orders obtained from, for example, the magistrates court in Western Australia could be applied to a situation where the assaulted spouse tries to get refuge, say, in Tasmania or New South Wales. The magistrates courts in those jurisdictions could enforce that protection order. If the person were followed by the assailant to the State of refuge, the assailant would be subject to penalties within the State of refuge.

The commissioners of the various police forces have been instructed by Ministers to pay particular attention to child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse, not only within Australia but also when Australians travel overseas. The Australian Federal Police, through their liaison officers in Bangkok and other places around the world, keep an eye on Australian paedophiles who travel to those jurisdictions and take advantage of the poverty of youngsters there in order to gratify their particular lusts.

Thanks to the women's refuge movement in particular, which 20 years ago inaugurated the protection of women who were subjected to domestic violence, there has been a growing awareness in the community that we are talking about criminal assault of a particularly vicious kind, quite often a hidden kind. Now that it is more openly spoken of in the community, I believe magistrates and judges are willing to respond, as are the various police commissioners and police forces, in dealing with this form of criminal activity.

In fact, that judgment was founded on representative government as being essential to our form of democracy, and that was never conferred by the common law judges. They never conferred a right to vote. As our colleagues from Singapore will well know, the old imperial common law judges never gave the right to vote to the people. It had to be fought for at every stage. This breathtaking idea that the High Court is on the side of common law enshrining of the right to representative government is absolute nonsense.

         —Catholics and dissenters know that they would not have a bar of it. The right to vote is not a common law right. The way in which the High Court constructed its judgment last week does not give any confidence that the common law judges have the capacity to protect the rights and liberties of the Australian people. That will fall to this Parliament. Admittedly, the High Court has had a very proper role. For example, when the conservative coalitions back in the 1950s tried to ban a particular political party and dissolve it, the High Court held that that was beyond the constitutional power of the Federal Parliament and Government. In fact, the people upheld that judgment in a referendum. But that was based on our Constitution, which was founded on referendums in the late 1890s and passed by the Imperial Parliament. It was nothing to do with the common law itself. If the workers in the 1890s had decided to go for class warfare instead of the parliamentary and arbitrary system to better their working conditions, the common law judges would not have given them any help either to secure their democratic rights.

         Senator Spindler asks about whether the Government is going to allow the High Court to usurp the role of the Parliament. The answer is no. For example, only a few weeks ago this Parliament passed a law to do with conscientious objection to military service in particular theatres of war. Where were the High Court judges during the Vietnam war? Where were they in protecting the conscientious rights of young Australians to say, `No, we will not kill other human beings in that conflict'?

         It is a fact that in the time that has elapsed since that particular project various pieces of legislation have gone through this Parliament which have dealt with rights for Australians which the common law—once again I say—never recognised. One that comes to mind is the question of the right of privacy, which this Parliament has dealt with fundamentally over the last several years, over a lot of objection as to the way in which it was worked out—at times from the Opposition and at times from others within the community. That has required a tremendous amount of work by this Parliament. That is the sort of work we will continually undertake. It will ensure that the rights which the common law never recognised will be recognised by this Parliament and protected in the ways that I have outlined.

         In relation to the comments made by Don Argus of the National Australia Bank, I think Mr Argus has been a serious and very conservative commentator on issues relating to the Australian economy. What he says, of course, is that if the Government's tax cuts in 1994 are too stimulatory, those opposite have to face the prospect that so are theirs.

         For the benefit of those who are watching the Senate show and not listening to this noise, the interjections are all directed at the four-legs-good two-legs-bad type arguments in support of Fightback. We have to analyse what the real situation is, and the Opposition can find no real succour in the comments of Mr Argus about the medium term fiscal outlook. If our tax cuts were too stimulatory, so would be the Opposition's. The Government does not believe its offered tax cuts would be excessively expansionary because, as I have said on a number of occasions, we are committed to returning the Budget to surplus in the medium term. That is why we introduced the changes to the fringe benefits tax regime and so on which were announced a couple of weeks ago.

         Mr Argus said that an expansionary policy was understandable in the present economic circumstances. Mr Argus was a willing contributor to the preparation of the One Nation statement, which did introduce stimulatory economic policies at that time—and I think he is right. He has a different view, by the way, from the other business leaders Senator Short quoted today at Question Time. Mr Argus had a slightly more bullish view about a recovery than them. Mr Argus's view of fiscal policy contrasts with that of Dr Hewson, who said that he wanted to take $6 billion or $7 billion out of the Budget and reduce the Budget stimulus by 2 per cent of GDP. So I do not think the Opposition can take much comfort from what Mr Argus said about these issues.

On what basis did the Minister then contradict this advice and accept a monopoly proposal from Monash, which had incorrectly reported that the University Partnerships proposal had fallen apart?

I do not have an answer to that question in any detail and I will refer the question that has been asked by Senator Tierney to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin. However, I do say that Senator Tierney ought to stop engaging in cheap political gimmickry on this. We have made a very positive initiative in introducing open learning into Australia, which supplements the tertiary system—a very useful innovation. Senator Tierney has been running around Australia condemning us for that and misrepresenting the position. Senator Tierney should actually stop doing that. In the meanwhile, I will refer the rest of the question to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services.

Given these actions, how does the Minister propose to ensure that the non-metropolitan universities with distance education centres will not be disadvantaged by the proposed Monash University dominated open learning system?

         The letter of the Minister, I have to confess, is somewhat disappointing. The resolution of the Senate which was as a result of a motion moved by my colleague Senator Short, who of course has taken a very close interest in the welfare of Baltic peoples over a long period of time, was to protest the continuing presence of Russian troops in the three Baltic states—troops which are of course now regarded as occupying forces now that the three Baltic states have been accepted by the international community as independent sovereign states.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This is a position that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would know we held throughout the years of occupation by the Soviet Union and was in fact held by all Australian governments except the Whitlam Labor Government which reversed that policy for a period of time. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and since the international community accepted the independence of the three Baltic states on a general basis, up to 200,000 Russian troops have remained. The exact number is somewhat in dispute, but it is certainly somewhere between 130,000 and 200,000. The Baltic peoples are deeply distressed by this continuing presence of Russian forces on their soil and have sought support from the international community in pressuring Russia to withdraw those forces.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We know there is difficulty for Russia in withdrawing in terms of providing housing and other material benefits for the grossly extended Soviet force, in particular the Russian force, but, nevertheless, that does not negate the very reasonable demand by sovereign nations that occupying forces or forces of former occupying powers still on that soil should leave. This Senate very reasonably expressed that demand also and requested that the Australian Government protest that continuing occupation to the Russians and join—I am not sure whether it said it specifically, but certainly that was the spirit—with other governments of like mind to apply that pressure.

          As I have said, the response of the Minister to that demand as evidenced by his letter today is disappointing. Nowhere in his reply does he say that the opinion of the Australian Government is that it is opposed to the presence of the Russian forces in the Baltic states. He does not in any place indicate that the Australian Government is prepared, either on its own behalf or in conjunction with others, to diplomatically apply pressure to Russia to withdraw those forces. He does not canvass the possibility of the international community looking for ways in which it might support Russia in the provision of housing for its forces upon withdrawal.

        <para first-indent="16">

          I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that even the Baltic states themselves in their very difficult economic circumstances have said that they would try to look at ways in which they could help ease this financial burden. All the Minister really says is that the Australian Government is pleased that a timetable has been agreed with the Government of Lithuania for withdrawal over the next couple of years and that the Australian Government hopes that a similar agreement will be reached with Estonia and Latvia as well. That is not good enough. That is a reply that will disappoint the Baltic peoples in Australia. They deserve more from this Australian Government. One can think of many states in the world that have foreign soldiers on their soil, but of the Baltic states particularly when one takes into account the fact that they were forcibly occupied for so long. They deserve more from the international community and they deserve more of the Australian Government.

During the course of this debate the Minister might get up and in fact say that the Australian Government's policy is that these troops should be withdrawn forthwith from the Baltic states and that the Australian Government is willing, together with other Western and like minded nations, to apply what diplomatic force is open upon Russia to require that withdrawal as soon as absolutely possible.

          —That was a pathetic little bit of grandstanding from the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) and he ought to be ashamed of himself for doing it. I do not mind in the slightest his getting up here and saying that he, the Opposition and members of the Australian Parliament are concerned about the continuation of the presence of Russian forces on Baltic states' soil. That concern is a concern that we share as I made perfectly clear in the text of this letter when we said that we hoped that similar agreements of the kind that had been reached with Lithuania would in fact prove achievable with the other states.

          The whole point of the letter that I did the Senate the courtesy of sending to the President of the Senate was simply, as a point of information, to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that one particular state referred to in the motion had in fact the day before the motion was passed entered into an agreement which would, within a reasonable time frame, allow for the withdrawal of the troops in question from its soil. In the letter I could have drawn attention to the obduracy and the stupidity of Senator Short in not amending his motion properly in the way that he was advised he should on the morning that the thing went through. The motion makes several references to Lithuania which are not appropriate, given the reality of the particular agreement signed on 8 September.

          Senator Short could not get his amendment correct and the point of the motion was simply to clarify that particular matter for the benefit of the Senate. It is absolutely no justification for pretending in some way that the Opposition's position on this is holier than that of the Australian Government. The motion did not call upon me or the Government to take any particular diplomatic action. If it had, I would, of course, have been responsive to that in the terms of my reply. It simply expressed the views of the Senate on an issue in respect of which it was entirely legitimate to express views—views which the Australian Government shares.

         Between giving that notice of motion and the motion being brought on the following day, there were announcements over the wires from Lithuania that, in fact, an agreement had been reached between Russia and Lithuania. To its credit, Senator Evans's office rang me on the morning of 9 September and said to me, `We have consulted with the Department on this and it has drawn to our attention the fact that overnight there appears to have been an agreement signed between Lithuania and Russia. Therefore, we suggest the following amendment to your notice of motion'. Senator Evans's office suggested, with words supplied by his Department, that my motion be preceded with the words that the Senate:

         I later inserted the word `virtually' in the first paragraph of the motion so that, instead of saying `there has been no progress on the withdrawal', it said `there has been virtually no progress on the withdrawal'. That amendment was cleared with Senator Evans's office and his office said that that was okay by the Department. On that basis, the Senate agreed to carry it as a formal motion on 9 September.

          I ask Senator Evans for an apology for the mistake that he made in his remarks. He has implied that I did not take any notice of the agreement that had been signed between Russia and Lithuania. I did take notice of it; it had occurred in that 24-hour period. The wording of the resolution and the amendment that was made to that motion were words supplied to me by his office and his Department. How he could not know that is beyond my comprehension. As I have said before and as this chamber now knows par excellence, it simply reflects the fact that Senator Evans is not up with the game in terms of his Department and his portfolio responsibilities.

          Senator Evans implied in his letter to the President that he was doing the Senate a courtesy—and it is a courtesy—in deigning to reply to the President. I would be absolutely amazed if he had shown the discourtesy that is implied in the opposite—namely, that he would not even have considered replying. Given that Senator Evans replied—and I welcome that—I find his response, as Senator Hill has said, very disappointing.

          The motion that this Senate passed, formally and unanimously, expressed concern that there had been virtually no progress on this matter whilst recognising the Lithuanian situation. There is no mention in Senator Evans's letter to the President acknowledging that concern. Weakly, he said in his response that he had an expression of concern because he says in the last sentence that the Government `hopes that similar accords are signed with Latvia and Estonia in the near future'. If that is a response to an expression of concern that is supposed to reflect what the Senate had felt about this matter—it felt strongly about it—then Senator Evans grew up in a different school of English language from that which I and my colleagues on this side of the chamber grew up in.

          The letter says nothing about the continuing situation. As I understand it, that situation is that there has been no further progress in terms of any form of agreement between the Russian Government on the one hand and Latvia and Estonia on the other. The letter also does not reflect the fact that, whilst the defence Ministers did sign an agreement between Russia and Lithuania on 8 September in Moscow, at that time it was also hoped that a similar agreement would be signed between President Yeltsin and President Landsbergis. A last minute hitch occurred, so that agreement was not signed and, as I understand it, has still not been signed. That is an important agreement because without it the defence Ministers' agreement is much weakened. Senator Evans's letter does not acknowledge any of those things.

          Without taking up much more time, I very strongly endorse Senator Hill's words of disappointment in Senator Evans's response to this formal resolution of the Senate. I believe that Senator Evans has not dealt with the issues concerned. He has certainly not reflected in any way in his answer the concern that this Senate and many Australians, not just those of Baltic origin, feel about this matter. It has much wider implications than the situation simply between Russia and the Baltic nations, because it goes to the whole question of the presence of foreign troops on the soil of sovereign nations.

I hope very much that the Government of Australia will be lending its good offices in whichever way it can, much more strongly than is indicated in his letter, to achieving the resolution of this matter in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia and also doing what we can through our good offices to get a better basis for agreement between President Yeltsin and President Landsbergis. It is a matter of very real concern and it is something that the Government, as well as the Australian Parliament, should feel much more strongly about than the intent that is shown in Senator Evans's letter.

He has looked at the notice of motion of 8 September, not the motion that was passed on 9 September, because the motion that was passed on 9 September was amended to take into account exactly the wording that his office and his Department passed on to me and which I was happy to accept.

        That is the context of my referring earlier to Senator Short's not appreciating the logic and the force of his own motion and amending the motion properly accordingly. He amended it in a half-baked and incomplete fashion. Because the motion had been thus amended and because there were continued references to Lithuania, conveying the impression that there had been something less than substantial about the agreement that had been reached with Lithuania, I thought it appropriate under those circumstances to write to the President, not in any way referring to that exchange but simply for the record, making it clear that there was this very substantial agreement on the record signed by the Defence Ministers providing for the withdrawal of all forces from Vilnius by November this year and from the rest of Lithuania by 31 August next year. On the face of it, it was a perfectly reasonable thing to do and simply does not justify the criticism that has been directed towards me or the Government by Senator Hill and now Senator Short.

        Some might say this report has been a little long in finding its way into this chamber, but I think anyone who gets the opportunity to read it will see that the delay has done it no harm. The principal reason for the delay is that the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, at the time of receiving this term of reference, was devoting itself to the drugs in sport inquiry. As everyone knows, as a result of an extraordinary effort, the Committee brought down an excellent report on drugs in sport. The inquiry clearly was a matter of considerable scope and priority for the Committee.

         The first point relates to the concern the Committee had about putting together the words `environment' and `tourism'. For many years, indeed until fairly recently, environment and tourism were at war with each other. People who spoke the language of environment seemed to regard tourism and all tourist developments as the enemy and vice versa.

         It is easy to report and it is certainly fair to report that that attitude has changed. The environmental lobby and the tourism developers appreciate that there is much more to be gained by both of them through cooperation. Not only is it a matter of what can be gained but also it is a fair representation and recognition by both those groups that it is vital that they do cooperate.

         —She did indeed and perhaps we should have called our report the title of her poem. I was tempted to at some stage, but in the end we were not persuaded by poetry. Senator Brownhill is quite right. Australia has been marketing itself as an overseas destination because of its environmental or landscape attractions. It is very important that the tourist industry, in developing opportunities for people to see and explore that countryside, that outback, does not in the process jeopardise or even damage that environment. That has been the case in times past.

         It is very comforting that our report was able to table a recognition of the changed language between those two groups, those parts of industry, in the Australian community. There has been a recognition that there is no point in killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Although we did not examine it in great detail, it was certainly brought to the Committee's attention that there is a need for tourism and the environment to work together—not only to cease to be at war, but to work together—in preserving the environment. Even if the tourism development at the outset is a very sympathetic development, the number of tourists that come to stay in an area and/or visit the surrounding areas still

         We have seen a number of examples, some of which we referred to in the report, where it is important to ration the number of tourists, either the total number or the number at any one time able to proceed to an area. This is certainly happening with the area around Uluru rock and in many other areas of the environment, not only in areas which in the past were called fragile environments but also in areas that are overrun by uncontrolled or unlimited numbers of tourists and which can become threatened and proceed to a fragile state.

         We thought it was very important to make the point that `environment' should include not only landscapes but very much the people living in the landscapes and to make recommendations about the importance of tourism developments to take account of the environment in consultation with the community but in particular to include that local community.

         Taking evidence at Broome, we were told about the fairly dramatic impact of the increased population in Broome on the local community, a dimension that is not always developed in looking at the impact on tourism and environment. One important consideration, for example, is that the costs of everything rise with the increase in population in a tourist resort. The changing character of Broome is a very salutary lesson in some ways. The local population, white and Aboriginal, have had to come to terms with fairly significant increases in costs—the cost of living in particular. Further, some of the people, particularly the Aboriginal community, have had to deal with the changing landscape of their culture through the development of tourism in what was previously not a tourist resort. We urge in our report an understanding of the environment to include `the people' and `the local community'.

         We were also told of sleepy beach resorts that people like to retire to for quiet holidays. If those beach resorts are turned into skyscraper-type holiday resorts, people visiting them do not experience the same kind of holiday at all; they do not enjoy the same kind of rest. We also met the concept of the anti-tourist tourist—someone who likes to be a tourist visiting places but who does not want to meet 5,000 other people also there at the same time. There is a very large appeal in our tourist industry for places to which people can go to be away from it all. If we want to go to a wilderness, the last thing we want to find is that it is overrun by other humans. The very word `wilderness' means that we expect to find few other people. I do not think most people mind finding sight and sound of other humans; not all of us want to be hermits. But the concept of the anti-tourist tourist I think is worthy of consideration and is reflected in the variety of tourist developments that we find around Australia.

         The second main point I highlight is the issue of adequate statistics in the area of tourism. In trying to assess the impact of an industry or to set goals that we want measured to account for the impact of changes and developments in that area, it is very difficult if we do not have adequate baseline statistics, or at least an agreed set of statistics and figures. What is a bed for the purposes of being counted as a tourist bed? Most of us can describe what a bed is, but is this bed to be counted amongst tourist statistics or is it for local use and, therefore, not to be described as part of tourism?

         There is still much more debate to go on about what exactly constitutes tourist statistics, but we do now have the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Australian Bureau of Statistics; I think the ABS is producing the framework of guidelines for what constitute tourism statistics and how to collect them. It is very important that those principles be agreed to and that the collectors of the data—the small providers of beds, support services, restaurants, accommodation and so on—appreciate the way in which that data is being asked for and contribute to its collection, so that we begin to get consistent national data.

         Finally, the Committee makes recommendations about the changed nature of the Foreign Investment Review Board. We agree to its continuing; we agree about the good work it does; but we feel that, if we really are serious about the Foreign Investment Review Board giving independent advice, that advice should proceed directly to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) after being examined by the FIRB and not back through Treasury officials. We have made recommendations to that effect and to the effect that there would therefore be a requirement for some at least modest change in the structuring of the FIRB.

Local communities are very concerned if a significant overseas development gets started but does not proceed, and there are any number of examples of that happening around the country. We feel that that is a matter of relevance and pertinence to the FIRB, and we have made recommendations along those lines too.

         This is an opportune time to have a report such as this which puts the tourist strategy in place, particularly in terms of the opportunities for jobs and growth in this area. Nowhere is there any report that tourism is a negative in terms of economics. I do not wish to canvass again the economic issues or changes to local communities, for example. In the limited framework of looking at it in terms of economics, from all accounts tourism seems to be a very significant plus. Export earnings from tourism for this country are larger than rural and mining earnings combined, something that is still not widely recognised by the Australian community. Certainly once known, it ought to focus our minds considerably on the importance of protecting the tourist industry and seeing that it is developed, but in a way that is consistent with other principles and policies of the Australian community, let alone of Government or Opposition policies.

         There are jobs in the tourist industry. Many of those jobs are smiled at and dismissed as menial, but they do not actually reflect what the tourist industry is built on. Many of the jobs, I am interested to note, are for women, and many of those women are employed in their own small businesses dealing with the day to day running of a profit-returning organisation offering a service to people. There are opportunities for increasingly diverse jobs within tourism, and I think it is important that in understanding the benefits of the industry we also understand the character of it. It is not just a bed-making industry.

         I had the pleasure of being in Russia—what used to be called the Soviet Union—a couple of years ago. There we were given immediate and real evidence of the failure of that country to have anything approaching a national transport strategy that could deliver food to the people. Sometimes I am inclined to worry about national strategies on the ground that they seem to be establishing a bureaucracy. When I came home I though about this in terms of a national tourist strategy. It is very much to Australia's credit that we can, firstly, have the skills and sophistication to define and consider a national tourist strategy; and, secondly, define and address the areas of considerable difficulty. It is a measure not only of our sophistication but also of our civility.

I can assure all of those people who read this report or Senator Crowley's speech that, even though Broome is a long way away, it is a destination which people from Sydney and Melbourne can get to at a very reasonable price flying with Ansett. Once they get there, they will find that the cost of a beer or a meal at any of the very fine resorts, be it Lord McAlpine's Cable Beach Club, the Auski resort or many of the other resorts in Broome, is very reasonable.

Most Australians will have an interest in both of those topics because tourism has become so important to Australia's national economic advance.

         It is important that honourable senators and Senate standing committees do not immediately accept a reference in this Parliament and presume that the outcome of that inquiry should be to see whether or not the Commonwealth Government should get more involved.

I have yet to be convinced, for example, that setting up an environmental protection authority at the Federal level will actually achieve the worthy aims of trying to protect the Australian environment. Many honourable senators will disagree with that, but it needs to be put on the record that setting out to solve a problem by creating a new bureaucracy has failed many times in the past. And I think setting up a central agency such as an environmental protection authority will not help the environment. I remain to be convinced.

         Centralising environmental control can also be dangerous because one of the negative aspects of doing this is that one will in practice smother some of the entrepreneurial work and some of the innovative work at the academic level, in the private sector and in the government sector in trying to create environmental best practice. If we have State governments, local authorities, small businesses, medium sized businesses and academics all around Australia working on achieving best environmental practice, we are likely to come up with a higher degree of success in achieving environmental outcomes than if we have bureaucratic control and political control centralised in Canberra.

That is one of the main reasons why I have put forward that view in the minority report attached to this report on the Australian environment and tourism.

         The second main comment I wanted to make was on the Government's role in creating an investment environment where we maximise the opportunities for Australia in relation to tourism and particularly international tourism, which is growing in importance. I share Senator Crowley's view that the conflicts between environment and tourism which were commonplace 10 years ago have tended to be diminished and that the major obstacles to investment in tourism, in expanding our tourism infrastructure, are indeed created by governments at a number of levels. I will refer briefly to some of these.

         The rigidities in the labour market still make many of our tourism operations not as feasible as they could be and indeed inhibit the sort of service that we provide to international tourists. As Senator Crowley said, the sometimes seemingly menial jobs of changing beds, making cups of tea or coffee for people or serving them toast in the morning are not menial; they are absolutely vital to Australia's economic future.

         The investment environment we saw around Australia and at Magnetic Island with the stalled Magnetic Quays development—and I also believe that Senator Crowley, on her visit to Broome, saw evidence of a stalled project—was the victim of the monetary policies, the economic policies, of this Government, whereby it forced interest rates very high and ensured that both of those developments stalled in the middle of the process.

         I am honestly not trying to score cheap political points here. It is a lesson for all governments of both political persuasions. But here we have two blights on the environment of Australia not because of some mismatching of environmental and tourism objectives but because of the economic policies of a central government which forced the cost of money so high that the developers of these projects were just forced off the sites and were unable to continue. I am sure that, as the economic recovery gains momentum and people are able to re-finance these projects, Australia will be blessed with two new developments, at Magnetic Island and, of course, in Broome in Western Australia.

         To add to that, Australia does, with increasing focus on international tourism, need more and more capital going into tourism infrastructure—be it hotels, be it resorts, be it roads, be it railways, or whatever. A recent decision, indeed, a Budget decision of this Government, has put another major brick wall in front of investment in tourism—that is, the decision by the Keating Labor Government, and I believe with the support of the Leader of the Government in this place, Senator Button, to tax limited partnerships.

         Limited partnerships are a structure available in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, and lately Victoria, which allow people to invest money with little hope of reward in the medium term, but with tax advantages in the short term, and encourage people to invest in long term projects such as tourism projects which often have a long lead time to get a healthy economic return. The Government decided, I think very unwisely, to tax these limited partnerships, and I am reliably informed by people around Australia that this decision has halted dead in the water a number of proposals to develop tourism resorts, one which I know of in my home State of Western Australia. Again, a decision of the central government has limited the amount of capital which will flow into the tourism industry, which we all agree, on both sides of the chamber, and I believe also in the middle of the chamber, with the Democrats, is an industry which can be environmentally friendly and which can, of course, enhance Australia's economic outlook.

         I also wanted to touch on aviation policy. We have had a very controlled, regulated environment. I congratulate the Government on the deregulation that has occurred to date, but of course the deregulation in the air, the deregulation of international flights, naturally turn our focus to what happens when we get on the ground, which is an integral part of the tourism chain. I have already mentioned the school leavers who serve us toast and tea for breakfast. The airports are a crucial part of the tourism chain because the tourism experience starts when one gets on the plane in one's home port and finishes when one gets off the plane and gets home again. So every experience one has on the way through is crucial.

         Australia, of course, has highly regulated airports controlled by a central government monopoly. We must ask ourselves, when we compare some of the facilities around Australia with the international experience, whether or not we are developing the very best infrastructure in airports. Of course, the Opposition has made its policy quite clear on airports—that is, they should be owned and controlled by the private sector, allow private capital to flow into them and ensure that we develop them to make sure that Australia can keep up with the infrastructure requirements of the rapidly growing tourism market.

         In the short time available to me, I want also to refer to the Foreign Investment Review Board decisions and recommendations made in the majority report. In one recommendation, the majority of the Committee recommended that the Foreign Investment Review Board analyse social impact statements which should be required by developers to look at the social impact of tourism development. We all share a view that the social impact of tourism is something that needs to be looked at and considered. However, it is very hard for me to come to terms with the concept of a body like the Foreign Investment Review Board having to take social impact into account when it is coming to a view on whether or not a foreign investor should invest in Australian tourism—or any other investment, for that matter. I would think that the social impact is something that needs to be considered by the local community, in particular, and that local councils and local democratic processes should perhaps have some say, not over the investment factor, but over the development approval itself.

         Again, that brings me back to the point that if one moves tourism and environmental matters into the Federal sphere, through the national environment protection authority, one takes away that decision making from the grassroots level where people can have a direct say in what goes on in their local community. I think it was Dr Suzuki who said, `Think global and act local'. I am afraid that in Australia, we seem to keep thinking globally, not thinking too locally, but acting globally as well. The trouble with the environment is that, even though the environment is an intricate system of interconnected ecosystems, those ecosystems generally start right down at the ground with micro-organisms and build up into bigger ecosystems. They do, of course, in the long term become a massive global ecosystem, but the trouble usually starts down at the ground and the best people to control those problems are people in the local area who have a direct interest in living in a fine environment. I reiterate my scepticism about bureaucrats and politicians in Canberra being able to improve that environment, no matter how well intentioned they are.

         The other factor about the Foreign Investment Review Board which is referred to in the minority report is an inconsistency whereby the majority report actually asks the Foreign Investment Review Board to include the pre-1986 reform requirement that net economic benefit be demonstrated. My view, formed after considerable hearings with the Foreign Investment Review Board representatives, was that it is impossible to get anyone to analyse, scientifically or arithmetically, whether a particular development will have a net positive impact for the Australian economy. There are so many variables involved that it is very hard to decide that.

         I come back to the matter of the role of the Commonwealth Government, and the idea of the creation of an environment protection authority. I have made a recommendation in this report which I think is one of the most important ones—that is, to ensure that any legislation for the establishment of a national environment protection authority should be made available for public exposure and public comment for a period of at least six months prior to its being introduced in this Parliament.

         I am very worried that in Australia at the moment the environmental agenda is being run by a small handful of people who often have their own agenda to push. I refer, for example, to the listing of World Heritage properties. There is a very good example at the moment with the Nullarbor. The environment Minister federally, the environment Minister in South Australia and the environment Minister in Western Australia agree that they should list the Nullarbor and are proceeding with some speed to list the Nullarbor on the World Heritage listing without any consultation whatsoever with the local community. At the moment, no-one knows exactly where that proposal is. All of the reports are in, but again, there has been no consultation.

         The environment protection authority and the process by which it is being set up is being controlled by a small handful of politicians and bureaucrats. What I suggest, in the interests of all Australians, so that they know what sort of national environment protection authority they will get, if indeed they want one, is to have a long period of exposure of the draft legislation to allow everyone to come to grips with the implications of setting up this new centralised controller of the environment. I think that it would be democratic, I think that it would help the environment debate and I think it would allow all levels of society to have some view on the way in which the environment of Australia is controlled in the future.

        The report that I have just tabled is very much about the environment and tourism. It was not so very long ago as support for the environment grew, so did the tension between the environment and development lobbies which included tourism. Fortunately that attitude has changed. The tourism industry recognises that Australia's major environmental features like the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru Rock are significant drawcards and that it is in the industry's own interest to protect them. However, pressure on the environment will increase as a result of our rapidly expanding tourism industry. Therefore, it is vitally important to be able to identify these threats and ensure that we do not `kill the goose that lays the golden egg'.

        The extent of the economic potential of tourism is now widely known. Not only does income from inbound tourists exceed foreign earnings from wool and mineral ores, but growth projections suggest that numbers of inbound tourists will increase by up to three hundred percent over the course of this decade. On any assessment the Australian tourist industry will continue to play an increasing role in the future well being of the Australian economy.

        This Senate inquiry into the Australian Tourist Industry has therefore been most timely and since December 1990 it has been able to draw on 103 submissions, 1475 pages of Hansard evidence as well as other sources of information to complete its report. The economic dimension of the tourism issue has been a priority concern of the Committee throughout its inspections, hearing and deliberations. The Committee heard from peak authorities of the industry (such as the Australian Tourist Industry Association) on this matter through to individual developers of tourism enterprises and the managers of such projects. There was real enthusiasm for the industry's prospects.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Several questions were raised during the inquiry concerning obstacles to the industry's further development and ways in which those obstacles could be surmounted. The Committee heard about the need for the international marketing of Australian tourism to be better coordinated between the Commonwealth and the States, the need for environmental impact statements for tourism development applications to be assessed competently and expeditiously, and the need for tourism developments to be properly completed so that the environment is protected and any environmental damage during construction to be made good.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With regard to marketing, it was clear to the Committee that the Australian Tourist Commission has been performing a necessary function with competence and should continue. Nevertheless, there is concern about the appropriate role of the States and Territories in the international marketing of Australian tourism. That concern has resulted in coordinated efforts between some States and the recent announcement of the withdrawal of the Northern Territory Tourist Commission from its overseas offices. The Committee has taken this issue a step further with a recommendation that an investigation be carried out by the Tourist Ministers' Council to evaluate whether a rationalisation of overseas representation is required.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Similarly, the Committee was advised that tourism developments need to be assessed competently and expeditiously. It is clear that local and State governments need access to competent advice for the environmental impact assessment of proposed projects. If this is done well it will ensure that developments are both environmentally benign and economically beneficial. It is notable that the National Tourism Strategy released by the Federal Government in June confirms that, through the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, a cooperative approach will be sought to the management of environmental issues in tourism contexts. For its own part the Committee has expressed its concern that the definition of environment include people; and the Committee has recommended that social and cultural impact statements be prepared for all tourist developments. It is essential therefore that care must also be taken in major tourism developments not to disenfranchise local communities and encroach on their culture. Tourism developments must address any likely dislocation of members of the community including costs of living effects and possible adverse impact on cultural values.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The environment and tourism sectors are very much dependent on one another and they must continue to achieve `win-win' outcomes. The need for tourism developments to be properly completed was highlighted during the Committee's visit to Magnetic Island and inspection of the Magnetic Quay development. There a failed development has resulted in a devastated beach, disfigured headland and siltation on the Great Barrier Reef. These consequences can be deleterious to tourism. The situation on Magnetic Island is due, at least in part, to the fact that the developer went bankrupt. It is regrettable that there can be no guarantees about the economic soundness of developers, and insurance to make repairs to the environment in such circumstances is a difficult proposition—adequate repairs would entail the completion of the project to a certain level. Nevertheless, in this situation there are two steps that can be taken to deal with environmental degradation from tourist developments. The Committee has recommended, first, that projects likely to cause significant scarring only receive development approval conditional upon an undertaking to renovate the area. Second, the Committee recommends that before tourism developments are approved, provision be made for community consultation including with the involvement of local government where appropriate.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee addressed problems of this kind that provide difficulties for the further development of the tourist industry; those difficulties need to be overcome. In addition, the Committee's inquiry revealed three significant areas in which changes of an administrative nature will greatly benefit Australian tourism. These are the report's most important findings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, tourism worldwide depends on the availability of a sufficient range of unique sites and features as well as quality facilities including hotels and restaurants. Increasingly, it is also depending on accessible natural sites that are both beautiful and interesting. For an extended period up until late last decade, however, there was a need for the tourism industry to acknowledge the significance for it of the Australian environment and take coordinated steps towards its preservation. This situation was remedied with the publication in mid-1990 by the Australian Tourism Industry Association of its
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Code of Environmental Practice
        </emphasis>
        followed by the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Environmental Guidelines for Tourist Developments
        </emphasis>
        .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee was particularly pleased to note these initiatives on the part of the tourism industry. And close scrutiny of these documents revealed their soundness in appreciation of the environment and its protection. The Committee endorses the ATIA's documents from that perspective. The implementation of the Code and Guidelines could ensure that many of the more regrettable mistakes in tourism developments in Australia will not be repeated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The second area of change that could significantly benefit tourism concerns foreign investment. The Committee found that there is general agreement that foreign capital is welcome if not necessary for the development and support of the Australian tourist industry. This agreement extends from the Commonwealth Government and the States to the Bureau of Tourism Research and the tourism industry. One of the Committee's most important findings was that the operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board, the authority charged with advising the Treasurer on foreign investment proposals, needs to be reformed. The Committee found that the FIRB process for recommending approval of foreign investment has not been fully independent. Further, the FIRB has not comprehensively monitored projects that have been approved. And the FIRB needs to acknowledge the full scope of its responsibilities under the Impact of Proposals Act with regard to the social impact of developments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to address these problems the Committee has proposed a number of recommendation relating to the structure and method of operation of the FIRB.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The third major finding of the Committee's inquiry concerns the need for accurate and comprehensive statistics about the industry to assist development planning. The Committee's task of inquiring into the Australian tourist industry was complicated by the fact that statistics on the industry are not collected and presented uniformly and comprehensively. Since the Committee inquiry began, however, some significant steps have been taken to address the inadequate state of tourism industry statistics. In June 1991 the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Framework for the Collection and Publication of Tourism Statistics
        </emphasis>
        . It remains for the collectors of the data to provide the data in accordance with the formula.

        In concluding my remarks, I believe that the Australian Landscape is one of our greatest assets. Valued appropriately and managed properly, it can become the centrepiece of our rapidly developing Tourism Industry. Our report has endeavoured to draw together the major issues associated with the development and proper management of a long term, sustainable industry. The recommendations we have made, we believe, will go a long way to ensuring that the tourism sector continues to expand and develop into one of our key industry sectors, providing wealth and employment opportunities well into the twenty first century.

I find it passing strange that earlier today when giving notices of motion both Senators Campbell and Panizza strongly supported mining in a national park, namely, the Karijini National Park in the Pilbara in Western Australia, despite the fact that there are more than adequate supplies for hundreds of years of iron ore outside the national park and despite the fact that the pebble mouse, which is on the threatened species list, is within the national park and that the most important site for that animal lies within that national park area.

         Senator Campbell also mentioned the Magnetic Quays development and laid the failure of that development at the foot of the Federal Government in relation to its economic policies. It seems to me quite clear that what happened in that case was that inadequate attention was given to the economic viability of the proposer of that development. Inadequate conditions were written in, in that the developer was supposed to have taken out an insurance policy so that if there was an economic failure or bankruptcy of that development company provision was made for the restoration of the area. Neither was that provision insisted upon nor was the provision that was written in acted upon before the date of expiry in relation to Magnetic Quays. There was a failure of the environmental protection process in relation to the Magnetic Quays development, and that is what has led to very serious damage to the environment in that area.

         I want to pick up the point made by Senator Crowley that there are really two extremes in the tourism industry. There is the beer, brothels and casino type of tourism industry that one sees well exemplified on the Gold Coast with the glitz, glamour and the high cost type of holidays. That is one type of tourism. The other extreme is tourism which one can only associate with wilderness and which, as Senator Crowley pointed out, is necessarily associated with very low population density—in fact, very often so low that one needs to be completely alone in those locations to enjoy the wilderness experience.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The first type of tourism depends particularly on sight—going quickly to an area and having a look at something—and the other type depends very much on a full range of experiences such as sound, touch, smell and aloneness with a natural environment. That latter type of tourism is very much in danger of being lost in Australia, yet Australia is one of the last countries in the world where one can have a wilderness experience. Within the next few decades wilderness will probably disappear from the face of this planet, with the exception of a few places in Australia where it can still be experienced.

         While there is not a large immediate profit to be made from wilderness tourism—indeed, it is the most rapidly growing area of tourism—over hundreds of years the integrated economic return to be made from that type of activity, leaving aside the very important cultural and experiential aspects, is very great indeed. We need to recognise the great importance of hanging on to those wilderness areas and maintaining very low population densities so that people can continue for many future generations to experience wilderness.

         In the last week I was down in northern Tasmania in an area which has come to be known as the Tarkine, an area of temperate rainforest, where quite clearly the number of people who could go into that area and experience it at first hand would be very small at any given time. There are very few examples left in the world of temperate rainforest. In terms of the integrity of the central area, the area is still very much intact with very little human intrusion and one which really should be incorporated into the World Heritage area.

         That brings me back to what Senator Campbell was saying, that these sorts of areas do need Federal activity to ensure that they are protected. By their very nature, these areas have very low population densities and do not have people who might raise a case for or against tourism. These areas, which share characteristics right across Australia, need Federal Government intervention to ensure that they are properly protected and that there are comprehensive conditions laid down for their protection.

         That also brings in the matter of threatened species. Over many years we have been expecting Federal legislation to protect threatened species. It has been promised for at least seven years, to my knowledge. We are still to see that legislation. We understand the legislation which is in the process of being argued by several Federal Ministers is likely to be significantly watered down; yet this is an area, in contradistinction to what Senator Campbell said, which demands Federal comprehensive legislation across the whole of Australia.

         Certainly the application of that legislation needs to be administered through some local knowledge, and that needs to be fed into the system. But without that comprehensive Federal legislation it will simply fail to protect threatened species. We will fail to protect the wilderness experience, of which Australia is one of the last refuges in this world.

         —I wish to briefly finish off the remarks I started before lunch. We were discussing the motion by Senator Sowada to disallow the regulations of the Federal Airports Corporation, specifically those not requiring them to observe State environmental protection laws in relation to environmental impact studies and the third runway in Sydney.

         The point I was making was that the figures Senator Sowada had presented indicated that the risk to the people of Sydney of that third airway were way above the acceptable levels of risk in an industrial capacity. In this capacity one is dealing with a general population which in the main stands to gain nothing in particular from the expansion of that airport whereas in an industrial situation the worker at least expects to get some employment from the exposure to potentially dangerous situations.

         I also made the point that the recent crash in Amsterdam did not involve a plane immediately after take-off—the plane was in fact attempting to return to the airport when it crashed—and the claim made by Senator Cook in relation to take-offs over Botany Bay was largely irrelevant to that situation. Almost certainly, a plane losing two engines and attempting to return would be circling over either an area of population or, perhaps even more dangerously, over some of the chemical storage facilities or some of the petroleum dumps and refining facilities which surround Botany Bay. So the risks are really quite considerable and, as Senator Sowada has pointed out, some of those aspects were not taken into account in relation to the Federal environmental impact statement procedure.

         Last night, Senator Kemp, who I believe is the shadow Minister for Democrat bashing, was analysing the number of times the Democrats had voted with either the Opposition or the Government. Quite clearly, in this particular case, which we see as a very important issue, the Democrats will call a division and the Government and the Opposition will vote together. According to Senator Kemp's own figures, there were 97 occasions on which the Democrats raised amendments and very important points when the Opposition and the Government voted together. Yesterday, Senator Short put out a press release entitled `Democrats Destroy Coalition's Major Senate Initiative'—

I would ask you to draw him to attention and ask him to make his comments relevant, given that he is speaking outside the agreement.

         In response to a couple of points raised by Senator Newman, the Australian Democrats certainly do agree with her point that Sydney does need increased airport capacity. I do not think anyone with half a brain would disagree that that is necessary. We support any move to increase that capacity. However, we do not believe that the third runway is the way to go. We support the fast tracking of Badgerys Creek and one would be very hard pressed to find anyone in Sydney who opposes the Badgerys Creek airport. In fact, the western Sydney regional councils have requested of the Federal Government that the development be fast tracked and speeded up so it can come on stream much sooner than its current completion date.

         Bankstown airport is a very important existing facility for light aircraft. It has been suggested on many occasions that the smooth running of Mascot airport would be assisted by moving many of the smaller aircraft at Kingsford-Smith to Bankstown. I understand that Richmond Air Force base will slowly be changed from military use to civilian use. We could possibly see many of the cargo flights that currently go into Mascot move to Richmond. Even Williamtown airport in Newcastle has a very important role to play in developing wide ranging airport services in the Sydney region. So it is not just a matter of Kingsford-Smith. There are many options. We believe—and this has been suggested by a number of people—that even better management at Kingsford-Smith would result in a better flow of air traffic.

         Senator Newman referred to a range of issues that she believes were adequately addressed by the EIS. It may well be her opinion that those issues were addressed, but there are a lot of people who believe that those issues were not adequately addressed by the environmental impact statement. That matter is now before the courts and it should be decided there. If that environmental impact statement has adequately met all the concerns and has addressed all the issues, the FAC should have nothing to fear from the courts scrutinising that document and coming up with a judgment in its favour.

         Ours is not a delaying tactic, as has been claimed by the Opposition and, I suggest, by the Government. In fact, the Opposition should be desperately concerned about the processes at work here. One of the main reasons I have raised this issue in the Senate is that, once again, the Federal Government is using the processes of this chamber and the Parliament to ride roughshod over local communities and the States.

         A matter of great concern was raised here in relation to the ANSTO Amendment Bill. The Government was successful in respect of the issue of radioactive waste at Lucas Heights. Thanks to the actions of this Government, we now have a situation where the management of radioactive waste by ANSTO is not covered by any State planning environment law anywhere in Australia.

         What we are seeing once again is the Federal Government riding roughshod over the States, believing that it can take matters into its own hands when it does not like what is presented to it by way of State legislation. We believe it is very important that this principle be opposed. To that extent, we have pleaded with the Opposition to defend vigorously, as it has in the past, the rights of the States. It should once again recognise that this is a very arrogant move on the part of the Government. The Government has not consulted anyone. The State governments have found the Government's actions so offensive that they have joined in an action in the High Court. In fact, I am amazed at the Opposition's response in this matter. Where are the defenders of States rights? The Opposition is the group in this Parliament that will continue vigorously to defend States rights.

         —Exactly. Just five minutes ago, Senator Campbell was on his feet defending the States. I have to say that I agreed with a number of issues that Senator Campbell raised in his address; they were very valid. However, when we are presented with clear Federal Government intervention in matters pertaining to a State, we find that the Opposition just collapses in a heap. It is the first group to jump on to the bandwagon with the Government and ride roughshod over the will of the States and over those groups that it has so vigorously protected in the past.

         Once again, I suggest to the Federal Government that its actions here are extremely arrogant. This is something that has happened before. I ask the Government: how many times will we have to put up with this kind of legislating to ensure that its Federal statutory authorities can simply ignore State legislation that otherwise applies to the activities of every other commercial entity and business in every other respect? I ask the Opposition to reconsider its decision on this matter as this device is being used increasingly by this Government to ride roughshod over the States. It is not something that the Australian Democrats would support, and I hope that the Opposition would do likewise. I commend the motion to the Senate.

The reason why this somewhat personal attack was launched on me by Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats was that I had drawn to the attention of the chamber a range of statistics which show how  the Australian Democrats have danced to Labor's tune constantly during the Thirty-sixth Parliament. I will reiterate those statistics which prove my case. Up to 17 September, there were 217 divisions.

         —I rise to speak on the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992. I begin by reminding the Senate of speeches made in relation to this Bill in the House of Representatives on 19 August of this year. My shadow Ministry representative, Mr Bruce Scott, led the debate for the Federal coalition and was followed by the Liberal MP Mr Russell Broadbent, who spoke of his extensive work in the disability field. Another Liberal member of parliament, Mr John Bradford, told the House:

         Community attitudes to the disabled vary enormously. Generally I believe that most people support the principle, and so they should, that disabled people should not be discriminated against. I think many people would go further and suggest that if there is to be discrimination, it should be in favour of those who are disabled.

        The Labor member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell, took an arm's length position when he called the Bill `a heyday for the social engineers' and expressed frustration with its aims. While his views may be extreme, they do reflect widespread scepticism in the community about the so-called politics of difference and the need to legislate for social change. Mr Campbell's colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Gary Johns, tried to make up lost ground for the Government.

        The Minister then invited interested parties to comment on the legislation over the winter recess. Several months later the Minister and his Bill are now under fire from such respected groups as the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Association of Surgeons. Both associations have expressed concern about the expanded definition of the term `disability' and the rights of health professionals when dealing with HIV positive patients.

         Even groups representing people with disabilities have hit out at the Bill, labelling it as discriminatory and a mockery of the very essence of the reasons for the Bill. Letters and faxes expressing concern about this Bill have poured into my office over recent months. I have brought a number of the submissions to the attention of the Minister's office. However, the Minister remains unconcerned and unmoved. I am appalled that there is not one backbench Labor member listed to speak in the debate in this chamber today. I am surprised that Senator Zakharov and Senator West, who have normally been champions in this area for many constituencies, are not speaking and we are to hear only from the Minister in charge of the Bill, in summary—in a similar way to the way the issue was dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary, and probably with the same briefing notes that Mr Johns used in the House of Representatives in August.

         On the other hand, the Federal coalition is seeking to obtain details of all submissions made to the Government so that the concerns raised in them may be properly addressed. We have asked for a full list of people and groups who have made submissions. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was Minister Howe who publicly invited community organisations and groups to make submissions on this legislation to the Attorney-General's Department. I have been informed that the Attorney-General's Department has been precluded from making available the numbers of people who made submissions, the list of names and the comprehensive issues raised. I have been provided only with a summary of the main issues that have been addressed.

        Our amendment was rejected. Various peak bodies have made representations to me, as well as to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, and they are the tip of the iceberg in relation to concerns about the Bill. For example, the Confederation of Australian Industry strongly opposed the legislation, saying that employment decisions should be taken on the grounds of merit. The Law Institute of Victoria questioned why the burden of proof in disproving the exemption of unjustifiable hardship rested with the complainant. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Victoria highlighted the ambiguity of `unjustifiable hardship' and the lack of action plan monitoring. The Senate's own Scrutiny of Bills Committee found that the legislation failed to set out the qualities and attributes needed for a person appointed to preside over a compulsory conference.

         Reading the representations, I find a common concern relates to exemptions, particularly the proposed three-year exemption for the telecommunications industry.

         The definition of `disability' covers physical, sensory, cognitive, neurological, intellectual and psychiatric impairment, mental illness or disorder and the presence in the body of organisms causing or capable of causing disease. It is worth noting that cognitive and neurological impairment were not included in the original explanatory memorandum. The Liberal and the National Federal coalition took up the issue with the Government in the House of Representatives in August. I am pleased that it has finally agreed to it.

         Controversy continues to surround the definition of `disability' and the fact that it includes `the presence in the body of organisms capable of causing disease'. I received a barrage of criticism about this definition. The Australian Medical Association rightly pointed out that virtually all Australians carry organisms in their body capable of causing disease. The need to protect personal or private health was also raised in the AMA submission as well as the need for a special exemption to cover the health professions.

         The cost of establishing the Office of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, funding public education programs, support agencies, additional staffing and legal aid is also contentious. The explanatory memorandum provided to the House of Representatives predicted that this cost would be $5.5m in the first year. Yet the memorandum now provided to the Senate forecasts just $2.3m. The reason for this massive $3.2m discrepancy lies in the Federal Budget Papers. Far from delivering the expected $5.5m, the Federal Government came up with only $1.553m in the first year, $1.032m in 1993-94 and $0.761m recurrently. Such evidence exposes the rhetoric of this Federal Labor Government and again calls into question its much publicised bona fides.

         I now turn to the principles of this Bill. The legislation is complaints based and provides for the establishment of an office of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner who will be part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Commissioner will try to conciliate complaints but, where that process is unsuccessful, the Commission can inquire into complaints and make determinations. The determinations, which are not binding on the parties, but enforceable in the Federal Court, include remedial action and payment of compensation. The legislation specifies that damage can cover injury to a complainant's feelings or for humiliation that the person might suffer. The Federal Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, illustrates this point with the case of a Tasmanian footballer banned from playing because he was HIV positive. Speaking on ABC radio on 17 July this year, he said that the footballer could soon have recourse to new anti-discrimination law and demand compensation from the local league.

         The Bill also provides that only reasonable accommodation needs to be made for people with disabilities. Persons against whom complaints are made can argue that the accommodation necessarily involves unjustifiable hardship. Similarly, an employer can argue that a person with a disability is unable to carry out the inherent requirement of the job. The Bill provides for the introduction of disability standards should the Government and relevant parties decide that they are necessary. The standards relate to employment, education, accommodation, provision of public transport services and facilities and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. Service providers also have an opportunity to lodge action plans with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission outlining long term strategies to overcome perceived discriminatory practices.

         Originally, this Bill defined `de facto spouse' as a person living with another person `on a bona fide domestic basis, although not legally married, whether or not they are of the same sex'. The definition broke new ground because it extended the definition of `de facto spouse' to homosexual couples for the first time. Last month the House of Representatives amended the legislation by deleting the definition of `de facto spouse' and defining `associate' as a spouse, a person living with another person on a genuine domestic basis, relative, carer or a person in a business, sporting or recreational relationship.

It includes research on a class of viruses now increasingly believed to be the cause of not only AIDS, but also incurable diseases like muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and at least two of the forms—two of the strains of leukemia.

         The Disability Discrimination Bill does represent a very positive and significant step forward for Australians with disabilities. Though we do share many of the concerns that have already been expressed and we do have major reservations about this piece of legislation, the Democrats will be supporting the Bill. We congratulate the Government on finally acting to put in place at least some Federal disability discrimination legislation. I make the point here that virtually all States already have some form of disability discrimination legislation, with the exception of Tasmania. I note that the ACT has such legislation, but unfortunately the Northern Territory does not.

         This Federal legislation is putting some national uniformity, some national standards, in place right across the entire country. It is picking up a number of issues that the State Bills cannot touch, such as the Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities on which the State legislation has no bearing. This legislation is also trying to come to grips with some of the problems between the various States' legislation. For example, in some States—New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia—there is no cover for people who have a psychiatric disability.

         Unlike the Opposition, our concerns mainly relate to our belief that the Bill does not go far enough in protecting and advancing the rights of people with disabilities. We have discussed this legislation with a range of interested groups and individuals and virtually all of them in the disability area agree that this Bill is nowhere near as good as it could have been. But we understand the desire of people with disabilities, their friends, advocates, relatives and carers, to at least see the anti-discrimination mechanism established in this parliamentary session, rather than risk losing this legislation altogether. Therefore, the Democrats will be supporting the Bill.

         Despite our reservations we have continually told those who have been in touch with us that, yes, we will support the legislation. Because despite their concerns—and very genuine concerns already discussed by Senator Tambling—not one disability group has asked us to do anything other than make sure this Bill gets through as quickly as possible and not to even let it lapse through until the end of December. That was one of the reasons that we decided we would agree to a referral only to the Senate Standing Committee and not see this Bill move off to a joint committee with the possibility that it could have taken months and months to actually put the Bill back before this place.

         The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs will look at this Bill on Friday and hopefully will, in a very focused way, be able to examine some of the problems that have already been mentioned. It is certainly true that a good deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed and I stress again here that the Democrats certainly do not believe the legislation is perfect. But the general view coming through from the community is, `Despite the shortcomings of this legislation, let us see at least something passed'.

         I have no doubt there will be some problems to be ironed out in the future, but we cannot reasonably expect legislation such as this to swing into operation without any technical or practical difficulties. Similarly, it would be ridiculous to spend months and months to try to tighten legislation to the point that it is virtually set in concrete, a totally static, unbending law, never to be amended or never expecting any changes. That is simply not going to be the case.

         As the Minister has said, this legislation is to be a framework for change.

         What is crucial about this Bill is its very clear symbolic value. The mere existence of this legislation on the Federal statute books is an indication to Australians with disabilities of a national refusal to tolerate any discrimination against them. It is a signal to Australians with disabilities that, as a society, we value them and their contribution and we do not believe it is fair or just or acceptable to discriminate against them because of their disability. It is a signal I would hope Australians without disabilities would be very keen and very pleased to send. From that symbolic perspective, the Australian Democrats certainly welcome and support the Bill.

         I move on to look at some of the concerns that we do have. Some of the concerns expressed to us in letters and faxes reflect somewhat of a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge of what exactly is in the Bill and what its purpose is. Some of them, unfortunately, are fairly blatant attempts by certain groups to avoid any obligations that might fall their way under the Bill. Some are very genuine and, indeed, the vast majority are very accurate observations about shortcomings, from minor to major, in the legislation.

         A lot has been said already about some of the cost implications and I do not believe these concerns are warranted. The organisations and individuals voicing them should really be looking more closely at two things: firstly, the intent of the Bill which is to look beyond people's disabilities and focus on what individuals can do, and what is realistic assistance to help them actually do that. In other words, it is about shifting attitudes. Secondly, they should be looking more closely at the potential of the Bill to provide employers with valuable employees. In relation to employment, we are basically talking about a pool of talent that, at the moment, is largely untapped, but a pool of talent that can be tapped with very little expense.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Industry Week
         </emphasis>
         had this to say to employers who were anxious about the impact of the Act on their businesses:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . employers are missing an opportunity to tap into a group of workers previously ignored except by the most enlightened employers who . . . have already begun using common sense, inexpensive workplace changes to employ workers with disabilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The trouble is that employers think it is going to cost a fortune to employ people with disabilities. If they look to the United States—and it is much stronger legislation there—it has not had any of those experiences and it has not had those problems. Indeed, the results from what is happening in the States are very enlightening indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The results generally show that compliance with disability discrimination legislation can be inexpensive and quite easy and there can be some really great pay-offs for employers who make that change. For example, the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          US News and World Report
         </emphasis>
         of July this year talks about a small business in Carolina where one-half of the firm's 18 employees have disabilities. Since employing people with disabilities—in this particular instance, mainly people with learning disabilities—the owner of the business has discovered that absenteeism has dropped, work performance is higher, productivity is up and accidents and carelessness on the factory floor are down. The report quotes the owner as saying, `Any manager who does not look first for a disabled person is leaving gold sitting on the back porch'. The owner goes on to say, `Employers are just afraid of taking the time to be a little bit creative'.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The key to this whole piece of legislation is to promote a more creative approach to employment and to encourage greater workplace flexibility and diversity. The Bill simply says that one cannot discriminate against people with disabilities when one is hiring, firing or promoting people or providing a service to them. It contains two general exemptions: firstly, where the action one would have to take in order to accommodate the person with a disability would impose unjustifiable hardship; and secondly, where the person with a disability is not able to perform the inherent requirements of the job or the position concerned.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These are sensible exemptions which make it quite clear that the Bill is not about forcing employers to take on people with disabilities regardless of their skills or abilities. It is not about taking away the right of employers to employ people on merit. It is not about forcing employers to incur unreasonable expenses or any unnecessary hardship in taking on employees with disabilities. It is not about quotas and it is not about affirmative action law. It is primarily about changing the attitudes of employers, co-workers and service providers towards people with disabilities—and I do not believe employers have any great cause to be anxious about the cost implications. Indeed, they need to be aware that from the opposite perspective many organisations representing people with disabilities are concerned that the notion of `unjustifiable hardship' is too vague and could be used by some as an easy way out where employers or business organisations are not interested in providing equal opportunities for disabled people.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another side of the cost argument is the potentially significant community savings to be made by improving the rate of participation in employment among people with disabilities. When earlier this year I was looking at some of the data in this area I came across a speech to the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures by IBM Australia executive, Mark Bagshaw. Mr Bagshaw has quadriplegia, has been with IBM for 13 years, and is the company's international marketing manager. About the costs of the argument, he said:

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But rather than look at the problem from just a cost point of view, I prefer to look at the numbers from a cost/benefit point of view. In other words, I believe we should also take into consideration the potential benefits to the community if these people were taxpayers making a valuable contribution to the country's gross national product, rather than recipients of government benefits. If this were done, the total benefit to the community of providing appropriate job opportunities for people with disabilities would, I suggest, go a long way towards addressing the expected balance of payments deficit.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        As I think he is giving the right message to Australian employers, I will just quote him again at length. Later in this article he goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I believe that employers have a responsibility to understand what disability is all about; to listen to people with disabilities to hear what they can and cannot do.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think employers also have a responsibility to match a job to a person's ability rather than their disability. For example, I've been successful in my chosen career partly because the job is well matched to my physical ability. I could say that in a marketing management role I don't do anything; that's not quite true, but I certainly don't do much which requires physical dexterity. I'm therefore 100 per cent productive in the job.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

         I believe employers have a responsibility to formulate a corporate policy on the employment of people with disabilities, and most importantly to put a plan in place to identify suitable positions and make them known to the disabled community.

         Many employers adopt what I call a "passive acceptance" view of employing people with disabilities. If approached, they are likely to be reasonably open-minded about employing people with disabilities, but they mostly do little or nothing to communicate their willingness to listen.

         In return, employers have a right to expect that people with disabilities will put the effort in: to contribute to your business, to make the most of their skills and abilities—in other words, to provide you with the same return on investment as all your other employees.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Basically, Mr Bagshaw is saying to employers not to be afraid and that Australian businesses really need to do four things: firstly, employers should investigate their company's policy on employing people with disabilities and, if there is no policy, should set one up; secondly, employers should identify positions which would suit people with disabilities and, if necessary, seek help from disability organisations; thirdly, employers should understand what government assistance is available for employing people with disabilities; and, fourthly, employers should make their positions and policies known by writing to disability groups, by advertising and, when the job ads are actually placed, by making it very clear that they are an equal opportunity employer, and also by advising government departments. The result of all this, Mark Bagshaw says, is a clear classic win-win situation where everybody benefits—people with disabilities, the community and employers. This is the attitude that Australian business should be bringing to this Bill.

         Another of the specific exemptions which has already been mentioned relates to Telecom, and this is of great concern to people with hearing disabilities. In a letter to the Attorney-General's Department, the Chief Executive of the South Australia Deaf Society, Damian Lacey, put the case against this exemption. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Deaf people and people with disabilities generally have received a most unsatisfactory level of provision in the past in this arena. Access to telecommunications is a major quality of life issue for people with disabilities in our technological society. We cannot accept that it is unreasonable for telecommunications to be required to meet the provisions of the Bill when other major service industries will be required to meet them.
       </para>
       <para>
        He goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . telecommunications access for deaf people and people with disabilities (is) critically important in our information age. Not only must we attempt to adjust the current inequities, but we must work to ensure that the potential of technological development does, in fact, improve the fit between the individual person with a disability and society.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Consumers Telecommunications Network, representatives of which will appear before the Committee on Friday—it is a national coalition of organisations concerned with telecommunications issues—has been very outspoken on this issue as well, stating that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        —the exemption contradicts the objects of this particular Bill;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        —throws into question the Government's commitment to reducing the barriers for people with disabilities to ensure they are able to fully contribute to and participate in community life; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        —threatens one of the main objects of the Telecommunications Act which is to ensure the standard telephone service is "reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business".
       </para>
       <para>
        In its excellent submission on this Bill to the Committee, CTN made the critical point that telecommunications is now an essential service providing consumers not only with a cheap and effective means of transacting business and making appointments but also with a vital social network enabling individuals to create communities, maintain contact with family and friends, albeit across potentially vast geographic distances. For people with disabilities the value of a telephone is greatly magnified, and it becomes even more important if it is simply to contact friends and relatives, make doctors appointments or perhaps even in an emergency to ring an ambulance or the police.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If the telecommunications providers really felt that they could not provide a particular service without incurring unreasonable costs, if they really felt that there was a major problem, they could rely on the unjustifiable hardship clause in the Bill. It is already there in the legislation, available to be used by any service provider. As several organisations and individuals have asked: if the framework is good enough for everyone to use, why has the telecommunications industry been singled out? Why is it more special than anybody else? Why is it different from, say, aviation, broadcasting, tourism or, indeed, the banking industry?

         It is interesting to note that the Americans With Disabilities Act recognises not only the social desirability of ensuring disabled people have access to telecommunications services but also the market potential of providing such services. The American Act contains a separate section specifically covering telecommunications which requires carriers to provide 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year TTY facilities. So why has it proved impossible for the Australian Government to do something different here? Why is it impossible for it to do what the Americans have managed to do? We have asked questions of the Government and, as yet, really have not received a satisfactory response. I look forward to the Committee hearings on Friday when we will be asking a lot more questions on this specific issue.

         There are a number of other concerns we have about this legislation which I will quickly list. They relate to areas such as the operations of the Migration Act, the Australian Defence Force in relation to combat duties, peacekeeping services provided by the Australian Federal Police, and employment and accommodation in private households where the employer or provider of that accommodation actually lives. The view has been expressed to me that none of these areas is any different from the general situation of employers or other providers of goods and services and, as such, they should have no blanket exemption at all. I believe this view is correct, I support what these groups are saying, and I think that these exemptions certainly weaken the Bill itself.

         We will not make any progress by keeping disabled people on one side of the river and non-disabled people on the other, with each side creating barriers. What we need is to build up the banks so that the river does not flood and to build bridges across the river so that we can meet, exchange experiences and create an environment where we can celebrate human differences.

        Yes, this is a rather idealistic vision but it is the spirit with which we should be looking at this Bill. We should not be looking at it with suspicion, fear or with exaggerated claims about its consequences, but with optimism. We should take advantage of this opportunity to end discrimination against people with disabilities to the ultimate benefit of all of us.

         —The Disability Discrimination Bill which we are discussing this evening is outlined in the explanatory memorandum as providing for `national, uniform legislation to make unlawful discrimination against people with certain disabilities in certain circumstances'. If Senator Lees was talking just then about being idealistic, I suppose that in beginning my speech I could be accused of being idealistic because I have some regrets in rising to speak on this legislation. And my first regret is that we need this legislation at all.

         It says something about our society that we have to in fact build the bridges that Senator Lees was talking about through legislation. In some ways it represents our failure, and I mean failure on all of our parts, failure of our institutions which are the agents for passing on our culture, our educational institutions, our schools and our families. It represents a failure on the part of community organisations, many of whom are doing a great deal to overcome the sorts of prejudices that have been shown towards people with disabilities. It represents a failure on the part of employers, the Government and the Public Service. I instance the very poor record that Public Service departments have in employing people with disabilities, and they of all ought to be leading by example. Legislation will not necessarily mean that they will do any better than they are doing now. What internally motivates people is the important thing rather than the external motivation of legislation.

         As I said, we ought to look at all the institutions, including the media. We ought also to examine ourselves, our organisations, educational institutions, families, employers, companies and government departments, and ask ourselves: what are we doing to break down those barriers that have been built up towards people with disabilities? Given that and given that the Government has put this legislation before us, and given that there is a sense that we may achieve something through legislation, then it ought to be that that legislation is approached in the most bipartisan or non-partisan way.

         My first regret is that we need this legislation at all. My second regret is the way in which this legislation has been handled. I thought that this would be one area in which we could take the politics out and have a non-partisan approach. When I first saw the legislation and read through it, I listed a large number of concerns. Without having looked at any of the submissions, I drew up a list of the concerns which I had, which I discussed with my staff member who was particularly looking at this.

         I do not claim to have a legal training. I do not claim to have the sort of experience that the organisations that have made submissions have, but with my untrained eye, my eye with an interest in people with disabilities, I saw a number of problems. It seemed that this legislation had been presented to the House of Representatives in a very ill-prepared form. The number of submissions that we have received and the number of submissions that the committee received illustrates just that point.

         The first reading of the Bill raised those problems and it also obviously raised many problems in the minds of others. The burden of my regret lies in the behaviour of Minister Howe and his handling of this legislation. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) said that it was the introduction of:

        His very opening paragraph outlines the importance that he appeared to be placing on this Bill. He described it as a piece of legislation that `deeply affects the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities'. Given that, I should have thought that it would have been more carefully thought through and also, again, that there would have been much more cooperation. But that is what the Minister said, and obviously from his behaviour it seems like it was rhetoric.

         The Minister said, again in his speech, that he was letting the Bill lie in the House over the winter recess so that `interested parties can make any further comments'. That is what he said in his second reading speech, and I think that is proper. I thought it might have been better when it was first tabled in the House of Representatives but, given that it was not all that good—and maybe that was some admission of that—the Minister was now saying that he would leave time for those submissions.

        That is fine. But it would have been better if his rhetoric had matched his practice because if we were to believe the rhetoric then we should have seen that reflected in his behaviour.

         Senator Tambling appropriately and reasonably asked for copies of the submissions made to the Government. Senator Tambling indicated there might have been some privacy issues, but, surely, the Minister could have asked the people who made the submissions, `Do you mind if we give them to the Opposition so it can examine them and we can work together to make this legislation the best it can be and also to ensure that it doesn't have any unintended consequences built into it that we regret later on?'.

         Senator Tambling asked and the answer was no. The Minister tells us that he has put it on the table so that it can be looked at over the winter recess. We asked for submissions and they are not available to us. It just makes the Minister's statement sound very hollow. I am not asking Senator Zakharov to agree, but it does make the Minister's statement sound very hollow when, on the one hand, he says, `We want as much consultation as we can get' then, on the other, he precludes this half of the Parliament and, I presume, the Democrats. I do not know whether Senator Lees asked for the submissions, but I would have thought that it might have been appropriate for the submissions to be forthcoming after consultation with those who made them.

         Senator Tambling finally resorted to putting on notice a question to the Minister asking from whom he had asked comments. We got a summary of those comments. Senator Tambling approached a large number of organisations and I thank those people—and I am sure Senator Tambling has thanked them, too—for those very extensive and thoughtful submissions which have enabled us to examine this legislation more carefully. It would have been easier for them had the Minister given them to us so they did not have to do it all over again. They might question why their limited resources had to be used in that way.

         We suggested that this Bill go to a joint committee and be examined in detail because we had so many concerns, but that was not to be, and it will go to a Senate committee. Let me say, for the information of people who happen to be listening to the broadcast or who may read about it, that this is a case which reflects very well on the new procedure that the Senate has adopted. After the last election, the Senate adopted a procedure of referring Bills where there was some concern to the appropriate Senate standing committee. Previously, when we had concerns like this, we would make a speech during the second reading debate, then we would go to the committee stage and sometimes that committee stage, as in the case of the Family Law Bill, would go on for four days in this chamber, on a Bill on which we all agreed. We went through four days of debate backwards and forwards across the chamber. To facilitate and to speed up that process, it was decided that Bills could be referred to a committee and that that sort of level of debate could go on in the committee.

         One of the other benefits, of course, of the new procedure is that groups can put their case on the public record. Prior to that, it was the Government's interpretation of the groups' submissions and it was the Opposition's, the Democrats' and the Independents' interpretations of the submissions that were made to them, and it was often difficult for us to have evidence which was on the public record. On Friday, we will be seeing groups who have expressed their concerns about this Bill.

In some ways, I do not believe that that Senate Committee has the time to go through them all which a committee would have had if it had been a full reference. I believe that this Bill is so important that it should have been a full reference to make sure that we do not have any other unintended consequences. That is especially so when a number of organisations which are specifically for people with disabilities have said that the Bill discriminates against people with disabilities. That is of great concern. Hopefully, we will be able to tease that out on Friday, but if we start at 9 o'clock and finish at 5 o'clock, it does not leave a great deal of time to consider a Bill which I think has a number of flaws and a number of problems. We will do our best, and I hope that it does not mean that we will have a Bill which we regret later on.

        While I agree with Senator Patterson that internal motivation is far better than external motivation driven by legislation, and I commend her comments in this regard, nevertheless, in every case, legislation can be seen as an indication of a society's values or standards. On that basis, it would actually be a very strange omission and it would be very remiss of us, when we have set up a Human Rights Commission that has looked to the rights of many different groups within our community—it has tackled sexual discrimination, racial discrimination, and use of privacy in damaging ways—not actually to put in place disability discrimination legislation. So we can say that, while we would want to be far in advance of the legislation in our community action, nevertheless, we have a standard which shows our society's values.

         However, this legislation is not perfect and some of the inadequacies have been pointed out by others. There are several areas in which improvement can be made. Hopefully, the committee process will be useful in this regard. I seek to point out four problem areas that can be noted with suggestions for improvement. Firstly, a link could be made between this Bill and the Disability Services Act 1986 so that both pieces of legislation can be seen as complementary in their wording. I would like to ask the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to respond to my suggestion that paragraph (iii) of the clause of the Bill headed `Objects', which refers to existing laws, could actually include reference to the specific legislation regarding disability services.

         Secondly, I suggest that a lead-in time and an action plan could be tabled with the Human Rights Commission not only by service providers in a voluntary capacity, but also as part of the special and temporary exemptions or exceptions from this legislation that various groups may be seeking. I am thinking particularly of the three-year exemption for Telecom. An action plan within those three years I think would receive quite a degree of approval from people with disabilities who could benefit.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Thirdly, consultation with the public should be incorporated into the exemption procedure. When people are seeking either special and temporary exemptions, or even in relation to the general exemptions which are related here, the public are consulted. Fourthly, the legislation could have gone further and specifically required that all material relating to the regulation, promotion and implementation of the Act, and all proceedings under the Act, be freely available in formats which meet the needs of people with disabilities to assist the process of consultation. I note that for the first time a Bill has been translated into the alternative formats of brail and audio tape to allow for maximum consultation and input. I commend this action heartily.

         As I said, this legislation is not perfect. Nevertheless, it would be extremely damaging and counterproductive if the Committee process delayed or postponed the passage of this Bill. I would be more than happy to support the Bill now prior to its referral to the Committee process. I express concern on behalf of many people who value this legislation that it not get bogged down either now or in the committee stage. It is a start, a good start, and much better than the vacuum present up to now in terms of disability legislation. I think it would be very irresponsible to ignore this area and let it slip away. I am sure Opposition members feel they could improve on it and may be if they get their way in another election, they will be able to improve on it. However, I would like to support it now.

         —Last week a young man from the Beni Abbes Community in Hobart died. He was a person with disability. He was respected by those who loved him, lived with him and cared for him. He was loved because of his uniqueness and because he had an intrinsic value, as each individual person has. He was respected and cared for because of that fact, but he had a lot to give. Those who had the eyes to see the gifts he had were the ones who benefited from his living in that community. His passing was a matter of deep grief for those with whom he lived and for those outside of that community who supported that community. Such people abound in this community. Yet, sadly enough, their talents and gifts are very much overlooked.

         It all comes back to the questions that we mortals ask about why there is suffering and disability. Before we had to live for many years with the suffering, and in some cases death, of the one closest to us, we generally have the reasons for suffering all neatly worked out. It is all to do with free will. We are created with the gift of free will, otherwise we would be slaves. People make wrong choices and those wrong choices have consequences. Rulers decide to go to war and there are horrific consequences as a result. Aeroplane manufacturers make mistakes and do not fully understand metal fatigue, and there are terrible consequences.

         There is famine, starvation and injustice in the world and almost always that comes down to man's inhumanity to man. There is a very sound argument to suggest that something did go awfully wrong at the beginning and we are suffering the consequences of that. I come back to the point that, before we ourselves face pain and the loss of one who is closest to us, the answer seemed simple. However, when faced with that pain, faced with that disability and faced with the daily effort of coping—and after we have gone through the cries of `why?'—then we begin to focus on the meaning of suffering and begin to seek what good can come out of it.

         What I am saying is nothing new. It has all been said before. For example, Job said it in the Bible. It is a most interesting and illuminating piece. After having survived all the dreadful things that befell him, Job was able to say that he had been holding forth on questions that he neither recognised nor understood and that before he knew God by hearsay and now, since God had journeyed with him through the loss and pain, he saw Him face to face. Indeed, from the Christian perspective it was Jesus himself who, by word and example, corrected the view that those with disabilities should be blamed for them, or their parents should be blamed for them.

         Unfortunately, now we have come to the stage where we have to debate a Bill which in a way will require people to give acknowledgment to that very fact. If we were perfect there would be no need for this Bill, no need at all. Obviously, we have not been able to recognise the inherent value of persons with disabilities, their enormous talent and what they have to give. Better off dead, or least never been born, is the attitude to some persons with disabilities, particularly those with inherited disorders. It would be ironic indeed if we carried this legislation, and then in a subsequent piece of legislation—which the Minister presented in his second reading speech the other day—we entrench a system which will inevitably take the view that it is better if persons with inherited disabilities were not born. That is precisely what the outcome will be of the National Health and Medical Research Council Bill.

I know that when I had a person with a very severe disability on my staff it took time for the office to adjust. It took time for me to adjust but, looking back on it, the adjustments ultimately really were minor. The gifts, the expertise and the deep understanding of problems that person brought to the office were something that will be appreciated not only by me, but also others in my office for a considerable time to come.

         I would like to commend to the Senate the matter that was mentioned by Senator Tambling. I think he was quite justified in seeking from the Government a list and details of the range of issues which were raised by community groups and by individuals in relation to this particular Bill—at the request of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). It is most unusual, I believe, for the Minister to publicly ask for submissions on a draft Bill and then, when all of those submissions are in, not provide on request to other members of the Parliament the details of the issues raised. I would have thought it would have been better for the Minister to have supplied full detail. I am not necessarily talking about names if there is some concern of privacy; I am talking about the issues. What are the issues and what are the details of those issues which were raised in those submissions?

         There is the question of exemptions. I am not too sure whether the reason that the telecommunications exemption was so generous was Optus coming into the field. It would be interesting for the Committee to follow that through, and no doubt it will. The ability to communicate is an area of great importance to people with disabilities.

         I agree that there should be provisions in the Bill for a wider range of consultations. I have another problem—I am not sure whether this has been raised in the debate thus far—and that is the problem of another big bureaucracy and the money going into that rather than into cutting through red tape, getting things done for persons with disabilities and bringing down the handicaps that they face in our society. Some very good ideas are often floated, but very often as well the bureaucracies that are established, with considerable expenditure on them, are too top-heavy.

Then the people to lose their jobs when the cuts come are those down at the other end.

         The Disability Services Act 1986 is a landmark piece of legislation for disabled people. It was one of the first pieces of legislation that I dealt with when I came into the Senate in 1986. As with this legislation, that legislation was not perfect either but it did move disabled people forward. As I have said, when that happens the whole community moves forward. The legislation now before us does that as well. I think it is appropriate—it is indeed essential, as Senator Chamarette has said—that the human rights and equal opportunity standards that we apply in other areas of our community should also apply with regard to disabled people, and this legislation satisfies that requirement.

The discussion on the principle of the Bill has been generally supportive.

         Some general comments have been made about the nature of disability. As Senator Harradine said, it is very difficult for those of us who are relatively physically and mentally able and well to appreciate the intense suffering—it might be physical; it might be real mental anguish; or it might be simply a sense of isolation—that is a consequence of discriminatory practices that might be visited on a person simply because of his or her disability. Not many of us in this chamber can really speak of that from the point of view of a disabled person, even though many of us would have personal experiences with close relations and even spouses who have been in that situation.

To some extent, this bears on the point I was making in the Senate during Question Time today in so far as the common law has not really protected or sustained particularly minority groups in our sort of society in their attempt to exercise and enjoy rights which are taken for granted by others.

         The question of definition has been raised. This will be more particularly the subject of a more considered detailed examination in the committee process next Friday. Quite clearly, the definition of `disability' itself is of absolutely key importance. Once again, State legislation and experience in Commonwealth legislation has been drawn upon to include the concepts of physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric, cognitive and neurological impairment. Without going into the definition of `disability' in toto, I believe that it is sufficiently comprehensive to enable this legislation to benefit from well-tried definitions existing in other legislation not only in Australia but in the world where we can see how other like societies deal with this matter.

         It is not true to say that the mere existence of a disability, which will enable this legislation to be invoked, nor discrimination based on that disability in the sense that there can be exceptions and exemptions, is enough if to acknowledge and deal with the disability would create undue hardship for the person who would have to change, for example, the physical conditions of premises. If the inherent requirements of a job militate against accepting that a person with a disability can adequately discharge a particular function, these exemptions will allow the service provider, the business or the employer concerned to discriminate, but not in an unlawful way.

For that reason, I believe that the task of the human rights and equal opportunity Commissioner will be the subject of scrutiny by those in this Parliament and throughout the community who are concerned with such matters.

         Although these Bills sound fairly mundane, they are unprecedented, at least in recent decades, in the sense that they were introduced into the Parliament at the same time as the Government's Appropriation Bills were introduced on Budget night, 18 August. The research I have been able to carry out indicates that that situation where additional Supply Bills have been introduced on the same day as the Budget has not occurred in the last 40 years. It appears that in 1950 additional Supply Bills were introduced on Budget night and again in 1951, but times have changed a great deal in terms of the whole of the parliamentary and budgetary procedures since that time. I am not aware of any subsequent occasion on which this situation has arisen. In modern times and under the present system of consideration of the Appropriation Bills and other matters pertaining to the funding of government, it is an unprecedented action on the part of the Government.

         —As my friend and colleague Senator O'Chee says, it is inept. I will be coming back to that later. Essentially, the Government has taken this action because it has embarked on a rapid and very large increase in spending, totally unfunded, in many areas that were not anticipated when Supply Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2) were introduced and passed in the normal manner late in the Autumn session. These unprecedented Bills are a clear indication of the determination by the Government to spend up big in the early months of 1992-93 in advance of a possible early election. In other words, the Government is circumventing the normal budgetary procedures to give itself another option by putting another $170m in its coffers in the event that it might need it to buy and bribe its way to additional votes in an early election.

         The Bills also reinforce a growing impression and an actuality, as Senator O'Chee has pointed out, that the Government has lost control of its fiscal management. This is the second time in recent months that the Government has introduced extraordinary fiscal legislation. The Senate may recall that earlier this year the Government introduced not only the customary additional Appropriation Bills but also a totally unscheduled additional Appropriation Bill while those two normal additional Appropriation Bills were still before the Parliament. The reason for that was gross financial incompetence on the part of the Government and an essential reason for the two Bills that we are debating now being before us. It is a continuation of that gross fiscal mismanagement.

         There is the hidden agenda of giving the Government more money to finance its vote buying bribes in the event of an early election. The normal way of financing the expenditures that the Government says are required to be met in the Supply Bills is to handle it through the Advance to the Minister for Finance. In his second reading speech on these Bills the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) discounted that option because he said:

       <para>
        That is absolute nonsense. The amount sought in these Supply Bills is relatively small, although in total it adds up to $170m. In the total scheme of things, with a Budget of $100 billion, it is small. But the Government has seen a way in which it may be able to winkle out an additional $170m at an earlier stage than would otherwise be available for it. It is sheer nonsense for the Government to claim that it has to use this process in order to meet the expenditures that it claims it has to meet.

It transpired that there was no real urgency, at least in the sense of any contractual commitments by the Government. It is simply another ploy to try to buy votes for the next election.

         The Loan Bill 1992 is a standard mechanical Bill to enable the Government to finance that fiscal irresponsibility. The Loan Bill gives the Government the authority to borrow funds for the 1992-93 fiscal year. It is necessary to meet any shortfalls that occur between the moneys appropriated by Parliament in the Budget and the funds available through the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

         Certainly, there will be a requirement this year for such borrowing. Indeed, the Government's financial strategy this year and its incompetence have collectively combined to mean that the Government will have, on its own figures, a financing requirement of no less than $18.5 billion. There is every indication that that figure is highly conservative. We have learnt, through Estimates committee questioning, for example, that there is a real possibility, if not probability, that $1.5 billion, or thereabouts, that is factored into the Budget by way of assets sales—that means the sale of Qantas—will not be achieved this year. If that occurs, the Government's own financing requirement on its own figures will blow out to in excess of $20 billion. That is a figure in the order of 5 per cent plus—it is closer to 5.2 per cent—of GDP. That figure exceeds even the worst excesses of the Whitlam years—years of fiscal vandalism—which led to many of the problems with which we are still living in Australia today. That proportion of GDP that the financing requirement will need this year—that excess of 5.2 per cent—is twice the deficit and borrowing requirement in the last year of the Fraser Government in 1982-83, a year that the present Government has on many occasions sought to make capital out of in terms of the fiscal incompetence of that previous Government.

         Let me put on the record again, because it is not generally known or appreciated in the community, that the deficit we face this year as a proportion of our total national income is greater than the worst excesses of the Whitlam years and is twice the figure of the last year of the Fraser Government. That situation represents the greatest unravelling of and deterioration in the Commonwealth's fiscal position that we have had in the history of this nation. Only two years ago the Government ran a freakish surplus of $8 billion. In the two short years to the end of 1991-92, that $8 billion surplus—a very welcome surplus—turned into a deficit of $9.4 billion. So in two years alone there was a deterioration in the Commonwealth's fiscal position—and therefore the fiscal position of every Australian, every Australian taxpayer and every future Australian taxpayer—of $17.4 billion.

         In this financial year, this Budget year, the Government, on its own conservative estimates, is running up another deficit of $13.4 billion. If we remove the one-offs, if we exclude, for example, the proceeds of assets sales, the extraordinary Reserve Bank profits and a couple of other pieces of creative accounting, the real underlying deficit this year is $20.5 billion, and almost certainly that will be exceeded.

         On the Government's own forecasts out to 1995-96, the Government will chalk up another cumulative deficit of the order of $50 billion. Only six months ago, the Government, in its One Nation statement, said that it was going to move the Budget back into surplus by 1995-96. Within six months that statement had been blown out of the water by the Government itself. It was forced in the Budget to recant on that, to retract that figure and to say that by 1995-96 it would have a deficit of approximately 1.25 per cent of GDP—and that is on the basis of a very optimistic growth forecast. The figure of 1.25 per cent of GDP equals $6 billion or thereabouts.

         The Government alluded to having to put up a few taxes down the road, but it was not going to say in the Budget or at any subsequent time what those tax increases would be. It was only due to intense pressure from the coalition that the Government was forced two or three weeks ago to produce its proposals for this increased tax revenue, and we know what it came up with. It came up with additional tax revenue proposals starting in about 1994 of $2.5 billion, or thereabouts, a year. In other words, even on the Government's own figures, it is still going to have a gigantic hole in its fiscal position of a minimum of $4 billion to $5 billion and almost certainly less in 1995-96, even with the tax increases that it has foreshadowed. The only conclusion one can draw from that is that the tax increases that were announced two to three weeks ago are the first instalment. There has to be a major further increase in taxes for the Government to meet its now stated intention of balancing the books by the middle of the 1990s.

I wonder whether he has mentioned it to some of the major companies in Australia which, as we pointed out in the Senate today on several occasions, have said quite categorically that economic recovery in Australia will not be under way at least for the next two, three or four years.

         What the Government has done with this year's Budget, and what it is using the Loan Bill as a mechanical device to fund, is to provide Australia with one of the most spendthrift Budgets relative to the needs of our circumstances that we have ever had in our history. There has been an enormous increase in government spending this year, a 9 per cent increase—$9 billion, or 6 per cent in real terms. It has put enormous pressure on financial markets. The inevitable result of that will be to push up interest rates. Senator Collins, who is present in the chamber, might care to confirm this a bit later, but the Caucus economic committee yesterday received a report from the ANZ Bank which said that interest rates would go higher under the policies of this Government. We have all the seeds of a further major blow-out in the balance of payments, which continues to be in huge deficit. We are now in hock to the rest of the world by $150,000 million, that is, more than $8500 for every man, woman and child in this nation.

         If we look at precedent, we have previously seen the Government in need of appropriating additional funds. When the Iraq-Kuwait war was declared and prosecuted, we found ourselves with a shortfall on payment for wheat, the `insurance' for which is organised by EFIC but which in fact is paid out of Consolidated Revenue. In order for additional money to be made available, there was an additional appropriation Bill introduced, thereby allowing the money to be properly appropriated and spent.

         In this case, we have, if you like, a similar circumstance. We have not had war declared but we have had a recession declared. There are additional expenditures, as Senator Short pointed out. Part of the additional expenditure is $170m for programs for which there is no appropriation. The Government might argue that it had not decided it was going to spend that additional money at the time of the preparation of the Budget or the Appropriation Bills themselves so it needed another mechanism. Surely, precedent could have been followed and there could have been an additional No. 3 appropriation Bill which very simply would have appropriated that money in the proper and orderly way.

         The questioning that went on in the Estimates Committee will show why the Government was not interested in following proper procedure. Senator Short said during the hearing that the overwhelming impression he got was that the Government had taken this course of action to enable it to spend very heavily in the first few months of this financial year to give itself an additional option in terms of an early election and, in doing so, had adopted procedures in terms of budgetary processes that were unprecedented.

        That question, of course, was unable to be answered by anyone; and I am still waiting for the answer. Of course, a mechanism that could have been used by the Government—if it wished, if it had gone the appropriation Bill route—was to have sought an Advance from the Minister for Finance and spent the money on the basis that it would be reimbursed once the Appropriation Bills were passed. The problem with that is that there is not enough money left in the Advance to the Minister for Finance to allow that money to be withdrawn and meet the other demands that would be placed upon it before the Appropriation Bills are passed. When I asked Senator McMullan when he expected to get the Appropriation Bills, he replied, `The end of November'.

         So we have seen that the real reason for the use and the creation of these two Supply Bills very simply is to allow the Government to have instant cash to spend in case it wants to have an early election. All along, this early election option has been maintained by the Government, looking for a window of opportunity. The Victorian election last week has probably shut that window, but at the time of the drafting of these Supply Bills and the working out of this strategy the Government needed to keep that window open, to keep the opportunity of an early election in December or at the end of November available to it.

Ask the million people who are unemployed if the recession ended long ago; ask the 300,000 Australians who are now long term unemployed if it ended long ago; and ask the school leavers who are facing the prospect of attempting to get into the work force next year if the recession ended long ago.

         —This Budget has fallen apart already and Supply Bill (No. 3) 1992-93 and cognate Bills are simply the latest manifestation of it. Enormous changes have taken place since the Budget was brought down only two months ago. At that time the Budget looked pretty phoney anyway. Now it is looking even worse—and that is against the background of two consecutive years of hopeless Budget forecasting where the Government made the record level of mistakes that have ever been known in Budget forecasting. In the last two years the Government has been a total of $10 1/2 billion wrong in its estimates of its Budget or deficit—and, of course, in this case deficit.

         Since the handing down of the Budget, events unfolding around the world have brought a dramatic change in the situation in which this Government is now budgeting and, of course, in the situation in which it is introducing these particular Bills to cope with some additional pump priming expenditure. I will go into the merit of that in a minute.

         Let us consider the factors that are helping to destroy an already wobbly Budget. There has been a collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism and significant downgrading of European economic growth forecasts, which will clearly affect Australia's trading opportunities in the world; a further substantial reduction in Japanese economic growth forecasts for the forthcoming year, which clearly will have a direct impact on Australia; and signs that the United States economy has virtually stopped its already weak growth altogether and may yet again slip into recession. Obviously this worldwide unravelling of economic prospects will have implications on the Australian economy and, of course, this already demonstrated-to-be incompetent Budget.

         One wonders what the Government is actually doing to shore up its budgetary position and the Australian economic position.

We have a situation where the scribes report that the UK economy is in a financial and political crisis, yet here in Australia the foreign exchange, equity and bond markets are all performing decidedly worse than in the United Kingdom and nobody seems to be mentioning the word `crisis'. In fact, Mr Keating says, `The recession is over, everything is wonderful'. As someone pointed out in Question Time today, maybe for him it is, because he has managed to turn his $430,000 investment in a piggery into an investment worth $4.3m within only six months.

         Recent instability in global exchange markets and the failure of the US economy to recover as expected and the implications of this for commodity prices have no doubt brought an element of additional caution into global capital markets.

         That is what is happening to the Australian economy now. Certainly, he has been prepared to say anything. We all remember the expression which has every day usage, `This is the recession we had to have', but a lot of people have forgotten some of his other more appealing remarks. On 4 December 1990, he said:

I think one could say that if it walks like a pig, smells like a pig and oinks like a pig, presumably it is a pig. Mr Keating certainly has intimate financial relationships, at least, with pigs. Here is the recession that Mr Keating has engineered. Yet he is now apparently engineering a phoney recovery which will damage Australia's long term prospects.

          Let us look at this question of why we had this recession, anyway—the recession that Mr Keating happily says he engineered. Some people are saying, `It came from foreign parts'. Let us look at that because Dr David Morgan was one of the top people in the Australian Treasury until he moved across to Westpac. In an article in Westpac's
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Issues
          </emphasis>
          magazine—and I take the point that maybe Westpac is an appropriate place for someone from the Australian Treasury to go, in view of the size of the deficits and the miscalculations in both cases—Dr Morgan compares the 1982-83 Fraser recession with the 1990-91-92 Keating recession which, of course, is the worst since the Depression. Dr Morgan, who, by the way, is the husband of Mrs Kelly, the `Minister for having a good time', said:

         The 1982-83 recession was caused by a combination of external and domestic factors, the 1990-91 recession by purely domestic factors.

       <para>
        That is a former top Government adviser in the Treasury, saying that this recession is due to purely domestic factors. He puts the blame for the old Fraser recession, the 1982-83 one which we are still hearing about in this chamber, on oil price rises that hit the world's major economies, coinciding with a severe Australian drought which halved the value of rural production while a wages explosion squeezed profits and caused job losses. However, this is what he says about the 1990-91 recession, the present recession:

        But the seeds had been sown, he says, by the Hawke Government's mishandling of the recovery from the 1982-83 recession. Remember, of course, who the Treasurer was—it was the world's greatest Treasurer, Mr Keating. The seeds had been sown by the Hawke Government's mishandling of the recovery from the 1982-83 recession as—and I quote:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . most of the gains in reducing inflation during the recession were lost in an over-rapid recovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        By the way, the Reserve Bank's annual report for 1990-91 takes the same view. This incompetence, this mishandling by Mr Keating as Treasurer, laid the groundwork for the spending boom, high inflation and large balance of payments problem of the late 1980s so that—and I quote Dr Morgan again:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . another recession, this time due only to national problems, became inevitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly the sort of situation that Mr Keating is repeating right now and that this legislation is part of. It is part of an inevitable economic disaster as Mr Keating tries to buy his way back into power, just as in the past he has misled the Australian people with absolute nonsense to try to win, and succeed in winning, elections in the past.

         Mr Argus, the Chief Executive of the National Australia Bank, said yesterday that Australia could not afford the Government's unfunded tax cuts because they would over-stimulate the economy leading to a blow-out in Australia's foreign debt—a debt, by the way, which now stands at $150 billion or almost $9,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.

Here we have these warnings against what this Government is doing now. Already in the Budget it was government spending that was pushing the economy along. As the Budget Papers say:

Because of this spending, imports in the Budget are projected to rise more quickly than demand as domestic expenditure recovers. Of course, that is mainly government spending. Even at that point, the Budget was recognising—and I quote:

         What this Government has been doing in this Budget and these Bills is throwing money at a problem without solving it. In fact, it is making it worse in the long run by trying to get some temporary help or doing some temporary papering over of the cracks in the run-up to the next election. It is being helped, I might say, by some extraordinary statements from the Governor of Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, who, as the Senate remembers, has been the subject of considerable criticism in the past by the coalition.

         I will quote Max Walsh again, this time from Tuesday's paper where he totally rejects Mr Fraser's claim that Australia does not have a long term employment problem but only a short term one. It is incredible the way the Governor of the Reserve Bank always seems to be able to put a gloss on things that happen to suit to Government's line. Max Walsh states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The trouble is that the Governor, and by extension the Reserve Bank and the Government, has got it wrong—horribly wrong. We do have a long-term employment problem. . . and a serious one at that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the simple fact is that this Government managed to fund its expansion of the labour market by borrowing from abroad at levels that were far above those of the past and far above what we will be able to borrow in the future. Max Walsh says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Nobody for one moment—including Governor Fraser—imagines the rest of the world will continue to underwrite Australia's employment growth in the future in the fashion in which it did through the 80s.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A very much higher level of domestic savings is required to finance investment and produce remotely comparable employment outcomes to the 80s.
       </para>
       <para>
        He gives other reasons why we do have a long term problem—one which this Budget and these Bills before us will simply worsen. As Max Walsh says, if policy is being formulated on the basis of that proposition—that is, that we are having only a short term employment problem as the Governor of the Reserve Bank says—we are digging Australia into a deep hole. He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        I hope that the only loser to emerge from this will be this Government. I hope that this Government will be replaced in time to bring to an end these disastrous policies that are putting so many people out of work, putting so many Australians in situations where they are underemployed, putting so many Australians in the position where they do not even bother being on the unemployed list—they are the hidden unemployed—and putting so many Australians in a position where their economic future and the future of their children when they leave school will be massively diminished to suit the short term political objectives of a power hungry Prime Minister.

         It is highly disturbing that we should be governed by such people as these, because they exemplify the worst excesses of the 1980s. Is it not ironic that we have as the leader of that Government a man who, when he was Treasurer and when he was plotting to become Prime Minister, railed constantly against the corporate sector of this nation for what he considered excessive consumption, for what he considered excessive spending and for what he considered financial irresponsibility? Yet tonight we have before us Supply Bills Nos. 3 and 4 which are an indictment of this Government's own excesses, this Government's own financial irresponsibility and this Government's own inability to balance the books.

         Here we have a government that came before the Senate in August this year and said quite brazenly that it intended to run a deficit of $13.4 billion. That is $13,400m of deficit. Here we have a government that came before the Senate and said in the Budget that it had a financing requirement and needed to borrow $18 1/2 billion. Here we have a government that has come before this country in the greatest recession since the 1930s and said, `Instead of having good financial management, we are going to spend and spend wantonly'.

It has sourced the money from overseas, by pillaging the finances and the savings base of this nation and by making poorer the corporate sector and this nation's long term finances, which are what we really need to depend upon in order to generate a real recovery.

         —I rise tonight to make some points on behalf of my colleague Senator Walters, who is not here. Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Cook attempted to extricate himself from a very deep hole which he had managed to dig for himself in relation to a number of answers he had previously given my colleague Senator Walters regarding the loss of a very important joint venture with the Russians from the Hobart waterfront. As Senator Walters is not here and I am the only other southern-based Tasmanian Liberal senator, I believe I should take a few moments to briefly comment on Senator Cook's additional response to Senator Walters that I missed yesterday.

       <para>
        That was the initial answer he gave to the first question Senator Walters asked on 9 September. I think it is quite clear to anyone who had a chance to look at Senator Cook's rather pathetic attempts at backtracking yesterday that it was not Senator Walters who ended up with egg on her face but the Minister himself. There is no doubt, if there was any doubt before, that in providing his answer to Senator Walters on 9 September the Minister made a number of comments which were completely and utterly untrue.

         It is up to us in the Senate to judge for ourselves the motivation for the Minister's action, but surely any Minister of this Government has an obligation to come into this chamber and give answers that can be substantiated. This was not so in Senator Cook's case. Just as importantly, by coming into this chamber and making a number of incorrect and totally unsubstantiated allegations regarding Trident Seafoods, the Minister has damaged the standing in the community of that company. With that in mind, what Senator Walters and Trident Seafoods received from the Minister yesterday was nothing more than very shallow justice indeed. They both deserve—and I believe the Senate deserves—a total and unequivocal apology from the Minister, Senator Cook, for the answer he gave in the Senate on 9 September.

         I will quickly illustrate how that comes about and how Senator Cook not only got egg on his face but also was caught with his pants down. On 9 September, Senator Cook said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All I can say about that allegation is that I understand there are other reasons as to why this company is facing financial difficulties.

        Yesterday in his answer that had become, with great licence and a fair amount of imagination:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I should have referred to the possibility of the joint venture facing difficulties having regard to problems encountered by similar joint venture proposals in other States when apparently the Russian partners had difficulty in meeting their contribution to the venture.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure honourable senators would agree that the Minister's explanation bears no relation to his initial comments. If anyone has any doubts I will read it again. Initially, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        All I can say about that allegation is that I understand there are other reasons as to why this company is facing financial difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then yesterday he comes out and blames the Russians for it. Further, on 9 September the Minister stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The advice I have before me is advice that the company had decided to abandon this enterprise before it had even started to negotiate what the terms and conditions would be for the handling of this fish on the waterfront in Hobart.

       <para>
        Yesterday, Senator Cook said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I should have said that the negotiations were not concluded before the announced withdrawal of the project, which I indicated in a subsequent answer on 14 September.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister was right about one thing: he should have said a lot of things which he did not say and not said a lot of things which he did say. I believe that the Minister has been guilty of either misleading the Senate or at least of not doing his homework before attempting to answer Senator Walters's question. There is a lesson for the Minister in this: if you do not know the full facts you are better off not saying anything. Under the circumstances, I therefore call upon the Minister to provide a full and unreserved apology to both Senator Walters and Trident Seafoods for the answer he gave on 9 September.

         Whilst the widespread use of various chemicals in our society has manifested itself in residues in our soil, air, water, food and animals, residues have now been found in our children. I am referring to a group of seven children from the Coffs Harbour region. Residues in the children affected range from organochlorins and solvents to heavy metals, et cetera. The common link in these children is that they have unexplained health problems as our medical and health authorities have concluded. This is part of a theme I have presented on the several occasions I have raised these sorts of matters in the adjournment debate; that is, our health and medical authorities are unable to deal with the problems that have become associated with the mysteries of how misused chemicals affect our population.

Indeed, our health authorities ostracised many medical practitioners or specialists who studied these cases and who put forward links between toxic chemical residues and effects on health. I wonder whether that could be described in any way as a scientific approach.

         All of these seven children live in the Coffs Harbour residential areas. One of the children is named Andrew Want and I will outline his case history in summary. After a normal birth, young Andrew, at six days, developed rapid breathing at approximately twice the normal rate. At six weeks he was diagnosed with gastric reflux. Not until six months was he breathing at a normal rate. At 18 months he was coughing persistently, and at two years Andrew was diagnosed as asthmatic and put on medication via a nebuliser three times a day.

After two hospitalisations in a well respected children's hospital in Sydney, no explanation was given other than that Andrew's condition was described as psychological.

         The plight of Andrew and these other children is frightful. What is also frightening is that they are not isolated cases, as I have demonstrated before when speaking during amendment debates. Many other children from other Australian towns and cities have accumulated heavy metals such as lead well above overseas levels. I have to say `many other' because unfortunately this reflects the lack of attention, research and baseline data that our health authorities should have.

Why are not our authorities tracking down how, where, when and why these children are accumulating such levels, and why are they not doing something about it? I am afraid that this question remains rhetorical. The answer can be given only when sufficient recognition is given to these problems and they are not considered as problems to be wiped away and beyond understanding. We need to address ourselves to how we can understand these problems.

         It would be interesting to see how balanced the National Health and Medical Research Council is in assessing safety and health effects when approving the large number of chemicals for use throughout our community. I will expand on that at another time. But for the moment, I want to state again in this place that we are able to see that chemical residues are accumulating in our children. Clearly, there is a huge gap in a registration system for chemical use where the health of our community is not given sufficient consideration, let alone our top priority.

While I think that was amply justified, I will use his proper title tonight, which is Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition.

As this article says, that objective is to obtain control of both Houses. If he does not do so at the 1993 election, then certainly at a subsequent election, which Dr Hewson would no doubt call on the basis of a double dissolution. It is quite clear that Senator Kemp is doing his level best to achieve that objective—namely, to decimate the Democrats to a point where Dr Hewson would be able to control both Houses.

We all know that this would have been fully justified. The history of bank practice in Australia is now well and truly on the table. The fact that many people have lost their savings, that the banks have lost a lot of money, that the share price has gone down and that the banks have not fulfilled their duties under the financial system that is operating is clear. I welcome Senator Kemp, who has just walked into the chamber.

         On 13 May 1991, a disallowance motion moved by the Democrats to the Austudy scheme which rejected regulations concerning the assets test to the family farm and small business assets, suggesting that they should not be included, was again not supported. Obviously, Senator Kemp and his colleagues are not concerned about the plight of farmers and small business people when they are trying to give their children an education.

         On 17 June, the Democrats moved amendments to the Telecommunications Bill to allow individuals or organisations to take direct legal action in the public interest in the event of any breaches in the legal code. It would seem that Senator Kemp and his colleagues did not think it worthy of support that individuals should be able to take legal action in the public interest. I wonder why.

         There is more. An amendment was moved on 18 June 1991 to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) to increase the rate of withholding tax on interest earned by non-residents when the arrangement is believed to be for tax avoidance purposes. The losses to public revenue that these arrangements are being put to have been well and truly documented by taxation academic Barbara Smith. A parliamentary committee, which published a report very colourfully named

         recommended that this was worthy of further investigation because clearly there were substantial revenue losses. However, once again, Senator Kemp and his colleagues did not seem to worry much about tax avoidance or the losses to public revenue because they chose to vote with the Government against the Democrat amendment.

         In deference to the advancing hour, I shall stop at this point. I advise Senator Kemp and his colleagues that I have many more such examples where the evidence of the Opposition voting with the Government against the interests of ordinary Australians, against the public interest and against the Democrats is well and truly on the record. He might like to look at the substance of his voting record rather than at pure numbers, which no doubt take a lot of fine study to accumulate but which mean very little.

         —I want to make a few remarks in the adjournment debate; they will be fairly brief in view of what Senator Sid Spindler has pointed to as the somewhat late hour. Firstly, I thank Senator Spindler for the courtesy of informing me that he was about to attack me in the Parliament. I appreciate the courtesy, but I am not sure whether I was attacked. Senator Spindler has demonstrated once again that it is always very dangerous in this Parliament to read out a speech which has been prepared by one's research staff without looking closely at it. It is a very dangerous practice and Senator Spindler should have been more careful this evening.

         I can understand that Senator Spindler is sensitive about this issue. He is sensitive because he has been one of the driving forces in the Democrat party room which has led the Democrats down this dead end. Compared with virtually all his colleagues, it is Senator Spindler who has encouraged the Australian Democrats to adopt consistently these astonishingly Left wing positions.

         I have referred to Senator Spindler before. I said that he should be classified by the National Trust as the sole surviving Marxist in any parliament in any country on any continent in this world. I always like to hear Senator Spindler speaking because he is one of the sole survivors of the 1950s and 1960s.

         Senator Spindler must bear a very heavy responsibility for the quite dramatic figures which I tabled in the Senate last night. It is not surprising that Senator Spindler came into the chamber this evening to make some comments. I was surprised that Senator Coulter, whom I advised last night that I was about to make some statements on the voting record of the Australian Democrats, did not come in here to defend himself. I do not know why he sent in Senator Spindler but when Senator Coulter reads the

         Why has this whole thing emerged this evening—on Wednesday night when all of us feel it is appropriate that we leave comparatively early? Last night I tabled some pretty dramatic figures in this chamber. I repeat that in 216 divisions of the thirty-sixth Parliament which have occurred since March 1990 the Australian Democrats have supported the Government. By contrast, on 34 occasions they have supported the coalition. That is a pretty fine record for a Party that wants to portray itself to the community as some sort of centrist party and some sort of honest broker between the major parties. Senator Spindler is acutely sensitive about this. That is why he has come into the Senate this evening and decided to make a bit of a fuss about it. He has made only a bit of a fuss; I do not think he scored too many points.

         Another point I wish to make—having pointed to the Australian Democrats' dreadful voting record in divisions—relates to the number of Bills in the last two years that the Australian Democrats have enabled to be forced through this Parliament without any significant debate. Some 111 Bills in all—roughly one-quarter of the legislation which has gone through this Senate—have been forced through with the cooperation of the Australian Democrats. And this is the party that holds itself out as wanting to make governments more accountable to the Parliament! It is a dreadful record and Senator Spindler has cooperated in that rather appalling record.

         The final point I wish to make is this: I would have thought that any party that wanted to improve standards in the Parliament and encourage more effective Government accountability to the Parliament would have been one of the strongest supporters of the reforms to Question Time that we proposed as little as three weeks ago—and also of the procedure of moving to take note of Ministers' answers after Question Time to force them to be more accountable. But because Senator Spindler is the sole surviving Marxist in any parliament in any country on any continent in this world, he has convinced his colleagues that somehow because we on the Opposition benches want this accountability, because we want Question Time to function in a more traditional manner, as all other governments have decided, and because we wanted to ensure that Ministers were accountable for their answers through the

         In deference to my colleagues who undoubtedly wish to go home, I will conclude on this point: Senator Spindler will now pay a very heavy price for forsaking his heritage and adopting procedures which do not increase the authority of the Parliament but diminish it.

While this primary function has not changed, the volume of some business, e.g. registry, has declined. This  coupled with substantially improved systems for delivery of the Bank's services, has been trend, reflected in a reduced need for staff in branches. There has also been a move away from performing a number of ancillary activities in the larger branches, e.g. on-site data processing and market liaison (money market, foreign exchange market and banking liaison in Melbourne) in favour of handling these from Head Office. Apart from impacts of some centralising of activities, these changes have also been reflected in the reduction in staff numbers in related areas of the Bank's Head Office.

        The ABT has determined program standards, which require licensees to classify all programs according to the times of the day they may be shown and the audience for which they are suitable. Television Program Standard 10 (TPS 10) sets out the criteria which licensees are to use in classifying programs. The criteria relate to the depictions in programs of violence, sexual activity, drugs and the use of offensive language.

        (3) In February Australia expressed its concerns in a major address to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. At that time we actively worked towards obtaining a consensus Chairman's statement but this initiative was unsuccessful due to lack of agreement on the terms of the statement. In its latest statement on the issue on 26 August the Security Council expressed its deep concern at the deterioration of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and strongly appealed to all parties for an immediate ceasefire and urged positive participation in negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute. The Security Council noted that the Secretary-General had despatched a fact-finding mission to the region and was ready to send observers to the CSCE negotiations. It stated that the Council would consider further the role of the United Nations in Nagorno-Karabakh.
