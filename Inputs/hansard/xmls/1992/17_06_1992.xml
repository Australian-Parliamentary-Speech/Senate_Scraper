         The Committee seeks this extension for the following reasons: firstly, the Committee already has a set of terms of reference on superannuation which, amongst other issues, address matters pertinent to the superannuation guarantee legislation. Therefore, unlike a number of other Bills' reports, there is a need for the Committee to write a detailed report.

          Secondly, the superannuation guarantee legislation is a matter for which considerable time is needed in order that an agreed view may be reached. Honourable senators will be aware that the Bills have been the subject of considerable public comment and that parties represented on the Senate Select Committee have been involved in intense negotiations which as yet have not reached conclusion. I look forward to tabling the Committee's report on the superannuation guarantee legislation Bills on Thursday morning should the Senate agree to this motion.

         I and more than one million unemployed ask the Senate to give this motion its urgent consideration. Well over 100,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing industries in the last two years and we can easily increase that two or three times by the flow-on from those jobs which have been lost. Total unemployment is edging towards 11 per cent and the greatest shame of all is that 46 per cent of youth is unemployed in Victoria. Nationally, 120,000 young people are not in training and not in work. That figure can be doubled by counting all the street kids and other young people who are not lining up to be registered as unemployed and to receive unemployment benefits. So the question must be asked: what is this Government and what is this Opposition prepared to do to change it?

          It is indeed urgent that this matter be put into place by the Senate to investigate what action can be taken in the industrial area to achieve more employment, to get people out of the misery which they are now in. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this motion, in its terms of reference, does not ask for high protection across the board. It merely asks for a pause, but then asks for a considered, deliberate approach in lieu of the economic policy—I should say the apology for an economic and industry policy—that this country is following at the moment.

          Both the Government and the Opposition are heading rapidly towards further tariff cuts, which will further decimate our industries, which will further reduce jobs. This motion to establish a Senate inquiry would enable us to assess the effects of varying levels of protection on employment, on public revenue, on social security expenditure and on regional communities dependent on particular industries.

          We may well decide that certain industries are socially or geographically important enough to warrant longer term protection, and that may apply to the sugarcane growers in Queensland and the dairy farmers in Victoria. It certainly applies to the TCF industries in Victoria where 80,000 jobs were lost, where 80 factories are now at risk, and where 16 were closed last year alone. This committee should also investigate the additional tax incentives, depreciation allowances, cost of entry assistance, and research and development support which should be provided to industries most likely to succeed.

          We should look at the effect of the use of energy and natural resources in each of the industry sectors, and we should look at the potential for the development of alternative products or industries. We should also look at the exploitation index, the unacceptably low wages, work safety and environmental safeguards which enable international competitors to undercut Australian products. We should further look at the capital and expertise required to implement such strategies and look to the development of a framework for education, training, and research and development. Last, but not least, we should look for a toughening of anti-dumping measures. It is indeed urgent that this be done by the Senate now and I regret that the Government and the Opposition are not prepared to even look at industries' problems.

          —I will not keep the Senate long because I know that a number of people want to express a view on this matter. There are only two points that I want to make. The first is that it is incredible that this proposal comes before us a day after the Democrats conspired with the Government to impose a guillotine on the Senate because they said the burden of legislative business before the Senate was so great that there could not be proper debate on each of the Bills that are before us—Bills of a major consequence. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, with a clause on subcontractors, needs much more time than it is going to get; there is the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Levy Bill; and there are the reforms to the wholesale sales tax Bill to provide further imposts on Australian business. These are matters that should be debated in full, and properly, by this House of review, but they are not going to be so debated because of an agreement between the Australian Democrats and the Government.

          Yet the first day after we have that guillotine imposed upon us, the Australian Democrats come in here and seek to suspend Standing Orders in order that they might pursue one of their items of general business. What hypocrisy! How often do they lecture us, saying, `Your matters are of no importance. Ministerial standards are of no importance in relation to the Marshall Islands'. What this chamber should be debating is the legislative program and yet, the first day after they imposed the guillotine, they come in here and want to set matters aside so they can debate one of their motions; that is entirely unsatisfactory.

          Before I sit down, I want to make one point on the merits of this matter. The answer of the Australian Democrats to the terrible situation of Australia now, with mass unemployment and recession, is that they would put up the barriers again; they would try to isolate Australia in some way. I say to Senator Spindler that he should go back and read the Hughes report, the Garnaut report, and all those reports of experts that have told the Government what needs to be done in this country, and that is, to get the imposts off business—bring down the costs that have been imposed by government on Australian business so that it has the potential to be profitable again and to employ Australians. Over 10 per cent of Australians are unemployed. In my State, 46 per cent of young Australians who want a job cannot get one because this Government has imposed burdens upon Australian business under which it cannot survive and it cannot employ.

        <para first-indent="16">

          That is what the Australian Democrats should be concentrating on, instead of putting up more barriers, trying to isolate Australia from the rest of the world, and forgetting about those huge market opportunities that are out there in Asia if we can be domestically competitive. They should be concentrating on the reforms that are necessary in this country to enable Australian business to be competitive again. They should get those fairies out from the bottom of the garden; recognise the opportunities that are there for Australian business if government can reform in a way which can reduce imposts on business; free up the labour market and reduce taxation; adopt the Fightback package, for example; and take $20m a year off the tax impost on Australian business—then they will be doing something constructive for young Australians by giving them a chance of getting a job again. I commend that to the Australian Democrats for their careful consideration.

          From time to time in this place it is important to remind ourselves that there is a significant distinction between talking about important things and doing something important. The issues listed in this motion are important issues, issues for important debate. But we are having a debate here about whether we should set up a committee to look at these matters between now and October—matters that have been reviewed by very important government bodies and debated in public as a response to those inquiries for the last 70 years without reaching agreement.

          There are important differences between all of us in this chamber about the conclusion, but those differences do not arise because we do not know the facts.

          It is true that we disagree about the conclusion. Some people believe that setting up a committee between June and October will provide an agreement and a consensus. I am now talking about the period in which we have had official tariff board and its successors policies, although for reasons such as the Harvester judgments we could go back 85 years. In 70 years of informed debate in Australia, the one issue that Australians can be satisfied there has been a lot of discussion about, is free trade versus protection. It was one of the key issues in the debate about Federation. It is not exactly a new issue for Australia.

That is what we are about in here. Let us have the debate, but let us not sit around talking about whether we should set up a committee to try to do in four months what the rest of the Australian population has been doing comprehensively for at least 70 years, and arguably for longer. For that reason I do not believe this is an appropriate matter to which we should give priority in these last two weeks of sitting. Therefore, we do not support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.

          —I am very pleased to hear Senator McMullan's words of condemnation of this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. I want to speak very briefly because the serious thing for this chamber to do is to get on with 62 Bills. The Australian Democrats did a deal with the Government yesterday to apply a guillotine to those Bills so that fundamental Bills which go to the whole core of the future of young people, old people and unemployed people in this country can be debated. That is what the chamber ought to be about. What we are about, as a result of the sleazy deals that this hypocritical bunch of Democrats has done with the Government over recent days and weeks—and they are obviously still in train—is being denied the opportunity to debate those issues that are of great moment to the future of this country.

          Senator Hill said that his State has 46 per cent of its young people unemployed; my State has 46 per cent of its young people unemployed. Thirty-four per cent of young people throughout Australia are unemployed. Senator Spindler wants to go down this track. Someone said earlier that he was in a time warp. He sure is in a time warp. He wants to set up a committee of the Parliament to look at matters that, as Senator McMullan said, have been looked at for 70 or 80 years, and turn back the clock in relation to the whole trend of sensible, rational movement in tariffs that we have fortunately managed to maintain over the last few years.

          It is the hypocrisy of the Democrats' attempt to bring this matter forward that every honourable senator in this place, other than the Democrats, must find absolutely sickening. Senator Spindler talks about wanting to do something for the unemployed and for the economy. I will tell Senator Spindler what he can do: he can support the Fightback proposals that take $20 billion off the taxes on doing business in this country; and he can stop supporting Government legislation that imposes more and more costs on business, such as the superannuation guarantee arrangements, the industrial relations legislation, the training guarantee levy—one can name more and more—and the whole industrial relations system, in which he is opposed to providing flexibility and an opportunity for people to have jobs in this country.

          I think the Democrats went into the last election as a party with policies that were proposing to increase taxes and government spending, basically on business and therefore on jobs in this country, by $20 billion to $25 billion. This is the party that talks about wanting to try to do things for people. This is a proposal of the greatest hypocrisy. I am very pleased to see that both major parties are treating it as what it is—a shabby, sleazy attempt to divert attention from the way that the Democrats have prevented the proper processes of government and the proper consideration of the real issues facing this country. They deserve the fate their motion will suffer today.

          —Every time one drives off or onto a freeway, on the other channel one sees a large sign, `Go back: you are going the wrong way'. It seems to me that there is a clear lesson here for both the Government and the Opposition. As we have just heard in the last few minutes, they have adopted a policy which is leading to massive unemployment. In Victoria alone—Senator Spindler's State—one saw a major headline only a few weeks ago, `40,000 jobs lost in the clothing, textile and footwear industry as a direct result of tariff reductions'. To continue with tariff reductions at a time when we already have massive unemployment and to throw more people on the scrap heap is absolutely unconscionable. Contrary to what Senator Hill said, we are not suggesting that we build up high tariff walls; we are simply saying that at this stage the Government and the Opposition should stop where they are and review the situation with this Senate process.

          Also out of Victoria in recent weeks have come figures in relation to the benefits from buying Australian compared with buying imports—retaining industry in this country. They showed that for every million dollars which was spent on home manufacture, rather than on imports, roughly a quarter of a million dollars was garnered back by various levels of government in taxation, another quarter of a million dollars was saved in not having to pay unemployment benefits to unemployed people and there was a further very considerable benefit in the other employment which was generated.

          This is a clear indication that very substantial protection of Australian industry actually pays in terms of government taxes, revenues and savings in unemployment benefits. It is precisely because these figures are coming out at this time—it does not matter what has happened over the last 70 years—that it is urgent that this matter be debated and fresh consideration be given to it, rather than simply continuing down this doctrinaire road adopted by the Government and the Opposition which says that we should remove all tariff barriers and that somehow miraculously these dead industries will get up like Lazarus and become productive. It is not happening. The evidence is out there, if only the Government and the Opposition would open the window and look. We need to bring that evidence to bear on where we go in relation to this tariff matter. It is absolutely appropriate that that be properly investigated at this time.

          The conditions are very different from conditions which have obtained throughout the last 70 years. We are in the deepest recession; we have the highest level of unemployment and there is every indication that that level of unemployment is increasing. We have a large and growing foreign debt, and the interest rate on the debt is escalating out of sight. These are unusual circumstances. One simply cannot rely on things such as the Garnaut report, which is totally unrealistic. It is just not of this world at all. It is important and urgent that this matter be set straight now; that this investigation be got under way.

This motion is the worst form of politicking one could possibly have. It is misleading the Australian public. I believe that the way to address the employment problems that exist in business is, firstly, to get rid of the imposts and, secondly, to clean up the work practices.

          Let us look at tariffs, what they have done to this country and the problems we have. There are some factual things that have to be accepted. This motion gives people false hopes. The highest level of attrition is in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. When protection was at its highest, the industry had its greatest attrition levels. Senator Spindler mentioned the sugar industry. The sugar industry's major problem today is its high levels of protection. It has lost 25 per cent of the sugar market to imported sweeteners. That has occurred purely and simply because of that level of protection. The sugar industry has become non-competitive. Tariffs have cost Australians jobs. People have been locked in a cocoon which has protected them from the reality of the marketplace; they have lost jobs for that reason.

          Let us go further and compare the levels of protection in a number of areas. One could refer to a number of reports. Let us compare the levels of protection in the farm sectors of the United States, Europe and Australia. In Europe, with its high levels of protection, the attrition rate of farms has been 16 per cent per annum; in the United States, 14 per cent; and in Australia, 6 per cent. Protection does not protect jobs; it does not protect business. As I said in my opening remarks, this motion is totally misleading the Australian public. It is time there was a little honesty in the tariff debate, instead of dishonesty, and time people were told the truth about the impact of tariffs and what they do. Tariffs have cost Australian business its market share in Australia.

As other speakers have mentioned, we will not change this country until the excesses of the various imposts that business has on its head such as payroll tax, fuel excise and training levies—one could go through a whole list of these up-front taxes—are removed and until work practices are cleaned up.

The motion contains a considerable number of terms of reference. As Senator McMullan said, it probably is a tall order for such a Senate select committee to examine those matters and come back with a report by 30 October 1992. But we are not debating that; we are debating the suspension of Standing Orders.

          I will vote for the suspension of Standing Orders because I believe that it would enable us to have a wide ranging debate on employment, which would be useful at this time. Other matters relating to employment would be able to be brought in. People talk about restructuring industry, but very few people look at the structure of the paid work force itself. That is a danger. If we now had the participation rate that we had 20 years ago, there would be hardly any unemployment. That is a matter that has escaped most people's attention.

          There are now hundreds of thousands of people in the paid work force who would rather be out of it doing socially constructive alternatives. For example, the Australian Institute of Family Studies recently published a survey of mothers with small dependant children. Most of them would rather be out of the paid work force nurturing their children at home, yet they are being forced through economic pressures to stay in the paid work force. That is scandalous. Their jobs could be taken by the unemployed. They have been kept in the paid work force because it is most difficult now for a family to subsist on one income. That is because of the substantial drop in the real disposable income of a one income family in the last eight years, and the anti one income family policies and the economic and taxation policies that have been adopted by the Government. Those are the sorts of things that I would like to debate. That is one reason why I propose to support the suspension of Standing Orders.

         In view of the fact that this important Bill—which is aimed at making it easier for unions to force the 800,000 subcontractors to join a union against their will—has been guillotined by this Government, with the support of the Australian Democrats, at a time when we have record unemployment and have a great need to improve the productivity of this country, I think anyone listening to this debate will recognise the sham that it is.

         However, the Minister asked what our position was on this issue. I want to put the Opposition's position clearly on the record. We consider that this Bill is lousy legislation which never should have been introduced. It was introduced in the face of opposition from every employer group in this country. It was sparked off because of the Troubleshooters case, and the ACTU—the organ grinder—tapping the monkey, the Minister, on the shoulder and saying, `You must amend the industrial relations Bill to counteract the court decision of Troubleshooters.'.

         —In spite of what Senator Parer says, this is very good legislation and it is needed. But I do not want to take up the time of the chamber on that point. I wish to correct a matter which I raised yesterday. When talking about this legislation I referred to Troubleshooters and to the contract under which—and it says it does not employ people—it makes arrangements for people to work for others. I quoted from a case relating to a person who was injured while working under a Troubleshooters contract, as I put it, and who received no workers compensation.

         I spoke to Mr Bosa from Troubleshooters who said that that did not relate to any person who worked for Troubleshooters. I told him that I accepted his statement on that point. It would appear from the source of my information that he is correct. To make it quite clear, he says that, although the agreements that the people had to sign if they wanted a job did not at this time include workers compensation, Troubleshooters in fact did have people covered. I just wanted to correct that statement, having spoken to Mr Bosa about the matter.

        It would have been the purpose of the legislation had I persisted with 127A. 127B is about harsh and unfair contracts, which I would think are probably sham contracts anyway, but they are better described as harsh and unfair. Section 127A was about contracts that were designed to get around or circumvent the provisions of an award. They are sham for the reason that they are not genuine contracts. They are contrivances, inventions and artificialities,—

        designed to put some sort of legal gloss on law breaking and contracting out. As you know, from the evidence that has been given, they are contracts that deal with body hire rather genuine contracting. I, at least, am of the view that, if a particular case of that nature arose and was contested and taken to the High Court and went through the whole appeal system, the High Court would probably find, and this is my judgment, that the Commission has the authority to deal with those sorts of contracts, because its scope is wide enough. It is because I am of this view that I am more relaxed than I might otherwise have been about the 127A changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, under proposed section 127B, the Commission may review a contract if the contract is unfair, the contract is harsh, the contract is against the public interest. I think Troubleshooters, in evidence to us, pointed out the number of times that the words `against the public interest' have been used by the trade union movement as a means of getting disputes into the Commission. Paragraph 127B (4)(e) reads:

        Given all those particular outs in proposed section 127B, does the Minister really think that the changes that he has made to the amendments drop the provisions that would have clearly given the IRC jurisdiction over disputes involving contractors?

         —I would also like to make some comments on the removal of proposed section 127A and the impact of proposed section 127B (2). It is worth defining what the differences are. To do so, one has to look at a number of aspects of all the provisions in proposed section 127.

         The first point that I want to make is that 127A, which has been deleted, was in fact a class action provision. If we look at 127B, we see that it relates to the review of a single contract. That is the fundamental difference. If we go over to 127B (5), we find that the Commission must record its opinion. Of course, the fundamental difference between these two provisions and what has been removed—and this is where the employers have been conned and this legislation has been very cleverly written—is that, while it will take a little longer, the impact will in the longer term be exactly the same.

         Once the various cases are recorded, they will be used and waved in front of contractors on the ground. Coercion will be used. It is part and parcel of the whole thing. This is legitimising or legalising coercion. It will be used, it will be waved in front of the various contractors and they will end in up in front of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission whether they want to or not. Their only other option will be to be black-banned from sites. That is what will happen in practice. I think it is worth noting that aspect.

         Let us go through what has happened in terms of the removal of that clause. Consideration of cost and efficiency was the first point of proposed new section 127A(1). Cost and efficiency is the only part left out of proposed new section 127B(2). It must be remembered—I particularly put this point to the Democrats—that contracting is about being paid for work. In a normal employee situation, one gets paid for the time worked. There is a very big difference in terms of what can be produced in terms of cost and efficiency. So many people in this country—in the order of one million—choose to work the the contract system because they put efficiencies in place. They do not get involved in some of the more outrageous work practices that exist in some industries—not all industries, but some—and because they are efficient they earn more money for doing a particular job and they go home with more net dollars in their pockets. That is what contracting is all about.

         We find in proposed new section 127B (4)(e) the phrase `any other matter that the Commission thinks relevant'. Proposed new section 127A(1)(b) states that it `may have regard to any other matter that the Commission thinks relevant'. They are both there. Proposed new section 127B(4)(d) refers to total remuneration. We see total remuneration referred to again in 127A(1)(a)(iii). If we look a little further at 127B(4)(c) we find reference to the `development of the skills of employees performing work'. That is on the other side of the ledger. As one goes on through the Bill, one finds obligations of an employer on both sides of the ledger.

         The point I make in terms of the removal of clause 127A is that it does not remove anything other than the time it will take to do it. The Minister knows well and the Democrats should know well—particularly Senator Spindler, who has been lobbied significantly in terms of this Bill and has had many viewpoints put to him—that the only difference is time. Once there are a number of these particular cases on the record, the impact and the effect will be exactly the same.

         It is indeed unfortunate that the major employer organisations in terms of their paid advertising campaign were conned. I also think it is unfortunate that they should go into negotiations with a government—and I do not care which government it is—on the basis that `if you do certain things we will not do something'. That is not how organisations should operate and run. They should assess the merits of where they get to and then make their decision. From this point of view, I am going to defend the Housing Industry Authority, ASBA and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, which has been running paid advertisements in the

         Last night the Minister said that no evidence had been presented with regard to housing costs and the impact of unionisation. I want to set the record absolutely straight on that.

The Authority did produce that evidence yesterday. It is there for all to see and I am sure the Minister has seen it by now.

         IMPACT OF UNIONISATION ON     HOUSING COSTS
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While building unions have been unsuccessful in penetrating the single-family detached housing sector, they have forced industrial/commercial conditions on some high-rise and higher density housing sites in the major capital cities.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Where building unions have penetrated medium density housing, building companies are required to engage subcontractors on union imposed terms and conditions. The  main forms of union interference involve the setting of subcontractor prices well in excess of prices prevailing in single-family detached housing. So while subcontractor labour arrangements might be tolerated by the building unions they behave as a de facto contract regulation tribunal.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Home building firms which operate in both detached and multi-unit housing typically are forced to separately incorporate or to establish two divisional operations.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Housing Industry Association has compiled a profile of housing projects where subcontracting arrangements are applied under industrial/commercial conditions. These studies were based on actual unionised townhouse and home unit projects undertaken in 1991 and early 1992 and identify the source and magnitude of additional costs over dwellings of a comparable standard produced under non-unionised housing conditions.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The projects were undertaken by different companies in Sydney and Brisbane ranging from budget-priced townhouse developments to high-rise apartments. The additional costs arising from unionisation reflected mainly higher prices for subcontract labour due to the imposition of a union "rate schedule" and additional finance costs from lost time due to union industrial stoppages and closed sites for rostered days off. In some projects site allowances were imposed, requiring builders to maintain log books of hours worked by subcontractors (site allowances typically were expressed in terms of a $1 to $1.50 per hour per on-site worker).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The case studies revealed that unionisation of medium density sites added around 15 per cent to construction costs in three projects and 11.2 per cent in the other project. In the examples of townhouse projects the construction methods were virtually the same as for those applying to detached housing construction, but industrial/commercial conditions were imposed on the townhouse projects because the number of units in the projects exceeded four dwellings. In some areas, unions try to force commercial conditions on builders constructing homes in excess of $1.7m.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For a project home builder of detached housing, on-site labour costs would represent around 25 per cent of total construction costs; building materials, fittings and fixtures would account for the largest component of housing costs at about 50 per cent of the total and the remaining 25 per cent would represent administrative overheads, marketing and selling costs, interest expenses and profit margin. The impact of unionisation is to lift dramatically on-site labour costs. On the basis that on-site labour costs in non-unionised housing construction represent 25 per cent of overall costs of construction, the imposition of union conditions would increase on-site labour costs by between 40 and 50 per cent over traditional arrangements applying in single-family detached housing.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If the building unions were to succeed in subverting housing sites from subcontract arrangements to day-labour as applies to office construction sites the impact on labour productivity and housing costs would be devastating. Many home building companies would be forced to close down their business.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         One of the most significant cost penalties arising from the imposition of on-site employees instead of subcontractors is the loss of productivity. Independent subcontractors, unlike direct employees, are remunerated on the basis of results achieved as distinct from the number of hours worked. Subcontractors have the incentive to get on with the job.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Building firms which operate in the commercial building sector estimate that labour productivity of direct employees in that sector is about half of the productivity levels achieved by housing subcontractors. On this basis alone, the replacement of subcontract labour with day labour would push up housing costs by an intolerable 25 per cent. After allowing for both additional holding costs from industrial stoppages and site allowances, the extra cost burden on housing would be in the vicinity of 30-35 per cent.

         A number of aspects in relation to the clauses before us certainly need addressing. I particularly want to refer to the contract and the public interest. I want to address a question to the Minister as to why, in terms of that particular clause, we find that it is being deleted for certified agreements, yet as far as contractors are concerned, it is not being deleted. As I understand it, the principle reason for its being deleted in terms of the certified agreements is so that there can be variations to what are known as custom and practice. That means that under a certified agreement, for example, work could be carried out on five of any days in a week rather than the traditional Monday to Friday.

         In many cases it has been the work practice of contractors to either start work early in the morning or work across the weekend when that is suitable to do the job, taking into account weather conditions and a number of other aspects which impact on the work. Perhaps the Minister will address that aspect. We will find that, as a result of this legislation, practices which existed in the traditional 40- or 38-hour week, or whatever it was, will be forced onto contractors and there will be the sorts of price hikes referred to in the document which I have mentioned.

         I emphasise that, according to what the MBA had to say in evidence, which is inconsistent with what the Minister said yesterday, unionisation of the housing industry would push up the costs by no less than 25 per cent. The document shows quite clearly what has occurred in housing developments where unionisation has taken place. As I said last night, there is no way that the housing industry or any other industry can be quarantined from it, including the industry I am involved in, which is agriculture. I am sure the Minister knows very well that, in terms of contracting and transport tasks, it is possible to have a totally different price rate during what is known as the off season from that which applies during the busy times such as seeding and harvesting. Contractors operate during those times because there is competition in the marketplace and there is not the work around. Mark my words; this legislation will destroy all of that.

         In essence the provisions mean the same and in practice they will mean the same. The issue is one of public interest. It is inconsistent in terms of industrial policy to have the public interest applying in one area after having recognised in certified agreements that it is no longer appropriate.

         I have two questions for the Minister. Firstly, would the Minister confirm that the remaining provisions of clause 8 are not intended by the Government to cover self-employed entrepreneurs operating as business people in an open, competitive market? It must be borne in mind that this will have some bearing under the Acts Interpretation Act on how a court would construe the reach and ambit of the provisions contained in clause 8.

         The second question that I ask the Minister to address relates to the matter of public interest, which is identified as being one of three grounds which could be used to review a contract. The first ground is that the contract is unfair; the second is that the contract is harsh; and the third is that the contract is against the public interest. On the matter of public interest, I would like the Minister to confirm that the public interest in this provision is aimed at the substance of the contract and not aimed at the desirability of settling an industrial dispute which may then be in existence. A concern that has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions is that the public interest provision could be brought under the provisions of a contract that needs to be reviewed simply because it is the subject of an existing industrial dispute. I draw that distinction. I would appreciate the Minister's answers to these two questions.

At that time the answer was—and the answer remains—that it is not intended that self-employed entrepreneurs acting in a commercial way are caught by this legislation in the way in which Senator Spindler has drawn attention to it. That is also set out in the legislative statement of intent that I put down at the beginning of this debate in the committee stage.

The next question concerned the public interest and related to whether the Australian Industrial Relations Commission would direct its attention to the public interest in terms of the substance of the contract rather than embracing the wider dispute settling procedures of the Commission. The way this Bill is drawn, supported now by the amendments, makes it explicit that it deals with the substance of the contract. It is, therefore, distinguishable and different from the other powers of the Commission where it is enjoined to prevent and settle industrial disputes.

         This is the fundamental distinction we want to make. The legislation, stripped of section 127A, which is what the amendment before the Chair will do if carried, comes down to empowering the Commission, in the event of a contract being presented to it by a contractor which is found by the Commission to be harsh and unreasonable, to deal with harsh and unreasonable contracts. That is what the legislation does. It does not provide, as has been suggested in some of these questions, a class action basis for a union to take an action on behalf of all contractors. It explicitly does not provide that.

In this sense, I think any fair-minded, independent commentator would acknowledge that the way we have drafted these provisions reflects the existing provisions in the New South Wales Act enacted by the Greiner Government last year, although I might say that we have done it in a slightly narrower way.

         Let me go in order of merit to the next set of questions, which were from Senator Calvert. I will come to Senator Crane eventually; he is at the bottom of the class. Senator Calvert asked me two questions. The first was whether I thought that, by removing section 127A, we removed the jurisdiction of the Commission over sham contracts. That is according to the notes I took of the honourable senator's first question. There has been a long debate about what are sham contracts. Sham contracts were best defined by me in evidence I gave to the Senate committee of inquiry on Monday, and which was read into
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         by Senator Calvert when he asked the question. Sham contracts are contrivances to evade the lawful provision of an award in the pretence that it is an independent contract and not someone working as a wages employee. They are an artificial device to get around the law.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let me put it in logical sequence. To answer the honourable senator's question, one first has to comprehend the scope of the law as it presently stands. This is a matter of debate between protagonists in the field until such time as the matter comes before the High Court and the High Court finally decides what the legislation means. So, when we talk about what we think the law means, we are dealing in the realm of subjective judgment until it is defined by the High Court, which has the final power to tell us what it means.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think the powers of the Commission are wider than the powers that are commonly assumed to be its powers. The reason I am relaxed about deleting this provision is that, if an appropriate case went before the High Court—and this is a subjective judgment by me, based on advice coming to me—I think the High Court would find that it has the power to deal with sham contracts because it relates to employment law. I think the Commission would find that it has that power, but that is a matter to be contested in due course should such a case arise.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I am happier to remove this power to make it explicit because of my belief as to what the High Court would find. Whilst I acknowledge that not everyone believes as I do—the employers certainly do not; they think the High Court will find differently—maybe we will all be enlightened sooner or later one way or the other when the High Court makes a decision.

         Removing section 127A does substantially change the quality of the legislation before the Committee. The legislation in dealing with independent contractors is about two separate things. The first, which we are now taking out, gives power to the Commission to determine what sort of worker—an independent contractor or a wages employee—should be employed on particular work, and the second deals with giving the Commission power to deal with contracts which are found to be harsh and unreasonable and to then be able to set aside those contracts which are harsh and unreasonable. So, if we take the first section out, we are left with the fair contract section. Let us all take our chances before the High Court when defining the powers of the Commission.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That brings me now to the second question which Senator Calvert asked relating to section 127B as to whether we are clothing the Commission here with a judicial power which would, on the face of it, bring it up against determinations of the High Court. I think the case that is commonly cited here is the boilermakers case in which the High Court, inter alia, found that the Commission has an arbitral power but not a judicial one. Are we in fact running against that precedent? That is what I ascertain the question to be. The answer is that it is not in the way in which we have written it. We do not believe there is a judicial role for the Commission in the way the clauses have been expressed. I am aware that some people have said we are wrong in that and that they may challenge that. That is their right, but we are confident in our opinion and, should there be a challenge, we will defend the legislation.

         But please bear this in mind: we are simply asking that the Commission, as a no cost, simple, accessible venue, be able to determine whether a matter is harsh and unfair in a way which does not give it a judicial ring and then be able to replace it with something that brings it up to being fair. If people are opposed to this amendment, they support in an obverse way harsh and unfair contracts. If it is understood by the Opposition that by opposing our legislation it in fact supports things that are harsh and unfair, logically it cannot sustain its own position.

This is a small, trite point, but let me correct him: it is the Housing Industry Association. It is not an authority of any kind. It has acted reprehensibly in this debate. Senator Crane may or may not know better than the body of mainstream employer organisations in this country, but I notice that he holds his opinion out to be superior to that of the HIA. My question about the HIA and ASBA relates to their integrity when they negotiate with the Government over changes. To take the outcome of those negotiations and the advantages of them but to not honour their obligations shows, I think, a lack of integrity. I have addressed myself to that.

         I turn now to the particular questions which Senator Crane raised but which are pretty hard to find in the mishmash of rhetoric. It comes down to this: this Bill will not introduce wholesale unionism into the housing sector. It will not do that because no preference provisions will apply. It will not do that because we will accept an amendment from the Australian Democrats which will make it clear that a person does not have to be a member of a union to approach the Industrial Relations Commission to have a harsh and unfair contract set aside. It will not do that because there is no provision for class actions or logs of claims to be served on behalf of independent contractors.

         —In fact, there is no enforcement provision here. If Senator Kemp would care to read the legislation simply and clearly rather than the propaganda, he would know that. It is not a criminal act to join a union. Many independent contractors join unions because they work at one time under an award, at another time as independent contractors and, at times of slack demand in the housing industry, often call upon unions to negotiate contract rates for them. That is unexceptional. The rates for contractors in the housing area relate to supply and demand factors and economic factors rather than the award rate. This legislation acknowledges that and simply enables harsh and unfair contracts to be dealt with, leaving everyone free to set whatever contracts they wish as long as those contracts do not offend the test of harshness or unfairness.

         —The Remuneration and Allowances Legislation Amendment Bill is an important piece of legislation, although it may not appear to be so simply on the face of it. The purpose of the Bill is to create a new salary structure for members of the Industrial Relations Commission. It removes the power of the Remuneration Tribunal to determine those salaries. It changes the structure of the Remuneration Tribunal and provides that the Chairman of that Tribunal shall no longer need to be a judge or a retired judge of a State court. It also disallows a decision of the Remuneration Tribunal relating to the salaries of the vice-chancellor and deputy vice-chancellors of the universities in Canberra.

         In normal circumstances, although the Opposition may be critical of legislation of this type it would not oppose it. But, in fact, this legislation has a purpose which goes far beyond the actual provisions that I have mentioned. This Bill has its genesis—I think that is the word the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has used—in what has become a very long and bitter controversy between the Industrial Relations Commission and the Government. The Government is allied with the ACTU, particularly Mr Kelty, in this bitter struggle that has been going on for more than two years. It is because this legislation is designed to undermine the status of the Industrial Relations Commission, rather than because of anything in particular that the Bill does, that the Opposition wishes to register its strong disapproval and will be voting against the second reading of this Bill.

         As I have said, this Bill goes back at least two years. The Minister himself acknowledged this in his second reading speech when he referred to a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal in May 1990 regarding judicial salaries which then included the salaries of the presidential members of the Industrial Relations Commission as well as commissioners. That decision in relation to judicial salaries displeased the Government and it made some changes in relation to judges' salaries. But it seems to have displeased the Government even more in relation to the salaries of the Industrial Relations Commission. Up until then, there had been a close nexus between the salaries paid to Federal Court judges and those paid to the presidential members of the Industrial Relations Commission. Following this decision, the Government broke that nexus—it changed the salaries that were allowed.

         The important thing from the point of view of this Bill is that the Government then signalled its disapproval of the decision by breaking this nexus between the salaries of the Industrial Relations Commission and those of the Federal Court. That created a great deal of concern because, as I have said, historically, that status for the presidential commissioners had been observed for many years. Naturally, this was seen not only by the presidential members but also by all the members of the Industrial Relations Commission as a denigration of the status which they had previously enjoyed.

         The Minister referred to events which followed this as `robust discussion'. We know from information that is already on the public record that that robust discussion has continued. Indeed, I will refer to some aspects of that in a moment. As a result of that, the Government set up a new advisory group, headed by Mr Gleeson, a former head of the New South Wales Premier's Department, to consider the structure of the Commission and how the new structure would be remunerated.

         The Commission's report was ultimately made to the Government and given effect to in the Parliament as amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. Again, I do not need to go into that aspect of it. But in Mr Gleeson's report, the committee made the very firm recommendation that the Government should seek to disallow a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal only if extraordinary circumstances arise, to which the Government responded that the need to maintain the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal is recognised and the Government accepts that it should seek to disallow determinations only in exceptional circumstances.

         The Remuneration Tribunal was asked to determine the new salary structure for the Industrial Relations Commission as a result of the legislation based on the Gleeson report. The Remuneration Tribunal did so to the extent that it felt it was able to, but it lacked certain information, for which the Government is responsible. The Government should have provided the further information that the Tribunal required. But instead of doing that, the Government simply brought in this legislation and has decided for itself, and is seeking approval of this Parliament for it, a new salary structure. By doing so, it is flying completely in the face of the recommendation of its own Gleeson committee that this should be done only in exceptional circumstances.

         The record, as I said, over the last two years has been one of major stand-off and conflict between the Government and the ACTU on the one side and the membership of the Industrial Relations Commission on the other. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has got into the act. In relation to the April 1991 national wage decision, Mr Keating, who was then the Treasurer, made the most derogatory comments to the effect that that decision had been made by just five officials and that the accord is the primary national income determining institution, not the Commission. There could not have been a more offensive attitude by this Government to the Commission than that now infamous expression of the Prime Minister himself.

         The whole treatment of the Commission over this period of more than two years now is all indicative of the same attitude officially held by the Government towards the Commission. It is really hypocritical in the extreme that the Minister at the table, Senator Cook, who introduced this legislation, has come in and made these statements about his own views or those of the Government on the Industrial Relations Commission. In his second reading speech, he says that the Industrial Relations Commission should continue to have a central role in the industrial and economic life of the nation. I will not quote it all but he goes on to say:

In fact, the Minister himself has probably been less guilty than the Prime Minister and, indeed, the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, both of whom have continued to denigrate the Commission and its role.

It does not happen overnight and it is not caused by one event or one statement.

         Finally, my third and most compelling reason for resigning is your Government's total lack of understanding of and respect for the Constitutional requirements of Section 51(xxxv) of the Constitution. There have been five referenda directed at altering this provision. All have failed. The Industrial Relations power is therefore in the same terms as when originally drafted in 1900. The AIRC has been established under S.51 (xxxv) and its jurisdiction and power is limited by the Section as interpreted by the High Court. For my part I have been directly involved in two cases which have contributed to a significant expansion of the Commonwealth's power in this area. I refer to Turbet's case (144 CLR 335) and the Social Welfare case (153 CLR 299) where I was a member of the Full Bench whose decision went to the High Court.

I presume that the Government will say, `But our legislation restores a nexus'. However, it is not restoring the nexus of the past. The Government has rejected the Remuneration Tribunal's decision which had retained that nexus in the past.

         As I said, this has been a longstanding problem. The Government's new salary structure, although it now establishes a new nexus between Federal Court salaries, does so only at the level of new senior deputy presidents. The ordinary deputy presidents—or presidential members as they are generally known—will have a reduced salary which will be 95 per cent of the Federal Court salary. That may not seem to be a very large sum of money, but it is indicative of the attitude of the Government to express its displeasure with decisions that have been made by the Commission, such as the 1991 national wage case decision and others.

It changes a decision of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to salaries of vice-chancellors and deputy vice-chancellors of Canberra universities. The Opposition would not normally be concerned about that, but we have adopted the policy that these matters should be determined in future not by the Remuneration Tribunal, not by this Parliament and certainly not by this Government, but by contractual arrangements entered into by the universities and their staff. They should not be part of decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal. They should not be treated in that way.

Whether that is due to this legislation is perhaps uncertain, but it is certainly the case that the Chairman of the Tribunal is no longer prepared to continue in that role.

         The Democrats believe that a strong and independent Commission is central to the optimum functioning of Australia's industrial relations system. It is the Commission's performance which defines its standing in the community, not the levels of salary paid to its officers. It is the security of tenure which guarantees that commissioners should not have their independence compromised by threats to their employment. Unfortunately, this Bill has been tainted by the power mongering of some members of the industrial relations community and the petulance of one former member of the Commission.

         I remind the Senate that section 72(iii) of the Constitution provides that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to fix the salaries of judges. In this Bill the Government is seeking to establish a salary link between judges and members of the Commission appropriate to their responsibilities. Just picking up what Senator Durack was saying, I interpolate that that is absolutely essential at a time of recession, when it is very important that the lid be kept on unrestrained claims for salary increases.

         —I am pleased to have that interjection because the Liberal and National parties have been very open about their intention to dismantle the IRC. The hypocrisy of Senator Durack a moment ago talking about the IRC is remarkable in view of the coalition's declared intention to remove it altogether. Its distortions concerning the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, even referring to it as the subcontractors' legislation, made it absolutely clear that its opposition to this legislation is based on its desire to prevent a workable system of salary determination being instituted. The Opposition wants to politicise the salary levels of the Commission in order to belittle the IRC. It desires an annual wages brawl so as to degrade the Commission's standing and authority with regard to other wage determinations made on behalf of Australian workers.

         I acknowledge that these salary levels are reductions of the Tribunal's recommendations. But we should also acknowledge that the Opposition is hypocritical in its support for big wages for commissioners, in light of the wage restraint being asked of other Australians, and also given its attitude to the IRC and its commitment to removing the IRC altogether. I understand that the commissioners' wages are about $134,000 a year and by no stretch of the imagination could be regarded as low incomes.

         This Bill also proposes to alter the salaries of vice-chancellors at the Australian National University and the University of Canberra. Other universities will pay much more in salaries and allowances than these institutions. The Australian National University and the University of Canberra may well be disadvantaged when seeking high quality applicants for these positions. While the Government has indicated that it will adjust funding to other institutions to compensate for these salary reductions at the ANU and the University of Canberra, it is a clumsy and unfortunate way to establish wage ceilings for vice-chancellors. It also leaves it at the discretion of the universities to decide to spend their budget allocations on higher salaries instead of on more student housing or course funding.

I note that the Bill leaves open the opportunity for the Remuneration Tribunal to recommend adjustment of these wages in the future.

         In April last year, the ACTU president, Martin Ferguson, said the ACTU would "work through" a national wage decision by the Industrial Relations Commission which rejected the ACTU's Accord VI deal but allowed a 2.5 per cent pay rise in the middle of a recession. When Mr Kelty returned from a trip to London, he flatly rejected the wage decision and spearheaded a vicious campaign against it.

        That is the basis of this Bill. Senator Coulter has come in here and argued—and previous statements by the Australian Democrats have shown that they have long argued, if anything, for an increased role for the IRC—that this Bill reinforces the status and independence of the IRC. He does not have to believe me; he has only to listen to the words of people who are on the bench. Later in my remarks I shall seek to table a confidential letter which was sent to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) on 21 April which I think makes pretty clear the views of at least eight of the deputy presidents of the IRC.

         Senator Cook ceaselessly comes into this chamber and urges us, as Senator Durack says, to accept the umpire's decision. It is interesting that Senator Cook's own view is that he will accept the umpire's decision only when it accords with his own views. It is now a matter of public record that Senator Cook attacked the IRC over the April 1991 national wage case decision. He was, of course, echoing, as I have said, Mr Bill Kelty who suggested that Justice Maddern—and I quote Mr Kelty at the time—`may see himself as some form of Fidel Castro'. This is an astonishing attack by the ACTU on the leader of the IRC.

I have to cite only the building and waterfront examples. On each occasion, the IRC stood firm against the Cook-Kelty efforts to institute the $12 pay rise. Senator Cook in another example failed to support the IRC decision on the APPM dispute.

Yet, in what must be the irony of ironies, Senator Cook urges the coalition to accept the umpire's decision and has the cheek to criticise the coalition for its advocacy of a more limited role for the IRC. I think that gives the lie to Senator Coulter's view that we wish to abolish the IRC. The coalition does not wish to abolish the IRC. The IRC will certainly have a role under the industrial relations policy outlined by John Howard.

         Just to demonstrate the point, recall that Senator Cook wrote to the Remuneration Tribunal to support the maintenance of the current salary structure while the Gleeson inquiry took place. Does Senator Cook recall that letter? Just days later, Senator Cook reneged on this decision as a result of ACTU pressure. The Remuneration Tribunal, another umpire, exposed a lack of merit in the Government's case and decided in favour of an increase. Again Kelty intervened and now the Government has moved to legislate.

         As a result of the actions of Senator Cook, I believe, the entire Remuneration Tribunal resigned.

Ken Turbet was the third longest serving member of the Commission and prior to his appointment to the Commission he spent 16 years of service to the trade union movement and was a member of the ALP for 20 years. In resigning, Ken Turbet said the Government could not be relied on to keep its word in relation to the IRC. Secondly, he argued that Senator Cook and the Government had damaged the public perception of the independence and integrity of the IRC. Finally, Ken Turbet pointed out that the Government had failed to uphold the requirements of the Constitution in relation to the industrial relations power.

I make no comments on their ability or independence, but I express the hope that they have the same fierce independence as the members of the Commission who signed the letter on 21 April. It was a pity that none of the four Deputy Presidents who have an ACTU background—Deputy President Marsh, Mr Justice Boulton, Deputy President MacBean and Deputy President Watson—signed the letter. One hopes that they have made their own views known to the Government in the same strong terms as did those who signed the letter of 21 April. Mr Howard has made his concerns known about there being a further appointment to the IRC from the ACTU. I believe that such an appointment will create enormous controversy and increase fears in the community about the independence of the IRC.

         I have indicated that this Bill comes before the Parliament today because it stems from a failure of the IRC to implement the accord mark VI of April 1991. This decision led to an attack on the Commission and a desire to undermine its authority. This is part of the pay-back policy beloved of the ACTU. The plain fact of the matter is that the IRC has not been totally compliant with the wishes of the Government and the ACTU. It is, of course, our view that in a number of areas the IRC should have made a number of different decisions. Nevertheless, the IRC, expressing its statutory independence, has refused to rubber stamp the accord processes. Mr Keating, our Prime Minister, warned the IRC to rethink its approach or face being `run over, bypassed or materially damaged'. That comes from a man who said, `We have the Reserve Bank in our pocket. We have the Treasury in our pocket'. Essentially, this Bill is yet another attempt to put the IRC in the Government's pocket.

         Our history has been always, and without variation, to have respect for the decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission in the end, whether or not we disagree with them. The very institution of the Industrial Relations Commission is a creation of earlier labour struggles in the broader labour movement last century, out of the disputes in 1891, that gave rise to the call for a better way of settling industrial conflict, and it is a major labour constitutional reform.

The wolf in sheep's clothing debate that we have just heard would, to the passing observer, appear to be saying that the greatest defenders of this institution are members of the Opposition, when we know that under their Fightback proposals their intent is to abolish the Commission, remove the umpire and introduce the law of contract between individuals and employers with a resort to the common law.

        Dear Commissioner Turbet
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have received your letter of 14 April advising of your intention to resign as a member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That is your decision and one which I understand has been anticipated for some time. I wish you well in your retirement but I have to say there a number of wrong assertions in your letter that must be corrected.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If you held these views, I am surprised that you never approached me or the Government to put them or to seek an explanation of the Government's position before taking the action you have. The role of the Commission and the perception of this role by its members are too important to let these wrong notions stand.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        First, you assert that "the Government cannot be relied upon to keep its word". You cite the reason as the alleged about-face on the Gleeson Committee's recommendation that the Government should only seek to disallow Remuneration Tribunal Determinations "in exceptional circumstances". Your assertion just cannot be substantiated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Gleeson Review was a full and open inquiry into the structure of the Commission. It was undertaken by Mr Gerry Gleeson, former head of the NSW Premier's Department, Mr Justice Olsson, a Supreme Court Justice of South Australia and former head of the South Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and Professor Alan Fels, then Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority. It was broadly representative and its findings were unanimous.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The restructuring of the Commission the Review proposed was endorsed by the Government and agreed by the Parliament in 1991. The positions of Vice-President and Senior Deputy Presidents were established in that process and agreed by the Parliament. The Remuneration Tribunal failed to fulfil its responsibility to determine rates of pay for all Commission positions as requested by the Government. This was exceptional and has been a substantial influence on the Government's decision to present legislation to the Parliament to change the Tribunal's determinations and to establish a more certain basis for future determination of remuneration of members of the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation which has now been introduced will provide levels of remuneration for the full range of positions on the Commission. In addition, it will provide salary increases commensurate with those received by the Australian community at large as a result of National Wage Case Decisions. There are very few in the Australian community who would not see this as appropriate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Second, I absolutely refute your assertion that I or the Government have taken any action which has damaged either the credibility of the Commission or the public's perception of its independence and integrity. As I have previously stated without qualification to Justice Maddern, both the Government's policy and its public comments have always made clear that a strong and independent Commission is central to its vision of Australian's industrial relations system into the future.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Gleeson Committee Review and the Government's endorsement of its recommendations were predicated explicitly on the importance of preserving the status and independence of the Commission. Indeed, doubts had already been raised about that standing. The establishment of the Gleeson Review reflected the Government's determination to ensure that those doubts would be quickly set aside through a complete and open examination of the Commission's structure.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is simply not the case that the public's perception of the Commission is affected by the amount of money paid to its members. It is the Commission's capacity to do its job, and the way in which it does it, that determines the respect with which it is held in the community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Frankly, I find it bizarre that Parliament's exercise of its legislative power to pronounce on Remuneration Tribunal decisions should be seen as threatening the independence of anybody. I note, for instance, that the Constitution itself (Section 72(iii)) provides that the Parliament fix the remuneration of judges. This constitutional duty of the Parliament in no way threatens, in fact or in appearance, the independence of the judiciary. That the exercise of such Parliamentary power in relation to non-judges—such as members of the Commission—should be thought to be such a threat defies all logic and commonsense.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Constitution provides judicial remuneration ultimately to be the responsibility of the Parliament. The Government is legislating to re-establish a salary link between judges and members of the Commission. This in practice enshrines ultimate responsibility on the Parliament for the remuneration of members of the Commission. The Remuneration Tribunal was established in 1973 and from its inception its operations have contained provisions which allow the Parliament to have the final word. It has been the common view within the Parliament that this is the way in which the Tribunal should operate. Comments by the Opposition during the Parliamentary debate over the Remuneration and Allowances Bill in 1991 made clear their continued commitment to principles which have been adhered to since 1973.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Decisions of the Tribunal have not been accepted by the Parliament on seven occasions since its establishment. It is clear that the power of ultimate decision of the Parliament has been seen by both sides of politics not as a theoretical power but as one that can and should be utilised on appropriate occasions. And it is not as though the Parliament's power has been used only or predominantly in relation to members of the Commission. It has, in fact, been mainly used in relation to overturning salaries for members of Parliament. It has also been used in relation to senior public servants and vice-chancellors of universities. Has it ever been seriously suggested that the independence of these people has thereby been compromised?
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is, of course, grotesque that anyone should suggest that members of the Commission—or other senior officials or statutory office-holders—would allow their independence or judgement to be affected by matters of remuneration of this kind. I cannot believe that members of the Commission would be so affected and it is beyond my understanding that people should have tried to suggest that there is a perception that they would have been.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Third, I am bemused by your suggestion that I "could at least be seen to be standing by the Commission, showing support for the principles of conciliation and arbitration". I just cannot understand what you are referring to—unless you are confusing the Government's support for workplace bargaining with a lack of support for the principles of conciliation and arbitration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If this is the case, it is just not right to suggest that support for workplace bargaining and the encouragement of employers and unions to reach agreement about terms and conditions of employment amount to a lack of support for the Commission and the abandonment of the principles of conciliation and arbitration. The Commission itself, through its most recent National Wage Decision, has recognised that the economy must move towards greater workplace bargaining.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is the Government's recognition of the Commission's central role in ensuring equity and fairness in workplace agreements that is central here. The Commission's role is integral to the legislative changes the Government has in mind. Moreover, the legislation will strengthen the Commission's role and expand its jurisdiction to deal with disputes involving independent contractors. This is a tangible statement of the importance the Government gives to a strong and independent role for the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        By way of contrast, I refer you to the most recent statements by the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, who said in Auckland this week that, under the Opposition's industrial relations policies, the Commission "will become increasingly less relevant". That is the real threat to the role and independence of the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Fourth, the delay in filling a number of vacancies on the Commission is directly due to the establishment of the new structure for it and to the further legislation now in the Parliament affecting it. A number of appointments will be made in the near future. Any speculation about the identity of proposed appointees is regrettable, but such speculation does not emanate from the Government. I note, by way of interest, that much of the recent media speculation over the remuneration issue has likewise been generated elsewhere—and not in government, or apparently even union, circles.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I take your references to Section 51(xxxv) of the Constitution to be intended to demonstrate the constitutional recognition of the place of an independent arbitral tribunal in the federal system of industrial relations. As I have said, the Government accepts and recognises this role. Indeed, the Constitution provides the basis for its protection by the High Court. You imply that this role for the Commission is compromised by the Government's proposals on remuneration, by media speculation about appointments and by disagreement by the Government over some Commission decisions. I do not see how such an implication could reasonably be accepted on any impartial judgement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, I agree absolutely that an institution of such national importance as the Industrial Relations Commission—whose decisions affect every Australian worker—must have the respect of Government, those workers affected by it and the community generally. No action taken by the Government has been intended to—or would be intended to—diminish the integrity or the independence of the Commission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am sorry that you have felt the need to respond in the way you have and to retire early from the Commission. But it is important that it be appreciated that the Government cannot accept the reasoning you have given for your decision.

The Government's undertaking was that we would abide by determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal, which is not, as has been styled here, the umpire; in this sense, Parliament is the umpire with respect to the proceedings of the Remuneration Tribunal.

As was its prerogative—and I do not object to it—it overturned decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal, as we now propose to overturn one. But we gave our undertaking that we would only do so if there were exceptional circumstances. What are the circumstances? The circumstance which we regard as exceptional in this case is that this Parliament had decided on a range of positions on the Industrial Relations Commission.

         Two of those positions—Vice-President and Senior Deputy President of the Commission—were sent to the Remuneration Tribunal for a salary to be determined. The Remuneration Tribunal, for reasons that I still cannot fathom, decided not to determine a salary for those positions. This means that I, as the Minister, on behalf of this Government, am not in a position to invite any person to fill the vacancies created by this Parliament for those positions. One cannot invite someone to accept an appointment for which there is no salary. That, therefore, effectively negates the will of this Parliament.

         This Parliament's will was expressed, whether the Opposition approved of it or not, in the creation of those two positions. The failure of the Remuneration Tribunal to set a salary means that we cannot invite anyone to fill those positions. I think that by any fair and objective test that is a circumstance which is exceptional. It is for that reason and that reason alone that we have proposed to overturn the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal and to set salaries at the level recommended to us by the Gleeson report—as has been remarked in this debate, an independent report, free of any influence of government, and a report that we have adopted.

         —I am running out of time to make a full explanation, but I am convinced that a full explanation will not change Senator Patterson's prejudices. Let me go to the Gleeson Committee. The Gleeson Committee comprised three distinguished Australians: Gerry Gleeson, who is a former head of the Premier's Department in New South Wales, Professor Alan Fels, who is the Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority and a distinguished economics professor, and Judge Olsson, who is a judge of the South Australian Supreme Court and a former President of the South Australian Industrial Relations Commission. They were unanimous, as an independent body, in recommending a structure and scale of rates to this Government. As I say, we sent that whole report to the Remuneration Tribunal, which then did not set those salaries for the Vice-President and for the Senior Deputy President. It is on that basis that Parliament must fill the vacuum.

         To style the Remuneration Tribunal as the umpire in this area is erroneous—that is, of course, well known in the case of the Opposition—because the Remuneration Tribunal is an advisory body. All of its determinations come here for allowance or disallowance. The structure of this body is to advise. If not disallowed, its determinations become law. But, if disallowed, Parliament will decide by virtue of overruling those decisions. That is all we are doing in this case.

         As to the independence of the Tribunal, the fundamental and most sacrosanct thing of all is that the Industrial Relations Tribunal be free to exercise its jurisdiction in a way in which it is respected by all parties in the community and not interfered with by government or by anyone else. This legislation does not do that. We are basing ourselves on the findings of what the right level of remuneration is by an independent body that considered all of the evidence and made that recommendation.

         The Opposition wants to make access to the Industrial Relations Commission a voluntary act in which both parties have to agree—the employer and the employee. So, if an employer withholds consent, there is no resort to the umpire and no ability for the arbitrator to make a fair determination. That amounts to undermining the total institution. It is fundamental hypocrisy to pretend otherwise. It is fundamentally fraudulent for Opposition members to argue that they are somehow the protectors of this institution while they hold a commitment to those views. I commend the Bill to the Senate and trust that it will pass on the numbers.

         —The Australian Government is delighted by the news that Presidents Bush and Yeltsin have announced agreement to major further cuts in their strategic arsenals beyond the reductions that were anticipated and agreed in the START talks. While some details have yet to be clarified, it is clear that the two leaders have given very positive effect to their unilateral statements in January offering to negotiate deep cuts beyond the START agreement limits.

         Today's announcement focuses in particular, and very encouragingly in that respect, on heavy and multiple warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles. According to President Bush, at the latest by 2003 the US and Russia are to cut their strategic nuclear systems to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each. That is significantly below the level agreed to in START, which was approximately 6,000 warheads each.

         The current arsenals of the two are estimated at, in total, approximately 21,000 strategic warheads. In addition, of course, there are some 8,000 tactical nuclear warheads in existence between the two of them, or there will be after the presently agreed, or presently identified, unilateral cuts are carried through. The announcement does represent a dramatic and extremely welcome reduction in nuclear armories. But beyond that it also gives clear expression to the significantly improved security relationship between the two nuclear superpowers.

         It is too early, I think, to comment on the prospects for further reductions. We have heard the remarks attributed to President Yeltsin that the scope for further cuts will be limited by practical difficulties associated with destruction schedules. While such practical issues do need to be acknowledged, we are encouraged that the timeframe for reduction to the agreed levels does appear to be based on the tightest possible destruction schedule.

         In the case of the other nuclear weapon states—the UK, France and China—I think this is an appropriate occasion for the Australian Government to call on them, as I now do, to follow the example of Russia and the United States and to start the process of implementing cuts in their nuclear arsenals. We do not accept that the smaller size of their arsenals in any way frees them from their continuing obligation to negotiate measures of nuclear disarmament. In this context, we consider also that a cessation of nuclear testing is an essential component of nuclear disarmament, and we call on the UK, the United States and China, as a first step, to follow France and Russia in their current moratorium on testing.

         Such a universal moratorium leading to a comprehensive test ban treaty would achieve a longstanding Australian policy objective, quite apart from anything else, and contribute in a practical way to the process of nuclear disarmament which has been given, again I say, such a welcome further impetus by today's agreement between the United States and Russia.

I refer the Minister to his claim yesterday that the Foreign Investment Review Board application `in respect of the companies concerned' in the Keating multi-million dollar, multinational joint pig venture was approved without any public announcement on Christmas Eve of 1991, five days after Paul Keating became Prime Minister—happy Christmas, Mr Keating! How was it possible for this project to receive such unpublicised approval when it was not until a meeting in Denmark on 3 March 1992, more than two months later, that the Danpork board agreed to confirm Australia as an investment location, to finalise joint venture arrangements with a local producer, the Brown and Hatton group, and to nominate a site for a processing plant? As there was not even an agreed site for a processing plant in this $80m joint venture in December, let alone an agreement with a joint venturer, can the Minister give an unequivocal assurance that the FIRB approval that the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, gave to Mr Keating as a Christmas present on 24 December was for the same joint venture proposal that was not even agreed in outline until April 1992, more than three months later, and which is still the subject of three weeks of negotiation so far in Denmark by Mr Keating's nominee on the board of Euphron, Mr Stephen Coudounaris?

         —This is pretty desperate stuff but, after yesterday's effort, one is not surprised. If those opposite want to understand the history of the Foreign Investment Review Board treatment of the proposed joint venture between Danpork and Brown and Hatton, let me say that the Board received an application on 26 August 1991. Approval was granted by the then Treasurer on 28 September 1991 and the parties were advised on 2 October 1991. An application for variation, which was a matter I referred to yesterday, was lodged on 5 December and dealt with on 23 December. The parties were advised on 24 December.

         First of all, Senator Baume asked the question, `Why was it unpublicised?'. The Foreign Investment Review Board deals with many applications and many approvals. They are not, unless they are hugely significant in terms of the size of the foreign investment and so on, matters which receive publicity; that is something which any one of those opposite ought to know and understand.

         Senator Baume clearly also does not understand that applications for Foreign Investment Review Board approval are frequently made by companies, and they are made on the basis of various other things happening subsequent to approval being given. It is an application for foreign investment in a particular project. All sorts of things usually have to be resolved before a project in any one of those cases goes ahead. There is nothing abnormal about that. Only Senator Baume could try to see some abnormality in this matter. The Leader of the Opposition has cast Senator Baume in the role of asking these questions in return for a position on the Opposition front bench. Those opposite ask these questions in here because they are apparently not game to ask them in the House of Representatives.

         Anand is a widely respected civilian figure. He was interim Prime Minister after the February 1991 coup. In that period he established a reputation as a principled leader, committed to transparent government independent from outside influences, particularly the military. He has made it very clear that he will serve only in the capacity of Prime Minister of an interim government for an interim period in order to preside over the formal dissolution of the Parliament and the holding of fresh elections, which should take place in about four months time. His new Cabinet is more or less identical to the 1991 interim Cabinet. I particularly welcome the return of Arsa Sarasin as interim Foreign Minister. He played a valuable role in the interim Government.

However, in view of the Prime Minister's obvious belief that payroll tax relief will assist his business, is Senator Button again at odds with his Prime Minister following his answer to me yesterday that he—that is, Senator Button—does not think payroll tax abolition would provide a solution to the horrendous level of unemployment that his Government's policies have provided?

         The changes that the Senate enacted just before lunch to section 155 of the Federal Act will ensure that there will now be a flood of workplace agreements. I can only trust that they will be based on the sort of agreement that has been reached between the Finance Sector Union and the National Australia Bank, which covers some 23,000 workers in that institution. That is a fine example of the type of workplace change—without conflict, with consensus and with cooperation—that this Government identifies as the positive way forward in this country for workplace change.

         The National Australia Bank is a significant banking institution in the finance sector in Australia. It, too, has transposed the cooperative mentality and approach in the workplace. In our system of workplace bargaining, in cooperation with and through the union structure, it has negotiated an agreement which has now been registered in the Industrial Relations Commission. That agreement, which introduces innovation in how working hours are to be organised, will ensure a productivity increase for the company which will be shared by the workers in that company.

         The facet of this agreement that is particularly engaging is that full time workers of this company can now choose how they work their hours, as long as they work a total of 38 in their working week and as long as they meet their job demands. The bank has introduced a process called Flexinet, which ensures that the work is carried out but in a way which suits the family responsibilities and obligations of its employees. This company, National Australia Bank, won the Affirmative Action Agency award in the work and family category because of its in-house policies which ensure that workers who have family and child caring responsibilities are able to adapt their working days to meet those responsibilities as well as their work responsibilities.

         I have been asked how this relates to APPM. In the course of the APPM dispute, we saw great conflict as authoritarian management tried to impose change on its workers without appropriate consultation. Because of the Government's action, with the Tasmanian Government, we got the matter into the Industrial Relations Commission where, for the moment at least, it has been settled. What we have here is a conflict of style: on behalf of the National Australia Bank, cooperation; on behalf of APPM, conflict. APPM's style is that of the Opposition.

Earlier in Question Time, Senator Alston referred to debate in the press today about the impact of the superannuation levy package on low income earners—the sudden natural constituency of the coalition. Firstly, does the Government support the view that a flat rate as opposed to a percentage rate increase in a national wage decision achieves the objective of benefiting low income earners?

Unfortunately, I am sure they have not found the performance of the Opposition very engaging today. However, as to the question from Senator Kernot, of course it is a matter of fact that a flat rate wage increase benefits lower paid workers by virtue of the fact that they get the full amount of the increase. A percentage wage increase means that because their wages are lower they get a lower outcome.

         I will give an example of what I mean. In accord mark VI we negotiated with the ACTU a $12 flat rate increase payable from the middle of last year. That went to the Industrial Relations Commission and in April of last year the Commission overruled the accord submission and instituted a 2.5 per cent wage increase. I have constantly said in this place that the Government's attitude to the Industrial Relations Commission is that we sometimes disagree with its decisions but we fight to the death for its right to make them. This was one of those decisions with which we disagreed.

         We believed that, as a matter of public equity and social equity, it would have been far better to have awarded a flat rate increase to meet the needs of lower paid workers than to have gone to a percentage increase. I will give the figures. To someone earning $18,000 a year, a $12 increase represents a 3.5 per cent increase per week; but for someone earning $60,000 a year, a $12 increase represents an increase of only 1 per cent per week. So in terms of the Labor Government trying to get some equity for lower paid workers, the flat rate increase was a significant measure which we supported.

         In her second question Senator Kernot asked whether we would consider supporting a flat rate increase in the next wage round. It is too early to say what the nature of a wage claim will be and whether or not we will actually have a flat rate component to it. It is certainly a matter for consideration because we are concerned about meeting the requirements of lower paid workers, but we will need to talk shortly with the ACTU about the nature of its wage claims. In those discussions we will consider what the right way is of meeting the needs of wage earners in this country.

         I might add that this does highlight one important difference between the Government and the Opposition, that is, we do support national wage cases. We support them because they do make adjustments to wages across the board in this country and they are a vehicle for dealing with the equity dimension of wage fixation. That is in contradistinction to the Opposition, which wants to abandon national wage case increases and leave ordinary workers in the grips of the market, negotiating wage increases directly with their employers within the structure of common law and, outside that, of the Industrial Relations Commission.

We believe in providing public support through the taxpayer and through the Medicare system so that all Australians can obtain the best possible health care.

         —I did see that particular program. I think it was two Mondays ago. It was very sobering viewing indeed. I think we all know that police are placed in positions of particular peril, great hazard to their lives in various instances, where they have to confront those who are carrying out a crime or are threatening the lives of others. But at the same time I think it has to be acknowledged that there is widespread community concern about the use of deadly force by police forces. In that situation the Police Ministers Council has responded by putting down minimum guidelines to be implemented by all commissioners to regulate the use of such force.

         In particular, I have been most concerned since the findings of the inquiry into the shooting of David Gundy in New South Wales, when the police made forcible entry and shot him. The National Committee on Violence also expressed its concern that there should at least be minimum guidelines nationwide regulating the use of lethal force by police; that is, in situations where they intend to kill, or certainly to inflict very serious bodily injury on a person who, as I say, is perhaps in the course of carrying out a crime or threatening the lives of others.

         The commissioners and the police Ministers have agreed that there ought to be very strict guidelines making it clear that the use of such force is indeed a last resort, only to be used where there is immediate threat to life. What has to accompany such guidelines, of course, is much better training processes so that police in these various squads or in general are psychologically, as well as physically, prepared to undertake the sorts of split-second judgments that have to be made in many of these situations of quite considerable peril.

        AWARD RESTRUCTURING FOR   CATHOLlC SCHOOLS
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator Boswell about the funding of award restructuring for teachers in Catholic schools. I now wish to add further to the information provided at Question Time yesterday. The following answer has been provided by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Minister Beazley.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is aware of the concerns of the Queensland Catholic Education Office. However, contrary to what Senator Boswell has alleged, the Federal Government has met its share of award restructuring for teachers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Award Restructuring Assistance Program (ARAP) commenced operation in 1991 to pay the Commonwealth share of costs arising from teacher award restructuring. Key elements of this in 1991 were the move to a national benchmark salary of $38 000 and the introduction of Advanced Skills Teachers (ASTs) to provide a career path for classroom teachers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since 1990 Catholic systems have benefited directly in line with real increases in teachers' salaries i.e. Catholic systems were paid $2 million in 1990, $19.7 million in 1991, with an estimated allocation of $27.3 million for 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        ARAP operated differently between States and school sectors in recognition of their different stages of moving towards the benchmark. Schools and systems are reimbursed according to actual wage movements rather than lagged average national movements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        this has been of particular benefit to systems such as the NSW Catholics which moved to the benchmark and introduced ASTs quickly and the Queensland Catholics where the benchmark adjustment was large.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Catholic sector has argued that the Commonwealth's share under ARAP should be 50 per cent of actual costs as Commonwealth general recurrent grants account for 50 per cent of Catholic systems actual operating expenditure. The Commonwealth contribution for most Catholic systems is 41 per cent which equates to the category 10 percentage share of the community standard—the benchmark for Commonwealth funding for non-government schools. The Government has not given any commitment to meet the higher percentage.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        By providing differential funding the Commonwealth has allowed non-government systems to progress their award restructuring agendas (in advance of government systems) and receive appropriate Commonwealth compensation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The other items—workers compensation, holiday leave loading, superannuation and long service leave—mentioned by the Honourable Senator yesterday are on-costs. They are not included in the Schools Price Index which supplements general recurrent grants. The Catholic education authorities have already been informed that, consistent with government policy in respect of the supplementation of recurrent grants through the Schools Price Index, these on-costs have also not been included in ARAP funding.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Federal funding for non-government schools falls largely into two programs: capital grants and recurrent (per capita) grants. Capital funding is currently under review and allocations for future years will be determined in the Budget. Recurrent grants have been announced through to the Year 2000 to enable non-government schools to plan their future with confidence.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If elected the Hewson Government will be struggling to pay for the package of measures associated with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). As personal income tax cuts and family allowance increases are essential measures to alleviate the negative impact of the GST on family incomes, schools funding will take a low priority.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A Hewson Government would, at best, be able to deliver the promised increases for non-government schools on a greatly modified scale.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As the Liberals' proposed restructuring of funding categories will favour schools in Categories 1 and 2, Catholic systems (which are funded at Category 10, and Category 11 in WA) are likely to receive significantly less than they have been promised in a scaled-down version of the Liberals' funding arrangements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Opposition's package also threatens to re-open the State Aid debate by reducing funds to States and Territories while promising significant funding increases to non-government schools.

        </emphasis>
        's promised 5% cut in grants to States and Territories will inevitably be passed on to State School systems. The Hewson Government would simultaneously increase funding to non-government schools—a move which would be interpreted publicly as a major resource shift from the government to the non-government schools sector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This blatant departure from needs-based funding may well invite questions about the legitimacy of Federal funding for private schools and re-open the State Aid debate. The question of State Aid was successfully laid to rest by the Labor Government in 1985 when it introduced the present funding scheme based on twelve categories of need. Revisiting this issue would be divisive and destructive to the instability of all non-government schools in years to come.

It concerns the important matter of the rate at which interest is charged for calculating provisional tax at the present time, given that the Treasury is still charging it at 10 per cent when interest rates have dramatically dropped. This matter is of extreme importance to a lot of taxpayers, especially as their interest and income have dropped significantly with the drop in interest rates.

I am not talking about selling a block of land that he might own; I am not talking about selling the house that he might have owned before he became Prime Minister; I am not even talking about restoring or improving a house that he owns.

          Senator Lewis seeks to suspend Standing Orders, firstly, on the basis of an answer to a question which I gave—the question dealt specifically with alleged failure by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to register a conflict of interest, an allegation which fell a little flat—and, secondly, on the basis of a number of questions relating to a company called Danpork and another company and their fee of application. On the basis of that issue, Senator Lewis seeks to suspend Standing Orders to raise a whole new set of issues which have not been comprehended even by his colleagues in the Liberal Party. Certainly, in relation to the question of registration of interests, they have been opposed by his Party.

I take it that he is taking it a step further in relation to Prime Ministers because he wants to hitch on the wagon of Senator Baume in seeking to make his point. I think it would be a very good idea for him to come back on the adjournment debate some night and tell all of us his new views about the matter. Starting as he did with President Bush, I think he should examine the actual situation in the United States before he puts that forward as a model for Australian Prime Ministers.

Looking at the history of this country, the honourable senator suggested that, if he had screwed his courage to the sticking place with this issue in the time of the Fraser Government, he would have told Mr Fraser that he should put his farm in the hands of trustees—the very thing which the honourable senator's colleagues objected to in the pecuniary interests committee inquiry a few years ago.

If this sort of issue has to be debated continually we will be telling him what he ought to do now under the guidelines which currently exist. But let me say that it is totally unrelated to the sorts of questions which the hatchet man here, Senator Baume, has been pursuing in the Senate on behalf of his Leader in the lower House. Senator Lewis's proposition is just not relevant in terms of the suspension of Standing Orders and I hope that the Senate will deal with the matter quickly.

         —I think Senator Button needs to be reminded of what is at issue. In support of the points that have been made by my colleague to suspend Standing Orders, I think it is important to point out the following: firstly, the investment concerned had been camouflaged. The points that Senator Button makes with regard to the registration question being opposed or not opposed by honourable senators on this side of the chamber is irrelevant. We have often said and have said again that it is meaningless, just as it has been shown to be on this occasion.

         The second point is that it is half a million dollars that is involved. Despite Mr Keating's assertion that half a million dollars is only a small amount of money, to most Australians it is a very large amount of money. The third thing is that it is a particular industry which is subject to decision making by the Government of the day. The Government is in the position to make a decision which will either advantage or disadvantage Mr Keating in a personal financial manner. That relates to the question of the so-called dumping of pig meat onto the market. One could say that, if indeed other piggeries were put out of business before the regulations were changed, Mr Keating would be very definitely advantaged and that there would be a virtual monopoly on the market for that meat.

Further than that, we have the FIRB, which has been quite crucial in this matter. Of course, all the people in the FIRB worked for the Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer. Indeed, to say that this matter is full of improprieties is to put it mildly. Senator Baume has put the case perfectly well. He has put it in an important way. Senator Button has chosen to answer it—

I would have been much more impressed if a virulent young Senator Lewis, with ambitions unfulfilled—that is not his fault; it is no reflection on him—had made this strong speech in 1976 or 1977. There are two issues involved here: potential conflict of interest and conflict of interest. It is always a problem in these matters.

         There are at least six areas where the conflict of interest of the Prime Minister has emerged with regard to this $500,000 investment in the pig industry that he has developed during the time he was Treasurer last year and during the time that he has been Prime Minister. The first area is in regard to the investment possibly being a loan of $500,000. If he has a loan of $500,000, it is clear that it is to his personal advantage that interest rates be low. To the extent that he may, in his public capacity, seek to see interest rates lowered, it is a matter not only of personal interest to him, but it is clear to the public that there is a potential conflict of interest in the Prime Minister's decisions about interest rates or foreign investment.

         A third area is that visitors from foreign countries come to visit the Prime Minister, such as a Minister from the Government of Denmark. We are told that, in that discussion, the Prime Minister can take his hat off as Prime Minister and speak as Paul Keating. Senator Button, who represents this Government as Leader of the Government in the Senate, says that the Prime Minister was not speaking to him as the Prime Minister, but as a private citizen of this country. He cannot maintain that distinction. The Prime Minister was speaking in his public capacity as Prime Minister to gain a personal advantage of the $500,000 investment that he has in the pig industry.

         A fourth area is the pig industry. The Prime Minister is a competitor with others in the pig industry. Many of those competitors are going broke at the moment; they are suffering a depressed price for pig meat. The reason is that there is an alleged dumping of Canadian pig meat in this country, underselling the Australian price. Into that vacuum, into that area where a lot of pig producers in Australia are going broke, moves the Prime Minister of this country for a personal advantage through the use of his public position.

         A fifth area is payroll tax. Senator Short asked a question today about the particular advantage the Prime Minister enjoys in being involved in an investment which is exempt from payroll tax. How do we know what influence the Prime Minister may have had to gain that exemption from the New South Wales Government? The sixth area is the registration of company details. There is a requirement for the Prime Minister to register. I put it to those opposite that the required details were not on the register of pecuniary interests of the Prime Minister as is required of Ministers of this Government. Who would have guessed, by reading the register of pecuniary interests of Ministers, that this Prime Minister had such an investment or had such a pecuniary interest? It was only because of a search of company records that this became clear. There is a conflict of interest and the Prime Minister must declare what his personal interest is.

        I stand more in sorrow than in anger in relation to Senator Tate's response. I seek urgency because there is obviously abysmal ignorance about the stand taken by the Australian Hospitals Association, which represents the public hospitals of Australia, not the private hospitals. Six hundred and six public hospitals and 330 private hospitals joined together recently in an effort which they entitled `Operation hospital survival'. We get this abysmal answer from Senator Tate about what the Government is not going to do. That is all we heard from him.

        The hospitals in this country are in crisis. For the first time in their history, the public hospitals have joined with the private hospital system to get home to the Government that there is a crisis situation. It is a matter of urgency. It is not something that can be fobbed off by saying, `This isn't occurring'. It is occurring; it is occurring today. We get the absurd response that the Government is going to do nothing.

         The hospital system is in crisis. I will take but a few minutes to explain why. Gross domestic product spent on health care in this country has been static for 13 years. No other country in the world has kept its percentage of money spent on health care as a proportion of GDP static for the last 13 years. Every country has increased the amount expended because there has been an ageing of the population in Western countries and there has been a boom in technology, yet this country, under Medicare, has kept the lid on it. It is called rationing. If honourable senators do not believe me, they can ask the people in the streets who are trying to access the system. They cannot get in. Because of that expenditure blow-out, only 41 per cent can afford private insurance.

         Mr Gear has other plans about what the Government is going to do in the health insurance system. Senator Tate said, `We are not going to nationalise health', but that is not Mr Gear's plan. He has put his plan to Mr Howe and Mr Keating. Mr Gear wants to nationalise the health system. He wants to increase the Medicare levy to 2.25 per cent—which still will not cover the cost of health in Australia. That is what Mr Gear wants to do, but Senator Tate does not answer the question.

         Why is it urgent? It is urgent because in April this year four health Ministers met with the Federal Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and said that they would refuse to reaffirm their commitment to Medicare because of the Federal Government's failure to fund it adequately. That is what the Ministers who are getting the message from the grassroots, the public hospitals—

         What else has happened? The two groups which are not natural allies—the peak body representing the public hospitals and the peak body representing the private hospitals—have together put out a very well researched paper outlining the state of health care in Australia today. It is disastrous. When we in this chamber were growing up we had what was recognised as one of the best health systems in the world. It is not one of the best in the world after eight years of the Labor Government and Medicare. What do the General Manager of the HIC and the Chief Executive of Medibank say? They say that the decline in private health insurance is disastrous. They want it turned around.

         Before Medicare was introduced, 76 per cent of people were privately insured and now only 42 per cent are privately insured. We have hospital queues of between 70,000 and 100,000 across Australia and an occupancy rate in our private hospitals of between 50 and 60 per cent. That is a ridiculous situation.

         I refer to an article entitled, `Health cover agony for mum'. A Western Australia mum who was out of work and finally got a job but still had a pharmaceutical benefits card had a child with glue ear. She went through the public health system in 1990 and waited six months for the child's ear to be treated. After the child had been treated, one of the grommets that were placed in the child's ear fell out and the other was not very successful. She went back to the public health system and was booked into a clinic. She was told that her child's ears could not be examined because they were too infected. So she had to wait. She got another appointment, for which she had to wait a long time. Finally, she was told that she would have to wait six months to a year for surgery.

         This was a child who at age four could not hear—at the very critical time when a child is developing language, and hearing is vitally important for language development. Just consider how that would have set that child back in his or her development. It is not just the discomfort of that child's glue ear but his or her development. But the mother was told to wait, so what did she do? As she did not have private health insurance, she went to the private system and paid to have that service because she wanted her child treated. What was the outcome? She got an appointment immediately; she booked for private surgery; and, on the same day as would have been her next public clinic appointment, she was able to get the child into surgery.

         This committee will inquire into the creation of a new corporate form tailored to meet the needs of small business. The committee will examine the unproclaimed Close Corporations Act 1989. That act had as its object the simplification of the corporate rules for small business by reducing financial and other reporting requirements and by abandoning the company law distinction between directors and share holders in favour of simple principles based on partnership laws. The committee will also examine suggested amendments to that act and other corporate structures having the same broad objectives.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Close Corporations Act was included in the Corporations legislation which was passed by Parliament in 1989. The Act was never proclaimed because of constitutional difficulties. However the demand for some new corporate form tailored to the needs of small business remains.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Australia has approximately 800,000 companies registered with the Australian Securities Commission. Some 1,200 of those are publicly listed on the Stock Exchange. Perhaps another 30,000 could be classified as significant in terms of their assets or the complexity of their corporate structures. The remainder are overwhelmingly small businesses—the family farm, the local shop or garage or the family company with few assets outside the family home and having only a handful of members. It is important that the regulatory requirements for these companies are appropriate to their size and value.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In addition to the advantages that will flow to small business from a simpler regulatory system, it is to be hoped that the Australian Securities Commission will also benefit in that it will not have to apply a single, and often inappropriate, regulatory regime to all companies in Australia irrespective of their size.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The committee will also take the opportunity to examine the drafting of the Close Corporations Act. It is particularly important that a piece of legislation designed for the use of small business and with the object of reducing cost and complexity of regulation should, as far as is possible, be expressed in simple and accessible language to enable the user to understand it without the requirement for costly legal advice.

        —Today the Senate is debating cognately the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992, the Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992. It is indeed very difficult to discuss four lengthy and complicated Bills in only five to 10 minutes each because of the imposition of a Government-inspired guillotine. I believe tax Bills are so important that they should not be subject to the guillotine process.

        The four Bills which are before us—particularly the first of them—give legislative effect to announcements contained in the One Nation statement delivered earlier this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Tax Bill No. 2 corrects a number of tax anomalies and technical deficiencies. At the outset, I have to say that, unfortunately, many of these new measures announced in the Prime Minister's economic statement have failed quite dismally to address Australia's fundamental economic problems.

        Some of the measures before us today were designed to lead Australia out of recession, but time and time again the proposals are too narrow and too restrictive. It is as though the Government is putting extra lead in the saddlebags of the racehorse and not enabling it to perform to its maximum. I think that is tragic. Who are the real losers? They are the unemployed. At least there was a glimmer of hope that some of these proposals would get off the ground in terms of infrastructure development. But they have been muzzled and constrained in such a way that very few projects will be possible. Then again, there is the time constraint—they have to be ready by December 1992.

        In my remarks today I am will refer particularly to the Development Allowance Authority Bill, the infrastructure proposals and the lack of use of limited partnerships in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). The Opposition, through a series of amendments, gave the Government the opportunity to pick these up at the committee stage and make something worthwhile out of this legislation. But the Government has turned its back. The losers are not members of the Opposition, but the people of Australia. These Bills could have provided employment opportunities. That was the hype; that was the basis on which they were sold in the One Nation statement. But when these Bills came before this place they were not as stated in One Nation. They were restrained; they were changed. And the losers are the people of Australia, especially the unemployed.

        Various sectors of the business community have called for the need for increased competitiveness and greater incentives for business expansion by way of tax reform. The business sector has expressed disappointment that in the One Nation statement there has been no attack on government controlled labour costs, such as payroll taxes and the superannuation and training levies, no clear means of stimulating investment in the labour intensive industries, and no extension of the meaning of effective life to the original announcements in the depreciation regime. The One Nation tax reforms we have before us today have been aimed at encouraging private investment in long term projects but they have fallen far short of what was needed.

        The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 is once again an omnibus Bill implementing a wide range of proposals, most of which have previously been announced. But some of those previous announcements do not correspond with the legislation before us today. One of the most significant changes is in the area of the depreciation regime to provide higher rates of depreciation for depreciable property with effective lives of five years or more, and I indeed welcome those initiatives. These higher rates will reduce the impact of the Government's inability to resolve satisfactorily its earlier problem of what is known as the effective life issue. Depreciation has been described by one tax writer, Don Napier, in the June issue of

       Just ponder for a while, Mr Acting Deputy President, the impact that will have on business decisions and business investment. This Bill introduces the new six ranges of depreciation rates which are to replace the only recently legislated seven broad-based depreciation rates. While these accelerated depreciation arrangements will be of benefit to business, there is little evidence to suggest that the Government's tinkering around with depreciation rates has done much to bolster business investment confidence. In fact, this Bill not only incorporates changes to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) of this year but also contains the Government's reversed recent decision to make depreciation allowances to businesses available only on a declining balance method for depreciation purposes.

        In the One Nation statement it was announced that straight-line depreciation would be abolished as part of the depreciation reforms. How little the Government knew of depreciation rules and how they work and how they adversely impact, particularly on the leasing industry in banking. In the initial years of owning equipment, this gives a worse result than `diminishing value', which the Government was proposing should be the only method. However, the straight-line method gives a better result in later years and, further, many companies would have had difficulties with the computerised accounting systems in leasing transactions which were generally calculated on a straight-line method.

        At first the Government and the ATO response was emphatic that there was no chance of a back-down on the abolition of the straight-line depreciation regime. However, fortunately, after a lot of pressure, this Bill now incorporates a most necessary back-down and we do have the opportunity of straight-line calculations of depreciation under this new regime.

        Further, I suggest that this Government take a good look at our Asian neighbours as well as our other major trading partners who show that they are only too well aware of the way in which tax allowances and other forms of assistance can encourage the spending of capital and the development of new enterprises. We cannot be a community isolated from the rest of the world. The World Economic Forum's 1991 report on world competitiveness shows that only New Zealand and Hungary have less advantageous taxation regimes than Australia. In fact, we ranked twenty-first, whilst Singapore ranked first and Hong Kong second, with Japan and India sharing third place.

        The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) also increases the exemption for gains on the disposal of goodwill of a business from 20 to 50 per cent where the net business interests to the taxpayer are worth less than $2m. Again I would have to say that this goodwill concession is an attempt by the Government to counter the coalition's incentives and initiatives in Fightback. We welcome this because it is the Fightback incentives that show that the Liberal and National parties are leading the tax debate in this country, and it is the Government that is blindly following on well back in the field.

        However, one problem needs to be addressed on the proposed capital gains tax. The proposed amendment to section 160ZD was designed to ensure that where the disposal of an asset occurs due to the expiry of the asset itself—where it is obviously worthless—no capital gains tax is to be payable. Because the anomaly actually arose from earlier legislation which came into operation on 15 August, it was considered that the benefit should apply from that date rather than 2 April 1992. I thank the Government for an amendment that has just been placed on our desks that will effectively mean that the operative date for those expired options and expired leases will now, fairly, be 15 August 1989, the original date when the Government should have got it right.

        I note that the revenue effect is expected to be minimal. I must indicate that in recent times Government responses to these sorts of problems have been readily forthcoming. I particularly thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his part in attending to these on a timely basis. The effect of that amendment is that it will overcome a serious injustice committed against those taxpayers who had a lease or option which had expired during the period from 15 August 1989.

        The Bill also contains 15 miscellaneous amendments to the capital gains tax. One worthy of comment ensures that capital gains tax is payable where non-taxable Australian assets owned by a deceased Australian resident are inherited by a non-resident beneficiary. A number of people might say, `Fair enough'. But I remind those listening, both on the radio and in the Senate, that this provision has certain dangerous death duties overtones which I do not think people really should ignore.

        An amendment to the research and development 150 per cent taxation concession is the result of an anomaly in the clawback provisions which could not easily be accommodated or removed by a single Tax Office ruling. In fact, I believe that many of the taxation rulings should really be incorporated into legislative changes rather than left on the books as Taxation Office rulings. I applaud this move, and I request the Minister to ensure that more of the rulings are in legislative form to give them the correct force of law that is necessary to support them. This measure was announced on 17 January 1992. It will prevent the application of research and development clawback provisions to certain eligible companies where a grant or recoupment is made by the Commonwealth under the cooperative research centres program. Naturally, the coalition has no problems with this particular proposal.

        Again I am pleased that the Government has heeded the call to enable substantially self-employed people with minimum outside superannuation support not to be deprived of deductions to their personal self-employed funds. This is a matter that we have been giving a lot of attention to in recent years because it is an injustice which affected the self-employed community. People such as doctors who got minimum support as a result of one or two visits to a hospital a month, and as a result of being paid a fee there, could be deprived of tax deductibility on their own personal superannuation funds. This amendment overcomes that degree of injustice.

        Other amendments to the Bill include changes to the Medicare levy to limit concessions to those holding health cards, the blind, pensioners and recipients of sickness allowances; seven previously announced changes to anomalies to the foreign source income; contributions on behalf of employers extended to three eligible types of superannuation funds; and the deferral of the initial payment of company tax instalments for those which have a tax liability of $1,000 or more but less than $400,000, balance after 31 December 1991 and pay their tax in two instalments. This last proposal with regard to company tax is indeed welcome, but I must point out that a great deal of uncertainty and confusion within the business community could have been avoided if the proposals had been legislated before 31 December 1991 and not six months later.

        One other taxation change which is causing the coalition some concern is a measure to exempt from income tax the pay and allowances of Australian Defence Force members serving with the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. While the exemption is to be backdated to 9 June, provision exists, and apparently it is the Government's intention, to terminate this concession once the UN declares a cease-fire in Cambodia. Such action, if taken, is inconsistent with the exemption granted to Australian personnel involved in the Namibian peacekeeping force who were also operating in dangerous, unmapped minefields and were constantly subject to the threat of injury and disease long after the cease-fire declaration.

        Further, it is my understanding that phase two of the UN peace plan was to start last Wednesday if all groups were in agreement. However, this is not so. One group, the Khmer Rouge, is still not willing to demobilise its troops. As well, one has to consider the literally millions of mines that have been placed or buried throughout Cambodia. Our Defence Force personnel are therefore in constant danger, but they are equipped to handle this. The full-year cost of extending the exemption is estimated at approximately $2.5m; yet this is only additional to the Government's costing in the event that the Australian personnel remain in Cambodia after the declaration of a UN cease-fire.

        For a government to put the lives of our willing young men and women at risk and then refuse a tax exemption of pay and allowances for these courageous service people, given the precedent set in Namibia, leaves us speechless. I am pleased that, on the initiative of my colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman, an amendment will be moved during the committee stage proposing to overcome this unsatisfactory situation. The amendment, on behalf the coalition, will seek to extend the tax exemption for ADF personnel participating in the UN peacekeeping force in Cambodia until that country is made safe, not just until the UN announces its cease-fire. I think it is appropriate that Senator Jocelyn Newman do that because she has a long record of concern about the welfare of ADF personnel and she has special responsibilities in this chamber for defence issues.

        I now turn my attention to the Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992 and the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992. The Government's proposals for pooled development funds differ substantially from what was outlined in the One Nation statement. While Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) deals with some significant features, a separate Bill, the Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992, outlines the conditions for qualification of a pooled development fund. Some of the differences actually favour the shareholders. For example, the maximum investment by a pooled development fund in a single entity will now be increased to 20 per cent whereas in One Nation it was to be 10 per cent. That is one of the few areas where it favours the taxpayers.

        The PDFs will ostensibly provide a mechanism for channelling equity capital to eligible small and medium sized Australian companies, defined as companies with total assets of not more than $30m. The Opposition is amazed that this Government is now reintroducing a concept which is very similar to the failed management investment company scheme which expired last year and which was subject to so much criticism, although I must admit it is less prescriptive than the former scheme. It was reviewed by the BIE in 1987, which concluded that the MICs should finish in 1988, given that the program was seen as a catalyst and not a permanent force of assistance. So neither the Government nor the MIC licensing board saw the program as continuing indefinitely.

        Presumably, funds which may have been or would be channelled directly to some firms or through other investment arrangements will now be channelled via the PDF in order to benefit from the lower tax treatment. The coalition's assessment of a 30 per cent tax rate applying to PDF and imputation credits attaching to receipts of franked dividends is that net investment is unlikely to change, even with the above tax concessions. The tax concession exists through one intermediary, the pooled development fund, only at the expense of investment through other financial arrangements. I think that is a tragedy. In short, it will just encourage investors to channel their investments through a PDF rather than encouraging increased investment in small and medium sized businesses.

        The coalition feels that the pooled development fund scheme may tend to institutionalise investment decisions even further. In fact, Labor's pooled development fund would provide only a paltry $5m in 1994-95 and 1995-96 when major tax reforms are required for the business sector. It is another example of tinkering very much at the edges.

        Moreover, concern should be expressed at the compliance costs associated with pooled development funds. They are exorbitantly high. Hand in hand with the announcement of the measures for the pooled development funds in the One Nation statement come measures which have resulted in the Development Allowance Authority Bill before us today. Again, this Bill is nothing more than a bandaid solution which will provide $40m in 1994-95 and $70m in 1995-96 when major tax reforms are needed for the business sector.

        This Bill establishes the eligibility of large projects—that is, projects with a capital cost of $50m or more—for the development allowances. The type of eligibility project specifically identified in the legislation includes factories, mines, quarries, wharves and other port facilities, hotels, pipelines and transport. The development allowance is a deduction against income equal to 10 per cent of eligible plant expenditure in its first year of use. To qualify, an application must have been lodged with the DAA by the end of 1992. Why such a tight timeframe? This is not adequate, especially when one realises that the requirement to meet world best practice, which is known as the competitiveness test in the legislation, is actually waived for the first round of applicants who apply before the end of 1992.

        Nonetheless, the question remains: what is the sense behind setting up a scheme of special assistance when the recipients are firms that are already identified as having little or no existing assistance but have in place world best management and industrial relations arrangements? Obviously, if firms have world best practice arrangements in place, they would not require any additional assistance from taxpayers to compete in the international marketplace. The unwieldy administrative arrangements and the denial of legitimate interest deductions in the form of inhibitions in prohibiting roll-over of interest financing is adding considerably to the capital cost structure of these businesses. This is another example of putting lead in the saddlebags.

        Further, it should be noted that the Government's proposed Development Allowance Authority would discriminate against small projects, that is, projects with a capital cost of less than $50m. This $50m threshold is arbitrary and distorting and will encourage vertical integration which may or may not be the most efficient production structure. The fact that applicants must be registered by the end of this year will provide the Government, presumably before the next election, with some projects—at least on paper—which will enable it to claim that it is getting some investment back on track. But it is not going far enough; it is very much a bandaid treatment.

        This raises the question of the genuineness of the Government in wanting to put in place significant development proposals. I suggest that the Government is assuming that two or three projects will get off the ground prior to the 31 December deadline. Why should projects such as stage 2 of the Loy Yang B project—a project that would yield lower electricity prices to Victorian consumers—not be eligible? The reason is that they must be substantially new, rather than the second phase of an already existing project. The whole concept of the Authority is flawed and there is no logic in setting up the Authority to hand out taxpayers' money over such a short timeframe. We supposedly have in place the world's best arrangements.

This is absolutely appalling. A number of amendments contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) were announced in the One Nation statement. These will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act by confirming that taxpayers are entitled to deductions in respect of losses incurred in writing off a bad portion of a debt; allowing interest or other borrowing expenses on funds borrowed to invest in infrastructure borrowings to be described as deductible, even though the interest received is exempt; and increasing the rate of deductions for buildings used for traveller accommodation and industrial accommodation from 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent from 26 March 1992. This is a welcome move. The amendments allow the capital cost of income producing structural improvements to be evenly deductible over 40 years at the rate of 2.5 per cent and allow depreciation to the holders of crown leases who were denied depreciation deductions for property they installed on leased land—another welcome move.

        Two other measures not previously announced include expanding the definition of `primary production' so as to include horticulture, including the propagation or cultivation of plants and their products; and confirming that prospecting, exploration or drilling for minerals, petroleum and natural gas is not categorised as research and development for the purpose of the special R&amp;D deduction of up to 150 per cent.

        Because of the shortness of time, I commend readers and listeners to the deliberations of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration when these issues were extensively canvassed. I thank Mr Hood from the Taxation Office for his lucid explanation of these issues. I do have certain problems in regard to retrospectivity which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to address when summing up the amendment during the committee stage. After some lengthy discussion on the point, the amendment will clearly change the law and not merely confirm or clarify it. It was agreed that this matter will be further investigated and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister, with assistance from the Taxation Office, can clarify this point on retrospectivity. I also wish to express my disappointment that the horticultural extension definition includes hydroponics only from 25 May 1992. We welcome this addition, but this industry has been operating now for quite some time.

        However, of all the matters before us in this debate, the coalition is most concerned about the tax exempt infrastructure borrowings, or the facility for non-assessable/non-deductible bonds. The issue has been widely canvassed again in the Senate Standing Committee report, and I commend readers to that. However, we are very surprised, given the strong support from the witnesses, that the Government has not seen fit to acknowledge the worth and the value of those seven or eight amendments put by the Opposition. Because of time constraints, we obviously cannot put them again, but the proposals and the concept of limited partnerships must raise their heads in the future.

        Unfortunately, the proposals in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) are far too restrictive in their application than the initiative announced in the One Nation statement. The Bill will restrict the utilisation of bonds to funding by corporate entities, and this restriction is in conflict with initiatives taken by State governments to establish the option of equity investment in projects to be structured as limited partnerships. We have already seen movements by the New South Wales and Victorian governments to this effect. The question is: why is this Federal Government lagging behind, stopping such developments from getting off the ground and easing our unemployment problem?

        The proper utilisation of limited partnerships would support private participation in infrastructure projects, especially when it is considered that infrastructure projects require investors to take a very long term view in appraising the return on their investment and to address a range of risks and issues. Why should they have to have roundabout mechanisms of raising $2 companies? Why should they have to address their losses through that sort of artificial mechanism rather than through the efficient partnership arrangement which is acknowledged worldwide? It is hard to believe the Government's blinkered vision in this particular area.

        I refer to provisions where moneys raised by infrastructure borrowings can be spent only on construction of a related facility on or after the date on which the first draw down of the borrowings was made. In other words, this will prohibit the effective roll-over relief. How does this work? In the initial stages of construction, one borrows short term; it is high risk. Once the operation facility gets going, one then borrows long term and low cost because there is lower risk. Under this legislation we are unable to make the first case roll over into the second. So we are denying these companies the opportunity of minimising in a legitimate and commercial way—

        I was third on the speakers list this afternoon, and Senator Kernot from the Australian Democrats was supposed be ahead of me. This shows the scant regard that the Democrats have for taxation Bills: they just let the Government do what it likes with them. I presume Senator Kernot is out doing another dirty deal with the Government. She did a dirty deal with it yesterday to lose 80,000 jobs, and she is probably out doing a deal to lose another 20,000 jobs to make it an even 100,000 for the week. It is disgraceful that they have not taken their place in the debate even though Senator Kernot put her name on the list.

        I will address Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) more than any other Bill. It involves amendments to taxation laws to provide for higher depreciation rates for plant purchased after 26 February 1992. This is for plant which has an effective life of more than five years. The items of plant which have an effective life of less than five years have been dealt with in legislation following the March 1991 statement by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. It was dealt with as late as February of this year. So it is very hard to keep up with the continual amendments to the depreciation schedule. I think Senator Watson did say that there have been seven changes in three years or something like that.

        I will do the comparisons a bit later to show how much this is tinkering at the edges. There is no real gain in it. These rates are far too low. There is certainly no incentive in these new schedules to invest in new plant. Plant purchases go on all the time; they are programmed to go on all the time. If the incentives had been greater, some operators whose plants may not have needed changing over for a few years might have made the decision to do so earlier. But the changes are not great enough for that.

        Why have these incentives been put back into the legislation? Under the Fraser Government there were many incentives to turn over plant fairly regularly. This did two things: a lot more machines were supplied to the business sector and productivity increased. We had those incentives under Malcolm Fraser's Government. But when this Government came along—led mainly by Senator Walsh, the former Minister for Finance—it continually eroded those incentives. The investment allowance certainly went and the depreciation schedule was changed to write off machinery over a longer period.

        Under the new proposals in this legislation, as I have said, anything with an effective life of under three years will not be affected. It will be wholly written off. Anything under $300 will be a one-off write off. Under the new proposals, items of plant of three years to less than five years stay at 40 per cent prime cost, with a diminishing value of 60 per cent. This is where the changes come in. Items of plant of five years to less than 6 2/3  years go to 27 per cent prime cost whereas it was 24 per cent before. The diminishing value is 40 per cent whereas before it was 36 per cent—hardly any change. Items of plant of 6 2/3 years to less than 10 years go to 20 per cent prime cost under the new schedule whereas it was 18 per cent before, with a diminishing value of 30 per cent whereas it was 27 per cent before. I will not repeat all of those figures because they are in the explanatory memoranda. This Government is just tinkering at the edges and not making any real changes.

        This is only further tinkering, because of what happened in the March 1991 statement. That legislation did not come before the Parliament until February of this year and made changes that were supposed to be effective from July 1991, not when the statement came down. There was pressure on the Government—I think Senator Watson alluded to this—just before last Christmas to put all those new schedules back to March 1991. The problem was that when the March 1991 statement came down anyone thinking of purchasing a fairly big plant could see a better depreciation schedule around the corner, in four months, and backed off or delayed purchasing new equipment.

        The ones that hung off lost that productivity, lost employment opportunities and lost the opportunity to increase profits. The Government has been tinkering and tinkering.

So there is utter and total confusion. How can anyone—earthmoving firms, farmers—who buys plant, which depreciates for business purposes, do any forward planning? As I have said, farmers, plant operators and everyone like that get caught.

        Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) also defers the initial payment of company tax for 1991-92, that is, for companies which have a tax liability of under $400,000. Companies which pay in two instalments will be able to defer for nine weeks. Once again, this is tinkering at the edges. Company tax payments had to be made at the normal time, although there was a time when payments were able to be made in four equal instalments, but this Government came along and saw that the only way it could keep up with its ever expanding deficits was to get money in more quickly. The Government was not getting any more money in, but it continually had to get money in and spend it before it earned it. Under a Bill we put forward a couple of years ago tax payments had to be made within 28 days after the end of the financial year or from the end of the reporting year. Companies with a financial year ending 30 June had to pay by 28 July. That is extended now to 28 September—nine weeks. That is simply tinkering at the edges. The bulk of the tax was paid by most companies six months later. It is a totally ridiculous situation. There is no great concession. It is simply a stay of execution—a term I used last night. If one is to be executed and there is no way out, I suppose the sooner the better—get it over and done with.

        Also under this Bill, the capital gains exemption on goodwill for small business will go from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The threshold for the net worth of a business under this category will apply to companies worth under $2m. At present, the 20 per cent is available, to my knowledge, for companies worth $1m. I suppose this measure is in this Bill to try to pick up a few votes to appease small businesses that have either been put into bankruptcy or will have to put personnel off in the next few months when the new legislation and the superannuation levy come in. When will these measures come in? In 1993-94. I ask Senator Tate: if these measures are so important and are needed for small business, why are they not introduced now? Taxes are increased on the day they are announced. If these measures are to loosen up businesses that are in a corner, why do they not apply now?

I do not pretend that I have been able to read the whole lot in this short time. I do not think that even an expert like Senator Watson has been able to go through the whole lot and get the indications. That is why I think the legislation will be back here in a couple of months for more amendments. Whatever these measures are, they are far short of what we have in the Fightback package. Indeed, when we are in government, the Fightback package will be the answer.

I will preface that by adding slightly to the remarks that I have made by saying that this recession that we have in Australia today is a very deep recession. It is the most serious, most protracted recession that we have had since the years of the Great Depression in the 1930s. There are various causes of the recession which have caused two million Australians to be either unemployed or underemployed, but one of the fundamental reasons for the recession is the impact of grossly incompetent economic and financial policies on the part of this Government impacting on the confidence of investors and on the ability of both individual and corporate Australians to save.

We are not opposing Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) or Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), although we will be proposing one or two amendments.

        I will very quickly outline again why we are opposed to the Development Allowance Authority Bill and the Pooled Development Funds Bill. The Development Allowance Authority Bill establishes a one-member statutory authority—the Development Allowance Authority, the DAA—which will have the task of assessing the eligibility of large projects with a capital cost of $50m or more. The basic objection that we have to this is that no earthly reason has been presented as to why we have to set up yet another quango to handle a matter such as this. The cost of establishing this Authority is not small by any means. It is a one-man Authority, so it says. As I understand it, the cost to set up the Authority is $1.2m. The administration costs in relation to what the Authority is supposed to be doing are very high indeed.

        Let me make it clear: we are not opposing the concept of the development allowance as such; we are opposing the establishment of another authority to administer, if you like, the development allowance that is being proposed. That development allowance was announced in the One Nation statement on 26 February. At that time no details at all were given as to the administrative arrangements to be put in place to deliver the allowance. At no time was any mention made of setting up an independent statutory authority at a cost well in excess of $1.2m.

        It is worth noting that the One Nation statement records that certain broad criteria would need to be observed in identifying projects eligible for the development allowance. Various criteria were spelt out but, strangely, those criteria are not given any attention in the outline of the Bill's explanatory memorandum, although they are contained in the clauses of the Bill. I am not sure what that suggests. It could suggest sloppy or inconsistent drafting. It could also suggest that the Government will not be putting much weight on these broad criteria when it comes to interpreting the legislation. If that is the case, it just increases the whole element of uncertainty to which I referred earlier.

        I find it very odd indeed that the requirement in the Bill to meet `world best practice', known as the competitiveness test, is actually to be waived for the first round of applicants who apply before the end of this year. There are various other points one could make about this Bill. The $50m threshold is arbitrary. It distorts investment decisions because there is a big difference in terms of the development allowance situation and, therefore, the tax treatment according to whether a project is a whisker under $50m or a whisker over. Smaller investors, of course, miss out altogether.

        The main point to be noted in relation to the legislation is that it is very small beer when we look at it against the proposals contained in the coalition's Fightback package. This Government is tinkering at the edges of the fundamental problems confronting business in this country. It does not have the wit or the courage, for whatever reason, to really tackle the major problems that are facing this country in the way that the coalition has set out so concisely and in such detail in its Fightback proposals.

        So far as business is concerned, far from mucking around with allowances such as this, we are proposing the abolition of no less than $20 billion of taxes on the cost of doing business in this country—on the actual cost of producing goods and services. That includes, in particular, the abolition of the totally anomaly-ridden, ramshackle wholesale sales tax system that we have in this country, much of which is built into the whole cost structure of business.

There have obviously been deals done between the Democrats and the Government on this. There has been some watering down of the Government's initial proposals. The fact remains that the Government is imposing a system of compulsory employer contribution superannuation which will cost this nation thousands more jobs to add to the unemployment scrap heap that the policies of this Government has produced over the last several years.

        If the Government were really serious, it would recognise the fact that the cost of transport in Australia is an enormous burden because of the size of our nation and the reliance we have on road transport. That, in turn, is importantly dependent on the fact that there are such industrial relations problems across the other areas of transport. If the Government were really serious about doing something to lower the costs, it would do what the coalition is proposing and abolish fuel excise. That impacts to the tune of something like $4 billion a year on business in Australia. The Government will not do any of those things. Instead, it mucks around essentially—when compared with the broad sweep of what it ought to be doing—with mickey mouse projects of the nature that are contained in the Development Allowance Authority proposals.

The incentives to invest in pooled development funds will be tax concessions. They are covered in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3).

        The fact is that the PDF scheme is similar, in many respects, to the management investment companies scheme which was in operation in previous years. The management investment companies scheme was unsuccessful and was terminated, with agreement on all sides, in June 1991. The pooled development funds proposal is essentially a new version of that earlier tried but not very successful scheme. One question that the Government ought to be answering is: with the management investment companies scheme having failed in the past and being wound up, why is the new proposal not likely to suffer the same fate?

         The pooled development funds scheme will encourage the further bureaucratisation of investment at the expense of individual portfolio investment.

        The Industry Commission, which reported recently on the availability of capital in Australia, does not support the PDF concept. The Industry Commission noted in its report that there had been a rapid growth in intermediaries specialising in investments in smaller companies in the past decade due largely to the deregulation of the finance market. The Industry Commission concluded that the availability of capital for small and medium enterprises depended largely on the rate of return. That is not a very startling finding but it appears to have been overlooked by the Government with respect to bringing forward the pooled development funds proposal. The Industry Commission observed:

        The only effective and enduring policies for boosting the level of savings and, therefore, the level of investment in this country are, as I outlined earlier, the types of policies that are contained in the coalition's Fightback package. The pooled development funds proposal is going into the type of thing that we have seen bankrupt Victoria in recent years—my own State. The Cain Government and now the Kirner Government have got government involved more and more in channelling funds into investment, into trying to pick winners as to where investment will go—getting government's sticky fingers into the whole area of the private sector.

The cost to Victorians, of which I am one, over future years to try to get back on an even keel, to repair the damage that has been done by that Government, will be extraordinarily high. It will be a major burden on the whole process of economic development in Victoria through the 1990s. Although the pooled development funds proposal is of perhaps a lesser magnitude than that, it is conceptually very similar. It is very dangerous. Given the experience of the Government in previous years, and having seen the experience of other States, I am surprised that it would wish to go down that path.

        Out of all of those items there are two major ones I would like to discuss. Firstly, the majority of the accelerated depreciation measures contained in the One Nation statement are implemented in this legislation—and this was long overdue. We had been calling for this for two years, once it became obvious that the decision in the May 1988 economic statement to abolish accelerated depreciation and simultaneously to cut the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent simply worsened the habit of Australian business to under-invest in productive capacity and to concentrate on speculative investments which relied to a large extent on inflation. This is the real tragedy of the 1980s—that a lot of money which was sacrificed by workers under the accord, was not reinvested in productive industry but squandered.

        We welcome these changes. They are simply a reversal of a bad mistake. Nonetheless, it must not be forgotten that the company tax rate is now very low. Given the fact that New Zealand had to raise its company tax rate from 28 per cent—which prompted the March 1988 changes—to 33 per cent, the rationale for keeping the rate at 39 per cent in Australia seems to have diminished substantially.

I wish to clarify this position by stating again that the Democrats believe that the current taxation arrangements which apply to superannuation are not fair. Even though these arrangements are too generous, it is not fair to deny the current concession to some people because of an anomaly.

For example, the Democrats believe that the more generous depreciation arrangements for new buildings should have been contingent on energy efficiency design and other features being incorporated into the buildings.

There is no point in trying to outdo the deregulationist policies of this Government. Community sentiment has really turned around and has started to reject the worship of the free market.

But I recall having heard the coalition in New South Wales saying very much the same thing as this just before it came into government in 1988. I recall having spoken to senior members of the New South Wales coalition shortly after they had won the 1988 election. They promised me—they swore blind—that, yes, they would manage government business far better than the Labor Party had in the dying days of the Unsworth Government; no, they would not be rushing through legislation at the eleventh hour; and, no, there would not be any late night sittings.

The DAA will assess the eligibility of projects with gross expenditure of $50m or more for the development allowance, which is the deduction against income equal to 10 per cent of eligible plant expenditure in the first year that the plant is used or installed ready for use. This is provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

        Definite criteria have been set out to evaluate eligibility. Projects must obtain a pre-qualifying certificate to claim the development allowance. Specific criteria must be met. For example, the project must be able to provide a sufficient and achievable contribution to Australia's competitive standing and plant expenditure must be for legitimate primary use in the eligible project. Important trigger dates are to be set against each step of the DAA's assessment of an application to reinforce the object of the allowance, which is to bring forward investment in new plant and equipment.

        The cost of this new measure will be $40m in 1994-95 and a further $70m in 1995-96. The cut-off date for pre-qualifying certificates is 1 August 1996. The plant must be in use or installed ready for use by 1 July 2002, as assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation. We note that industries whose nominal and effective rate of assistance is greater than 10 per cent will not be eligible for the development allowance. This means that investment in textile, clothing and footwear industries and the passenger motor vehicle industry will not be eligible.

        The Australian Democrats have some concerns about the trigger dates. The Bill requires that an applicant must have applied for registration with the DAA for plant expenditure incurred, or proposed to be incurred, by 1 January 1993. Given that it is already nearing the end of June, we believe that this timeframe may be too short to allow for full publication and dissemination of the scheme in the business community. We understand, however, that this deadline is fuelled by the Government's desire for projects to begin as soon as possible to bring forward new investment and stimulate the economy.

        The Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992 establishes concessionally taxed investment companies, called pooled development funds, to provide patient equity capital for eligible activities in Australian companies with total assets not greater than $30m. The Bill aims to strengthen the program announced in One Nation to alleviate the lack of development capital. The pooled development funds board has five members from the private sector with one ex-officio DITAC member. Capital will be raised through the issuing of shares and gains by shareholders will be tax exempt. PDFs will be taxed at only 30 per cent, not the company tax rate of 39 per cent.

        The Australian Democrats have long been advocates of an improved method of delivering venture and development capital to new projects and high tech research. Development capital investment is often seen as too risky by conservative investment and fund managers and therefore researchers and scientists have often faced tremendous difficulties in commercialising research. In this respect, I draw honourable senators' attention to Memtec's difficulties which were exacerbated by its inability to access venture capital and nearly saw it take its ideas offshore through want of local investors.

        However, this Bill still does not provide an adequate incentive for seeding capital for new business ventures. A PDF is restricted from committing more than 5 per cent of its capital to new business enterprises which, in our view, is too narrow a criteria when start-up venture capital is so often sorely needed to get new ideas off the ground. Whilst the focus of this Bill is directed at providing equity capital for existing projects, it is our belief that this focus should be widened to improve the access to capital by new ventures through the PDF scheme.

Further, PDFs, although primarily required to invest in newly issued shares, may now be allowed to buy pre-owned shares as a supplement to existing shares, provided they can prove to the board that the value of the investee company will be increased as a result.

       A limited partnership is a partnership which has both general partners, whose liability is unlimited, and limited partners, whose liability is limited to the amount of capital they have invested in the partnership. Even though the liability of limited partners is limited to their contribution they may have access to losses in excess of that contribution, and for which they may not be liable.

       Limited partners do not participate in the management of the partnership and are therefore similar to investors, such as shareholders in a company. The issuer of a direct infrastructure borrowing must intend to "own, operate and effectively control the use of, the facilities on which the money will be spent" (proposed subsection 159GZZZZB(1). A limited partner is not in a position to exercise that kind of control and is not exposed to the risks associated with ownership.

       The estimated revenue cost of concessionally taxed borrowings to finance the construction of infrastructure facilities was based on the level of debt that might be used to finance the construction of infrastructure facilities of the kind specially targeted for assistance. If infrastructure borrowings were to be available to re-finance existing debt, to acquire partly constructed projects and to finance transmission facilities in the electricity generating industry there would be a considerable increase in the level of debt that would be eligible for the tax concession, and a corresponding increase in the cost to the revenue.

       If the borrowings were able to be used to re-finance existing debt and to acquire partly constructed facilities the revenue cost would commence in the 1992-93 year. In later years the increased revenue cost would be significant because, if Mr Proctor's submission was adopted, eligible borrowings would not be confined to the cost of constructing infrastructure facilities and acquiring related facilities, but would be available to finance the "on-going operations of the business". This increase in the scope of the concession could be expected to translate into a massive increase in the revenue cost.

       Infrastructure borrowings are a targeted tax preference recognising that the Government considers electricity generation, land transport and seaports high priorities and areas where private sector involvement can best be encouraged. Infrastructure borrowings are designed to promote private ownership, operation and control not just private finance of infrastructure. It is not clear that the transmission stage of electricity is amenable to such a private role. Also, transmission does not have the scope for operating efficiencies as generation does.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       A rough estimate of the cost of infrastructure borrowings is around $5m for each $100m raised in terms of tax on lenders forgone. Most of that amount will be recovered in around 5 years when the borrowers may generate sufficient income so that the fact that they have forgone their tax deductions results in their paying more tax. The possible costs of the Bass Link project, or whether it would satisfy the "private" tests of infrastructure borrowings, is not known. The cost of extending the concession to electricity transmission is impossible to estimate as it is critically dependent on the number, scale and timeframe of possible private transmission projects and the extent to which they are financed by infrastructure borrowings.

In many ways the debate on these taxation Bills has reflected their significance—not the last few minutes of the flurry, but, in the main, honourable senators were dealing with matters of substance and dealing with them substantially. I do not of course agree with a lot of the things that were said, but that is a different question. I would normally make a fairly lengthy contribution to this second reading debate because this is important material, but that would be using up a limited amount of time, so I will not do that.

        I should formally indicate, firstly, as the Senate is aware, that there will be two Government amendments to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, which we will deal with at the committee stage. I understand that at least one of those amendments is supported by the Opposition, perhaps both, but I am aware from Senator Watson's contribution that he supports one of them.

        Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) contains some important substantial matters. In all the hue and cry about timing, guillotines and amendments—including the Government's amendments—which are secondary issues, we cannot take our attention away from the big questions that are involved in that Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). Between them they constitute a very important package of tax reform which substantially reflects the initiatives of One Nation. They form a substantial part of the package to give stimulus to the Australian economy in a way that will also encourage investment that will make the Australian economy more efficient in the long term. I refer, for example, to the depreciation amendments and the capital gains tax goodwill exemption in the Taxation Laws Amendment (No. 3) Bill in particular.

        The No. 3 Bill, in a sense, is more substantial in that regard with PDFs, the tax exempt infrastructure borrowings, the capital expenditure on traveller accommodation and the development allowance as examples. There are others. Different people have different priorities, and in the time available I do not wish to deal with them all. Taken together they constitute a major contribution to the economic well-being of this nation. They are a significant element of One Nation.

        One Nation is a package essentially designed to do two integrated things that are necessary for our economy: first, to give short term stimulus to the economy. Tax measures are not, on the whole, well suited to the task of giving short term stimulus, because by definition they are designed to encourage investment, and the lead times tend to be long. They tend to fit more in the second element, but some parts of these Bills are more short term and for that reason have tight timetables. The obvious example would be the development allowance. It is designed to bring forward investment to ensure that we have that necessary stimulus for the economy. In the main, it is the expenditure element of One Nation that provides the short term stimulus, although there is some of that here.

        The second and interlocking element of One Nation is its intention to stimulate the economy in the medium term by directly making, on the expenditure side of the Budget, and encouraging through tax measures, investments that will not only create jobs in themselves but that will, in the process, make the economy more efficient. For those reasons they are particularly important. This is an important part of the continuing economic debate between the competing packages of the major parties—One Nation and Fightback—with the alternative propositions put forward by the Democrats. This is a very important contribution to that debate and it is a very important part of the Government's agenda for economic reform in Australia.

I have referred to the two Government amendments and I will deal with them in more detail then. There is one Opposition amendment which I understand will be proceeded with which relates to the situation in Cambodia. All I will say in the second reading stage is that there is no disagreement about objectives. The Government is of the view that the amendment is entirely unnecessary to achieve the agreed purpose.

        Senator Kernot raised a particular question which I understood at one stage may have been the basis of an amendment. I think quite appropriately at this stage she has simply raised the issue and invited me to respond to it. I will do so now. This relates to what I called in my shorthand notes which were prepared for this speech the `fruit trees' amendment. The Democrats are concerned about the depreciation arrangements for investment in orchards in general and fruit trees in particular. Within the question raised by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Democrats, there are some interesting questions about the most appropriate treatment of such expenditure, the most appropriate treatment of what is currently regarded as capital expenditure by orchardists and how that might most appropriately be regarded. I do not want to make a final, definitive response here today on it. I simply say it raises some important questions and the Government is prepared to examine any submissions people want to make about how that might best be modified.

There were a number of issues outstanding, many of which were dealt with in my letter to Senator Coates which I have incorporated. Once again, in order not to take up the Senate's time unnecessarily, I will not repeat that here. It fits within the broad framework that I outlined of these packages taken as a whole as part of One Nation. There are a large number of important issues.

        Senator Watson raised in particular again an issue that was raised and debated at some length during the Committee hearing. This was a concern about the potential retrospective effect of the amendments concerning research and development and exploration expenditure. For people who want a detailed consideration of the Government's position on that—it is essentially a technical matter—I refer them to the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        of the Committee hearing where a very detailed discussion took place about the general principles of what was intended to be achieved, why we were proceeding to amend in this way and our view that the amendment merely makes clear what is the existing legislation. Our view is that it is an amendment that does not change the rights or obligations of any taxpayer; it merely makes it clearer. Therefore, if there is no burden, there can be no problem of retrospective application of that burden. I think that argument was pretty broadly accepted, but if people wish to pursue that in more detail they should refer to the extensive debate which has already taken place on that matter.

        In conclusion, I turn to the two associated Bills, the Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992 and the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992. These have been very inappropriately denigrated. I am somewhat surprised and particularly disappointed that we find ourselves in some conflict over these important Bills, because they both seem to me self-evidently to be proposals with a significant capacity to enhance the economic well-being of Australia, particularly in the medium term but also in the short term.

        There is a common theme in the evidence that is put forward by small to medium size business to politicians of all political persuasions, I am sure. I cannot comment on the suggestions that are made to Opposition, Democrat and Independent senators when they visit business, but I can certainly comment on behalf of government members and I can certainly speak for myself. One of the concerns most frequently expressed—it was made clear by Senator Button and the Minister on his behalf in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free)—is the failure of the Australian capital market to provide long term development capital for productive investment. It came up again explicitly in the extensive and important consultations that Ministers had with business prior to the One Nation statement.

        It is difficult to prove that there is this lack of development capital. There is not a database that one can point to that says that is what proves the problem exists. The anecdotal evidence is very strong. The concern of business is very real. The Government accepts that we should act to improve the flow of development capital to revitalise and restructure mature industries, to assist the growth and development of new industries and firms, and to provide the sort of enhanced expertise in important new technologies which will be fundamental to competitiveness in the 1990s. It is from those small and medium size firms that much of the growth for the economy will come in the recovery stage that we are entering now. It is very important that we enhance and encourage those companies.

        I do not share the view of the Opposition. I understood—although, listening from my room, it seemed somewhat more stridently put by Senator Short today, but it may be that I did not pick up all the nuances of his position—that the Opposition's position essentially was that the PDF proposal was insufficient and that more needed to be done. If the argument about PDF was that it is the beginning and the end of the requirements of small business, then I suggest that would be a valid criticism. As an element in an armory of measures to enhance economic performance, I think one has to say that, at the very least, it is a small plus. I think it is more than that.

        The most important thing to the success of small business is that the economy is growing.

As I said at the beginning, I believe that this is one of the more important packages of Bills that the Senate will deal with in this session. It is very desirable that we give speedy passage to this legislation because it has the capacity to significantly enhance the economic performance of Australia, to make some contribution to that short term impetus and to make a very significant contribution to that medium term restructuring that will give us a more efficient and competitive economy.

        The Opposition is concerned about some ambiguity in the legislation relating to the tax-free status or otherwise of entitlements for Defence Force personnel serving in Cambodia. I understand that the Government believes that the Opposition amendment is not necessary. We, however, would prefer to err on the side of safety. The Government has not always given the interests of servicemen the highest priority. In fact, even now the senior Australian officer serving as a peacekeeper in Cambodia has been without his pay and allowances for six months. So it is in the light of items like that that the Opposition wants to be very careful that the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed on anything to do with the conditions of service of Australian peacekeepers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I draw attention to the fact that in Namibia the peacekeepers were treated differently from the way it appears they will be treated in Cambodia. Regarding the exemption which the Government is proposing for the tax-free status pay for Cambodia, while it is to be backdated to 9 June 1991—and properly so—it will apparently be terminated once the UN declares a cease-fire in Cambodia. I can see some advisers' heads shaking. It will be on the certificate to be issued. The entitlement of Defence Force personnel is in accordance with a certificate from the Chief of the Defence Force.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We are concerned that, if that is the motive—and of course I would not want to claim the Government has an ulterior motive—it would be perfectly possible for the Government, so as to be seen to be protecting the revenue, to decide that certificate from the Chief of the Defence Force could be revoked at a time when it suited the revenue rather than the interests of Defence Force personnel.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Therefore, in our amendment, we require the certificate of revocation, signed by the Chief of the Defence Force, to be a disallowable instrument. In other words, we believe it is proper that the Parliament should be entitled to scrutinise very carefully when the Government, with the assistance of the Chief of the Defence Force, determines that eligibility for tax-free pay will end. When one thinks about it, Cambodia is such a fluid and difficult situation that, even now, when the cease-fire should in fact be in existence, when we should have moved perhaps to a slightly less dangerous period of the peacekeeping, we still have only token disarmament from three of the factions and a refusal to disarm by the fourth faction.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We also have to recognise that people in Cambodia, civilian or military, are facing an extremely difficult situation with regard to land mines—perhaps even worse than was feared when our troops went to Namibia. Therefore, they are going to be in a very dangerous situation for a long time to come, and what is operational and what is not is going to be very much in the eye of the beholder. We do not believe that this should just be a matter for the Government to decide. We believe it is very important that the Parliament should decide when our peacekeeping forces are no longer on operational service in such a dangerous mission as they are quite clearly facing in Cambodia.

         So we do not accept the Government's view that our amendments are overcautious or unnecessary. Anything that can be put in place that properly protects the conditions of service of our servicemen should be put in. I really do not understand why the Government would quibble at accepting this amendment. If it says it is simply unnecessary, it certainly cannot be seen to do any harm. I would have thought that the Government would not object to the Parliament scrutinising its actions as to when Defence Force personnel are no longer on the service for which they have become entitled to tax-free pay. It is also of course of moment to servicemen in their entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.

         So quite a great deal rides for a serviceman on what his status is at any given time, whether it is purely peacekeeping or whether it is operational. I do not think I need to labour the point. I urge the Committee to support the Opposition's amendment, which is not designed to take political points off the Government but simply to give extra protection—if protection is needed; and we believe it is—to our servicemen. I urge the Government, and of course the Democrats, to support our amendment.

         The Government has not fixed a determination date in relation to the Cambodian tax exemption for the obvious reason that nobody can be certain when the involvement of the members will end. The exemption, as the explanatory memorandum says, will apply until a termination date is specified by the Chief of the Defence Force. The only way in which this can be a cause of concern—that in some way the interests of the defence personnel will not properly be taken into account—is if there is a concern that the Government, through either, I assume, the Treasurer or the Minister for Defence, will force the Chief of the Defence Force to sign a certificate that he would not wish to do and that he might quietly comply without kicking up some sort of a ruckus.

         Many people here probably know the Chief of the Defence Force better than I do, but I know him a little and I would have thought that was a highly unlikely position, to put it politely. It is not a concern that I share. I do not want in any way to criticise the intent of the amendment. As I say, I think we have a shared purpose; we are only talking about process. I am advised that this is the standard process and that there is no need to go further. For that reason we are not proposing to accept the amendment. I cannot get passionate and say that there is some outrage involved. I believe the amendment is unnecessary and that the prevailing provisions will discharge the requirement in the normal way, as they have on previous similar occasions, I am advised, and as they should on this occasion.

I would have thought that in the normal course of events the Parliament—and the Senate in particular—has been very unwilling to put into the taxation legislation things that might not do any harm, even if they do no good. That has not met with much favour. In fact, I keep being berated—including by my colleagues in the Opposition who do so all the time—because the tax legislation is too big and there are too many bits in it.

When I think some other proposed amendment is a crisis, I will come in here and say so, but I do not intend to invent a crisis when one does not exist. I think that is undesirable and it is preferable not to do it. But I think the net change to the outcome ffrom whichever side one looks at it—either for Consolidated Revenue or for the individual—is nil.

         —I remind Senator Kernot that during the Gulf war the Democrats wanted to have a say about how, when and in what manner our people were committed. I would have thought that, in relation to how and when our people remain committed in a situation which is dangerous, this Parliament would have a continuing interest in whether our peacekeepers stay there and continue to be shot at or whether there is any requirement on them to be withdrawn. That in itself is surely a matter for this Parliament to take a close and careful interest in.

         I would have also thought that the Government, through the Chief of the Defence Force maybe, would make a decision as to whether the personnel involved should no longer be given special protection under the Veterans' Entitlements Act of operational service. Whether they get a tax free status is surely something which relates to compensation for the commitment that these personnel make. Surely we have their lives and their well-being in our hands. It is not unreasonable if we, as a group of representatives of the people, have the opportunity to decide these matters which are of such moment for these people, who could be sacrificing everything for us and for the peace of the world.

To most people, the words were quite clear—`acquisition or construction of facilities'. I appreciate the dilemma in which Senator McMullan finds himself in not having the One Nation statement in front of him. The words that appear in the legislation have a significant impact in terms of raising quite substantially the cost of capital.

         I also query whether infrastructure bonds should be able to be used to refinance temporary project debt. When going to the market at the riskiest time of the project—that is, the construction stage—funds will naturally be more costly than when the project is up and running. Accordingly, I draw Senator McMullan's attention to an increased cost of financing as a result of what might have been an unintended consequence of not acknowledging the situation of temporary finance project debt which could qualify for infrastructure borrowing. It appears from the wording that it is excluded at the present time. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that a lack of roll-over relief will put additional lead in the saddlebags and make it much more difficult for such projects to get off the ground.

         —There is an important distinction—and I am not sure whether this meets Senator Watson's concern because there are two separate issues, one which does not fall within the legislation and one which does. I am not absolutely clear which of the two Senator Watson is referring to. He may be referring to both. There is refinancing of debt which exists prior to the impact of this legislation. It may be an ongoing project but the debt itself would not qualify. Then we cannot refinance that debt to make it qualify because that does not serve the purpose that One Nation is driving towards. But my understanding and advice is—and this is what I thought was Senator Watson's concern—that, if we have what I will call for the purpose of our discussion across the chamber `qualifying debt' and we refinance that qualifying debt, it remains qualifying debt.

         Also, I raise one matter which perhaps we should explore a little more thoroughly. I did have the opportunity of speaking with one of the Minister's advisers before the commencement of this session and I take the point made about the objectivity of the matter, but it might be beneficial if this was put on the record. I therefore ask: is it appropriate that the amendment relating to research and development in the mining industry be retrospective to the commencement time of the research and development concession? The Minister may wish to take advice and respond accordingly.

         When summing up on the second reading, I responded to the point that Senator Watson is making about the retrospectivity with regard to research and development, and exploration. We dealt with it in some detail before the Committee; I do not want to do so again here. But, because it is our view that the change does not affect the rights and obligations of any taxpayer—it merely clarifies them—we believe that there is no problem with the date of operation.

         The problem with retrospectivity arises when we retrospectively change any rights or obligations for a citizen or taxpayer. Our view is that that does not occur on this occasion.

No claims have been allowed which will have to be retrospectively disallowed as a result of the effect of this clause, and there should not be, given the explanation I have made. It is valid to say that, on the basis of a misunderstanding of the provision, there was a view that it meant something more than it did for a short while. I think the letter was generated by that.

My question revolves around borrowing costs. Are borrowing expenses such as legal fees, stamp duty and bill line fees not to be deductible? Although these expenses are of a capital nature, they are arguably not amounts paid as consideration for the acquisition of a bond. As the matter is not free from doubt, I was wondering whether at a later omnibus Bill stage the provisions could be clarified, particularly in terms of section 159GZZZZE(1)(b).

Seminars on this issue organised by the Taxation Office often run for one day, and even that is quite inadequate and insufficient to deal with it. Yet in this most important forum—or what should be the most important forum—the Parliament, the debate on this Bill is restricted to just one hour. I think that is a most unhappy situation.

         This Bill is but a further stage in the implementation of the self-assessment scheme, where the onus is on the taxpayer to supply the correct information and to comply with the law in a very complex area of tax administration. The review of self-assessment was announced in December 1990 and the information on the proposed changes was released in August 1991. The amendments contained in this Bill are the result of that initial process.

         The Bill will establish a system of public rulings by the Commissioner which will determine the Commissioner's position on a given arrangement or type of arrangement. In fact, private rulings may also be made in which a person may request the Commissioner's opinion on a matter before entering into an arrangement. I believe this is a major plus for taxpayers. Unlike the current rulings, I emphasise that the new public and private rulings will be binding on the Commissioner and, if followed, the taxpayer cannot be put in a worse position by a subsequent change in interpretation. I believe these measures will add a great deal of certainty to tax planning, and naturally the coalition welcomes this.

         However, there is one disturbing aspect of that rushed last couple of months, which is the fact that the contents of the Bill before the Senate today were widely distributed and debated before they were available to parliamentarians, and I believe that was unfortunate. I certainly think it was unintended and the fault lies not with the Tax Office but with the Government because this Bill should have been introduced a lot earlier. The presumption was that the Bill was available to parliamentarians when, in fact, it was not. So it is certainly no reflection on Mr D'Ascenzo or his staff who conducted those seminars in the belief that the Bill had been distributed. It is a matter that needs great care in the future because we may not necessarily be quite as lenient on other issues.

        Industry has expressed the opinion that a person undergoing the audit should not be disadvantaged or unnecessarily deprived of any entitlement which he had prior to the commencement of the audit. A former member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and perhaps Australia's foremost tax authority, Peter Roach, the noted writer and participant in the priority task force on self-assessment at the invitation of the Tax Office, notes:

        It is important that that go on the record because it could be a supporting comment. Concern has also been raised by the industry that the Tax Office presently has a dual approach to the administration of part IVA, which contains the anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This should really be reconsidered in the context of the current self-assessment legislation because the Tax Office is saying that the imposition of a high and relatively fixed culpability penalty is appropriate in circumstances where part IVA applies to cancel a tax benefit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The reason for this, according to the Tax Office, is that part IVA is confined to blatant, artificial and contrived schemes which were prevalent in the 1970s and were referred to by the then Treasurer, Mr John Howard, in his second reading speech. There is concern by the industry that the sober and appropriately restrained approach referred to by Mr Howard in his speech for part IVA has been adopted temporarily and only at the level of interface between the ATO and the Parliament for the purpose of securing the passage of the self-assessment legislation. I realise this is a serious accusation but, unfortunately, it has been based on industry experience. Professional firms have found that at the branch level of the Tax Office, part IVA has been applied to circumstances which are no more than examples of legitimate income tax planning measures.

         Comments that I have received from the industry are that it feels the actions of the branch office personnel in invoking part IVA cannot be dismissed as simply erroneous or overzealous attempts to apply official ATO policy. This comment is based on two reasons. First, despite the fact that part IVA was introduced over 10 years ago, the ATO has made no attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines as to how part IVA should be administered. Rather it is selectively referred to in an ad hoc way for various rulings and public statements. Having now established self-assessment in a legislative form, I call on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) to give consideration to a ruling, which will now be a binding ruling, for the application of the general anti-avoidance provision of part IVA.

         Secondly, in an Administrative Appeals Tribunal case decided in 1989, case W58, counsel for the Commissioner submitted that in interpreting part IVA it was not permissible to seek guidance from the explanatory memorandum or the speech made during the second reading debate by Mr Howard. This was a bit of a worry because when we sought confirmation about the status of the explanatory memorandum and the status of Tax Office deliberations at committee hearings, we were led to believe that they did have a certain status. In the context of self-assessment rules and the fixed culpability tariffs at 50 per cent and 25 per cent, there is an obligation on the Tax Office to issue a clear and comprehensive statement on part IVA, the anti-avoidance provision. Therefore, I ask the Government to agree to this request for a ruling.

         Another contentious issue within the Bill is the question of defining the standard for what is a reasonably arguable position. Perhaps this is the most contentious aspect of the whole self-assessment legislation. The overall proposal is that, if all reasonable care has been taken and the tax avoided does not exceed $10,000 or a specified percentage of the taxable income—in other words the threshold test—there will be no culpability penalties. The new concept of a reasonably arguable position as a defence for a taxpayer getting his tax sums wrong is a fundamental protection for the taxpayer. While I have received very strong submissions that we should be amending this, there are equally good arguments on the other side. Under the circumstances the Opposition will not be seeking an amendment, but we believe we do need certain clarifications on this issue.

         As these penalties of 25 per cent apply where reasonable care has been taken, it is important that the threshold be set at a respectable level. The provisions have been modelled on the US concepts. However, in broad terms the threshold in the United States is 10 times that set in Australia. This, together with the fact that the US penalty for underpayment of tax in these circumstances is only 20 per cent of the underpayment, the proposed Australian position can be seen to be substantially more stringent. There is no clear reason why the Australian tax officials need to be armed with a blunter instrument of enforcement than their US colleagues. Why are Australian taxpayers to be treated more harshly than taxpayers in the United States?

        I repeat, unsuccessful arguments, not successful ones. If the taxpayer's argument succeeds, there is no liability in tax. The question is: how good does an unsuccessful argument have to be to merit the description of being reasonably arguable? I refer those who are interested in following this concern to Peter Roach's article at page 18 of the Institute of Chartered Accountants' magazine,

        A point well made by a number of commentators was that the higher the standard (ie the more difficult it is for taxpayers to succeed in their contention) the greater will be the resulting instance of requests for private rulings. The consequence will be a move away from self-assessment.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is contrary to what we are arguing. Again, this concept of a reasonably arguable position will have the Government clawing concepts out of other jurisdictions, for example, the US revenue laws, but unfortunately applying harsher provisions without the hindsight or the experience of the overseas counterparts which may represent perhaps a more reasonable position. They may have been to the United States and the United States revenue authorities may feel that, in hindsight, their revenue laws have been a little harsh at 25 per cent rather than 20 per cent and in having a higher threshold before qualifying for this reasonably arguable position.

         We have been advised that, provided that the Australian Taxation Office acts in good faith and with goodwill and commonsense, the reasonably arguable position is quite acceptable despite the fact—I must stress that this is a real worry in this concept—that we are not treating all taxpayers in the same way. I think this is unfortunate. Certain taxpayers have a stronger obligation in terms of reasonable care than others and I think that, based on an amount of money, this is an unfair criterion for distinction.

         It has also been argued by one sector of the taxation industry that the phrase `reasonably arguable position' should be rejected and replaced by `reasonable care'. The concept of reasonable care comes up quite frequently. The reasonable care position is based on unfairness to the taxpayer and the tax agent. Many a taxpayer may not be in a position of being aware of all the circumstances relating to his or her case, which could be complicated by rebates and rulings in terms of when this threshold of $10,000 will apply.

         Not all tax agents are as aware of all the information and rules as others. Further, the everyday taxpayer would not be as knowledgeable as tax lawyers or tax agents. However, I think it will be interesting when the Tax Office issues its first culpability penalty. That indeed will be the subject of a proliferation of articles in legal and tax agents' journals. That will expose this whole concept of the reasonableness of this position, about which we do have some doubt.

         I must say that good arguments on both sides come to light. It is to be hoped that the Tax Office will adopt a reasonable approach, and that the sort of argument that John Howard put forward when he was first introducing part IVA provisions about 10 years ago will prevail. I believe that not only should the taxpayer, as the information paper of August 1991 states, `be acting in good faith', but also that the Australian Taxation Office itself will need to act in good faith. Because the system is so new, it is expected that there will be many defects in it. Therefore, in Peter Roach's words, the entire situation can be summed up by noting:

        In conclusion, I draw the Senate's attention to what I believe will be a proliferation of requests for rulings from the taxpaying community. I ask the Government to ensure that adequate resources are given to the Taxation Office so that taxpayers will not be disadvantaged by undue delay. I have drawn attention previously to what I regard as a very unfair system working in the Taxation Office, in terms of the quota of high level staff that it is permitted to employ under some union arrangements within the Public Service administration.

         Given the fact that the Taxation Office will be required to shed staff as part of its modernisation program, given that it has to pay efficiency dividends and the like, there is the strong possibility that it could lose personnel at the technical level, particularly in the national office, where there is a need to strengthen the resources of the Taxation Office. This current lack of resources, amongst other things, has delayed the implementation of self-assessment and is further putting back the clock in terms of the ability of the Taxation Office to proceed with the simplification of income tax. Simplification of the income tax law must go hand in hand with this self-assessment process. Self-assessment is one step forward.

         So again I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to review the quota arrangements. I know the Parliamentary Secretary has global budgets for wages and expenses, and there is certain interchange between the two, but there are definite problems in the technical categories, level A and the Senior Executive Service where restrictions are imposed on Mr Boucher in terms of his ability to recruit high level staff to cope with an increasing area of complexity in tax administration. I make this final appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary for the need to issue rulings in the light of self-assessment in terms of the application of part IVA of the general anti-avoidance provisions. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        I think that is a very reasonable statement. There are lovely little graphs in the explanatory memorandum. The test that is first to be applied if there is a tax shortfall is: did the taxpayer take reasonable care? What is the test and how is that test to be applied? The second test to be applied is: is the taxpayer's position reasonably arguable? The explanatory memorandum sets out the sorts of things that may be considered in determining, in a very subjective view, whether or not the taxpayer's position is reasonably arguable. Those things include virtually anything and everything that is said in this Parliament, previous rulings that have been made and future rulings that will be made. But the one thing that may not be considered is the opinion that the taxpayer may produce that has come from tax experts or senior counsel who have practised for years in the field. That is the sort of advice which this system says the taxpayer may not rely upon.

When we visited the national office, we found out that it will take 1,000 fewer officers to collect the revenue; that is, 1,000 officers will be surplus to requirements. But those officers will not be leaving the Tax Office, because there is a nice cosy arrangement with the unions that nobody actually loses his or her job. It was relying on natural attrition which was, prior to the recession we had to have, running at somewhere between 8 and 9 per cent. But we are in a recession, and it is now running at 3 per cent.

I do not quite remember when self-assessment was introduced, but it was quite a few years ago because I can remember former Senator Stone, as well as myself, commenting at the time that the horrendous legislation gave the taxpayer no protection whatsoever. We pointed out time and again that, with self-assessment, there were no private rulings. I do not know whether there were public rulings at the time, but there were definitely no private rulings.

         This system of self-assessment without private rulings led to many taxpayers paying too much tax. To prevent penalties, they had to err against themselves. The Senate does not have to take my word for that; it can take the word of those in the accounting profession around Australia which, if I may say, is a very noble profession. I believe that it is the right of all taxpayers to pay only the tax that is justifiably due and no more. As a result of the grey areas, they should leave a margin for error so that they do not fall into the net of the Commissioner of Taxation.

I understand that both the Commissioner and the taxpayer will have to stick to this Bill. I am also happy to see that there are reviewable private rulings in the legislation by which, if a person believes that the Commissioner's ruling is not correct, they can have the ruling reviewed.

         I want to leave a bit of time for Senator Kernot to contribute to the debate, but I must mention briefly that the legislation introduces a new system of penalties for understatement of income tax liability. The liabilities will be based on the requirement that taxpayers exercise reasonable care in carrying out their tax obligations. A more rigorous standard, the reasonably arguable position test, will apply to items which affect tax by more than $10,000.

         Senator Bishop asked what is a reasonably arguable position. I believe that if a taxpayer does not have a reasonably arguable position the book should be thrown at him. I presume that if a taxpayer has a reasonably arguable position he will go into a scheme with the best advice. So, if a taxpayer receives good advice and can document this advice from a reputable professional person, why should there be a penalty?

         Moving on to the penalties, on reading the schedule of penalty rates I found that they are quite horrendous and also leave quite a few grey areas. I will just run down the summary of rates of penalty. I have no argument with `deliberate evasion' which has a penalty rate of 75 per cent—then there are decreases and increases and that sort of thing. `Recklessness' has a penalty rate of 50 per cent. `Tax avoidance profit shifting' has a penalty rate of 50 per cent. `No reasonable care' has a penalty rate of 25 per cent. Where is the fine line between `recklessness' and `no reasonable care'? I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me that in his summing up. `Private ruling disregarded' has a penalty rate of 25 per cent. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me why that is 25 per cent. I believe that if a private ruling is disregarded it is far worse than having no reasonably arguable position and taking no reasonable care. Then the schedule refers to hindrances to disclosure, which I suppose is fair enough. I just cannot understand that summary, and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on the issues that I have raised. I believe the schedule leaves far too many grey areas, though they are less grey than before.

The Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill proposes to revolutionise and rationalise the system of penalties and rulings and the objection and amendment processes. Rising to Senator Panizza's challenge, I intend to be extremely brief in my comments. The Government has consulted widely on this. There have been a number of press releases and an information paper. The issues have been canvassed in great detail. The Australian Democrats support the legislation because it generally grants benefits to taxpayers. In particular, I commend the Government for finally introducing the concept of—

         —I think Senator Panizza has misunderstood what I have said. I commend the Government for  finally introducing the concept of legally binding rulings, both public and private. This is a long overdue step, and I acknowledge that I understand that it is a very major step for a government to take. The current situation is that rulings are an indication of the practice of the Commissioner of Taxation, except in some celebrated circumstances such as in respect of the Adelaide Steamship Co., but they do not have any legal effect. This meant that the Australian Taxation Office would give a ruling on a matter, often of great complexity and importance to the viability of a particular project, but with a caveat that the ruling was legally useless. This contributed to business uncertainty. This legislation will introduce the concept of legally binding rulings, both public and private, which will greatly assist in projects requiring certainty in taxation matters. This is particularly opportune at a time of low economic activity.

         There are also some radical changes in respect of the length of time in which taxpayers will be able to lodge objections to taxation assessments. There is a complete rewrite of the amendment provisions. We think that taxpayers will be generally advantaged by the new system of penalties, in particular the allowance of a tax deduction for interest charged on underpayments and late payments. The non-deductibility of these interest penalties, which has existed at the same time as payments made by the Commissioner to a taxpayer have been taxable, has been a matter for resentment by taxpayers for many years. I commend the Government for finally addressing this running sore.

         As Senator Watson has said, this legislation is the continuation of the process of self-assessment which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) initiated during his time as Treasurer. The general policy is one of accepting the claims of taxpayers and redirecting resources to the audit function. The Democrats support such a policy and we think it has resulted in a large amount of revenue being raised from the auditing of big business. But I acknowledge to Senator Panizza that there are risks in such a strategy as the recent debate within the Taxation Office, which was leaked to the public, has highlighted. Some senior taxation officials expressed concern, I understand, about a possible overclaiming of refunds of several hundred million dollars because returns are not being assessed in the old manner. I do not know the current status of this concern. No doubt there are some people who cheat on their tax responsibilities; but there are very administrative savings from this system.

         The Commissioner of Taxation stated in a speech to the Taxation Institute of Australia on 30 May this year that he would need an extra 13,400 employees to undertake the tasks that were formerly performed in the assessment stage. So in this Bill we have made a choice between those numbers and improved auditing resources. With good timing, I commend this Bill to the Parliament.

There is no way we could have continued to run the growing tax system under the mechanisms imposed by the previous legislation. In fact, we are not.

         I have a number of concerns. The Commissioner of Taxation is empowered to withdraw a private ruling without the consent of the rulee, even if the arrangement subject to the ruling has begun to be carried out where great disadvantage to a third party is likely to follow. I refer particularly to proposed new section 14ZAU(2)(b)(i), which refers to another person who will be disadvantaged if the ruling is not withdrawn. There is no guidance in the explanatory memorandum as to the type of person who might suffer detriment as a result of the private ruling having been given to the rulee. For example, can the Treasurer be another person for that purpose?

         For the purpose of the record, I might go through each of my questions because, if we do not have time, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) may have to take them on notice. We only have four minutes left for this debate and I have four more questions. There should be guidance in terms of the meaning of proposed new section 14ZAX. This relates to the effect of the withdrawal of a ruling deemed never to have been made. Can we have either an explanation or a ruling on that? I have a problem with page 5 of the explanatory memorandum, which says:

        While true from one perspective, this statement is at odds with section 170, which states, in express terms, that the Commissioner is merely empowered to amend; he is not obliged to do so. We have something of a conflict there. Finally, under proposed new section 14ZAN, the Commissioner does not have to deal with certain applications for private rulings. Proposed new section 14ZAN(d) deals with an application for a private ruling where a tax audit is being carried out. If a tax audit into a taxpayer's affairs does not cover a given year—for example, a year of income that has not yet commenced—being the year of income to which the application for a private ruling relates, then the application should be considered. Accordingly, it could be necessary to reword paragraph (d). I ask the Tax Office to look at that. I have a form of words, but I believe that the time for this debate has now expired.

         —I wish to speak briefly this evening on the Audit Report No. 41, tabled in the Senate today. This report is the project audit of the disability services program, concentrating on employment grants, community participation grants and protective security. This report is timely, given that the Government is in the midst of amending the Disability Services Act to extend the transition period for prescribed services, and drafting guidelines for the administration of funding under the Disability Services Act as well as national standards which will apply to all services in receipt of funding under the Disability Services Act.

         This report provides the Senate with an insight into the administrative difficulties entailed in implementing the Disability Services Act. Since its inception five years ago the Act has remained totally bereft of section 5 guidelines and concrete national standards for service providers.

         The project audit of the employment subprogram conducted by the Audit Office sought to:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . assess the effectiveness of the systems and procedures used by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to fulfil the requirements of the Disability Services Act. In particular, the audit focused on the adequacy of monitoring procedures and reporting requirements, including performance indicators and outcome standards, as well as the adequacy of departmental procedures and control over the payment and acquittal of grants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian National Audit Office has concluded that aspects of the administration of employment grants could be improved in a number of respects, particularly the procedures for determining whether grant recipients are meeting legislative requirements of the Disability Services Act. This is hardly surprising in the light of the fact that there are still no guidelines, despite the fact that the coalition has been calling for them for many years. In addition, given the ongoing confusion that has characterised the transition phase of this Act, I am sure that the vast majority of service providers, consumers, parents and advocates to whom I have spoken would wholeheartedly agree with the conclusion of the Audit Office.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I will turn to a number of the specific findings of the Audit Office in relation to the disability services program. In terms of the Department's efforts to attract appropriate applications from service providers, the ANAO found that grant recipients consisted mainly of groups with an historical association with the Department and questioned the manner in which the Department stimulated innovation and the establishment of new services, which is a key aspect of the Disability Services Act.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is a telling remark from the Auditor-General considering that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and the Department have long placed the blame for a lack of innovation and forward thinking on the service providers, particularly sheltered workshops. I have moved around sheltered workshops in a number of States. The complaint and concern expressed to me by the providers of those services is that they are the ones who have always been apportioned the blame.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, page 6 of the Audit Office report states that a number of the applications for funding support showed no indication of `adequate information gathered to establish eligibility, application and agreement forms, and grant approvals'. Such sloppy paperwork is totally unacceptable. I am sure that service providers who are forever complaining about the mountain of paperwork received from the Department would be aghast at this finding.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, and directly related to the need for national standards, the Auditor found instances where agreed outcomes were generic and not sufficiently specific, and where outcomes were expressed in terms of desirable goals rather than definite outcomes as required by the Disability Services Act.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Again, the major concern expressed to me by employment services providers has been that they are never certain whether they are complying with the requirements of the Act and the Department during the transition phase. Time and time again, I have been told that the goal posts have been moved without due consultation and good reason. The introduction of minimum enhanced and eligibility outcomes cannot come quickly enough for the majority of service providers.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Fourthly, and directly related to the need for the national standards, is the Auditor-General's recommendation on page 8 that:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . assessment guidelines and written administrative procedures be developed to facilitate and standardise the assessment of the extent to which organisations are meeting the objectives of the Disabilities Services legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        This recommendation was made in light of the fact that there were no guidelines whatsoever to indicate how reviewers from the Department would undertake evaluations of the various activities and achievements of the recipient organisations. Hopefully, this totally unacceptable situation will change with the formulation and implementation of the guidelines and standards.

         However, the Auditor-General's report and findings again highlight the environment of uncertainty and the administrative laxity in which the disabilities sector has been forced to operate since the enactment of the Disability Services Act—and this is a long time during which these service providers have been operating under a great deal of stress in the recession we had to have which Keating gave us, trying to find—

I am very sorry—the recession that Mr Keating said we had to have.

They have been trying to do that in this environment of uncertainty and administrative laxity.

         Much has been said both inside and outside the Parliament about the difficulties entailed in meeting the transition phase by 30 June 1992. Last November the Minister recognised that this deadline was totally unachievable due to the vast majority of services not being able to meet the criteria of the Act. He announced that there would be continued funding for services which have achieved certain specified minimum standards of service provision.

         The Auditor-General has found that reviews of employment services in relation to their fulfilling the transitional arrangements of the Act were backlogged in each of four States in which his audit was conducted. He quite rightly expressed concern that services are not being satisfactorily investigated and evaluated in relation to their achievement of the eligibility criteria required for continued funding subsequent to the transition phase. That is also a very telling finding from the Auditor-General as the Government has claimed that the reasons for the extension of the transition phase related to the minuscule number of services which have achieved eligibility status. What is being said is that we are going to have to extend the date because only a minuscule number of groups and organisations have achieved the standards. But the Auditor-General's reporting gives us to understand that the whole story was not told because the finding begs the question: is the extension of the transition phase due solely to the reasons put forward by the Government, or is it in fact that many services have actually complied with the Act but have simply not been properly evaluated by the Department?

         In the four States the Auditor-General looked at, there was a backlog. So on one hand the Government says, `We need to extend this because there has been only a minuscule number who have reached the standards', but on the other hand the Auditor-General is telling us that we have a backlog of organisations that have not been evaluated.

         Finally, the Audit Office noted that the DISCUS database, which has been established to record details of grant recipients together with financial information and data needed for the administration of the program, was deficient in a wide range of areas. I will list them because they are valuable. They include: errors in database information; inadequate recording or manual grant payments; no controls to detect or prevent duplicate payments of grants; the process of reconciling financial information in DISCUS with the financial ledger system is difficult and complicated; ongoing formal training for users of DISCUS as well as those responsible for input does not appear to be adequate; and, finally, the DISCUS system was inadequate in terms of detailing the achievement of outcomes and the undertaking of inspections.

         In recognition of the importance of Disability Services Act guidelines and national standards, the coalition will move amendments in the Senate to the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill to ensure that these standards and guidelines are given appropriate parliamentary scrutiny. At this time, negotiations are proceeding in relation to whether these guidelines and national standards should be amendable by the Federal Parliament, as has been proposed by the coalition. If ever there was evidence that these important standards and guidelines require the most careful and proper parliamentary scrutiny, this report is that evidence. We should not have a situation where the providers of those services are left with any uncertainty about what is required of them under the Disability Services Act.

The games were an outstanding success, and I would like to record my appreciation to all those who organised and participated in this great supporting event as well as to more than 1,000 local families who billeted young athletes and the many hundreds of Darwin citizens who gave of their time voluntarily to assist in the organisation.

         Launched in 1982, the Pacific School Games were first held as a lead-up to the Brisbane Commonwealth Games, with competitors coming from as far afield as Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and, of course, the Northern Territory. The event was a rousing success, prompting Victoria to pick up the Games for its 150th birthday celebrations in 1984. In 1988, Sydney marked its bicentennial year with a similar display of sport and sportsmanship. The fourth Pacific School Games in Darwin this year attracted 1,934 competitors from countries around the world, including the People's Republic of China, Russia, Thailand, Vanuatu, Canada, Hong Kong, Fiji and Japan.

         As the shadow Minister for community services, I am pleased to report that disabled athletes participated in the 1988 Games and again in Darwin this year. For example, in the athletics arena, 39 people with intellectual disabilities competed, 15 were visually impaired and 10 were wheelchair athletes. Similarly, in swimming, 31 were intellectually disabled, four were visually impaired and 14 were wheelchair competitors.

         The Pacific School Games aim to give students who excel in athletics, gymnastics and swimming the opportunity to develop their skills in the international arena.

         Honourable senators would be aware that on previous occasions in this place and during the Senate Estimates committee process I have raised a number of concerns regarding the proposal by the Attorney-General's Department to introduce a law enforcement access network, commonly known as LEAN. LEAN will provide the Attorney-General's Department and a number of other Commonwealth and State government departments with access to data concerning property ownership and company involvement of individuals throughout the community.

         I am somewhat disappointed that I have as yet been unable to obtain any estimate as to the likely cost of the system. Officers from the Attorney-General's Department indicated to my office that they were reluctant to provide this information because the provision of the expensive computers necessary to run the program is currently the subject of a tender process. Whilst I appreciate that it would be unwise to prejudice the tender process, I trust that the Government will appreciate that it is very difficult for those of us on this side of the House to make some preliminary judgments about the system when we simply do not know how much it will cost.

         Honourable senators would appreciate that the LEAN system opens up the prospect of speculative data matching. Naturally, this causes concern for the Privacy Commissioner. Essentially, speculative matching would be simple random matching, which means that it could be possible for individuals who were not under investigation at all to come under scrutiny. LEAN opens the whole issue of re-use of publicly collected data for intentions other than the original use for which it was provided.

         As a parliament, I believe we need to ask ourselves the question as to whether publicly available information should be made accessible for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected. Surely individuals have a right to know the full extent of how information which they provide on themselves willingly for one purpose may be used for another purpose. This is an area of the Privacy Act which requires reassessment by the Government.

         Another area where the Privacy Act is inadequate in relation to LEAN is that State police forces and State tax offices who will have access to the LEAN information on individuals may not in fact be strictly bound by the Privacy Act. Although the participating State authorities will be required to sign a memorandum of understanding regarding the use and access of LEAN information, they nevertheless will not be strictly bound by the Act, and here again there is the potential for misuse. There is also the potential which will exist for departments, such as the Department of Social Security, to pull together information from their own sources and also from the LEAN network to create huge databases on individuals. Again it is a matter which needs to be clarified.

         —Much criticism is directed against unions. Too often it is unfair, unbalanced and defamatory of a great many workers. Critics condemn employees and their organisations for seeking better conditions, for fighting to preserve their rights, for striving to keep their unions strong. Rebukers paint workers as greedy, irresponsible and aggressive. Unions are regularly blamed for industrial disputes. Those who make these accusations generate much ill-will towards a great many honourable men and women. They cause authorities charged with the keeping of law and order to misdirect their endeavours. They help create an industrial culture where workers become scapegoats, where people are wrongly charged with offences, where witnesses are persuaded to give false evidence.

         Matters to do with the Camperdown abattoir in Victoria supply a most unhappy example of what I am saying. Members of a picket line established outside those works were treated quite outrageously. They were subjected to the terror of facing a criminal court; they were reviled and denigrated; they were made to suffer for actions of which they were innocent. Camperdown is in the western part of Victoria. Police there were used by others for perverted purposes, and I use the adjective advisedly. There was an attempt to pervert the machinery of the law.

         —As Senator Tate has said, it is reminiscent of the sorts of things that happened at APPM in Burnie. Charges laid against members of the picket line at the Camperdown abattoirs failed to lead to the conviction of any. Six of the cases were dismissed with costs of over $18,000 awarded against the police. The rest were withdrawn.

         People charged with offences must be happy when they are dismissed, but that does not save them from the anxiety and the distress brought to them by the service of information on them. Why were the picketers and the police used in this way? Who sought to employ the anti-union, anti-worker culture in some parts of society as a vehicle to gain some advantage for themselves? The resolution of those questions appears to be a sad and alarming one.

         The picket line was legal and its members had every right to be where they were. It was established by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, a duly registered organisation under the Industrial Relations Act. Its purpose was to protest against the use by the abattoirs of contract labour supplied by Troubleshooters Available. The abattoirs was run by a company called Famicorp Pty Ltd. The person who controlled it was a Mr Farouk Fami. A firm of solicitors, namely Kroger and Kroger, was instructed to act on behalf of the corporation. A Mr Warwick Leeson, who described himself as a private inquiry agent, was in turn engaged by or through the lawyers to work at the Camperdown Meat Works on behalf of their client.

         The first of the picketers brought before the court was Shane Francis Reilly. He was charged with hindering police. Mr Leeson, a Constable Bowman and an Inspector Meehan gave evidence against him. A film of the event involved showed their testimony to be false. The case was dismissed with costs against the police.

         Matters worthy of profound concern arose during the cross-examination of Mr Leeson. It appears he was sent to Camperdown to gather evidence for use against the picketers and the union in legal proceedings along the lines of Mudginberri or Dollar Sweets, as he himself said. It was suggested in cross-examination of Mr Leeson that he was to provoke the picketers into action which would then form the basis for such proceedings. He denied this, but his testimony supports the validity of that suggestion.

        It is cause for some alarm that these events took place. I want to make just a short comment because it is the end of the day and people want to go. It is right and proper for a person to take legal proceedings seeking remedies for the unlawful acts of others. It is wrong to seek an ulterior end through the perverse use of manufactured evidence whether that be obtained by provoking actions that would otherwise not take place or, as seems to be the case here, by simply giving false testimony.

        It should be noted that where a civilian employee of the Commonwealth is not a member of either the CSS or the PSS, he or she would be entitled to a minimum level of employer superannuation support, currently the three per cent productivity benefit.  Generally such employees have this support provided through the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust (AGEST) or another industry fund approved by the Minister for Finance.  AGEST currently has around 55,000 accounts of which around 25,000 are active accounts.

        Because the PSS is a fully defined benefit scheme and the CSS in part defined benefit, it is impossible to specify the total employer subsidy in respect of each employee.  The subsidy would depend on a number of factors, such as age of entry, age of exit, rate of salary increase, earnings on funded contributions, etc.  By making assumptions as to the unknown factors, actuaries estimate the overall employer rate that might be required to fund the benefits.

        (5) The scheme administrators have little need to record employment status because, once a person becomes a member, employment status is largely irrelevant for scheme purposes.  However, where the employment status affects the calculation of benefits, eg pro rata benefits for part-time staff, it is possible that some presumption of employment status could be made by examining each record held.  The number of part-time employees (including part-time casual employees) in the CSS and PSS would constitute less than 10 per cent of the combined 218,000 member population.  The other types of employment status are not relevant for superannuation purposes and so are not recorded in the scheme administrator's records.
