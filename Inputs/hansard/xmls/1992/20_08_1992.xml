       Sales Tax Simplification Legislation

       Dear Member,
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We the undersigned are writing to you to voice our strong objection to the proposed "Sales Tax Simplification".
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Our main concern is that if this legislation is implemented a major industry (and therefore jobs) will cease to exist.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       To quote from a V.A.C.C. letter dated 29 July 1992 to all farm machinery dealers the F.M.D.A. "estimates this impost alone will cause up to 150 dealers to close their doors putting as many as 2000 people out of work in rural Australia".
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       This proposal will further diminish the strength of the Farm Machinery Industry; an industry whose owners and employees are already struggling in these current economic times. The number of businesses has already fallen from a high of 2400 dealerships in 1984 to a current number of approximately 800. (Figures as supplied by V.A.C.C.).
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       With the forecast closure of a further 150 dealerships the industry will have effectively been reduced by nearly 75% in the past 8 years.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       At a time when job creation is first and foremost in the minds of both public and politicians it seems ludicrous that this proposal may cause many hundreds of hardworking and specially trained people to join the growing ranks of the unemployed—not to mention the effect to supporting businesses.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       As everyday working class people we find it difficult to comprehend why a revenue raising industry will be further sacrificed to prop up our failing economy. Where will it all end?
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We hope you will express these concerns to the Senate and do your utmost to quash this proposal being implemented.

       We, the undersigned, formally notify you of our objection to the proposed Federal Government National Accreditation system for child care centres in Australia. The system is unworkable and unrealistic in terms of what it will supposedly achieve for our children. It will result in the reduction of valuable child care places (at a time when it is reported that there is a crying need for more child care places) and a galloping increase in child care fees for all parents, either on fee relief or not. At no time has the Federal Government sought our opinion as parents, nor consulted us on what we want or feel are accepted standards. Quality child care cannot be legislated for—it comes from the heart. The Interim National Accreditation Council system is neither workable or affordable.

       We will not allow elitism, in the form of a star rating system to invade the child care arena. All children in Australia are entitled to affordable quality child care and we will under no circumstances accept the National Accreditation system proffered by the Interim National Accreditation Council.

         The Keating Ministry recently `pushed' legislation through our Parliament in public obediance to a foreign power whilst under `threat'. It is my will that the Laws of our Commonwealth and its written Constitution be upheld per s.44 in this and associated matters and the original jurisdiction of the High Court also be upheld as is my Right in all this if such becomes necessary. The Constitution is clear that such matters are for "trial by jury", and with no Referendum to the contrary we can indeed be grateful that such public accountability remains beyond debate.

         The Committee is seeking this extension for two basic reasons. The first is that of its 17 terms of reference, seven remain to be reported on. The outstanding issues include taxation arrangements, matters relating to the vesting and preservation of benefits, lump sums and annuities, the inter-relationship of superannuation with the age pension, implications for the financial system, and a number of consumer issues. All these are matters of great importance and all have their difficulties and pitfalls.

        Since the Committee started work a year ago, it has produced an information paper
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Super System Survey
        </emphasis>
        which described retirement income practices in 21 overseas countries. It has tabled two reports—Safeguarding Super and Super Guarantee Bills and a discussion paper
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Super Charges

        . The Chairman has made two statements in the Senate on matters arising in the course of the Committee's work.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        After the Committee was established, the Government released major policy statements on prudential supervision of superannuation funds, information to be provided to fund members, the proposed superannuation guarantee levy and, on 30 June last, a comprehensive statement on
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Security in Retirement

        . The Superannuation Guarantee legislation was introduced and passed.

        None of these developments had been foreshadowed at the time the Committee was formed and all have added to its workload.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee's work, and in particular its reports and other pronouncements, have greatly stimulated public interest in superannuation. Submissions are still being received and now number 238. Many of these record complaints covering a wide range of topics and have tended to place the Committee in the role of consumer advocate.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The remaining terms of reference go to the heart of the design of superannuation schemes and the development of appropriate government policies. Many aspects of them are technically complex and all are politically sensitive. If the Committee is to make a worthwhile and lasting contribution in this area it will need to proceed with thoroughness and caution.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government has indicated its adoption in principle of the Committee's first report Safeguarding Super which recommended the implementation of a wide range of prudential controls over the establishment, administration and investment activities of superannuation funds in the interests of safeguarding members' assets. The Committee believes that it should play a part in the examination of the Government's response in the light of the experience it has gained during the conduct of its inquiries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Legislation will be required to implement the Government's decisions, probably resulting in the further reference of bills to the Committee.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the light of these considerations, the Committee feels that an extension of its reporting time to 14 December is warranted and seeks the agreement of the Senate to this course.

        This Bill proposes to ensure the validity of amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations to reflect the superannuation guarantee arrangements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On the basis of legal advice, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 (SG Bill) was not presented to the Governor-General on 30 June 1992. That advice indicated that it would not be appropriate to seek Royal Assent owing to the fact that the SG Bill was not passed in identical form by both Houses of Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Legal advice on 30 June was that the amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations could proceed and could come into effect from 1 July 1992 even though the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill had not been enacted.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That advice was on the basis that 1 July 1992 would be the commencement date for the SG Bill, when it was enacted, and that it would follow that the commencement date of the amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations would be 1 July 1992.
       </para>

        Subsequent legal advice raised doubt about the validity of this approach. In consequence, the government decided to introduce the present Bill to place beyond doubt the validity of the amendments to the regulations from 1 July 1992.

        NATIONAL PARKS AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Since the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 came into effect there has been increasing recognition for the need to effectively manage the marine environment. The extent of this area is significant. The Australian Fishing Zone occupies a larger area than Australia itself and the Commonwealth Government is responsible for managing the majority of this area.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Marine areas differ from terrestrial areas in terms of their management requirements. The migratory nature of many marine species, the seasonal shifts in currents and nutrients, and the ease of transport of pollutants such as oil and the relatively limited knowledge we have of marine systems requires that comprehensive legal and management programs be developed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed amendments to be included in the Bill are intended to ensure that the enforcement provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 are adequate for the purpose of protecting those marine reptiles, birds and mammals to which Part III of the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations applies, by making the powers in the Act consistent with, and no less stringent than, the enforcement powers in the Whale Protection Act 1980 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The need for the amendments arises from the agreement by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that it is inappropriate for management of marine mammals and marine reptiles to be under commercial fisheries legislation, and that responsibility for those animals should be transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The Fisheries Management Act specifies that the term "fish" does not include marine reptiles or marine mammals, unlike the former Fisheries Act, and it is now necessary to ensure that the provisions of the NPWC Act are adequate to protect those species of animals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Paragraph 71(2)(b) of the Act provides for the making of regulations for the protection and conservation of wildlife and subsection 3(1) specifies that the term "wildlife" includes animals and plants that are indigenous to the continental shelf of Australia or the superjacent waters. Those provisions of the Act are implemented through Part III of the National Parks and Wildlife Regulations, which applies in or on the continental shelf of Australia, the superjacent waters, the sea-bed and subsoil beneath those waters and the airspace above those waters. Part III protects specified animals and plants and provides for a licensing system administered by the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. In general, a licence to kill, take, keep, sell or purchase a protected animal or protected plant may only be issued for the purpose of scientific research, educational study or non-commercial propagation. Exemptions to some of the provisions of Part III apply to traditional Aboriginal hunting and to certain aspects of licensed commercial fishing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The animals protected under Part III of the Regulations are listed on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the Regulations. Currently, the groups of species covered by those Schedules comprise sea snakes, seals and birds. Arrangements are in hand to add turtles, crocodiles and dugong to the Schedules in the near future, through an amendment to the NPW Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        With sea snakes, turtles, crocodiles, birds, seals and dugong protected by Part III of the Regulations, and whales and dolphins protected by the Whale Protection Act 1980, all marine reptiles, birds and mammals will receive protection in Commonwealth Waters under legislation administered by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For logistical reasons, and for efficient use of resources, enforcement of that legislation will in many cases be delegated to officers from Commonwealth or State fisheries or nature conservation agencies, who will receive appropriate appointments under the Commonwealth legislation. For example, a group of officers from the Victorian Department of Conservation and Environment has already received appointments as inspectors under the Whale Protection Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill proposes the creation of a new category of enforcement officer with powers of enforcement able to be limited so that they apply only to offences against specific regulations in Part III of the NPW Regulations. The new category of enforcement officer is to be known as a wildlife inspector.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because Part III of the Regulations and the Whale Protection Act complement each other in the protection of marine mammals, the enforcement powers available under those pieces of legislation need to be consistent. Furthermore, because the protection of such species of marine wildlife as turtles and dugong is being transferred to Part III of the Regulations from the former Fisheries Act, the powers of enforcement should be at least as stringent as they were under that legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Effective enforcement requires that officers have powers to arrest without a warrant, seize evidence, and search a vehicle, aircraft or vessel in connection with an offence. Under the Whale Protection Act and the Fisheries Management Act, enforcement officers have powers of that kind. Under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, however, those powers are only available to wardens in Australia and in the Australian coastal sea. Amendments proposed in the Bill are intended to extend the application of those powers to the continental shelf, so that wardens and wildlife inspectors can use those powers when enforcing Part III of the Regulations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to achieve consistency with the Whale Protection Act, the Bill will provide wardens and wildlife inspectors with the power to require a person in charge of a vessel to give information concerning the vessel and its crew and any person on board the vessel.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In order to achieve consistency with the former Fisheries Act and the current Fisheries Management Act, the Bill will provide wardens and wildlife inspectors with the power, pursuant to the consent of the owner or occupier of the land or premises or under a warrant, to enter and search land or premises where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there may be evidence as to the commission of an offence.

         The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the basis on which research levies on grain legumes are paid to be changed from a specific rate per tonne to an ad valorem rate. At present, the Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985 (the Act) provides for the imposition of levies, on specified grain legumes, at flat rates per tonne of seed as recommended by the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) which is the representative organisation under the Act. These can be increased by regulation up to a maximum rate also specified in the Act. The levy rate for most grain legumes is currently $1.25 per tonne. Peanuts are levied at $2 per tonne and navy beans at $5 per tonne. The levies attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The change is being implemented at the request of the GCA and is intended to make the collection arrangements more equitable. The ad valorem levies proposed would ensure that growers' contribution to research is proportional to their net return for the particular crop grown. The GCA has recommended an initial operative levy rate of 1 per cent of the net farm gate value and a maximum rate of 3 per cent.

         The Government made a commitment, in 1985, to match expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production (GVP) of the relevant commodity. This policy was reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement, "Research, Innovation and Competitiveness".

         The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the basis on which research levies on oilseeds are paid to be changed from a specific rate per tonne to an ad valorem rate. At present, the Oilseeds Levy Act 1977 (the Act) provides for the imposition of levies, on specified oilseeds, at a flat rate per tonne of seed as recommended by the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) which is the representative organisation under the Act. This rate can be increased by regulation up to a maximum rate also specified in the Act. The levy rate for all oilseeds is currently $1.55 per tonne. The levies attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989.

         The change is being implemented at the request of the GCA and is intended to make the collection arrangements more equitable. The ad valorem levies proposed would ensure that growers' contribution to research is proportional to their net return for the particular crop grown. The GCA has recommended an initial operative levy rate of 1 per cent and a maximum rate of 3 per cent.

         The Government made a commitment, in 1985, to match expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production (GVP) of the relevant commodity.

        I would like to pick up briefly on a remark that Senator Baume made in relation to one of the Acts under consideration for amendment, that is, the National Gallery Act. As Senator Baume quite rightly pointed out, this Bill will change the name of the Australian National Gallery and this could entail a considerable cost for the ANG in changing its mastheads, letterheads and so forth. I think it is rather strange that the explanatory memorandum says that there will be no financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this Bill. I fail to see how a name change of this magnitude will not entail financial obligations on the gallery as it seeks to change its mast-heads, letterheads, and so forth, to comply with the new legislation. Perhaps the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) could give us some financial details as to what it would cost the gallery to change these things in line with this name change.

        The Bill also repeals the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests (Commission of Inquiry) Act 1987 and the States Grants (Air Quality Monitoring) Act 1986. The section related to the ACT vests in the National Capital Planning Authority, from DASET, the management of Commonwealth national land acquired for the special purposes of Canberra as the national capital, with the approval of the Minister.

        In the opinion of the Australian Democrats, this provision is to be supported and represents a further devolution of land management from the Department to the National Capital Planning Authority. This, we believe, should enable the NCPA to more effectively manage Territory affairs under its control, rather than through constant reference to the Department where national land is concerned. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        There is not much more that needs to be said on that, but before resuming my seat I want to highlight a suggestion that has been doing the rounds in Canberra that possibly Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory should be nominated for World Heritage listing. That proposal is around. It is one that I guess will come to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in the not too distant future. I just alert Canberrans to the matter so that they may give it some thought and possibly have some input into whether the Australian Capital Territory and Canberra should be listed for World Heritage listing.

        I am not quite sure what that would mean. I am not quite sure whether it would require the consent and concurrence of the ACT Assembly or of this Federal Parliament, because the Minister does seem to have a lot of power in determining things that happen with Canberra as a Territory. I alert the Parliament to the difficulties with World Heritage listing of the North Queensland rainforest and the severe curtailment that was put on any activity in those areas as a result of World Heritage listing.

        I am not quite sure what World Heritage listing would mean for Canberra. I am not sure that too many others are too certain about what would happen. But if it followed World Heritage listing of other parts of Australia, it could mean that we would have to apply to the United Nations or to the World Heritage Commission or advisory body to get permission to do anything at all within Canberra. If we wanted to build a road, construct a fowl house or build a new Foreign Affairs building—things like that—maybe we would have to go overseas to seek permission; I do not know. Certainly, in the World Heritage listed rainforests, if one wants to do anything at all, one has to go through a series of people to try to get permission.

        It is one of those things where a lot of people will say that it is taking sovereignty out of the hands of Australians. I accept that with the World Heritage listings of the rainforests there was an exclusion clause saying that development of a particularly important national nature could go ahead in the rainforest areas, provided the Australian Government approved. But it is all one of these things that comes from overseas; it is determined from overseas. One just wonders whether our national capital should be put in a position of in some way, however lightly, being subject to decisions from other people on what should possibly happen in our national capital.

        However, I wish to respond to the one substantive point that was made by Senator Baume in the debate last night, that is, the question of the changes to be made to appointments. At present the Chairperson and some members of the Australia Council are appointed by the Governor-General acting with the Minister's advice. But because chairpersons of the Council boards are appointed by the Minister and are ex-officio members of the Council, these other members of the Council are effectively appointed to the Council by the Minister alone. I think Senator Baume conceded last night that that in itself made sense. It is considered more logical, and less expensive for administration, for the Council's Chairperson to be appointed by the Governor-General and for all other Council members and board members to be appointed by the Minister, or by the Council as the Minister's delegate. Thus the change from Governor-General to Minister in this Bill is addressed to the special structure of the Australia Council. The Government has not decided to apply it in a general way to other statutory authorities in the remainder of the portfolio. If the Government were to do that, of course, the Government would introduce all the amendments at once.

         —I just restate what I said briefly in the second reading debate—that we oppose but will not divide on the amendment seeking to change only the Australia Council and not all other similar bodies, that is, the method of appointment by the Minister rather than the Governor-General. That is in the absence, in our view, of any argued case, despite what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) said. I do not look forward to a series of amendments, but we will no doubt get them because that has been the pattern of change to these items of legislation in recent times.

         Also, we will oppose but not divide on the other matter of the name change from the Australian National Gallery to the National Gallery of Australia which, with the National Gallery of Victoria, will make it even more confusing, we believe. We will not oppose other amendments, even though we lodge our protest at the fact, firstly, that one of the amendments relates to yet another drafting error; secondly, one of the amendments relates to changing—in the case of the National Parks and Wildlife Service—the financial limits for independent action. These were changed, I think, in a couple of bites last year for every other segment of this Department's enormous activities. As I said in the second reading debate, it would be very nice if this Department could get its act together and do it all in one go. But while we oppose those two particular amendments, we do not intend to divide on them.

         —The six Bills which are the subject of this debate are six sales tax Bills which purport to re-write the sales tax legislation of this country, legislation which has been in existence since 1930 and which, of course, has been amended from time to time—indeed, many times—over the ensuing 60 years but which has now been subject to the most thorough ongoing review in the 60 years of its existence.

         There are at the moment something like 27 Acts of Parliament relating to sales tax, and the six Bills that are the subject of this debate today are the rewrite in essence of that existing legislation following review of it, essentially by the Australian Taxation Office. I will come back to the consultation process in a moment.

         The genesis of these Bills came in the 1990 Budget when the Government announced that it would be undertaking a review of the sales tax law with a view to simplifying it. To use the Government's words, the whole thing was supposed to be purely `a simplification process'. What, I think, this debate will clearly demonstrate and what the work of the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation, which has met in recent weeks, will demonstrate is that the proposed legislation, far from being a true simplification of the main concerns and complexities of sales tax law in Australia, will be at least as complex as the preceding legislation and will not really solve the grave complexity of issues that are inherent in any wholesale sales tax regime.

         That, I might say at the start of this debate, is absolutely the reason why the coalition, on coming to government at the next election, will abolish the existing wholesale sales tax regime, whether it be the existing 27 Acts or, if these six Bills get through the Parliament, the consequential six Acts, because a wholesale sales tax regime is fundamentally flawed. If we have a wholesale sales tax regime, we inevitably get in it the problems of anomalies, inconsistencies and complexities that have bedevilled the sales tax system in this country for so many years at such cost and inequity to the whole of the Australian community.

         We will be abolishing whatever sales tax regime we inherit and, as part of a major reform of the taxation system in Australia generally, we will be replacing it with a goods and services tax, which, by its very nature, will remove automatically virtually all of the inequities and inefficiencies of a wholesale sales tax regime. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax system and its replacement by a goods and services tax regime, which is a value added tax regime, will be only part of a major tax reform in Australia that will include an average reduction across the board of personal income tax, targeting particularly lower and middle income earners, of 30 per cent.

         The third main string to the tax reform—the first being GST and the second being income tax—is the abolition of no fewer than seven taxes that now are imposed on business in this country, at very great cost to our whole cost structure and therefore to our competitiveness as a nation. The present tax structure in Australia is very negative in terms of encouraging competition amongst Australian industries and in terms of their ability to compete overseas in export markets and to compete in the domestic market against imports. It is a major drag on the Australian economy. It is a major drag on our productivity. It is a major drag on our investment. It is therefore a major cause of the absolutely horrendous unemployment situation that we have in this nation today.

         That is the backdrop to the six sales tax Bills that we have before us today. The Bills are said to represent the Government's attempt to simplify the horrendously complex, gargantuan, archaic, arcane, regressive, unfair and anomaly ridden wholesale sales tax system. If I have not already made it clear enough, let me make it absolutely clear at the outset that the Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to the Bills and will vote against them, even as they are now proposed to be amended very substantially by the Government. We will come back to that on many occasions in this debate.

         The fact is that the six Bills before the Senate at the moment, which were rammed through the House of Representatives in 45 minutes flat by the use of the guillotine in the dying days of the last sittings, are to be massively amended and indeed emasculated by many of the changes proposed by the Government following its extensive two-year review. The Government is now backing off. It has pulled its head in. It is proposing to eliminate quite major sections of these Bills. So we are going to see a very emasculated and therefore a very messy, equally inequitable and inefficient system replacing the one that we already have.

         The Government claims that these Bills represent a major overhaul of the existing sales tax law. The Government claims that the result is a major simplification of the system. Certainly the Taxation Office has laboured long in its work on this matter. The simplification review was first announced by the Government in the August Budget of 1990 and it was only on 2 April this year, in a press release by the Treasurer, that the results of that review were announced. The legislation itself did not come immediately into the House of Representatives; it was not seen for the first time until 26 May. It was guillotined through the House of Representatives in the most brutal, undemocratic, unparliamentary way, with no opportunity for debate, no opportunity for consideration or input by those millions of Australians who are going to be affected by these changes.

         The results of these labours—which have been largely in-house with virtually no real consultation with the clients of the system, those who are actually going to have to pay tax, the tax practitioners who advise those who pay the tax, and so on; I will come back to that lack of consultation—certainly do represent an overhaul of the existing system. It is an overhaul which has not removed many, if any, of the fundamental weaknesses in the system.

         Prima facie, those results may be interpreted by some to have included some simplification in the sense that it is now proposed that we will have six Acts of Parliament rather than the 27 Acts which deal exclusively with sales tax, but that does not, in itself, mean that the real end result is the true simplification of the wholesale sales tax regime. The main problem with the wholesale sales tax regime, so far as its complexity, its confusion and its inequity are concerned, relates to the area of exemptions and classifications. How can one product, one good, be classified as having a particular rate of sales tax applying to it?

         We have a multi-rate system. There are five rates of sales tax: zero, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. In many cases the dividing line, in terms of defining a product as to whether it should be eligible for a 10 per cent rate, a 20 per cent rate or a 30 per cent rate, is very fine indeed. Most of the cost and the complexity in the system arises from the classification process and the process of exemption from sales tax at all. Again we have problems of definition. They are the real problems in the sales tax system, not the fact that there were 27 Acts and there are now going to be six Acts. The exemption and classification problems within the sales tax system have not been tackled at all in the review that the Tax Office has undertaken.

         The Bills were rushed through the House of Representatives without any consideration. They were to have been allocated a brief four hours for debate in the Senate in the dying days of the last sittings, because the Government was at great pains to push the legislation through the Parliament so that it could have an operative starting tax collection date of 1 September or 1 October. The Government was going to apply the same guillotine process to these Bills in the Senate as it did in the House of Representatives. The coalition was violently opposed to this and I welcome the support that we received from the Australian Democrats for the establishment of a Senate select committee to examine those Bills. That examination has taken place over the recess.

         I must temper my expression of pleasure at the support of the Democrats by being bitterly critical of the fact that they were not prepared to support the coalition in having a suitably lengthy timetable for the consideration of the Bills. Instead, they supported a request by the Government that the Select Committee report by yesterday, 19 August. That gave the Committee a period of only six weeks from go to whoa to establish itself, to advertise its existence, to call for submissions, to receive submissions, to conduct the public hearings, to prepare the report, produce it, agree on it and table it in the Parliament. That was an impossibly tight timetable.

         As a result, the report that I think was tabled in the Senate yesterday by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Walsh, is in my view very inadequate. That is no reflection on the secretariat that laboured very hard and long to support us and which was cooperative in the extreme. But that secretariat was given—as were we members of the Committee—a totally impossible timetable and, as a result, our consideration of the Bills suffered mightily. I believe that the Australian taxpayer will pay the consequences of that as well, to a large degree, because we have not done the job that the Senate mandated us to do. Indeed, we had only two days of public hearings, which took place last Wednesday and Thursday, 12 and 13 August.

         At 6 p.m. on the night of 11 August, the Treasurer put out a very skinny three-page press statement which heralded major changes in six areas that the review and the Bills that the Committee was to consider had covered. There were no amendments available for the Committee to look at the following morning and, indeed, they did not turn up at all during those two days. So the Committee was working very much with one hand tied behind its back because of the changes foreshadowed by the Treasurer, but without the specific details of those changes in the form of the amendments and, indeed, with the other hand tied behind its back because of the impossibly tight time constraints that we had.

         Before the establishment of the Select Committee, after the brutal guillotining of the legislation through the House of Representatives, the coalition had representations flooding into us expressing grave concern about both the thrust and the detail of the Government's changes as outlined in the six original Bills. The Senate Select Committee had similar representations flooding into it. Indeed, in the space of the very tight 2 1/2 weeks that the Australian community had to make their submissions to the Committee, despite that tight timetable, we received no fewer than 150 submissions. That reflected the very grave concern, community wide, about the proposals before the Senate then and now, despite the changes that the Government is proposing.

         Those representations came from a very wide spectrum of the community. They came from the manufacturing sector, the retail sector, consumers, legal and accounting practitioners, large and small businesses, the finance sector, the oil companies, the architectural and design professionals, and on and on it went. The extremely large number of differing concerns from this very wide range of representations did not involve merely matters of detail. They included, and still include, grave concerns about the fact that 250,000 farmers, for many of whom present incomes are negative, will be brought into the sales tax net for the first time.

         They include the fact that probably another quarter of a million business people, who are not at the moment required to register for sales tax purposes, will have to register in order to obtain various exemptions in terms of business inputs. In other words, the sales tax net is going to extend to include up to or perhaps even more than half a million more taxpayers than it now covers. If that is not bureaucracy gone mad and if that is not the tax system gone mad, I would like to know what is.

         The other concerns that came in included grave concerns about the possibility that many taxpayers would be hit for substantial retrospective liabilities of tax, and tax penalties. A leading member of one of Australia's largest and most respected accounting firms has described the Government's proposals as providing a `recipe for uncertainty and confusion' and as leading `to a great number of distortions and to many unintended consequences'.

         Grave concern was expressed in many quarters about the powers that the original Bills conferred on the Australian Taxation Office, including the quite draconian penalties that the Taxation Office could impose. The Business Council of Australia, for example, described the Bills as conferring absurd and dangerous powers on the Tax Office, `enabling it to deem facts to suit its case regardless of the actual facts'. The Business Council claimed that the Bills, `with their Orwellian overtones, would grant the bureaucracy powers that are simply unacceptable in a democratic society'.

         There will be significant amendments proposed to the Bills but I do not think the underlying intent will change. Under the Bills as originally drafted, the Taxation Commissioner certainly would have had enormous powers, not just to impose draconian penalties on people but also to exercise enormous powers of interpretation. I take as an example proposed new section 92 of the Bill as drafted when it came into the Senate and as it read when it was brutally guillotined through the House of Representatives.

         Proposed new section 92 gives the Tax Commissioner the power to cancel tax benefits obtained by avoidance. That is fair enough; there is no dispute at all about that in principle. Let us look, however, at the power of interpretation or determination that subsection (2) of proposed new section 92, as drafted when it came into this place, conferred on the Commissioner. If the Select Committee had not been established to consider these Bills, this proposed new subsection would actually be law:

         The Government will no doubt argue, and has argued, that that wording and the general anti-avoidance provision from which it comes is based on part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That was the original argument, I think, but the comparison is quite misleading. Section 177D of the Income Tax Assessment Act lists eight criteria which must be satisfied before part IVA applies. In the original sales tax Bills no such criteria were included. I am pleased to note, as I understand it, that objective criteria will now be included. But again I come back to the fact that that was not the Australian Tax Office's or the Government's approach and that it was only through enormous community concern and concern expressed by the Liberal and National parties that that change has been made, although, as I say, it in no way changes the basic underlying intent of the section. I will be asking questions and seeking total confirmation, in the committee stage of this debate, as to whether the revised general anti-avoidance procedure provisions of the Act do, in fact, totally exclude the prospect of catching up normal commercial transactions. We will be seeking a total assurance from the Government on that account.

         Setting all that aside, the fact is that these Bills generally reflect a government which, despite all its rhetoric, is profoundly hostile to business. It is, in effect, profoundly hostile to the activities of the great majority of the population—those millions of Australians who generate most of our national income. Our national income is not generated by us politicians, or by the bureaucrats in Canberra or elsewhere around Australia. The income, wealth, jobs and prosperity of this country are generated by those businesses and those business people—large and, particularly, small businesses—around the nation who are striving simply to be able to do what they can do best, free of the encumbrances and interferences and Orwellian involvements of government in their activities.

In addition to these sales tax Bills, to which I will return later, we have Senator Cook introducing legislation to meet the dictates of his old union bosses in the Building Workers Industrial Union—a union of which he is still a member. How is that for a conflict of interest?

Sometime in 1985, in the other place, the Treasurer of the time, who is now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said that the sales tax system was old and archaic and it was time for it to be changed. It is a pity he was not successful in his own Caucus and party room in bringing that forward and giving us a goods and services tax instead of the sales tax because it would have saved us a lot of work today in dealing with this mishmash of sales tax legislation.

         Sales tax was introduced into Australia 60 years ago, in the 1930s, in the time of the Depression, as a temporary tax on luxuries. One can see what it has grown into now. What is more, can anyone say that the luxuries of the 1930s are the luxuries of today? I do not think that anything now can be regarded as the luxury it was in the 1930s. Women's jewellery would have been a luxury in the 1930s but it certainly is not now; it is just part of everyday life.

         Let us look at what the sales tax system has grown into. It is absolutely hopeless to administer. It is absolutely hopeless to work with for anyone in business, as I am. For example, to go back to the luxuries under the temporary system that was brought in in the 1930s, a car would have been a luxury in 1930, but does anyone in this chamber now say that a car is a luxury? Perhaps the Government has defined anything over $43,736.56 as a luxury because one might not need quite that sort of car and it has its own sales tax regime and depreciation treatment. A car is definitely not a luxury.

         At present, Australia has a foreign debt of $165 billion, give or take a few billion dollars. One can never get a straight answer out of this Government on anything, let alone on what the foreign debt is. One would think that, in such a position, the Government would be looking at internal costs for farmers, miners, small businessmen and big businessmen and putting Australians in a position where we can compete with the rest of the world. The only way the Government is going to cut down that foreign debt is by making us competitive. But the Government and its Ministers have put more and more impediments in the way of business, and that has been the ruination of business in Australia.

         It is all very well for those on the other side to bring Bills like this forward; they do not have to administer them themselves. The Australian Taxation Office administers them. None of those opposite would know where there is sales tax and where there is not half the time, and yet they sit in judgment. To my knowledge, no-one over there—except perhaps Senator Walsh—has ever paid a pay-packet out in his life. I will give Senator Walsh the benefit of the doubt. But they sit here in judgment and tell us what business must do and must not do for ever and ever. Business is paying to be a tax collector for the Government. That is why the Hewson GST package is far in front and is far simpler. There will be one form once a month.

         I come back to the Bill, which is causing nothing but hardship for Australia. This foreign debt that we have created and cannot do anything about reducing flows through to all people. This is not only to business people, it flows through to the interest rates that people pay on their homes. It most definitely penalises the one group that I have already mentioned and that is the exporters of Australia—the farmers, the miners, the business people, the manufacturers. They are the ones who are copping it.

         One would be looking to the Government to lessen the pool of unemployment; it is one million at present and rising fast. We have had a bit of a comeback of 0.1 per cent in the last month, but that has mainly come about not by anything this Government has done, but by the fact that some of those school leavers of last year have been absorbed. Of course, in another three-odd months we will have another set of school leavers that this Government will have to worry about and unemployment will probably hit 13 per cent.

         This sort of legislation—the sales tax system—just penalises and it penalises those who have a chance of employing people. Instead of bringing in this sort of reform—and it is not reform judging by the mishmash we have here—the Government should be looking at abolishing sales tax lock, stock and barrel and starting again with a GST.

As one who is involved in the building industry—not largely; probably a building a year—I have not been able to find out whether plastic sheeting is exempt when it is put under concrete.

There are certain things like containers for pizzas, biscuits and milkshakes. An extra $2m to $3m will be ripped out with regard to those items.

         According to the Government, food is not taxed. That is a big lie. Once, when printing a catalogue, only the printing was taxed, but we now have more tax on that. Now the whole lot—models, photography, lay-out, design, typesetting and film advertising—will be subject to tax. What is the Government's answer in this case? It will allow exemptions of up to $10,000 for small business. But the Government is not exempting small business from anything; it is just shifting the load somewhere else. It is shifting the goalposts, if you like. The burden of collection is shifted elsewhere. After all, when that measure was brought in it was regarded as a smokescreen to take attention away from the goods and services tax, but that tax would have been a far lot easier to administer.

         There is another change in small specifics. On swimming pools there will be a difference in tax depending on whether the pool is made of fibreglass or is built into the ground in concrete. That, once again, comes from my experience in the building game. Why is that? The purpose or use of a swimming pool is exactly the same whether it is made of fibreglass and lifted in with a crane or whether it is built into the ground of any other material.  The intent and purpose are exactly the same, yet there is a variation on the amount of sales tax paid.

         This mishmash was rammed through the House of Representatives in, I think, 37 minutes—do not hold me to the number of seconds—and then it landed in this place. We were supposed to deal with this legislation before we went home for Christmas. But fortunately, due to Senator Short's work, ably helped by the Democrats, there was an inquiry. But then the inquiry itself was thrown into confusion by the Government announcing some changes at the last minute. We got the report of the inquiry on our desks yesterday.

         In 1990-91, the Government announced that it would undertake a review aimed at `simplifying' the sales tax legislation. Senator Short has already gone into the reasons why it is anything but simple. We now have before us the so-called simplification Bills. From what I read, the Committee advertised and, in no time, it had received 150 submissions from all over Australia. The Committee then found out that it was anything but simple.

        Senator Short has already told you about that sort of strengthening.

         The proposed legislation includes clear policy changes, and we were told it was a simplification. The areas involved include external costs and leases. What a shemozzle came out of the leasing system. Another area is goods donated, or charities. From what I saw in the press release put out by the Minister, charities have now been exempted. My office received about 133 letters from Western Australian charities. I thought that in this world, in this age, and in this country, we left charities alone because of the cheap work that they do for the unfortunate people in the lower socioeconomic groups. But the Government had even decided to have a crack at them, although fortunately it has changed its mind. Other areas include businesses operating as deemed manufacturers, the coverage of tax rulings—Senator Watson could probably talk for half an hour on that alone—and the treatment of untaxed goods.

For example, take the average John Deere, Massey Ferguson or John Holland dealer—whatever dealers there are around. A machine would be put onto the showroom floor from the distributor, say in this case it was John Deere. The machine would be put on the dealer's floor. Normally it was sales tax free while it was sitting on the floor. If it was bought by a farmer who was exempt, then the

         Under the proposed legislation, which is now changed but not changed enough—as it is, it was rushed through the House of Representatives in 37 minutes—the dealer putting it on the floor, who has all the other costs of financing it and paying interest, would have had to put the sales tax up then. If he sold it to a farmer who was exempt, he would have then been reimbursed. Madam Acting Deputy President, even you, as a solicitor in the city of Adelaide, far removed from the agricultural sector—or I think you are—would know that a combine harvester would not be used for anything else except taking a crop off, which is an agricultural pursuit. Yet in this case, this Government was attempting to put the sales tax on first.

         This Government is always on about bringing in money through the door—the cash flow system, then maybe it has to go back later on. In this case of agricultural equipment, it always had to go back. Take, say, a simple new Holland header at $200,000, with 20 per cent sales tax of $40,000. That dealer would have had to put up finance for, say, six months—if he is lucky to sell it in the first season. There is six months on that at 10 per cent; honourable senators can work it out for themselves. That would be what that dealer had to borrow and pay to the Federal Government for its own programs and then, later on, it would have been refunded. But what would not have been refunded is the interest. Whether or not that fellow made a payment to the bank to put the machine on his show floor or had forgone interest if he had to finance it himself—I doubt that most of those dealers can afford that sort of thing—he would have had to put it up. He would not have got that back from the Commissioner of Taxation. He would have got the sales tax back, but not the interest.

         In other words, as I said before, it is still an impost on production. The dealer's combine header is probably sitting on the floor; he could have a four-wheel drive at $150,000 sitting on the floor; he probably has a two-wheel drive at $80,000; he would normally have a hay baler at $40,000-odd to make up a reasonable show floor; and maybe a utility as well that will still be sales tax free at the end. So it does not take much to have $1m worth of stock on the floor. That, of course, would have represented $200,000 sitting in the sales tax department awaiting reimbursement, as agricultural machinery will always be tax exempt. I could forgive that if it was something that may or may not be exempt at the end. But in that case, I cannot. I understand from the Government backdown that that will not now happen.

         It is up to the Commissioner's discretion, however—it is not written in the legislation—that while machinery is sitting on the showroom floor it will be exempt until its final position is settled one way or another. Although agricultural machinery is always agricultural machinery, it is still up to the Commissioner's discretion. How many commissioners will we get in Australia? What is more, how many have we now got in each State? In Perth, the Tax Office has split into two; one part has gone north and one has gone south. People do not know what office they belong to. Have they got a commissioner within reach? Is a ruling by one the same as a ruling by another? That is what worries me about this legislation. Even though the Government has backed down, there is too much at the Commissioner's discretion rather than being set in legislation so that people can read the legislation in plain English and then work out their business around it.

         Even with the back-down that has occurred, there is still the same problem when parts are put onto the shelf and are then sold to exempt users. Some may not be exempt, but it is up to the one that is buying to declare whether he is exempt or not. In the original legislation it was going to be treated the same. A part went onto the floor, went into a part bin and the sales tax had to be put up.

         Under the present legislation, I was told yesterday by the machinery dealers of Australia—and I have not had any direction to the contrary—once those parts are there, even though the sales tax is not paid by that dealer under the changes we have made, if a part is needed to repair a machine that is under warranty and that has been bought under sales tax exemption, that part must have its own order number, its own purchase invoice, its own invoice, and be sold to the farmer on invoice. If that is correct, it causes a lot of headaches. Not only does it cause headaches but, if a person has to bring in a special part for that, he could lose two, three, four or five days work. He could have one part sitting on the bench and yet another one would have to come from the United States. If the Machinery Dealers Association of Australia is correct on that matter, the Government had better do something about it.

After all, what is a four-wheel drive? I think it is a vehicle that is driven by four wheels. A ruling came out a couple of years ago that that was sales tax exempt if used in certain ways on a farm, but now that is specifically overturned by this legislation. Can anyone tell me why four driving wheels should be treated differently, tax-wise, according to whether two wheels are at the front and two at the back rather than the whole four being down the back, with two extra at the front to balance the machine? I have not been able to get an answer as to why it is treated differently.

Six by six is four wheels driving at the back and two at the front, as used in forestry and in farming for taking seed and super to the paddock. I do not know whether such vehicles would be exempt. I have tried to find out but I have not got an answer. Can someone tell me that? I could go on with those sorts of things, to which I have not got answers.

I believe that, rather than simplification, it set out to broaden the base. I ask: broaden the base of what? Not less for more and enough for the others; no, just to get more in. The financial impact tells us that. In conclusion, as Senator Short said, we will be opposing the legislation, and in government we will certainly be doing a lot more about it than that.

Unfortunately, the process has gone wrong. While I am not privy to some of the reasons, there is a lot of confusion out there so far as sales tax payers are concerned at present.

         Unfortunately, it does appear that the issue at the last minute was rushed and, as a consequence, there were a large number of unintended consequences. The problems created are reflected in something like 140 submissions that were presented to the Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. Perhaps there were an equal number of letters, protests, phone calls and so on. Despite the Government's revisions—they are substantial, and we thank it for them—the question before the chamber at the moment is: will this legislation still achieve its basic objective of simplification? While the thrust is right and the direction is right and there have been quite a lot of amendments, there is still a lot of confusion about some intermediate situations.

         I just want to say that the review process, short as it was—and it was far too short—was a very necessary one and, I think, quite clearly demonstrates to the Australian people the value of a second chamber and the value of the process that we have here of referring Bills to a committee. Had these Bills not gone to the Committee, there would have been enormous additional problems because it would have taken a lot longer to expose some of the difficulties and to have had them rectified. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced, and we now have before us, a series of amendments to the amendments which reflect a revision of policy, but there are still approximately over 1,000 pages of new legislation and explanatory material and the law is still expected to come into effect on 1 December.

         Let me give an example. It is fairly clear that charities will no longer be taxed in the three areas that were previously not intended to be taxed, and I think the Government has reasonably satisfactorily addressed five or six of the areas which were the focus of most of the attention of the submissions. But there are, I must say, a whole lot of intermediate areas. For example, there is still a dilemma in the minds of the natural gas industry, particularly that sector of the industry which uses natural gas vehicles. Let me explain by way of example: since 1985 compressors and associated equipment forming an essential part of a natural gas vehicle refuelling system had been exempted from sales tax. The industry is still uncertain about its position at the present time, despite the changes. This is what I say is unfortunate.

         In 1990, home refuelling appliances, small compressors, were also granted an exemption. That was very satisfactory, but under the proposed sales tax simplification legislation the exemption would be removed and a 20 per cent sales tax would apply. In the event of this change, the whole natural gas vehicle fuel program throughout Australia would naturally be under threat. This additional and totally unexpected impost, without reference to the industry, would mean that the already marginal economics of natural gas as a vehicle fuel would become untenable.

         This uncertainty has not been fully addressed. Because of the pressure to go through the whole raft of amendments—I have had the amendments for only about 36 hours—I put it to the Government that the problem in this good industry is that we have an abundance of natural gas and we are going to tax it out of existence, which would be unfortunate, but I believe that the problem could be overcome by a simple amendment. I hope the advisers will take note of it, because we cannot afford to lose industries unnecessarily at this critical time of deep recession.

         I believe that the decision could be reversed by amending proposed item 172 to include the following words: goods for use in the preparation and use of natural gas as a fuel, internal combustion engines, parts, accessories, attachments and fittings. This simple change would mean a continuation of the natural gas vehicle fuel program through Australia. I therefore ask the Government whether it can institute the amendment to reverse what has been an apparent anomaly and, I hope, an unintended consequence.

         That clearly demonstrates the intermediate dilemma in which a lot of industries now find themselves. These amendments to the amendments should have gone back to the Select Committee for further evaluation, further contact with the industry and further input. Then there would have been a lot more certainty. Sales tax, unlike income tax, is a transactions tax. It is paid up front. Technically it is possible to get one's money back but it is very embarrassing and very difficult and it is not good for customer-client relationships.

         There will now be six Acts in lieu of the previous 27 sales tax Acts. That is welcome. In fact, the new sales tax law has been completely rewritten in a different style, with substantial changes in terminology. The thrust is very important. However, the Bill does nothing to overcome the inherent defects of imposing taxes at the wholesale sales tax level when nowadays that step in the distribution chain is rapidly disappearing. Also, the charges would add significantly to industry's input costs, quite unlike the coalition's Fightback policy, which is designed to remove such business charges as business input costs.

We thank him for that and we acknowledge the important role played by Senator Short and Senator Vanstone on the Committee and others in drawing attention to the problems that were created by this legislation. As a result of this change, there is another big problem that we must address if we are to have any pride in Australia as a nation. We have to encourage Australian ownership in industry.

         The original sales tax legislation, as a result of the removal of the deemed manufacturer provisions, would have overcome that inequity. When the Government decided to reinstate, for very good reason, the deemed manufacturer provisions, it recreated a problem for the industry in that there was an anomaly. There was not a level playing field. As a result of this anomaly, the oil refineries that were affected were the companies that had an Australian shareholding content. I think this was, indeed, unfortunate.

         One may say that they should restructure their activities to overcome the particular problems. But the question has to be asked: why should oil companies that are efficient worldwide restructure their operations simply because of the whims of governments in the way they structure their sales tax? The cost involved in restructuring to take advantage of the concession now, along the lines of the competitors, really cannot be easily quantified. In any event, there is no guarantee that the anti-avoidance provisions of the law would accommodate such actions because that is the way the legislation is written. That is unfortunate. It is difficult to restructure because the dominant purpose of restructuring is to overcome the sales tax problem, which is technically running into the problems with the anti-avoidance provisions of the law.

         The legislation currently excludes investment when used in conjunction with refinery exchange arrangements, even though refinery exchange is for all intents a part of the manufacturing operation. Briefly, to avoid creating a multitude of small, inefficient refineries in Australia—and this is basically what the Government is expecting the industry to do—each company manufactures products at one or two locations sufficient for its overall needs. It exchanges part of these volumes for products from its competitors' refineries interstate to satisfy markets remote from its manufacturing location. The practice of refinery exchange appears to be unique to the oil industry. Because it is a highly volatile fuel, about 5 to 10 per cent is lost through evaporation.

         To exclude refinery exchange based investment from the manufacturing concession is anomalous, and it sends a signal to the market from the Government that efficient world scale manufacturing operations are actually not encouraged. I am sure that this should not be an intention of any government. But it is my job, I believe, to focus on a few of these problems at the moment. I put it to the Government that it must address these issues.

         Let us look at one particular case. In 1992-93 Ampol, for example, proposes to commit over $140m of new capital expenditure, the large majority being facilities fabricated and constructed in Australia, a not insignificant proportion of which may now be subject to sales taxes excluded from the concessions. This is surely an unintended consequence. The companies proceeded on the basis that the law was going to be changed with the removal of the deemed manufacturer provisions. They were right. But at least it put them on a level playing field.

         The oil industry is highly regulated, to the stage where the Prices Surveillance Authority controls the wholesale price which the industry is able to charge for its petrol. Therefore, any additional legislation, such as the sales tax simplification legislation as now amended, will cause problems of inequity. Surely, the purpose of simplification was to remove the industry. It is unique in its operation and it is at an essential time, and I think it important that we address this matter, because I feel that discrimination against companies that have an Australian shareholding content is quite abhorrent.

         The basic intention of the legislation was to stimulate manufacturing investment and to make industry competitive by reducing the incidence of sales tax on business inputs. We have a problem of inequity here, so far as the Australian companies are concerned. The refiner-marketer could be a deemed manufacturer. This would mean that storage, handling and distribution facilities would be exempt and this would be clearly in line with government policy. But the policy changes affect the five refiner-marketers unequally. That is caused, it is true, by their corporate structures, which have developed differently over the years. Consequently, three organisations are now able to obtain a substantial benefit while two—the two which have Australian content—cannot. Because the deemed manufacturer provisions have now been excluded from the proposed simplification of legislation they will perpetuate a previous inequity, and we have told the Government how it should overcome the particular concern.

         I will now direct some attention to some of the amendments: firstly, the general anti-avoidance provisions. Fortunately, the proposals originally put to this Senate have now been changed and a number of conditions which the Commissioner must satisfy before the provisions can be applied have got to be examined. But a notable omission from these revised amendments is what I refer to as the safe-harbour provision for ordinary commercial dealings. Without this, there will be a great deal of confusion from this new legislation. In other words, despite all the words, the principal failing of the old provision would appear to be mirrored in the new provision. The provision could be even worse than this in the proposed section 93(2) as expressed in the comprehensive terms, and might preclude the Commissioner from having regard to the matters not expressed therein.

         The untaxed goods provisions, as foreshadowed, are not to be extended to those untaxed because of the small business exemption, and the proposed amendment does now appear to fully accommodate most concerns. Under the original simplified law, donations to exempt bodies—for example, goods which were donated to a charity which were to be used in a raffle or sold for the purpose of making money—did not qualify for the exemption. This was drawn to their attention; it has now been addressed. A new item, 193, is to be introduced to provide for an exemption of goods for donation or loan to an always exempt person and we welcome that. That was certainly an unintended consequence and caused unnecessary fear across the business community. In the case of property owned or leased to exempt organisations, the scope of the proposed amendments appears to be much more limited than was indicated in the Treasurer's press release of 11 August. Examples of the types of things not covered as intended are perhaps much more limited.

I put it to the Committee that some of those areas that do need to be looked at are the general anti-avoidance provisions, particularly the areas that I addressed earlier, and property owned or leased to exempt organisations.

The original intent under sales tax law was that the containers have the same rate of sales tax that applies to the products that the containers enclose. A simplification process would have endorsed that concept. But no, we have a change whereby there is a discrimination and, instead of simplifying the area, the Government has added further confusion and is going to get extra revenue from it.

We have lost a lot of the benefits in the process of that research.

Given the fact that the Opposition has highlighted an entirely different approach—the Fightback approach, and a GST, which will certainly address all the issues about which we have major concerns—the Government should at least go back and have a thorough look at the question of rulings, the anti-avoidance provisions, the dilemmas that typesetters are faced with in the printing industry, the problems within the food industry, and so on.

It has not been driven by a need to simplify the indirect tax system—the wholesale sales tax system which virtually every practitioner believes, if it is not already in a state of breaking down, is certainly in a state of chaos and confusion. The Bill has been brought forward in an attempt by the Government to score some political points.

         As I was saying, I think a heavy responsibility descends on the Australian Democrats to ensure that any such Bill which finally emerges from this chamber is carefully examined by that Senate Committee.

         It is true, as I said, that a heavy responsibility falls on the Australian Democrats in relation to this. It is not as though they are opposed to indirect taxes. We have certainly seen that from the alternative Budget which Senator Kernot presented to the Australian people some weeks ago. It was strangely called, I would have to say,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Getting to Work

         On a number of occasions I have drawn attention to the former alternative Budget that was the vision presented by Senator Spindler. I used to come into this chamber to attack his proposals. Essentially, Senator Spindler felt that the Australian people should have another $6.4 billion of taxes imposed on them. I suspect that I reflect the feelings of the Australian community in saying that the last thing we need is more taxes.

         document actually trumps Senator Spindler. She believes that taxes should be raised by about $7.2 billion on top of the already heavy burden of taxes that the Australian people are now paying. I am most grateful to Senator Lees for drawing my attention to that. I did mark that statement in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Getting to Work
         </emphasis>

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Getting to Work
         </emphasis>
         , that Australia, with the United States, has the second lowest level of taxation of OECD countries. So Senator Lees does believe that the Australian people are lowly taxed. This feature is highlighted in

         That is why the Australian Democrats want to impose a whole range of new taxes on the Australian people. They want, for example, to increase the income tax. The so-called jobs levy is, in effect, an increased income tax which will hit most families in this country. They believe in a fossil fuel levy which will hit just about every person who uses a power point, every factory that needs to rely on energy. It is a very heavy tax and a very heavy burden which will flow through to the costs of virtually everything produced in this country.

         Senator Lees and her colleagues have proposed higher petrol taxes, in direct contrast to the sorts of proposals that are included in the Fightback program, which aims to cut the overall burden of petrol taxes by about $11 per tank of petrol. We also have proposals to lift the company tax rate, which I guess is a strange proposal in a period when we are actually trying to encourage companies to make profits to put on jobs! The response of the Australian Democrats is to increase company taxes.

         It might be said that the Democrats have a responsibility to look at their policies, which I believe are an invitation to the Labor Government to lift taxes in various areas. That is why I tend to feature those quite prominently in debates in this chamber. It is not as though the Democrats are ever going to be able to put through these taxes but the Labor Party, with its high spending program, is always sorely tempted to find new areas of revenue, to find taxes. The Democrat policies on taxation are an invitation to the Labor Party to bring in more taxes.

         —One concern that has been drawn to my attention by a number of constituents which is worth bringing before this chamber is that the legislation we have before us will render virtually useless all existing rulings held by taxpayers as well as related case law. There is no doubt in my mind that the Bills before the Senate are complex. That was probably best shown by the inability of the Australian Taxation Office to provide quick answers to questions asked during the Select Committee hearings. Because of this complexity, taxpayers will have to seek rulings from the Tax Office to see whether they have incurred a tax liability.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The legislation even contains a provision to protect taxpayers from having to pay back taxes if the ruling happens to be incorrect. But the sting is that such private rulings will give protection only to those people to whom they are issued. This will leave other companies and businesses further down the chain exposed to uncertainty and potential tax claims. An example is a manufacturer who gains a ruling relating to the classification of his product. The manufacturer then sells the product to wholesalers and it is on-sold to retailers. I understand that the problem is that the ruling applies only to the manufacturer. If the ruling is found to be wrong or is reversed, only the manufacturer will be compensated. Customers who acted in good faith would then be liable for the tax.

         The only way to avoid this problem is for each actor in the chain to seek an individual ruling. That means that the only way to guarantee commercial certainty is by going to the time and expense of seeking rulings from the Australian Tax Office. Not only will this so-called simplification add to business complexity and costs but it will bog down the Australian Taxation Office in a morass of individuals seeking rulings.

         An issue which has been raised in the media and which, I understand, still has not been satisfactorily resolved in the amendments that the Government has brought forward is the amendments that relate to retailers such as jewellers and marketers of photographic equipment who currently sell goods tax free to Australians going overseas and to international tourists in Australia. I understand that the proposed amendments will be extremely costly and cumbersome and will cause problems for retailers and customers. Under this Bill, it will be much cheaper for all tourists to purchase their duty free goods outside Australia.

         One aspect of the new Bills which has the prospect of costing much more is that of dual usage. Certainly where goods are used both by an exempt organisation and by a taxable organisation, exemption applies to those goods. For example, certain goods relating to the Sydney Harbour Tunnel project are exempt even though they are owned by private contractors. The Bills will ensure that an exemption will apply only where goods are leased or purchased by the exempt organisation. I understand from accountants that this provision will jeopardise many joint private sector and public sector projects and add costs to many organisations that rely on public funding. So much for the Keating Government's policy to involve the private sector in infrastructure projects!

         One way to judge the worth of this legislation is to see how it matches the intent of the Government. The Treasurer, Mr Dawkins,in his press release outlining the simplification of the wholesale sales tax legislation, referred to the benefits of the simplified law. He said:

         I also declare, as Senator Panizza did, that as a primary producer I have a vital interest in this legislation for a variety of reasons. The first reason—certainly not the least important—is that in a taxation system there must be equity between and within industries. This measure has been touted as simplification, but it exacerbates that lack of equity between and within industries. I will also develop that point in a moment or two.

         One of the unintended consequences of this legislation on the various machinery dealers and suppliers of goods and services, particularly to rural areas, will be that the actual cost of operating each item purchased will be greater than the sales tax. As a result, sales tax will be collected by default.

         I am cynical and suspicious enough to believe that the legislation has been designed in such a way as to increase the tax base while increasing the cost to the people in rural and regional Australia who supply those goods and services. These people are finding it very difficult to survive. For example, last week a local machinery dealer at Ravensthorpe told me that 60 per cent of the items that he sells have a value of $10 or less. The cost of administering the proposals before us will do nothing more than significantly increase the cost of those products beyond what the tax exemption is worth. Of course, the final user of the product will pick up the costs.

         Rather than the Bills simplifying sales tax and making it easier for people involved in those industries—whether in the wheat, wool or beef industries; mining, particularly prospecting; or any arm of the agricultural or mining industries—most of the tax will be collected by default. In the long run, this not being a simple or cost-effective operation will mean that our ability to compete, in an export sense, will be severely disadvantaged.

         I make reference to the haste with which this Bill, even though there has been some two years review in the development of it, was guillotined through the House of Representatives. The intention was to have it passed through this place before the winter recess. Fortunately, that did not occur. While one can be critical of the Democrats at times, one must also acknowledge that they did support us in having the legislation referred to a Senate select committee, although the way that the Committee was treated was most unsatisfactory. To have two days of hearings into what are essentially changes to 27 Bills, which was reduced to six Bills, to look at the various submissions—I believe there were around 150—and do justice to them in that time is certainly not satisfactory.

        that as witnesses have not seen the proposed amendments which give effect to the undertakings in the statement they reserve their position about whether the government's undertakings would fully satisfy their concerns. The Committee shares the concerns expressed by witnesses and believes that more time should have been available to consider the effects of matters raised in the Treasurer's press release.

        That is what the Committee said in its report. I quote from what Senator Short and Senator Vanstone said in their minority report:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The hearings revealed that the Government's new proposed Wholesale Sales Tax would include a tax on food, a tax on services, a tax on exports, a tax on tourism, a tax on farmers, a tax on many manufacturers, double taxation, a tax on infrastructure and a tax on plant and buildings. These taxes are all the result of the fundamentally flawed Wholesale Sales Tax system, that this Government seeks to retain.
       </para>

        Their recommendations stated further:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new law for Wholesale Sales Tax as envisaged in the Bills is fundamentally flawed. Sales Tax is a tax on goods. It is a tax that has a significant cascading effect, which results in tax on all sorts of goods and services, that is not intended.

        I emphasise that it is not intended. They continued:

        I will dwell for a moment on the disadvantages this has for Australian producers compared to our overseas competitors and highlight the particular aspect which has been drawn out quite correctly by Senator Short and Senator Vanstone. In the recent Budget nothing was done to ease the burden that exporters in this country carry. Until that burden is eased and broken down, and exporters are allowed to operate in a taxation system that is competitive and fair compared to what occurs in the rest of the world, we will continue to be disadvantaged and this country will continue to have current account problems, Budget deficit blow-outs and a number of other consequences which are not in our long term best interests.

One cannot come to any other conclusion but that. Until such time as we have a taxation system which does not disadvantage our capacity to be competitive in an export sense, we will continue to have the sorts of problems that I have outlined.

         Let us just talk for a moment about the current wholesale sales tax system and what is wrong with it. The first thing that is wrong with it is that it is a hidden tax; it is a dishonest tax. People do not know what they are paying. They do not know what the cost of the cascading effect of the tax is through the system. For that reason alone, if we had a taxation system which in fact was visible, people would be able to assess the actual tax they were paying and would be able to make a much fairer judgment on governments, whatever their colour, in terms of the amount of tax they were paying. They would also be able to make a much fairer judgment in terms of the businesses they were dealing with. They would be able to see just what mark-ups were being placed on goods and services, or goods in particular, because the service costs from a wholesale sales tax are very minimal, but they do have a cascading effect as a result of its indirect impact.

         The card to which I refer is American Express, well known throughout Australia and, indeed, throughout most of the world. In fact, I can recall only one place overseas where my American Express card was not accepted. The incident occurred in an out of the way centre in Germany and with only Danish currency in my wallet I met a few difficulties in paying for dinner. The card is not universally accepted in Australia, but with an American Express card and a Bankcard I have never been unable to charge accommodation and travel costs in Australia. The principal reason for applying for a card some 15 years ago was to pay for accommodation and meals, as well as for other purchases, when overseas. I later used the American Express card for a wide variety of purchases in this country.

         I have, however, not renewed my annual subscription to American Express, not because of a small additional impost charged by the company but because of a matter of principle. Whenever I make purchases in Queensland—this is where the vast majority of my card purchases occur—I am charged stamp duty on each transaction except the first. At 10c a transaction this is a relatively small amount but, if all the cards being used in Queensland were taken into account, stamp duty charges would net a reasonable amount of revenue for the Queensland Government. I have no complaint with that. I am a Queensland resident and, as I mentioned, most of my credit card charge purchases occur in Queensland.

         This year, however, as well as paying Queensland Government stamp duty I have been billed by American Express for New South Wales financial institutions duty. Although financial institutions duty is calculated differently, the duty for which I have been billed generally equates to the amount of Queensland stamp duty payable. I have asked the company why I should pay financial institutions duty, especially when most of my purchases occur in Queensland and when my American Express account was automatically credited from one of my Queensland bank accounts. The response was that, as my payments to the company were deposited in New South Wales, the company was charged financial institutions duty on its bank deposits and has now decided to pass this charge on to its members.

         I have no doubt that, under the conditions of use of an American Express card, the company can do this rather than accept the duty as a business expense, an expense which it has incurred because it entrusts its business to a New South Wales based bank. For users of the card in Queensland, however, it means that, even if their purchases are made entirely within Queensland, they have to pay New South Wales financial institutions duty. That is in addition to their Queensland stamp duty. I see no reason why Queensland citizens should prop up an ailing New South Wales economy.

         I have subsequently obtained, through the bank with which I deal, a Queensland based credit card which allows me to make domestic and overseas purchases. I still pay the required Queensland stamp duty but not New South Wales financial institutions duty. I informed the American Express company that, when my renewal of $60 became payable, I would not renew. That non-renewal has now occurred, breaking a 15-year association I had with the company.

         The reason I am recounting this today is to alert other American Express card holders in Queensland that they are subsidising the New South Wales Government. They would be able to find, as I did, that there are Queensland based credit cards which offer similar services to those of American Express and quite possibly cost far less than the amount charged by American Express for its annual fee.

         Now that I have an alternative card to my former American Express card, I am pleased that I took the effort to change. I see no reason why I should pay financial institutions duty to the New South Wales Government because a company I deal with happens to choose a bank in New South Wales with which to lodge its deposits. Those Queensland residents who carry American Express cards, or any other card which has a similar policy attached, should investigate the possibility of discarding their card in favour of a Queensland based card.

         There is an interesting postscript to the story about cutting my ties with American Express. As I knew that my association with the company was coming to an end, I discontinued using the card a month or two before my membership was due to expire. Even so, I received a final account from the company, an account for 26c. That was the financial institutions duty which the company had billed me for the last account which I had paid. I had a mind to ignore the demand for 26c but formed the opinion that the company would report me to a credit reference agency, and that my credit rating would be damaged, all for the want of 26c which the company had incurred but was intent on passing on. I duly sent a cheque for 26c.

         To reiterate, I suggest that Queensland credit card holders check to see whether they too are paying tax to the government of another State, as well as to the Queensland Government. If they are, they have a remedy of discontinuing the use of that card and obtaining an equally good Queensland based alternative.

         —I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a situation which I regard as nothing short of extraordinary. It relates to the situation of the F3 freeway between Sydney and Newcastle not being completed, but just ending in the middle of a swamp, eight kilometres from the national highway that it is meant to feed into. The F3 is 150 kilometres long. It is just sheer stupidity to build all of it, except for the last eight kilometres. It is obvious that a major road that links the largest city in Australia with the sixth largest city in Australia would have huge traffic volumes, and that is true. The F3 caters for all the northbound traffic leaving Sydney, going through northern New South Wales and on into Queensland. The question is: Why is the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) content to let this major freeway stop eight kilometres short of a satisfactory intersection and let minor State and local road traffic take the burden?

         For the last six years, it has been obvious that there was going to be a problem at the north end of the F3, but no plan was devised to solve this problem, just a feasibility statement on possible solutions. It becomes even more unbelievable when one considers that the freeway ends very close to Mr Brown's electorate of Charlton. The roads in his electorate will be expected to take a lot of the burden of the dispersing freeway traffic, just as they have done for the last five years when the F3 finished at a point west of Toronto—again, in the middle of nowhere and without any proper links with other major roads. This traffic nightmare is about to be repeated, 13 kilometres further north.

         To explain more fully to honourable senators who may not be familiar with the local conditions, the F3 is a federally funded road which is part of the national road system. The plan is for a network of major roads encircling the continent. The incomplete F3 has long been a break in the link. It needs to join both the Pacific Highway and the New England Highway. These roads, of course, are the major traffic routes to Brisbane. However, the F3 is going to stop just before it gets to these highways. The two northbound lanes of the freeway are going to feed into a single local road called Lenaghans Drive, eight kilometres short of the main intersection. This means that there will be a most horrendous bottleneck in peak traffic periods; peak periods such as Christmas 1993 when the connection is due to open.

         The authorities building the freeway are all aware of the fact that this bottleneck will occur. The project report from the Road Traffic Authority of New South Wales in Newcastle states that the average annual daily traffic, the AADT, on Lenaghans Drive is at the moment in excess of 8,000 vehicles. This is expected to increase substantially on the opening of the next section of the freeway to Lenaghans Drive, in December 1993. Current best practice indicates that dual carriageways should be built where the AADT reaches 8,000 to 12,000. To quote the RTA:

        The perception of inadequacy will be heightened for the northbound traffic coming from freeway standards to a relatively short length of two lane road with entering traffic, before re-entering further dual carriageways.

        If the situation is going to occur and the relevant authorities know that the result will be traffic disaster, the question is: why is Mr Brown, the responsible Minister, going to let this occur?

         Funding is needed urgently to connect the F3 both to the New England and Pacific highways with dual carriageway so that traffic flow can be smooth, efficient and safe and ultimately at a lower cost to private and public users. The freeway was started 30 years ago, but we are still waiting for it to be finished. At the moment, one could expect that this ridiculous situation with local traffic conditions could persist for another six years. It is more likely that we will be waiting for a further 15 years. Either way, it is simply not good enough.

         The Federal Government has to see this for the very high priority that it is. This F3 is the link between Sydney and the rapidly growing and increasingly urbanised and very popular holiday destinations along the north coast of New South Wales. With this traffic feeding into Lenaghans Drive, the results during peak periods like Christmas and Easter will be similar to the five-hour traffic jams that resulted six years ago when the tollgates north of Sydney were still in operation. It is simply unacceptable for motorists to go back to those miserable conditions again. But this is what the Federal Government expects us to accept.

         The national highway is a federally funded road. The route is determined by the Federal Government and, therefore, it is responsible for this plan. Last month the Minister for Land Transport announced $600m worth of road projects for high unemployment areas, but the completion of the F3, one of Australia's major roads, did not even get a look in. Even the fact that this issue is vital to the electorate of the Minister did not seem to help. This is a prime example of the ineffectiveness of ALP members of parliament in the Newcastle area.

         I look forward to the result of the public consultation paper being conducted next month and the environmental impact statement being conducted on the options for the link of the F3 to the New England and Pacific highways. Lenaghans Drive is, surely, not the way to go. A completed dual carriageway for the national highway is necessary. To stop the construction eight kilometres short would be a national transport tragedy.

The significant absence of deaths in police cells is something which affords us great hope that police practices throughout Australia can be improved in such a way that tragedies, such as the death of Paul Loughlin, do not need to recur. It is for this reason that I mentioned in my notice of motion that the Senate should commend the Western Australian Government and the Western Australian Police for this response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It reflects a significant indicator of improved police practice in that State. I also suggest that we should note with concern that the same indicators of improved police procedures are not present in other States.

         —I wish to use this opportunity to express my concerns about the income tax rulings system, in particular the taxation draft ruling known as TR92/D24. After all the excitement and the media attention of the Budget, I believe it is appropriate that we should turn our minds to the processes by which this country is really governed and to the people who are in important in that process. Because we operate here in the full glare of parliamentary publicity, we tend to be beguiled into the belief that we are actually in control, that we get the results we expect and that when we pull these exciting levers, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) refers to, we are in control—or he is in control.

         However, I would like to remind the Senate that what attracts the passing attention of the Press Gallery does not always represent the real and the ultimate exercise of executive power. I would like to illustrate what I mean by reference to the income tax system, particularly the rulings. We have had cause whilst sitting on various committees, particularly on the most recent example, the sales tax legislation Committee, to reflect upon how public announcements by politicians can be executed by the Public Service in ways which effectively frustrate the intentions of the Parliament. I would like to illustrate this more specifically and, I think, more powerfully by reference to the process of taxation rulings, in particular the reference to draft ruling TR92/D24 which relates to deductibility of interest expense of Australian companies.

         In a sense, the draft ruling process can be even more insidious than the slipping through Parliament of egregious legislation. I refer specifically to that word to draw attention to what is sometimes shocking or sometimes horrifying legislation, in terms of its impact. At least with the latter case we have some opportunity to grasp the fleeting moment and stall the process, as we did in the tax legislation, to allow some proper examination, and that is quite appropriate.

         Coming back to this ruling: firstly, the ruling will, through the creation of new levels of interference, add directly to the bill which the Commissioner will present to us to administer his office in the years ahead. More importantly and insidiously, it will add to the administrative costs of many Australian corporations.

         Secondly, it will distort the international transactions of those corporations and it will make them a great deal more difficult. In other words, what I am saying is that through this ruling the Australian Taxation Office will make life tough for Australian multinationals. It will make it difficult for them to do business. They will have to look over their shoulders all the time as they try to build up the sorts of overseas investments which this Parliament considers to be beneficial to Australia. The injection of equity capital into overseas subsidiaries, which the Tax Office seeks to penalise, is really the only way to invest in many Asian countries, given their investment rules.

         Thirdly, and more broadly, I question whether this could be part of a continuing campaign by the Tax Office to make life more difficult for Australian businesses generally, in circumstances where frequently there is really very little revenue at risk as far as the Tax Office is concerned. We spend about $1.4 billion in collecting revenue. We use a substantial portion of this to harass the very people we are asking to improve their performance, to create more wealth, to take more risks, to invest, and to employ more people. So we have to make sure we have a system where the tax administration is not working against those very objectives. I do not say it is happening overtly, but it is happening as a result of some indirect executive power now increasingly available through the tax ruling system.

         We allow all this to happen because, when it actually comes down to giving effect to government policies, we simply do not yet supervise sufficiently well the activities of those officials who administer the policies which we proclaim so loudly in this chamber. In the case of the tax rulings, they do not even have to come to the Parliament; they are issued by the Tax Commissioner. Of course, there are companies which may challenge them, but it is the very brave taxpayer these days that attracts the attention of the Tax Commissioner through a legal challenge, and this process, although necessary, does impede the satisfactory administration of justice.

         The draft ruling that I refer to is nine pages long and fairly complex. However, what is at the bottom of this is the question of what deductions companies should be allowed for interest on their borrowings. In essence, the Commissioner is seeking to deny companies interest deductibility in cases where a parent company may have borrowed money to capitalise a subsidiary located outside Australia. This ruling ignores the earlier legal precedent, including a case where the tax authorities lost in the full court. That is the worrying part about it. More importantly, it is another step along the way of the Tax Commissioner arrogating the power to tell these companies which of their commercial transactions he will treat as legitimate.

         This ruling, I would like to submit to the Senate, is perhaps the worst that we have received in many years in terms of its implications, particularly for Australian multinationals trying to invest abroad—not only for them, but I suppose they suffer the most severe ramifications. It shows the way in which the Tax Office, in its obsessive pursuit of revenue, can directly and comprehensively work against the general economic policies of this Government and what will almost certainly be the incoming coalition Government.

         Draft ruling TR92/D24 will be expensive. In summary, it will work against efficient operation of this economy.

It will, therefore, be against the overall objective to internationalise our economy. It will be anti-business in very broad terms at a time when we are trying to encourage business activity. Worst of all, this Parliament will have no say whatsoever in the matter.

         I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and to Senator Ray, that it is time that we in this place looked much more closely at how policy is actually carried out, particularly through the ruling processes in the Tax Office. We have had, in the last 10 years, Budget after Budget, economic statement after economic statement. All of them have proclaimed ringingly the need to improve our economic performance, the need to take the shackles off business and the need to push forward to higher levels of growth and efficiency. That was never more important than now and I use this occasion, in the Budget atmosphere, to raise this matter when our economic performance is so poor and when our levels of unemployment are so socially damaging.

In another Labor marginal seat, where a sitting Minister is about to be done over by Mrs Sallyanne Atkinson, in a desperate attempt to keep Mr Beddall there the Government has thrown in some money.

         Some people suggest that this is a pork-barrelling exercise. The Chairman of the Country Mayors Association in New South Wales, Alderman David Johns, was bitterly disappointed by and criticised very strenuously the Federal Government's provision of funds for job creation schemes to metropolitan councils—just more evidence which I will come to later. Alderman Johns points out that Fairfield and Liverpool get $13.177m, while Dubbo, Wagga, Tamworth and Orange in the country, and many other country centres, receive absolutely nothing. People in Sydney suburbs such as Fairfield can travel to other parts of Sydney looking for work, but a jobless person in country centres does not have the same advantage. Alderman Johns quite rightly pointed out in his press release that the only country region to be given significant job creation funds in category 1 of the Budget allocation was that based around Lismore, which surprisingly just happens to be smack bang in the centre of two very marginal Labor seats which again the Government is desperately trying to retain!

In fact, Alderman Johns in his press release points out that only $10.9m of the $73.65m allocated to New South Wales has gone to country councils, and none of these councils are west of the Great Divide.

         Non-metropolitan and coastal councils in New South Wales fare little better in the category 2 schemes. Cowra received a $344,000 grant, presumably to compensate for the recent loss of 150 jobs with the closure of Edgells. But Tamworth, which recently lost 220 jobs when East-West Airlines closed its maintenance facilities, received absolutely nothing.

Mr Ruddock has pointed out to me that there is gross discrimination on the Government's part against the northern districts.

The huge unemployment problem in the Cairns city area—not in any particular shire—has been recognised by the Government, but it has been recognised in only one of those local authorities. Cairns city, quite rightly, and good for it, will receive nearly $1.7m for job creation projects and the local authority right next-door, where at least half of those unemployed people live, will receive—I could ask honourable senators to guess how much—absolutely zero, zilch, nothing.

A lot of the money goes to the State electorate that Mr De Lacy represents and he is under real threat of losing his seat to the Liberal candidate there, Mr Kel Ryan. So maybe the Federal Government was trying to prop him up. The other two seats which surround Cairns and which just happen to be in the Mulgrave Shire area are seats which Norm Millhouse and Scott Sturgess for the Liberal Party could well win from the present Labor incumbents.

So in 12 months they have got to be there; then they are finished. Whatever jobs are created will be gone again by December next year. What really needs to be done is for real jobs to be created.

         —I rise to support briefly the comments of my colleague Senator Macdonald. I particularly make reference to the situation which has occurred in Western Australia with regard to this capital grants program. The first point that I want to make in this regard is the discrimination that has occurred against country shires as far as this capital works program is concerned, and the formula that has been used.

         As one works through the list of those shires that have not received any assistance from the capital works program, one finds that they predominantly, but not exclusively, come from country areas. There is a fundamental reason for this and that is that the Government, leading up to an election, has suddenly found that unemployment is a serious problem as far as its electoral prospects are concerned. Of course, in the country shires the recession has hit a lot earlier and a lot harder, and those people who fell into the unemployed category have long left. In fact, it goes back two or three years.

         But also there are some enormous discrepancies in metropolitan Perth. This shows up very clearly when one starts examining the question: why is a formula devised which allows, for example, the Stirling City Council to receive what is effectively a grant of $7m, yet the neighbouring shire of Wanneroo receives nothing—and nobody can tell me that unemployment stops at local government boundaries? Go to the other side of Stirling to the shire of Bayswater and one finds that it also receives nothing. I wanted to make the point that when one starts doing the breakdown under the formula that is put forward, it is interesting to find where the majority of the money falls.

         Certainly we find in the paper released from the office of the responsible Minister, Mr Simmons, that in such cases as Stirling there has been an enormous distortion of the figures. For example, Stirling has been counted in five electorates for the $7m, which is five times seven. It makes it appear that there is $35m and there was equity of treatment. But when one breaks it down and allocates, as best as can be estimated, the areas of the shires and where they fall, we find in Stirling, for example, which is held by Mr Edwards, something like the sum of $6.5m will be spent.

         We then go to Fremantle. If we break it down once again on an area basis, we find that the sum is somewhere around $5.5m. We then go to Canning. Once again, breaking it down according to area—and I am sure that Senator Ray would be well aware that Fremantle is held by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, and that Canning is held by Mr Gear—we find that the figure is $4.5m. We then move across to Perth, which is currently held by Dr Charlesworth. Mr Stephen Smith is the candidate for the Labor Party, and we find that there is an allocation in the order of $4.5m.

         If this is not a blatant political exercise in pouring money into Federal marginal seats in Western Australia, I do not know what it is, and it should be condemned as such. If the Government had any decency it would re-look at this particular formula and would take into account all shires that have this particular problem as far as unemployment is concerned and would get a formula which is much fairer. There is no justification for what has been done as far as this capital works program is concerned. I say good luck to those unemployed people who are going to get some assistance. It is long overdue. But I condemn the Government for the way that it has put this formula together and the unfair way in which the money has been allocated in Western Australia.

         It comes through, as Senator Macdonald has said, consistently in a number of States. I wanted to add my comments to what has been said here today. The figures show quite clearly how political this exercise is, and how a Prime Minister is endeavouring to buy his seat back by stacking the money up in favour of Labor marginal seats in Western Australia. And I think it is a disgrace.

         —Before the lunch suspension, I will make some comments. When the Standing Orders Committee moved for the lunchtime procedure on Thursdays, it was meant to be for non-controversial contributions initially—the fact that it has evolved in other ways is just bad luck, I say for the record—and it was to replace first reading debates on money Bills. Now this Thursday procedure has allowed for speeches which have become more like adjournment speeches. I do not think anyone would want to change that because, if it gets people off the adjournment and onto Thursday lunchtime, that would be a remarkably good thing. But I just note for the record how it has changed over the years. I do not object to its changing, but it also may mean, seeing that I have lunchtime duty at this time, that I may respond to some of the points made where normally I would not seek to intervene.

         Senator Macdonald and Senator Crane have made baseless allegations today about the local government grants—not so much Senator Crane, who tried to grasp it. For the record, I want to state what the criterion is. Yes, certain local government areas have got more money than others, and that does not make anyone who does not get the money happy. But the criterion on which these grants were made was to help those specific areas that had unemployment 0.5 per cent above the national average. That was the criterion.

From a look at the poverty line, however, the poverty index by electorate, the thing that really comes home as the more interesting point is how many National Party electorates are right up there at the top.

As I pointed out and as Senator Macdonald does not agree, when Brisbane—where there are several Labor seats, some of which are marginal—gets $3m and the Gold Coast, which is substantially safe Liberal territory, gets $8m, I really do wonder about this brilliant formula. I am sure some of our members wonder about this brilliant formula, which shoves $8m into, essentially, two safe Liberal seats and spreads $3m across four or five Labor marginal seats.

         —As honourable senators would have seen in the press, the UK has announced that it does intend to contribute military aircraft to patrol a no-fly zone in southern Iraq to protect the Shi'ite. Prime Minister Major has said the Security Council resolutions provide the legal authority for this action to be taken. It is expected that similar decisions will be taken shortly by both the United States and France.

         As to the Australian reaction to this, as I said in the Senate on 18 August, a couple of days ago, the Government is greatly concerned that Iraq has persistently flouted the authority of the UN resolutions right across the board and in particular in relation to the Shi'ite. The special rapporteur appointed by the Commission on Human Rights to inquire into the human rights situation in Iraq briefed the Security Council last week. In a scathing critique of Iraqi repression of civilians, he confirmed that Iraq was flagrantly in breach of the human rights provisions of resolution 688, particularly as they affected the Shi'ite and the Kurds. Again, as I said in the press release on 16 August, the Australian Government calls on Iraq to end its repressive military action against the Shi'ite and to allow humanitarian aid to the wounded and displaced.

         So, in light of that, against that background of concern and statements, we would support the UK proposal to patrol a no-fly zone in southern Iraq to protect the Shi'ite from attacks by Iraqi aircraft. We are awaiting final details, but we expect that the prohibition would prevent Iraqi aircraft from flying south of the thirty-second parallel. It would supplement, of course, another prohibition which has been in effect for more than a year on Iraqi aircraft flying north of the thirty-sixth parallel to protect the Kurds.

         As to the likely effect of all this, we certainly hope that the declaration of a no-fly zone will not lead to renewed hostilities with Iraq. The no-fly zone in the north of the country has operated for more than a year without leading to military clashes. That gives some grounds for confidence in that respect, but it is really up to Saddam Hussein. Again, as I said a couple of days ago, Saddam Hussein would be very ill-advised to underestimate the determination of the international community in seeing him comply with UN resolutions in all respects, including his treatment of the civilian population.

         —Senator Patterson says, `Do something'. In fact, this Parliament has done something. As Senator Patterson will know, in both the social security and health areas, legislation has passed through this chamber which provides for an offence equivalent to receiving stolen goods. In other words, a person who solicits another person to go out and obtain this information from, particularly, government agencies is himself guilty of an offence. That has been a particularly good and innovative part of those statutes, although it may well be that a more comprehensive statute could be put in place. I understand that we will get reports from Mr Lavarch's Committee in relation to that umbrella offence. It may be that Sir Harry Gibbs's committee also has some worthwhile things to say in that regard.

         Senator Spindler also asked about making the wrongful disclosure of confidential information a criminal offence. Already in relation to government held information, it is a criminal offence to wrongfully disclose it under section 70 of the Crimes Act, and under specific statutes that wrongful disclosure is also dealt with. I guess Senator Spindler's question relates to whether in fact there might be a crime created for situations where private organisations holding information which it could be anticipated should be kept in a confidential manner disclose it without the permission of the person concerned, and Senator Spindler suggests the telecommunications power might be used in that regard. This can be taken into account by the Government; it will be taken into account.

         However, it has to be said that in relation to the Privacy Act there already has been a significant extension to the private sector so far as credit reports are concerned. In regard to that particular important part of the confidential arrangements that people have when they enter into credit arrangements with financial institutions, there are very stringent safeguards to try to preserve the privacy of material held by credit reporting agencies. What has emerged from the report and from Senator Spindler's question is of great importance and I am sure that we will take this into account in further deliberations within the Government.

         —If I might deal with the last part of the question first, the program has been set up through the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. We introduced legislation in 1987 for that Authority and amended it again in 1991. In that legislation we provided for assistance for firms adding value to raw materials in Australia. That legislation was supported on both occasions by the Opposition and it was under that program that this process was set up.

         The reason this assistance has been offered to BWK is that throughout the world at the present time it is recognised in the textile industry that there is a shift going on from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region. A number of companies are considering new investments in further wool processing plants in this part of the world and there is a window of opportunity for Australia to win new investments in further processing of the woolclip. But we have to compete with other countries in this region to obtain those plants.

         If one takes the BWK example referred to in the question, substantial offers of assistance were, I understand, made to it by other countries. It is because we are the largest producer of wool in the world and because we should be processing more of our wool—currently we process only 5 per cent of the woolclip, which is a disgraceful performance in international terms—that the Government saw the need for us to take advantage of this window of opportunity.

         It has been quite clear from scattered statements by Opposition spokesmen and so on that the Opposition would let that window of opportunity close and let those plants go to other countries. The Government is not prepared to do that, consistent with our general view of industry policy, which we have developed over a number of years, in terms of assistance to industries like steel, which might have closed down under Opposition policies but which have been very successful under the Government's policies.

         The new plant at Geelong is an $85m investment. The Federal Government will support that investment through a taxable grant of $5m and a loan of $15m. A number of claims have been made—particularly in the Geelong region, I notice—by Opposition spokesmen that the Government is discriminating in favour of this company and against other wool processors, particularly Australian ones. These claims are absolute nonsense. Any company planning to invest in such a plant can apply to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority in the same way as this company did. It is generally accepted that, to be economically viable, these plants have to produce at least 4,000 tonnes of wool per annum.

         The program to which I referred earlier in my answer to this question gives the flexibility to provide support through a combination of loans and grants, unlike the grants-only part of the TCFDA program, which is supported under different incentives. Australia is the world's biggest wool producer, yet we process only 5 per cent of the total clip to top stage in this country.

There were 27 years of low base, right throughout the 1970s, and one per cent growth in manufacturing a year—an extraordinarily bad performance. As a result of neglect over many years, the wool industry, which is one of the great industries of this country, slipped over a period of years into decline. The result of Australia's poor performance is that Australia misses out on export income. A tops making plant adds 35 per cent to the value of Australian wool. By 1996, this plant will increase the proportion of the clip processed here to 8 per cent, and investments in other companies, which I am confident will take place, will increase that proportion further.

         BWK is committed to achieving a 49 per cent Australian ownership of the Geelong project within five years and hopes to attract investment in the project from wool growers, amongst others.

I very much welcome Geelong, a once great wool centre for this country which declined in the 1960s and 1970s as a great wool centre, being restored to that role.

         Last week the Government put to the ACTU a proposal either to support a national wage case increase of 1.4 per cent, which is the inflation rate for the relevant period, or to change the wages system, support workplace bargaining and, as well, argue for a wages adjustment for low paid workers on minimum rates awards of $10 per week from 1 March 1993 and $10 a week from 1 March 1994.

         The decision of the ACTU yesterday was a decision that took note of the social wage component of the Budget. It is important once again to reiterate that what the Government is concerned about and what the ACTU is concerned about through the accord is not simply the matter of wages. It is actually the matter of living standards. Living standards are determined by the level of wages, by the level of taxes and by the social wage—that is, the public goods supplied to households and the cost of supplying them. So the basic issue here is living standards.

         The ACTU Executive gave the Budget a big tick. It approved the social wage component in the Budget and it recognised that the Budget focus is a focus for jobs and more jobs, and a focus to take care of those Australians who are not in a position to take care of themselves because of their low incomes, their health, their age or some other disability.

         What the ACTU Executive said to us, by virtue of its decision yesterday, was that a new wage system will now be introduced into Australia. This will be a decentralised wage system—a system that will be built on enterprise or workplace bargaining—and the ACTU will put its shoulder to the wheel as a first priority in delivering that system. This is exactly in conformity with the second option that we put to the ACTU.

         The ACTU has also said to its affiliates that if it is not appropriate or if it finds that employers, as is their right, do not choose to enter into a workplace bargain, they should file an application to amend their awards for the $10 and the $10, meaning that those applications can be brought on at an appropriate time for the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with them.

         I take this response by the ACTU, which has also asked for some further discussions on this matter and wishes to talk the matter through further with its affiliates, as a very positive response, a good response and a response that should be hailed as that by all the commentators. We are now constructing a once-in-a-century shift in wage fixation—a movement from centralised to decentralised wage fixing in a managed way, smoothly, without a big bang and without following the course that the Opposition would choose to follow of increasing taxes, lowering wages and engaging in cultural cleansing by conducting an ideological campaign against the union movement.

Why were Australia's Federal Police still informing the Government on 24 July that the Gillespie children were still in Australia when it now appears that they had left Australian shores by boat off northern Australia about a week earlier? Was there any communication between Coastwatch and Customs authorities and the Federal Police, who had the principal responsibility for the search?

There was Coastwatch and Royal Australian Navy involvement in responding to Mayday calls which were picked up by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. That did take place. The AFP itself was not aware, during the course of the Coastwatch response to those Mayday calls, of the Coastwatch interest in a particular vessel. Coastwatch had not been tasked by the AFP or by Customs in relation to any particular vessel, because there was no identification or description of a vessel which would enable a task to be given to Coastwatch in relation to a particular search related to the abduction and disappearance of the Gillespie children.

         There were other questions asked by Senator Hill. I was not able to note them all, but I can assure him that very considerable resources were allocated by the Australian Federal Police and the Customs Service for the search. From personal knowledge and from conversations I had with the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police—and staff of my ministerial office have had many conversations with those holding operational responsibility within the Australian Federal Police—I understand that very considerable resources were dedicated to this search. Unfortunately, they were not effective in locating the fact that the Gillespie children, with the prince, escaped the Australian jurisdiction.

         This happens from time to time. There are other such occasions and one occurred a few weeks ago with the abduction of a child in Bondi. In that case, the tremendous cooperation between the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and the New South Wales police led to the speedy location and return of the child. In the Gillespie case the cooperation did not lead to the identification of the fact that the prince and the children were going to be spirited away as they were. How they were spirited away is still a matter of operational sensitivity. Investigations are still continuing and, whilst I offer Senator Hill or the relevant spokesman a briefing on these operational matters, I believe that it would be most unwise to elaborate further on the situation. I think I will eventually be able to satisfy Senator Hill that considerable resources were devoted to this very important search, but it still failed to prevent the removal of the children from Australia.

The Bureau of Mineral Resources has had a key role in providing advice to governments on resource matters, as well as being an advisory body carrying out strategic mapping aimed at providing the geological knowledge necessary to support the success of our mineral and petroleum exploration industries.

         Accordingly, this function is being transferred to the new Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Sciences, which is now to be called ABARS. The direct number of staff involved is about 55, with some additional clerical support staff, compared with the total current BMR complement of about 550. A physical transfer of these staff will most likely be required. The cost is currently being investigated. Although I will provide Senator Bell with details on this matter later, I am advised in this brief that it is not expected to be a major cost.

         It is correct that a considerable number—126 in total—of representations were made on this matter to the Prime Minister and relevant Ministers prior to the announcement of the review.

I understand Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, the executive director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, was reported as stating that he was pleased with the name change, which brought the body's identity into line with that of its overseas counterparts, and that the issues could be canvassed by way of inquiry.

         —What the situation thus described reveals, I think, in relevant part is as follows. In August 1988 Mr Burke purchased two duty free vehicles, a Toyota Corolla and a Toyota Starlet. The Department's records show that approval was sought on 6 January 1989 from the Irish Foreign Ministry to import duty free, as a third duty free vehicle, a Mercedes Benz 230E. That same document indicated that approval was given by the Irish authorities and the vehicle was registered, as Senator Knowles has said, on 11 January 1989.

That is not a matter that has been in the public domain hitherto, but it does explain, I think, a great deal about what subsequently happened. The Toyota Starlet, in respect of which he had thus sought to pay outstanding taxes and duties, was then written off in an accident on 16 February, after this application was lodged and before—

For her to get up and to ask for leave without giving us any indication of why she intends to seek that leave is plainly out of order.

        —Senator Bishop has shown by her contribution all the dangers that attend a rush into the public domain based on one-sided, manifestly incomplete and, on this occasion, significantly inaccurate information. Let me explain why I make those particular points. It is the case that the Department is currently investigating a grievance lodged by a departmental officer, who does happen to be the spouse of the person who has made an allegation about sexual harassment in the embassy in Bangkok, concerning the termination of that officer's posting in Bangkok in February this year.

        Perhaps I ought to just say this before I go into one more point of detail: the grievance was lodged under procedures provided for under the Public Service Act, regulation 83. It is being handled entirely consistently with those regulations. Those regulations require in the first instance that an officer be appointed to investigate the grievance and report to the Secretary. The Secretary appointed a senior officer of my Department—in this instance the divisional head for the Americas and Europe, Mr Greg Wood. He is yet to complete his investigations and to report.

        It would be, with one exception, inappropriate for me to disclose any further information relating to this particular grievance procedure because to do so would be an invasion of the person's privacy and could jeopardise the conduct of the grievance. The exception I will make is in reference to Senator Bishop's claim that no reasons were given for the person's termination until his return to Australia.

        I am advised very explicitly by the officer concerned who directed the Bangkok officer to return, Mr Forrester, that three quite clear reasons were given to the Bangkok officer as to why his termination was to occur. Those reasons were put to him in the context of that Bangkok officer having four days in the first instance—he sought an extra day, making it five altogether—to reply and in effect give reasons why that termination should not proceed on the particular grounds that were identified to him. I do not go into the substance of those grounds. I do not seek to evaluate those grounds. That is a matter, obviously, for the grievance procedure.

        As to the identity of the officer who was involved in that termination process at the Canberra end, it was Mr Forrester. Mr Forrester did talk to Mr Butler, certainly.

        Nor was the wife, in the context of her sexual harassment complaint, in any doubt about the identity of Mr Forrester as the person handling, in the first instance, that complaint; nor was she in any doubt about Mr Forrester's role in relation to her husband. That was something that was open to her at any stage to express concern about and to go down any one of the other routes that were available to her for resolving this matter if she thought, for whatever reason, including the identity of the officer engaged in this conciliation process, she was not going to get a fair go.

        I want to say this: since the complaint was first brought to the attention of my Department—I am talking now about the sexual harassment complaint—it has been handled, on all the advice available to me, and I endorse this conclusion, in strict accordance with the Public Service Commission's guidelines. One of the most important principles that the Department sought to observe contained in those guidelines is that of confidentiality in order to protect the privacy of both parties. Might I, in that respect, refer, as I should have yesterday, to page 44 of the guidelines on eliminating sexual harassment, which state:

        In following the guidelines, my Department has done the following things: it has ensured that the complainant was fully aware of all the options available to her from the time she first reported the matter to a departmental workplace harassment contact officer. I have spelt out previously—I do not repeat them—what those options were. The Department has provided the complainant with copies of the Public Service Commission's guidelines on eliminating sexual harassment and the departmental policy statement on workplace harassment, the relevant part of which I tabled yesterday.

        The Department sought advice on several occasions in fact—this is the question I left not specifically answered yesterday because I was not clear what the answer was—from the Merit Protection and Review Agency, as is required by those guidelines, to confirm the correctness of the process being followed. Again, my Department maintained regular contact with the complainant in order to provide further opportunities for her to discuss any concerns that she might have. This contact included meetings between the complainant, her spouse and two female members of the Department's workplace harassment group. Two additional meetings were attended also by Mr Forrester. Mr Forrester and one of the workplace harassment contact officers maintained contact with the person against whom the complaint was made, as one would expect.

        As to my own role in this, let me say just once more and, again, in slightly more detail, that I am aware that ambassadors are appointed by the Executive Council on my recommendation. This does require me to satisfy myself in this particular case, where the person against whom the complaint has been made is an unattached officer of the Public Service, that these matters are being handled in accordance with the Public Service Commission's guidelines. Mr Forrester has reported to me twice now in writing. There has been some supplementary oral reporting in the last couple of days. It is for those reasons that Mr Forrester has reported to me on progress and he will continue to do so while he remains involved.

        It would, however—and this is the key point—be quite inappropriate for me to intrude further into the actual handling of this matter. I am sure that point would be understood by anyone who has any sensitivity or understanding about the way in which these delicate personnel matters should be handled. I hope that that is a sufficiently complete answer to put this matter in the public domain to rest once and for all unless, of course, the complainant should herself choose to raise it in some other public forum.

        —in reply—I am afraid that the explanation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) raises more questions than it answers. First of all, I think it is important to know why this matter is on the public record. It certainly was not me who put it there. This matter came on to the public record as a result of a

        The matter has become particularly contentious because on each occasion that the Minister has answered a question I have asked, he has given one answer and then come back to the chamber and changed it. Just as he did in answer to Senator Knowles's questions on Brian Burke and just as he did with the Marshall Islands affair, he has given one answer and had to change it each time he has come back into the chamber. The one thing he has done today which is very rewarding is that he has admitted that he is responsible in this matter because Mr Butler was appointed by the Executive Council on the Minister's personal recommendation.

         —Senator Bishop says no. We do not know how far this will be taken, but certainly the process which the complainant has taken so far is according to a particular statutory formula. The whole of the Standing Orders go towards protecting people's rights. If we want to speak, we can, but it is not appropriate, in terms of what is fair to people's rights, that these sorts of things should be pre-judged and canvassed in this chamber. It may bring pressure to bear on the conciliation process, the mediation process or, later, the decision making process. I simply ask people to remember that this is not the appropriate chamber to deal with this matter. It has been dealt with in an appropriate way in the sense that the appropriate way is set out in the statute. I simply beg, rather than anything else, people to remember that.

         —Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President. We have a responsibility to ensure that the Minister properly administers his Department. I will tell the Senate how the matter arose. What disturbed me in the first instance was that there were reports that a woman had made a claim of sexual harassment against a very senior bureaucrat. I immediately saw a situation of strength against weakness—I say this with respect to some honourable senators—in the power struggle within the bureaucracy. I read a response in the newspaper that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was seeking to conciliate the matter. That seemed to me—and we have since had explanations as to the statutory background for it—to be a pretty unusual response. I am putting it in a historical perspective because I have been asked to intervene. That response from the Department struck me as being pretty strange.

         Then information came to light to suggest that in fact the woman's husband—who also turned out to be a DFAT employee in Bangkok—was returned from Bangkok to Canberra by the Department, allegedly for incompetence or some other breach. That complicated the matter considerably, because here we have a negotiating process taking place within the Department whilst the husband of this woman apparently has some action hanging over his head. That concerns me. I immediately ask whether there can be a proper process within the Department as to whether this woman's claim had been made in circumstances where something was being held over her husband.

         Since then, further evidence has come to light suggesting that the action being taken against the husband was really quite serious. Today, the matter has been further complicated by the fact that we find that the same bureaucrats are involved—and have been involved—in the process concerning the two parties at that early stage. I think that raises many questions as to whether the Department is handling this sensitive matter properly and whether the Minister is meeting his responsibility to ensure that the Department handles this matter properly. It is quite within our rights to ask questions relating to those matters, and if we did not do so we would be failing in our responsibility.

        It is important to look at the chronology. This event occurred in February 1992. Six weeks later the husband of the woman concerned, who is a Thai national and may not understand the nuances of Senator Evans's guidelines—and I will come back to those in a moment—was returned to Australia after a telephone conversation took place between Mr Butler, that is the person who is alleged to have perpetrated the harassment, and Mr Forrester.

        We have here the potential for pressure to be placed on this woman and/or her husband to make them abandon the claim. If it is abandoned, it can be neatly swept under the carpet and there will be no findings, nothing known about the outcome and no criticism of the way the Minister has handled or has failed to handle it. To try to say that the Minister has dealt with it properly, when every day he has had to come back into the chamber and correct himself, when every day new information has had to be dragged out of him—and his only response has been to play not the issue but the woman and to use insulting, unpleasant language and think that that absolves him of any responsibility—quite frankly, I do not find acceptable and neither do people who listen in either, be they in the building or elsewhere.

He tries to tell us that he did not know of any of this information because nobody told him. On this Butler matter, no doubt he would have had no knowledge of this either if it had not been raised in this chamber. Now it is on the public record, as I said.

We are discussing a matter that is affecting a person who was appointed on the recommendation of the Minister by the Executive Council, and a lowly stenographer. That is what we are discussing.

        So let us get it straight: here in the Senate chamber today we are discussing whether or not the Minister has failed yet again, just as he did in the Burke affair and in the Marshall Islands affair and as he has done now in the Butler affair, and refused to properly investigate the matter. As I said, in his response to me earlier the one thing that he said that I took great delight in hearing was that he is responsible. So we look forward to the Minister departing from his previous record and coming to this Senate and giving it information in an orderly and proper way and not having to have it extracted painfully like a dentist pulling teeth.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Kemp on 19 August 1992, relating to the provision of Budget estimates and forecasts.

       The point at issue here is that Senator Button was responding to my question yesterday as to whether the Government would be prepared to table in the Senate the forward estimates of outlays and revenues, particularly revenues, through to the year 1995-96. He said he would find out whether that information could be tabled.

        Senator Button said in the chamber today that it was the practice of the Government not to include such projections in the Budget Papers. In a technical sense, of course, Senator Button is right. However, in relation to the One Nation statement which was brought down by the Government this February, the Government did put down its forward estimates of revenues and outlays, and I suggest that it did this for a very good reason. The reason it did this was to attempt to argue that its tax cuts were affordable. On page 149 of the One Nation statement, we see the very table which I have asked the Government now to update and to present to the Senate so that we can see whether the tax cuts which were proposed in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         One Nation

        Mr Deputy President, you will be aware that this has become a matter of important public debate. We know that the Treasury has prepared these forward estimates of outlays and revenues and we know that the Government has a problem, because the Government itself has told us in the Budget Speech that there is a problem. It has signalled that it is possible that a number of taxes will have to be raised.

        I suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, to the media and to the Australian people that it is vital that if we are going to properly evaluate this Budget and see what hidden time bombs this Budget has in store for us, we must know now, and the Government must tell us, what its forward projections of revenues are. In an attempt to justify the One Nation statement, the Government was quite happy to put forward such projections. It is not happy to put forward such projections now and I suggest that the very reason for this is that it would show a huge black hole in the Government's prospective budgets in the years ahead. I suggest that this can mean only one thing—further sharp rises in taxes as the Government itself has hinted at in the Budget Papers.

        I am not asking something which is unreasonable, because the Opposition has outlined in the Fightback statement its year on year projections to show how the very substantial income tax cuts which we have proposed can be afforded. Therefore, as we go towards the next election, it is not unreasonable that, through the Government's great resources, Mr Tony Cole and Dr Preston—who spent such time going through the forward projections of the coalition's Fightback program—turn their minds, as I am sure they already have, towards encouraging the Government to publish these forward estimates so we can make a direct comparison and the Australian people can be better informed.

          The Government has accepted all of the Committee's recommendations and I would like to comment on the implication of this. In effect, the Government has acknowledged that the processes and time frame of the proposed reforms were totally inadequate. The original intention was to make quite substantial changes in the operation of radiological services, without having much idea of the impact of this.

          It was the Committee's belief that such a procedure was impractical and could have substantial effects on the community. It was clear that a number of the organisations and involved groups had not been consulted adequately about the proposed changes and that even a number of radiologists believed that they had not been given sufficient information on the issues.

          One consequence of this high-handed approach was the failure to recognise the important role played by rural general practitioners providing radiological services in remote areas, and the need for out-of-hours services in certain locations. Another consequence was the amount of opposition to the proposed restructure that surfaced during the Committee stages. This illustrated the wide-ranging and potentially devastating effect the restructure would have on many. It also points to the need for adequate consultations with groups likely to be affected by reforms in the area of health services in order for the provision of radiological services to meet the differing needs of the community. The Committee recommended that further consultations were essential and I was delighted to see that the Government has recognised the importance of consulting with those groups which will be affected by new regulations.

          The Committee believed that it was essential for any changes that were to be made to be made as part of a comprehensive reform. There seems to be little logic in a piecemeal approach with a drastic cut to the income of some practitioners, an increase in the fees of other practitioners and little idea of either the short or long term effect of such changes on the availability and cost of services in the community.

          It is difficult to understand why any change of this magnitude would have been undertaken in the atmosphere of misinformation, poor planning and general disorder which marked the process. It was evident from the number of submissions to the Committee—and in fact the number was 96—and from the public hearings that there was no rational structure to the reorganisation.

          This piecemeal approach was also manifest in both the research undertaken during the planning of the restructure and the limited consultation that occurred during this phase. For a policy that was supposed to provide a cure to existing problems and to prevent any reduction in the quality of future radiological services, it was surprising how little evidence was marshalled to demonstrate the nature and causes of those alleged problems, and how little research was conducted to understand what sort of radiological services would be needed to meet the future community needs.

          Answers to these complex questions depended on systematic research and consultation with a range of organisations. However, these issues were foreclosed by a narrow and simplistic approach adopted by those who prepared the restructure. Even the findings of the consultants employed to prepare the costing models of radiological practices—for instance, that cross-subsidisation was untenable—were ultimately eschewed in favour of arguments of only one of the groups involved in the provision of radiological services.

          For these reasons I am pleased that the Government has endorsed the Committee's recommendations that further research be conducted into a wide range of issues relating to the provision of flexible and possibly more specialised radiological services, including after-hours services, and that those responsible for planning the reforms consult more widely on the matters which impact on patients, State government services, medical practitioners and the other professionals.

          It also should be noted that the Government has recognised the Committee's concern that the issue of overservicing, as it relates to radiology, needs to be thoroughly researched and its causes understood before any changes are made to legislation already in place which is designed to address this issue. Suggestions were continually made that overservicing was rife, that it was a major problem and that the implementation of the new fee structure would put an end to this type of fraud. However, no evidence was put forward by the Department or the Health Insurance Commission to substantiate these allegations.

          Naturally, the Committee was concerned at such charges and has requested the Department to provide a report on the matters to see whether there was any such relationship between overservicing and the growth and provision of certain types of services. The Committee believes that this process would be more sensible than developing further legislation, as there was no proof that the legislation already in place was ineffective.

         The Government notes that the sector is currently largely self-funding, and would not support any major diversion of public funding to change the basis of funding for the sector. Nonetheless, it recognises that there are uncertainties associated with project-based funding and that provision for the sector varies between the States and Territories. While not supporting a major change in the funding arrangements the Government will therefore further examine the funding situation in the context of the development of a national policy.

         The Government recognises and endorses the important role played by the adult and community education sector in providing development opportunities and avenues into the educational process for people who have had limited educational opportunities in their youth. In the current situation of high unemployment, priority must be given to assisting people to gain employment as quickly as possible and guidelines for the delivery of labour market programs will therefore need to retain a principally vocational focus. The Government will give consideration to the extent to which guidelines for Commonwealth grants could be modified to accommodate personal development activities relevant to employment.

         As noted in response to Recommendation 4, the Government recognises that there are uncertainties associated with project-based funding, but would not support any major diversion of public funding to change the current self-funding basis for the sector. The Government therefore expects that specific purpose and labour market program funding will continue to be the predominant source of Commonwealth funding for the sector. In so far as its funding is concerned the Commonwealth therefore considers this recommendation impracticable. While predicability in funding can have its benefits there are also benefits in a flexible and client oriented approach to program management which, under current arrangements, is a feature of adult and community education providers. As noted above, the Government will further examine funding arrangements in the context of the development of a national policy.

In other areas the Government notes the large number of people attending and paying for the courses provided by the ACE sector, an indication that the private benefits of participating in such courses outweigh the costs of involvement considerably.

         Advice received from the Commissioner of Taxation suggests that adult education organisations are not necessarily precluded from having sales tax exemption status. Exemption status may be granted where an organisation has a set curriculum in a recognised discipline, appropriately qualified teachers, a building or room set up as a school, and where certain standards of achievement lead to qualifications or promotion to higher grades of learning. This definition may exclude some legitimate adult and community education providers. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training will ask the Treasurer to examine the matter further.

The Government has responded to them all; it has responded to some positively, put some on the back burner and specifically rejected others. If we are to make anything of the value of Senate committees in this country, we should follow the pattern established by a few other committees in the past and ensure that our reports are followed up by government; ensure that debate takes place with government on those issues where, for example, we disagree; and ensure that, where there is agreement, we assist government to fulfil the obligations that it is prepared to accept as a result of these recommendations.

         Firstly, there is a tendency—and I note it in the Government's response—for a significant number of major movers and shakers in the education industry in this country to separate what they call vocational training from personal development. Personal development courses have been called other names, but basically such people have attempted to split the two as appropriate parts of the educational activity spectrum.

         I make it quite plain today that the biggest mistake we can make as a country, which is now starting to be much more interested in training than we were about 10 years ago, is to accept that false dichotomy. There is no major split between vocational training and personal development teaching or education. If we placed certain attributes into the category of personal development, we would see that those attributes are an essential springboard to what is described as strict vocational training.

         For example, a course which has been described as one which creates in the learner confidence, self-respect, personal development, a capacity to work with others and a capacity to solve issues as an individual or as part of a group, has already done a great deal to prepare a person for further training. Yet so many responses—it is, unfortunately, implicit in some of the Government's responses—to the big educational questions do make that distinction. They say, `Yes, there is strict vocational training, which is what we have to get people into, and then there is other personal development stuff'. Ballroom dancing, flower arranging and those types of activities are used as examples to indicate that personal development courses are less important than what they see as the very important strictly vocational courses.

         The two are part of the same spectrum. People who walk into a Neighbourhood House and learn to be competent at a skill—learn to relate to other people around them, learn to problem-solve, feel more at home with themselves and their community and feel more self-confident—are on the way to becoming educated people. Without those basic attributes it is very difficult for someone to be a successful learner.

         It is a bit like teaching children to ride a bike. The first thing to do is to get them to be slightly adventurous, physically competent and confident. If you walk alongside  them and say, `The penalty for failure is this', `I don't think you can do it', or other such phrases, you inevitably inhibit their capacity to learn that skill. So when government bureaucrats in Canberra, for example, say we should be putting our money into vocational training rather than personal development courses, it is obvious that they are blind to the absolute connection between personal development and the successful learning of skills.

         This report quite clearly shows that there is a continuum and that getting people back into education and training starts with courses which, in traditional terms, may not be described as educational with a capital `E', but for many people they are a first step back into the educational process.

         It is very interesting to look at three of the major companies in Germany—Mercedes, Siemens and Bayer. Like most major German companies, they have a very well organised program for training their employees.

Those companies regard the training of their employees as an essential responsibility of a major company.

They want their workers to do that because they know that a fully developed, rounded, confident worker is someone who can be trained in specific skills later.

          One thing that came out quite clearly was that for every person who was doing a specific skill retraining course in those four major companies that I mentioned, there was another one doing some course related to personal development and recreation, with the company's full support. It did not matter whether it was bushwalking, abseiling, repairing motor cars or whatever. The aim was to get people to be competent in something that they chose and that was of interest to them. That was the first step. After that, if they wanted to, they could move into areas of specific skill training.

         This is the message I want to leave today. It is very easy for bureaucrats in Canberra who have to spend money in the most appropriate and responsible way, in a time of scarce dollars, to plump for what they regard as skilled vocational training. At the same time it is very easy for those bureaucrats to neglect the essential springboard value that personal development courses have in getting people into the education spectrum.

         I agree with those bureaucrats who, for example, say that if people are unskilled, they are likely to be unemployed and are likely to be unemployed more often than other people; that if people are unskilled, they will have less value to the gross domestic product and to themselves. That is true. There is no doubt that many unskilled jobs in this community and in a number of other OECD countries have gone by the board. They have simply been phased out. Therefore, the need constantly to re-skill people and to upgrade their skills is paramount and obvious to us.

         The point I make, along with a number of people from this adult education area who came to our Committee, as distinct from a number of these bureaucrats—although we all see the same problem—is that you have to have a springboard into particular skilled training that starts by making people feel keen, confident and able to relate to their peer group. One of the key things is that most education never occurs in an atmosphere of loneliness and isolation. Learning occurs, generally speaking, in consultation and in cooperation with other people.

         I think that some bureaucrats have the notion that education of the future will involve a person sitting in front of a modem, probably surrounded by a wall, a la Port Arthur model prison chapel, tapping on a keyboard, putting in questions and getting responses and vice versa and ticking off the number of successes one gets to the questions asked. That is a very isolated operation. I have been into schools and I have seen this sort of thing happening. Young people put their headphones on, go into the booth and then spend an hour isolated with their thoughts, and in some cases the teachers are not working with them before or after or even during that process. All one has is an isolating experience, not an extending experience.

         The answer in regard to young people learning French or adults learning French or German or Swahili or Chinese or Japanese is not to use isolating techniques of learning like that. It is to get people to work together, to get from a group that which you cannot get from a book or from a video.

         The answer in future to upgrading the skills of our society will not necessarily be a technological one. If that were the case, many years ago we would have had every kid in this country strapped up to a modem with earphones on, punching away at a keyboard or doing things by using television. That has not happened, for the simple reason that human beings prefer to learn in a situation which is a mixture of individual activity, quiet study and group activity.

         Everyone in this chamber knows that most of what they have learnt has been precisely as a result of that mixture of activities—what we do as a group and what we do individually as we read or watch videos or television. The Government must examine this response and it must examine other documents that come before it. We have to ask ourselves a basic question. Are we artificially creating a dichotomy between personal development and vocational training? If we are, we will end up funding and running programs which take into account only half of a person's learning potential.

         It is easier to say, `We only fund what is strictly vocational and that personal development courses are to be paid for by the user'. If we make those distinctions, we isolate a significant number of people who ought to be coming back into the education area. I refer, for example, to people who had bad experiences at school and do not want to know any more about education. We have to get those people back again because they are the ones who, in a changing society, are usually most at risk in terms of their economic potential, their capacity to get jobs and to hold jobs and their capacity to deal with their own lives—literally running a household, bringing up children and relating to each other. Some people are more vulnerable than others and the ones who left school early are generally, according to virtually all the studies I have seen, the ones most likely to get into difficulties.

I believe Tasmania has the lowest percentage of students in private schools compared with students in public schools.

They may be the very brightest ones who are simply bored, the bright ones who are not taken to their full potential; or they may be those with lesser abilities or those with some social handicap which makes it difficult for them to learn.

Probably the majority of us here cannot speak another language, yet we live in one of the most multicultural countries in the world. How many of us actually learn a second language later in life? In Australia there are 480,000 people who live in families where Italian is one of the major languages, either spoken as a first or a second language. Yet how many people in this chamber, let alone the community at large, have studied another language?  One could count those in this chamber who have done so, I guess, on the fingers of one hand.

         If we translate what is lacking in this chamber to what is happening out there in the community at large, we can see that the improvement of particular skills by a wide section of people in the community can only benefit the country, let alone individuals. Our children, the ones who are 19, 20 and 21 years of age, on the whole have been a bit better trained than we have in terms of the overall skill pattern. But, nevertheless, at high school or, for that matter, at primary school or even at university, one cannot give students all the skills they are going to need throughout their lives. So adult and community education will always fulfil a major need in the community.

         This is a pioneer activity because governments have traditionally shied away from funding or being involved in adult and community education. No government likes to pick up commitments which will cost it more and more each year. But if the clever country is going to be just that—a clever, comfortable, happy country—and if we are going to move towards those sorts of goals, then the development of adult and community education will be absolutely vital. It will not be done through TAFE, universities and high schools alone. There is an absolute requirement for this flexible sector of the education industry. It will require a rethink on the part of governments of all persuasions.

         The benefit from this joint party Committee's unanimous recommendations is that, regardless of what party is in government here next year, there will be a group of people who will be able to pursue an agenda, and the agenda simply says: `No. 1 right through to No. 30'. Adult and community education is a vital part of the whole education industry—of the educational spectrum—and it has to be supported in a way that it has not been supported in the past. This Parliament has a responsibility to do something about that. If governments get laggardly over this issue; if they get conned by the bureaucrats, who will do as little as possible; if they get conned by hypotheses and theories, and ideas that are half-baked and that, for example, separate vocational from self-development courses; if they get conned by those sorts of notions, then it is the role of this chamber, in particular, to make sure that they are brought back to reality.

By way of further endorsement of the Chairman's remarks, I can only say that I was fortunate to be a member of the recent parliamentary delegation to South America. On that trip, I was reminded of the very sorts of things that Senator Aulich, as Chairman of the Committee, has just been speaking about; that is, that there is, and should not be, a distinction between vocational education and the development of people's personal skills. It was self-evident, particularly in Brazil, where we were fortunate enough as a delegation to visit the office of the TNT transport company, an Australian company which had made an investment in Brazil. Part of that investment was for the company to meet the need of its work force in basic workplace education.

         The fact that the education was necessary was not only an indictment of the education system of the country but also an acknowledgment of the personal skills that are required to work in any industry. One can imagine the chaos which would be caused in delivering parcels from one end of Brazil to the other if the literacy of the deliverers was in question. As well as that, one can imagine the further inability of workers to perform the most basic functions of a worker in the transport industry if there was little knowledge of geography and the clerical skills required to ensure that the right parcel, package or item was delivered to the correct consignee.

         It was made apparent at the most basic level to those of us who visited the company that there was a need for adequate education and that, because this was not present in the country, the operating company had to provide for that need. In doing so, that company was then able to develop loyalty to the company based on what it had provided for its workers. Of course, the workers' appreciativeness was reflected in the fact that, unique or at least uncommon to the companies in San Paulo, this particular company had a loyal, longstanding and fairly static work force.

        GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REVIEW OF THE AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE, AUGUST 1992

         BACKGROUND
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) was established as a statutory authority within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982 (ACIAR Act 1982). That legislation provided for scrutiny and review by way of a sunset clause limiting the life of the organisation to 12 years (June 1994), subject to a review at the 10 year stage, ie. by June 1992.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Prior to arranging for the mandatory sunset review, on 18 October 1991 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, formally referred the matters of ACIAR's effectiveness against its charter and its statutory authority status to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for review and report. The Minister requested that the review be concluded prior to May 1992. In requesting that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade conduct the inquiry, the Minister hoped to expose the Centre's operations and performance to public scrutiny and also to help obtain a wider understanding of ACIAR's role.

         OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government congratulates the Committee on its extremely thorough approach to the review. The Committee has made careful and considered recommendations on the matter of the continued existence of ACIAR and has made a number of valuable recommendations for improving ACIAR's efficiency and effectiveness in the future. Their implementation will lead to enhanced performance of ACIAR as an important element of the aid program.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government agrees with the fundamental recommendation that ACIAR continue as a statutory authority, located within the foreign affairs and trade portfolio, and that the sunset clause limiting the life of the Centre be removed. ACIAR performs an important function independently in the aid program in improving the well-being of people in developing countries and Australia through collaborative research partnerships aimed at the development of sustainable agricultural systems and the design of appropriate natural resource management strategies. ACIAR's projects mobilise Australian research expertise, thereby contributing to building research capacity both in Australia and developing countries.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government agrees that the Centre should continue to undergo external reviews at regular intervals, as required of all statutory authorities, but considers that such reviews should be conducted by appropriate persons selected at the time of review and with the objectives of the review in mind.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee recommended that the role of sunset clauses for statutory authorities be investigated by the appropriate Parliamentary Committee. The Government notes this recommendation and suggests it would be appropriate for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to draw the matter to the attention of the Presiding Officers of Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government agrees that ACIAR's functions and mandate should be expanded further to include responsibility for the administration and disbursement of funds to the International Agricultural Research Centres, the conduct of project-related training and administration of the relevant training scheme and funds, and the carrying out of modest project-related development activities where practicable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee made two recommendations concerning the Centre's governing bodies. The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation that ACIAR's Policy Advisory Council be reduced in size, but considers it to be important that, in its advisory capacity, the Council have a substantial number of members from countries other than Australia. The Government also considers that ACIAR's Board should be a five-member board which need not necessarily have AIDAB representation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee made a number of valuable recommendations pertaining to the focus, administration and internal management of ACIAR's research program which the Government endorses in principle. In some cases the Government has advocated a broader approach and has commended the recommendations to the consideration of ACIAR's Board of Management and Policy Advisory Council for future policy directions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee made several recommendations concerning, or with implication for, funding within the aid program, namely an increase in ACIAR's budget to 3.5% of the aid budget by 1997, an increase in core funding for the International Agricultural Research Centres (IARCs) to 1.5 of ODA by 1997, and the creation of an establishment along the same lines as ACIAR with responsibility for research and development assistance in areas including manufacturing systems and human resource development. The Government considers that ACIAR's performance and the importance of the IARCs' programs warrant a reconsideration of their funding priority within the aid budget. Further consideration to a body similar to ACIAR to deal with non-agricultural sectors will be given.

        The Government agrees that it is important for ACIAR to maintain close dialogue with AIDAB and considers that it would be imperative for the Director-General of AIDAB or his or her nominee, to be a member of the Policy Advisory Council. However, the Government does not accept the on-going need for AIDAB to be represented on the Centre's Board of Management, given ACIAR's evolution and performance as a statutory authority completely independent of AIDAB. The Government considers that ACIAR's Board of Management should be an executive body composed of 5 members, but not necessarily having AIDAB representation.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The Government notes the importance of ACIAR's Policy Advisory Council as an advisory body to the Minister which has played a fundamental role in the evolution of the Centre's programs. The Council is unique in its composition of distinguished partner country members and eminent Australians. The Government agrees that there is scope for reduction in membership of ACIAR's Policy Advisory Council but considers that the JCFADT's recommendation of an absolute size of 12 members could be too restrictive. A membership of 12 to 14 would provide greater flexibility.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        While the JCFADT's recommendation that the number of partner country and Australian members be equal reflects the partnership concept well, the Minister may care to have a larger number of partner country representatives than Australians on the Council from time to time or vice versa.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The Government therefore does not accept the JCFADT's recommendation that the number of Australian and overseas country representatives need be equal on the Council. It would seem that maximum benefit could be derived from the Council as an effective and fundamental advisory body if it were composed of 12 to 14 members, a substantial number of whom would be drawn from ACIAR's partner countries.

        The JCFADT's recommendation that the quorum requirement for a meeting of the Policy Advisory Council be reduced from 9 to 7 reflects the reduction in overall membership of the Council. The Government considers that the requirement of 7 members for a quorum will also accord with a flexible membership of the Council of 12 to 14 members. The Committee's recommendation that the President have a deliberative and  casting vote, however, reflects the Committee's view that the Council comprise equal numbers of Australian and overseas country representatives. With a flexible number of Australian and overseas country members, the preferred option outlined above, the need for the President to exercise a deliberative and casting vote will not apply.

         The Committee recommends that ACIAR's primary focus remains South East Asia and the South Pacific. However, as funding permits, ACIAR should foster collaborative projects of mutual importance in other parts of the world, including Africa, the Middle East and South America. North Africa and the Middle East, in particular, should be a priority because of Australia's expertise in dryland farming.

        The Committee notes that ACIAR has fulfilled well its mission of improving the well-being of people in developing countries through its programs, which have been focused in those countries of importance to Australia's aid program. The Government agrees with the JCFADT that the assistance ACIAR provides should continue to be in line with Australia's aid objectives and thus focus primarily on programs in Asia and the Pacific, notably South East Asia and the South Pacific. The Government sees no reason why ACIAR should not foster collaborative projects in Africa, the Middle East and South America, capitalising on Australian expertise relevant to these areas, but notes that the expansion of programs into these regions would be resource dependent. ACIAR will continue to maintain existing programs in Asia and the Pacific and will assess proposals for projects in Africa, the Middle East and South America in the context of availability of resources, research priorities, impact and potential benefits in both Australia and the countries concerned. The Policy Advisory Council will provide advice on this issue.

        The Government agrees with the need for ACIAR to continue to maintain flexibility of approach to research partnerships and project design and considers it important that the factors applied by ACIAR in project evaluation and implementation regularly be clarified and publicised to the stakeholders concerned. The matter of the extent and duration of involvement of project scientists in-country work is important to ensure maximum benefits are derived by partner countries from collaboration between their scientists and Australian scientists. It is recognised, however, that this will vary from country to country, institution to institution and project to project, having regard to the level of science and technicality in projects and the internal capacity of the partner country institutions. Thus ACIAR will continue to be sensitive to these factors and will need to evaluate the level of scientific interaction required on this basis.

        The Government acknowledges that there may be instances where ACIAR projects could achieve optimum results and impact if implemented over a 5 year period rather than the current 3 year project duration. ACIAR currently adopts a flexible approach whereby extensions to 3 year projects are implemented to continue research or focus on particular aspects of research arising from the initial 3 years. The Government agrees that ACIAR needs to retain this flexible approach but may also consider the option of 5 year projects as necessary, bearing in mind the constraints of forward commitments and planning in administrative and resource terms.

        The Government agrees that there is benefit in defining the relationship between ACIAR and Australian commissioned organisations in clear guidelines. However, the relative responsibilities of each organisation in terms of the conduct of projects are already clearly spelled out in the formal Project Agreements entered into by ACIAR and commissioned organisations and it is difficult to see where these could be elaborated or improved. ACIAR will continue to evaluate and refine the terms of the Project Agreement, remedying deficiencies as this becomes required. The Government therefore does not accept the Committee's recommendation that there is a need to develop a further set of detailed guidelines at this stage.

In this context ACIAR's Board of Management has determined a policy of considering overhead charges on a project by project basis, having regard to the policies and practices of commissioned organisations. The Government endorses this approach which responds to an evolving situation. ACIAR's Board of Management may need to reconsider its policy and reassess the current approach in response to the position eventually adopted by commissioned organisations, and re-issue an appropriate policy when required.

         On many occasions Reserve Bank reports have provided an insight into a different level, nature and style of official advice which is given to the Government. It is unfortunate that ever since Mr John Phillips appeared to take a considerable role in the preparation of reports a couple of years ago, the Reserve Bank annual reports have tended to echo much more the evident attitudes of the Government rather than express what one would have hoped might have been strongly individual views or a strongly independent view of the monetary authorities.

I would have thought that at the moment it would be very difficult to find a unanimity of view about the level of the present Government's incompetence. Certainly, there is a widespread view that it is incompetent, that its management of the economy has been monumentally incompetent. It is curious to find that the Reserve Bank, apparently, has very little disagreement with anything that has been done by the Government in leading this nation into the most appalling, disastrous and largely unnecessary recession. This recession has been influenced to only a relatively small extent by external factors, unlike the 1982-83 recession which was basically drought driven. The Reserve Bank deals with that matter.

         I suppose it is all very well for the Reserve Bank to say that now. But what was the Reserve Bank doing at the time; what was Government policy at the time? The report goes on:

        <para>
         There is no doubt that real interest rates have remained high and maybe this is one reason that there has been such a very slow recovery from recession. The bank notes in its report that there has been a reluctance on the part of corporations to extend their indebtedness. It may well be, of course, a reluctance by the banks to extend credit. But the continuing very high level of real interest rates clearly is a factor.

          It is interesting to note, too, in the context of the Victorian State election that the bank recognises that there have been different economic results in different States. The bank notes:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The effects of falling asset prices and the associated impacts on financial stability and confidence were concentrated most heavily in those areas which had become most overextended. Victoria (and more lately South Australia) suffered the worst falls on most measures of economic activity. . .
        </para>
        <para>
         It is significant, as the Reserve Bank said, that Victoria and South Australia became the most overextended States. It is interesting to note that the State banks in both those States played a key role in that overextension. The State banks, under the policy directions of their Labor State governments, have played a key role in the disasters from which these two States are now suffering.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is interesting to note that the Reserve Bank in effect underlines in its comment almost the culpability of the Victorian State Government, which owned the Victorian State Bank—this also applies in the case of the South Australian Government. This led to a ludicrous situation in which Victoria became overextended and, as a result, it is now suffering the most. I hope that the Victorian electorate recognises the role that its State Government played in this overextension as a result of which it is now suffering.

         I do not know that the Budget is going to do that. All we see in the Budget is in fact an absence of any major, or even minor, programs that will encourage the generation of real and lasting private sector jobs, and this is the only place which can provide genuine increases in employment. So it appears that, despite the Reserve Bank's enthusiastic remarks about employment growth needing to be restored promptly, this Government is doing nothing about it except creating temporary jobs paid for not by the taxpayer but as a result of increasing debt—paid for on Bankcard.

          This is one of the dramatic differences between the nonsense of the Government's approach and the sorts of genuine assistance and encouragement for the private sector which are contained in the Opposition's Fightback policy, which takes taxes off business, helps generate jobs in the private sector and provides a real solution to Australia's problems. The One Nation package is now a clear failure. Mr Hawke, the former Prime Minister, quite properly identified it as containing such ludicrous forecasts and statements of expectation that it has in fact damaged the Government's credibility. Mr Hawke, of course, is quite right.

          There is one thing the Reserve Bank has stressed that I think is very important and that is the difference between this recession and the 1982-83 recession. We keep hearing from economic imbeciles on the other side—from the front bench in particular—who try to pretend that somehow things were worse in 1982-83 and that their problems are all because of what happened then. The Reserve Bank makes a very significant statement about this. It points out that the major recession in the early 1980s `had been exacerbated by the effect of drought on rural output'. It goes on:

         Let us get this clear: the Reserve Bank acknowledges that the fall in the non-farm economy in this recession has been larger than in 1982-83. In other words, this Government has managed to do this without the savage impact of drought which, of course, decimated the Australian economy in 1982-83. Let us hear no more of these nonsensical comparisons, because the Reserve Bank is demonstrating that the Labor Party has simply been misleading the people of Australia on this score. The report goes on:

         So this recession, on the Reserve Bank's evidence, is deeper, more protracted and worse than the 1982-83 recession. It is about time those sitting on the Government front bench recognised the reality and stopped spreading the Labor lie that somehow things were worse in 1982-83.

          I had also failed to pick up, until the Reserve Bank report did so, that the increase in consumer demand for retail goods, which rose in the June quarter, was largely a recovery brought about by this Government by handing out loot. In other words, it can fiddle the national income figures with taxpayers' money just as it can fiddle the unemployment figures, and it has been doing both. The Reserve Bank says:

         Here we have a situation where, clearly, if a government puts its mind to it, like this Government, it can fiddle the consumer demand element of the national income figures by paying out taxpayers' money, or borrowed money—which has now been demonstrated because of the huge size of the deficit—to fiddle the accounts. It means that one must take the national income figures with even larger grains of salt when the Government quotes national income figures to demonstrate economic recovery.

          The next point I want to make refers to the Reserve Bank's comments on the balance of payments. It points out that the net income deficit declined to $15.7 billion, down from $18 billion, in 1991. But then it reveals something else that I must admit I had not noted sufficiently well, that is, that this fall reflected a decline in the cost of servicing foreign liabilities mainly as a result of lower interest rates on foreign debt. It notes:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For the year to March 1992, the annual interest burden represented around 17 per cent of the value of exports of goods and services, around 3 percentage points lower than two years earlier.
        </para>
        <para>
         In other words, there does not appear to be a fundamental basic improvement in the balance of payments at all. On the contrary, it is simply because of lower external interest rates that the cost of servicing our debt diminished. That eased the burden and gave the false appearance of things being an awful lot better, and that the Government was somehow doing something to fix up the balance of payments crisis that Australia is in. It is simply not true. It is another indicator that does not really indicate that things are getting better at all. It certainly does not indicate that this Government is doing anything to improve the situation. As the Australian dollar falls, the servicing costs will increase, and I notice that in the Budget Papers there is a clear indication that the current account balance will worsen yet again.

         Minimising the fallout of the recession on the labour market will require balanced macro-economic policies, acting on the demand side of the economy.

In particular, successful competition in the international market place ultimately requires a highly skilled and adaptable labour force.
        </para>
        <para>
         What is the Government doing about these vital objectives that the Reserve Bank says must be achieved? I guess we could say that it is trying to improve the skill levels and the adaptability of a labour force, because it is trying to increase the numbers of people who are unemployed who are able to pick up skill levels. To that extent, I suppose we could say, `For heaven's sake, at least the Government has recognised part of the problem'. But it has not recognised what the Reserve Bank points out first—that we have to have balanced macro-economic policies acting on the demand side of the economy and, further, micro-economic policies aimed at increasing flexibility on the supply side.

          The Reserve Bank notes that there are problems with the public sector borrowing requirement. It says that the current financial situation `will make it more difficult to wind back the PSBR than in the 1980s, as well as limiting the scope for further discretionary increases in spending or cuts in taxes'. Here we have the Reserve Bank saying that the economic situation will limit the scope for further discretionary increases in government spending and this Government is, in fact, increasing government spending by borrowing—unfunded schemes and a massive deficit. The report then says that it will also be more difficult to introduce cuts in taxes, yet the Government says that it is going to proceed with cuts in taxes.

          Although the Reserve Bank's annual report is not as clearly a source of different, independent advice to the Parliament and to the Government as one has seen in the past, it does, nevertheless, reveal some clear failures of this Government. It clearly indicates that the Government is not undertaking a course that appears—if one reads between the lines of the Reserve Bank's report—to be one that the Reserve Bank would favour in some instances. The report clearly indicates that the present disaster in Victoria, for example, is directly attributable to the sorts of policies that allowed the financial institutions controlled by the governments in Victoria and South Australia to over-extend themselves and to over-expand. For all that, the Reserve Bank report is a useful document, but it would be nice to see it more of an independent one in terms of its general policy thrust and advice than it appears to be at the moment.

          —I would like to say a few words about this report, and endorse the comments made by my friend and colleague Senator Michael Baume. I want to touch on two main aspects of the bank's report. Firstly, I would like to point out that net profits made under the Reserve Bank Act—profits which basically relate to the activities of the bank—amounted to $2.6 billion in 1991-92. This was approximately $1 billion up on the amount of $1.6 billion—or near enough to it—in the preceding financial year of 1990-91. I would also like to make the point that those profits have been appropriated essentially to the Commonwealth Government. That $2.6 billion was very important in enabling the Government to produce a Budget deficit for this year of $13.4 billion instead of the much higher underlying deficit that really exists.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The Government has published in the Budget the figure of $13.4 billion as its bottom line deficit. The true deficit is, in fact, closer to $20 billion. Indeed, it is $20.5 billion. The most important single element in bridging the gap between that $13.4 billion and $20.5 billion—namely, $7.1 billion—is the very large Reserve Bank profit of $2.6 billion. It is not a cooking of the books by the Commonwealth Government in terms of its Budget formulation; nevertheless, if we are making an accurate assessment of the Government's true budgetary position, that figure should be set aside. Therefore, the Reserve Bank has once again, as it did last year, made a significant contribution towards allowing the Government to publish a much lower Budget deficit figure than the true figure.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Of course, the published figure is already horrendously high at $13.4 billion. That is something like 40 or 50 per cent higher than the far too high $9.3 billion deficit last year, which was, in itself, one of the important contributing factors in the continuing growth in the tragic level of unemployment in Australia. That deficit was also the reason for the level of economic growth—particularly in the private sector—being much less than it should have been.

          Another point I want to make about the Reserve Bank's annual report—and in this I endorse the comments of Senator Baume—is that there is an eerie similarity this year between the assessments of the bank and the assessments of the Treasury about the economic situation and the prospects for the future. Like Senator Baume, I would like to see a more full-blooded and independent assessment by the bank of the economic situation.

          The bank has had a very proud record of objectivity over many years—for most of the past years, anyway—in terms of its analysis and the frankness with which it publishes material. Senator Baume referred to the era when Mr Phillips was the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank. There have been previous occasions when, under Governors such as Bob Johnston, Harry Knight and Jock Phillips—as well as some of those other great Governors of the Reserve Bank—the bank was fearless in the advice that it provided to government and to the wider community. I detect a lessening of that in recent years.

It is extremely important that the Reserve Bank, as the central bank of this nation, is not only independent and fearless in the advice it gives to government and in the information it publishes for the community but also is seen to be independent. I hope that that situation of apparent independence, which I think has lessened in recent years, will be restored because it is of very considerable importance. The coalition, on coming to government after the next election, will be taking several major steps to ensure that the Reserve Bank is an independent institution, not only in reality but also quite obviously in the community's perception of it.

The national accounts figures show very halting growth. Much of the anecdotal evidence that is available to us indicates that in most major segments of the economy there has been no recovery, but a continuing deep recession and continuing major lay-offs of people in jobs.

         That really is not saying too much at all, given the snail's pace at best that we have had in the past 12 months.

In the Government's own Estimates published in the Budget only two days ago, the Government forecasts that the average rate of unemployment in this current financial year of 1992-93 will be 10.5 per cent, which is higher than the figure for 1991-92 on average of 10.4 per cent.

There is no way that the taxes that it nominates for increase, namely, fringe benefits, withholding and prescribed payments—as Senator Cook should know but obviously does not—can provide the necessary increase in revenue to fill the void unless the Government savagely increases those taxes. Even then, the Government probably would not make it.

          The certainty would be that if the Government were re-elected, it would finish up with a goods and services tax in the next couple of years. This would happen without any of the offsetting tax cuts, the $13 billion of tax cuts in personal income tax, the $20 billion of cuts in the taxes that are so onerous on business in Australia today—none of the generous compensation measures and provisions contained in the coalition's Fightback proposals to go with the major restructuring of the taxation system of which the goods and services tax is only one part.

          If this Government is re-elected, which will not happen, there is no doubt that there would be a savage increase in the total level of taxation over the next few years. That is obvious, given the amount by which it is putting itself into hock. This year the financing requirement of the Government will be $18.5 billion. That is the amount of money it has to find out in the money markets either here or abroad, simply to meet the extent to which its expenditure this year will exceed its revenue.

          That puts the Government into increasing hock. It means that the public interest payments—the interest bill that has to be met by taxpayers this year—will go up by 26 per cent, to quote the Government's own figures. Next year, it will go up by 33 per cent. Even the year after, it will go up by another 15 per cent. All of that has to be paid for out of taxpayers' funds even before one starts to pay off one cent of the actual massive increases in borrowing.

          Over the next three or four years, we will see a cumulative deficit in this country of a figure which could well approach $50 billion. The Reserve Bank's report talks about the size of deficits. It does not express quite the degree of concern that I certainly would have about the deficit over the past couple of years. It does make a statement that is important because it conflicts completely with the actual situation that we will face in this country. It says that for a variety of reasons, `temporary large deficits do not themselves pose a serious problem'.

          The first point to be made about that is that the deficit that we face as a nation in the Commonwealth Budget accounts is not temporary. It is an enormous deficit of an ongoing nature which the Government itself has acknowledged will continue well into the 1990s. That imposes structural constraints on the economy which are highly detrimental to the growth in GDP, investment, savings and, therefore, unemployment. The whole policy approach enshrined in the Budget of two days ago is a policy approach which is absolutely contrary to the requirements of this nation if we really do want to get back and be a dynamic, growing, job creating nation.

         That would have to be the understatement of the year. As Senator Baume said in his remarks, to date no adjustment has been undertaken. That is the reason why this nation is in its present dreadful mess, with its tragic level of unemployment, desperately low growth, and an abysmally low level of savings and investment. If it is said that the economy still faces a considerable adjustment task over the next several years, all I can say to that is, it sure does.

          This year's Budget forecast was for a balance of payments deficit on current account of $15 billion compared with $11.9 billion in the year just ended. That $15 billion deficit is probably optimistic because it is based on what I think can reasonably be described as an optimistic forecast for the growth in exports, given the uncertain situation that faces us in the major export markets that we rely on. Sixty per cent of our exports go to the Asian region, of which Japan is a very important part. The Japanese economy, as we all know, is pretty rocky at the moment and has some considerable problems of adjustment ahead. That will have an impact throughout the Asian region, and some of the individual major countries in the Asian region are undergoing their own readjustment problems, with lower growth rates than they have had in the past.

          The report also says that the lower inflation environment can only be good for overall savings performance and for the process of allocation of these savings. I agree with that in theory. In practical terms though, we now have almost the lowest level of savings as a nation that we have had certainly in living memory. One of the essential reasons for that is that the Government, through its budgetary policy, has been drawing on the nation's savings at an unprecedented rate. While I agree with the bank in its report that a positive overall savings performance is what is needed—of course it is—if the Government were to believe that, it would be taking steps through its Budget policy and other policy measures to ensure that it encouraged that performance rather than, as it is in fact doing, detracting from it very severely.

There has been a turnaround in the public sector borrowing requirement as a proportion of gross domestic product of no less than 7 per cent in the past three years. So far as I am aware, never in our history have we had a turnaround and deterioration of the public borrowing situation of that magnitude. This year will compound the problem even further.

The longer we delay in undertaking the necessary reforms in those areas, the longer we will be condemned to a decade of low growth in the economy, low investment, low savings and—as I have said and as has been said all too often—a tragically high level of continuing unemployment.

         The report is interesting because the tobacco industry is in a state of flux. I note the comment that Mr Arthur Graham, Chairman of the Advisory Committee, has made on page 5 of the report, where he says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The value of the Australian dollar has shown remarkable resilience despite the adverse economic climate in Australia in recent years. While the advantage to the growing sector of a depreciation of the Australian dollar is obvious, any sustained appreciation would only compound the challenge of trading without any market regulation and the continuing decline in tariff protection.

          One of the great problems the tobacco industry faces is that it is competing against countries where there is no free float of the currency. In fact, one of the major competitors of the Australian producers is Zimbabwe. That country principally has one cash crop, and that is tobacco leaf. The consequence is that every time growers in Australia or the United States become competitive with the growers in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe devalues its currency. Zimbabwe then can still get good returns in soft currency, but of course it drags down the price that it is fetching on the world market.

          The problem for us is that we do not devalue our currency every time we want to give a boost to the cash crop. In fact, some people would say that the currency at the moment is far too high. The great challenge for the Australian industry is how to compete with this.

          That is a real challenge because this year tobacco growers in Zimbabwe are selling their leaf for prices denominated in US dollars. So if the Australian dollar increases against the greenback, the consequence will be that, even if the price of tobacco leaf as sold in Zimbabwe stays the same, it would come in here much cheaper. Of course, the other problem is that Zimbabwe could well do a devaluation of the sort of magnitude we saw at the end of last season, which would throw huge amounts of leaf, sold at well under what is a realistic price, into the market and wipe out Australian growers.

          Given that it is almost inevitable that tariffs in the tobacco industry will come down—although it does not really make much of a substantial impact on prices—I believe that we should take a serious look at the definitions of `dumping' and `countervailing'.

          Although neither a dumping action nor a countervailing action should be used as a form of non-tariff protection, we have to be very aware that some countries do not have a clean float of their currency. We also have to be aware that, if we express the prices in perhaps the black market price for their currency rather than the official price, there is de facto dumping of the goods into the international market—and, most importantly, dumping of the goods into the Australian market.

          When we look at possible dumping we should be looking at expressing the price at which it is sold in the parallel marketplace for that crop rather than the official exchange rate in the country in question. If we did that, we would really wipe out the advantage in terms of selling into Australia that countries such as Zimbabwe had last year by their dirty devaluation. All I am asking is for the Government to go away and look at this problem. It is a very real problem—not just from Zimbabwe but from many other East African countries—which will remain with us until we take some positive steps.

         In reference to the annual report of the Institute, Senator Harradine attempted to show that there had been some impropriety regarding the Institute's payment of $3,618 towards the cost of bringing a Danish criminologist, Dr Berl Kutchinsky, to Australia to speak at the Institute's Conference on the Sex Industry and Public Policy.

         Senator Harradine's objections seemed to focus on the fact that Professor Kutchinsky's findings that there had been a 30 per cent decrease in sex crimes in three European countries since the legalisation of adult erotica were opposed to his personal beliefs that non-violent adult sexual depictions lead otherwise normal human beings to rape or even to kill. I attended that conference and recall that Professor Kutchinsky's contribution was very well received.

         Senator Harradine quoted Dr John Court and Dr Judith Reisman as criticising Kutchinsky's research and therefore calling into question his suitability to address the conference. I would like to inform the Senate of what the British Royal Commission on Pornography had to say about Dr Court. It said:

        From my own experience of Dr Court's published work, I would concur with the Commission's view. Senator Harradine also claimed that the Institute had failed to invite any of Dr Kutchinsky's critics to debate his findings. That puzzles me and perhaps Senator Harradine has begun to re-evaluate his traditional allies, because both the Reverend Fred Nile and Senator Shirley Walters attended the conference, and it is my recollection that both were invited speakers. Senator Harradine also claimed that the selection of funded speakers was made solely by Dr Wilson. This is incorrect as all speakers were approved by the Director of the Institute who was kept informed through all stages of the preparation and the conference itself.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The aggregate data on rape and other violent or sexual offenses from four countries where pornography, including aggressive varieties, has become widely and easily available during the period we have dealt with would seem to exclude, beyond any reasonable doubt, that this availability has had any detrimental effects in the form of increased sexual violence. Especially the data from West Germany are striking since here the only increase in the sexual violence takes place in the form which includes the least serious forms of sexual coercion and where there may have been increases in reporting frequency. As far as the other forms of sexual violence are concerned, the remarkable fact is that they decreased—the more so, the more serious the offense.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The finding is not so strange. Most other research data we have about pornography and rape suggest that the link between them is more than weak. And our knowledge about the contents, the uses and the users of pornography suggests that pornography does not represent a blueprint for rape, but is essentially an aphrodisiac, that is, food for the sexual fantasy of persons—mostly males—who like to masturbate.

         The policy implications of this conclusion are, of course open to debate. But as mentioned earlier, the mainstream attitude would seem to be a combination of two movements; (1) To reduce the area of total prohibition and censorship to a minimum, and (2) to implement a variety of restrictions, suitable of each form of pornography, in order to obtain maximum protection of children, and of adults who want no confrontation with the material.

         My office has received an order request from the Michigan State Police study on pornography and it's impact on sex motivated crime. This is truly the most distant request we have ever received. For several years I have responded to requests from all over the United States and Canada. This study was allegedly conducted by a former member of this Unit and presented in various public forums. Since his retirement, several attempts were made to locate this study. After years of investigation, the truth is that no such study was ever conducted.

         The promise of the study was supposed to show that pornography causes sexual assault. Anyone who has ever studied human behaviour knows that this is extremely difficult, if not impossible to say that one things causes certain behaviour. The best one can show is a correlation. The Michigan State Police maintain the largest computerized sex motivated crime file in the world. This file was initiated in 1955 and continues to be present, with almost 75,000 cases on file. The information that we can glean from these reports is greater today than during the time that this study was allegedly conducted. I have attempted to replicate the information that was being offered about pornography. There is insufficient data to indicate anything other than a weak correlation between pornography and sexual assault, and even less information to suggest that pornography was used prior to or during sexual assault.

         As the criminal personality profiler for the Michigan State Police, I can offer that pornography is used to enhance sexual fantasy and for arousal. That this material would cause one to work themself up into a frenzy and then commit a sexual assault would be a giant leap indeed. In fact, one of the most popular magazines in prison amongst child molesters is the J.C. Penney catalog (retail store), because it features young boys and girls in their underwear. I believe that the person who presented this study had a religious agenda. Wouldn't it be nice if all we had to do was eliminate pornography and we could eliminate sex crimes?  Aside from the difficulty in defining pornography, I could show a stronger correlation between the use of alcohol and sexual assault than pornography and sexual assault.

          As NBEET is one of the most prolific producers of asinine reports in the Public Service system, it was with some relief that I read this report and discovered that it is actually looking at a very useful issue and had some very useful comments on HECs and educational profiles. Needless to say, the opinions expressed by the Higher Education Council through NBEET are just a continuation of the sort of rhetoric that we have come to expect from this organisation.

          A perfect example from the report is that NBEET states that `There is strong support for the profiling process'. This opinion has been obtained by going around the various universities and asking them if they approve of it. This is not a very sound method of assessing the feelings for the education profile process or anything else. No university vice-chancellor is about to bite the hand that feeds the university. When the report says, `There is generally strong support for the profiles process overall', the praise seems to have a somewhat hollow ring to it.

          As I have moved around universities in Australia and talked to senior staff, this is not what they are telling me. They see it as a huge imposition and a drain on their resources. I noted in visitations to various educational institutions by the Higher Education Council that they were not meeting with staff. The question immediately arises, therefore, as to how accurate their claim of general acceptance of the profiling process actually is.

          One of the main groups affected is academic staff, and they were not given an opportunity to express their opinion. Staff are particularly affected by the profiling process and suffer significantly under the bureaucratic nightmare established by the bane of Australian education, Mr Dawkins. Data collection and educational profiles are an extreme waste of time and resources. Staff are often subject to tedious bureaucratic data collection when time is desperately needed in other areas of their work. It is no wonder that the education sector in Australia is unable to attract and keep a lot of academic brilliance.

          Data collected is often refined to such an extent that comparisons between institutions are not possible. Changes in criteria often increase the time taken by staff to collect data. As this report states, some comments were received that more data was collected than was used. Questions were raised in this report regarding the quantum, manageability and usefulness of data collected through the profiling process.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Another criticism examined by the report is the legislative basis of the profiling process. The legislation governing the process does not indicate the purpose to which the profiles can be put or limit the content, and there is no opportunity for public scrutiny of the profiling arrangements. This leaves open the way for the process to become increasingly regulatory in character.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           The report dismisses these concerns as it considers that the process is open and subject to multiple levels of scrutiny. All these levels of scrutiny are from within. The only external scrutiny received is through the Parliament, and the decisions for negotiations and advice from HECs are tabled. This is not adequate.

          Clearly, the need for higher education institutions to comply with the profiling process in order to obtain funds, constantly in fear of failing to meet the Government's hidden agenda, is a major threat to institutional autonomy. How can universities operate with autonomy and determine their own academic agenda without undue influence, when this agenda is subjected to such a high level of scrutiny by government?

          This report concludes that the education profiling process is working well and that it is generally accepted by the institutions. I reject this proposition.

          It is very clear that three challenges face the car industry in the run-up to the year 2000. The first is the reduction of tariffs to 15 per cent by the year 2000. The increase in automation, which will improve productivity but which will have a detrimental impact on the number of jobs, is really a second major challenge that the industry must face, and one that must be recognised by the public and government when seeking to increase job prospects in the industry in the long term.

          Thirdly, a change in consumer demands will clearly impact on the kind of product that the industry will produce. The environmental concerns expressed by consumers through their purchasing power will, in the long term, affect the car industry in a very real way. That is a challenge that the car industry in Australia must face if it is going to retain a viable industry into the year 2000.

          Tariffs have been substantially reduced already from 57.5 per cent in 1984 to 35 per cent to date, and will be reduced to 15 per cent by the year 2000 under the Button car plan. The Government is using this strategy to force the car industry to make improvements in price, quality and efficiency. It has certainly been a very effective tool, if that has been its major goal. The reduction in tariffs in the eyes of many has resulted already in the closure of one car factory and the loss of many thousands of jobs with Nissan.

          I really impress upon the Government how poorly regarded within the industry the tariff policy is. One would not find one person in the car industry at the moment who welcomes and embraces the Government's car tariff policy, especially given the very tight economic circumstances surrounding the economy and the car industry as a whole. Many are really wondering whether it is this Government's intention to simply kill off the car industry altogether by its headlong rush into lower tariffs. Certainly the car industry has made every effort to meet that challenge, but it is a real struggle and, certainly in the current economic situation, it would welcome a 12-month pause in the tariff phase-down, which would help it to restructure in this time of economic stress.

          In our view, the key to a successful car industry is improved productivity, innovation and meeting the needs of customers. Interestingly enough, this report states several times that one means of improving productivity is to increase investment in automation and advanced manufacturing technologies. It must be remembered that automation will not result in more jobs. If anything, automation will result in fewer jobs as robotics increasingly take the place of those skilled workers who once performed those functions. The Government must be aware of that and make plans to take up those workers by way of training programs and so forth, so that they are not just left on the unemployment scrap heap.

          The report also states that the difference in productivity between Australian and overseas car companies is due to our low level of automation. I find it interesting that it is not due to restrictive work practices, as one would be led to believe by other senators in this chamber.

          A third challenge facing the industry is changing consumer demands. I find it interesting to note that there has been a marked increase in imported small cars over the last few years, which indicates that consumers are not looking for large six-cylinder vehicles but smaller cars with fuel efficiency. This will become more important for the industry over time as the impact of the Californian emissions regulations come into effect. They will have a ripple impact throughout the car industry around the world as vehicles will be produced that will have lower emissions and will be much more fuel efficient.

          It is vitally important for the Australian car industry that manufacturers and components manufacturers recognise that these developments will eventually impact on what happens here in this country. Long term plans must be made to ensure that the industry restructures.

       In the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) the other evening, at page 13 it was pointed out that, in the absence of new measures, revenues are likely to decline over the period to 1995-96. He said that if the fiscal position nearer to the time is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. These changes, referred to in the Budget statements, would allow for the 1995-96 deficit to be between one-half and one per cent of gross domestic product—in other words, about $2 billion to $4 billion.

        It is absolutely clear from all the evidence available that the Government will be forced to implement those tax changes, those tax increases, if it is to even get anywhere near meeting its so-called promise to cut personal income tax by 1994-95 and 1995-96, as it `promised' to do in the One Nation statement in February, a promise that it reiterated in the Budget Speech the other night. It is an ironic situation, is it not, that the Government is now virtually admitting in this Budget that it will have to increase taxes over the next few years in order to give the personal income tax cuts that it had promised.

        The big question that arises from that, and the question which I posed in the Senate today and which Dr Hewson and Mr Reith and my colleagues have been posing very strongly in the House of Representatives, is: just what will be the size of those tax increases and what new taxes will have to be introduced to meet the revenue needs that the Government says it will require?  It will require those and more unless it can do far more than it has demonstrated in the last nine years to keep its own house in order on the expenditure side. What new taxes will it introduce and why on earth will it not come clean with the Australian public and with this Parliament and give us those details?

Those proposals in the area of taxation are very wide ranging indeed.

They include the abolition of $20 billion of taxes that are now imposed on the cost of doing business in Australia, the cost of making goods and services in Australia, the cost of employing people in Australia—taxes like the wholesale sales tax, the most inefficient, archaic indirect tax system in the world. We will abolish that. We will also abolish the tax on jobs—payroll tax. It is absolutely ridiculous that a country such as ours, with the unemployment problems that we have facing us, should tax jobs, should tax employment, by having a tax on payrolls.

        When the Hawke Government came into office in 1983, fuel excise was 6c a litre; today it is 26c a litre. That money has not gone into building roads or anything to do with motorists or transport. It has gone towards feeding the insatiable demand, the insatiable diet, that this Government has for spending, spending, spending. That policy has cost Australia very dearly indeed. It has cost jobs, jobs and jobs. It has cost economic growth and it has cost investment. It has reduced savings in this nation to the lowest level in our history.

The transport system enters into every facet of production in Australia. It is mightily burdened by that excessive fuel excise and we will abolish it.

It is not going to tell people which taxes it is going to increase, other than naming two or three in the Budget which would have no hope on earth of providing the necessary revenue required to balance the books.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Notice Paper
        </emphasis>
        which was the subject of a question here in the Senate today—that it is not just to pay for the unfunded personal income tax cuts promised for 1994-95, but also to pay for the absolutely irresponsible profligate blow-out in government spending that has occurred over recent years, notably last year and even more notably and regrettably this year when there will be an increase in Commonwealth government spending of the order of $9 billion. In real terms the figure will be about $6 billion. That comes at a time when the private sector is struggling to find an economic environment in which it is able to save, invest, grow and create jobs. There has not been a more irresponsible Budget introduced into this Parliament since the Whitlam Budgets of the 1970s, and we all know what those Budgets did to the economy and this great nation of ours.

        Indeed, on some measures, this Budget is worse than any of the Whitlam Budgets. The deterioration in the Commonwealth's budgetary situation in the last two years has been unprecedented. It well exceeds the deterioration that occurred in the years of the Whitlam Government. It is only three years ago that the Budget was in surplus to the tune of $8 billion—thanks not to this Government but to cyclical events. I must say also that at that time there was some greater expenditure constraint than is evident or available to the Government, quite obviously, today. But we had an $8 billion surplus in the Budget in 1989-90. That surplus fell to less than $2 billion in 1990-91 and was totally reversed in 1991-92 to a deficit of $9.3 billion, despite the fact that only 12 months ago, when the 1991 Budget was introduced, the deficit for the year was forecast to be $4.7 billion. That deficit forecast had to be revised four times in the course of the year and the actual outcome was $9.3 billion which was a 100 per cent error on the original forecast.

        Currently we have a deficit which is published at $13.4 billion, but when we take account of the creative accounting involved in that, the figure is really closer to $20 billion. Indeed, on my figuring, the actual underlying Budget deficit this year will be $20.5 billion. I am not alone in making that forecast. The very respected economic commentator Alan Kohler says $21 billion, I think, and another very respected economic commentator, Max Walsh, puts the figure at around the same level. So I am not on my own in making that estimate of a $20,000m hole in the Government's finances this year.

        What does that do to the economy? It does a lot of very serious things. It means that the Government has to borrow that money; it has to go out into the marketplace and find the money to fill the hole—and that is what it is going to do. If any of the Government's rhetoric about a recovery in the economy being under way is to be believed, it follows automatically that that Government borrowing requirement will thwart and chop off at the ankles any recovery in the private sector that could occur, because the private sector will be out there in the marketplace having to compete for funds for investment, for job growth and for increased production. The private sector will be out there competing with an avaricious, greedy government that is unable to control its own spending proclivities.

        Inevitably that means either a potential major increase in interest rates, if the money is to be borrowed domestically, or, if the Government reverses its policy of recent years and goes overseas to find some of the funds required, pressure on our exchange rate and the balance of payments and an increase in the already horrendous debt that this nation owes to the rest of the world. Australia has a net debt to the rest of the world of about $150 billion. Our gross debt to the rest of the world is about $180 billion. That figure compares with only $30 billion or thereabouts when this Government came to office in 1983.

        The really soft underbelly of the Australian economy has been massively exposed and damaged by the actions and policies of this Government. That underbelly is, of course, as it has been for a long time, the external account—our balance of payments, our ability to compete in the world, to be able to afford to buy what we want to buy from the rest of the world by selling to the rest of the world. We are unable to do that. Taking everything into account—goods and services and also all of the invisible items like profit flows, interest payments on accumulated debt and so on—Australia is in hock to the rest of the world again this year by an estimated $15 billion on the Government's own figures. That is a worsening of more than $3 billion on the year just gone by. Indeed, that $15 billion is an optimistic estimate; the more likely figure is about $17 billion, but I will not argue about a billion dollars here or there. The overall fact of great concern is that Australia will be going into debt to the rest of the world again this year by a figure approaching $1 1/2 billion dollars—certainly well over a billion dollars—every month.

        That will all be compounded by the fact that, as the decade progresses, the Government will have to find more revenue to meet the hole in its Budget. That will come from new taxes. It cannot come from anywhere else unless there are absolutely savage increases in the level of existing tax. Where will those new taxes come from? What form will they take? One can only speculate on that. It depends on whether the Socialist Left faction of Senator Bolkus—I see him coming back into the chamber—holds sway. If there were to be another Labor government, you could be as sure as eggs that a fair chunk of it would come from that hoary old Labor notion of a wealth tax.

        If the Government is going to honour its so-called promises to provide personal income tax cuts in 1994-95 and 1995-96, there are two other sources of revenue to finance those cuts. One would have to be an increase in the taxes on business. This Government has taxed business blind over the last nine years. All the portents are that it would have to continue to do so in the next few years if it were re-elected. Of course, increased taxes on business, particularly on the cost of doing business—on the cost of producing goods and services—automatically means a tax on investment and a tax on jobs. How on earth can we expect to get job growth in this country if we continue to be saddled with a government that believes it can milk the cow of the private sector dry, and not expect it to suffer in terms of employment, profitability and investment as a result.

        The final new tax that would obviously be a near certainty if this Government were re-elected would be the introduction of what Paul Keating, as the most articulate exponent ever, I think, of such a tax, pushed in 1985 before he got rolled by the trade union movement—that is, the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax or, to use our parlance, a goods and services tax. Paul Keating knows, and the Government knows, that the only long term solution to getting an efficient tax system in this country, where the burden of taxes on business is reduced and the burden of tax on individuals is reduced, therefore restoring incentive, encouragement and reward to them, is to massively restructure the tax system. That has to involve adopting a tax of the nature of a goods and services tax, which virtually every other developed country in the world has and which more than 100 other developing countries have.

That table shows very clearly that government spending this financial year is expected to be 27 per cent of gross domestic product—27 per cent of Australia's national income if you like—compared with 28.8 per cent in the last year the Liberals were in government in this country.

The massive spending in this Budget of Whitlamesque proportions is being directed towards rectifying the political effects of inappropriate economic policies rather than the fundamental causes of our economic malaise. Instead of embracing a comprehensive program of major economic reform, as the coalition has done in Fightback, to address honestly Australia's serious problems, the Labor Party is applying a bandaid to the consequences of its policy failures—that is, unacceptable levels of unemployment.

But within the constraints of Labor Party politics, an arrogant and incompetent Paul Keating drove up interest rates to impossible levels. This `scorched earth' economics of the man the Labor Caucus subsequently rewarded drove thousands of small businesses to the wall, with horrific unemployment consequences. But now, rather than tackle the fundamental weaknesses, he attaches this bandaid of make-work schemes in a short term effort to improve the figures—schemes which have been found deficient on so many previous occasions.

        This credibility gap is vitally important. If the community cannot believe the Prime Minister, it logically follows that they will not have confidence in his policies.

It ended at $9.3 billion and now we are expected to find an extra $13.4 billion to put on the tab. In fact, it is at least $16.1 billion. The Government will sell a few assets and transfer some Reserve Bank profits in an effort to fund just a small proportion of this annual deficit. I think the sale of Qantas will reduce its Budget deficit for this year by about 8 per cent, and Qantas will be gone forever. Some commentators argue that without the Prime Minister's creative accounting, the real anticipated deficit is nearer or just over $20 billion.

He argued for such a restructuring of the tax system in 1985.

        Mr President, you will note from the document that the make-work schemes end in two years time. Job creation projects should have been focused on increasing the economy's productivity and encouraging business investment through changes in the tax system rather than electorally motivated symbolic gestures. One wonders how many people under these schemes will end up with skills which can be utilised in the work force in the longer term; or will it be a case of employed one day, permanently unemployed the next? There is a place for training schemes, but even then they can only provide assistance to a very small proportion of the unemployed.

        The essential problem is lack of demand from employers. Until such time as this issue is addressed, job creation schemes of the sort announced in the Budget can be only superficial bandaid measures and training schemes will have minimal effect in overcoming Australia's unemployment tragedy. It is this issue of lack of demand from employers which should have been principally addressed in this Budget. The Government should have addressed the burden of still uncompetitive infrastructure.

        Micro-economic reform has stalled under this Government. The waterfront, transport and communication industries are still not efficient. Elsewhere the results are similar. For example, while the power industry has now improved productivity, the massive debt of electricity utilities has caused power prices to remain high. Then there is the issue of the insidious on-costs which have risen significantly during this Government's period of office. The accord may have delivered some wage restraint at the expense of productivity, but businesses have been lumbered with the superannuation levies, training levies, fringe benefits tax, workers compensation changes, payroll tax and a raft of other imposts.

        Then there is the taxation system. Not only is Labor's taxation system biased against business, as I have outlined, but the total tax take is uncompetitively high and is further increased by this Budget. The reason it is uncompetitively high is that Paul Keating refuses to cut government expenditure because it might cost short term votes. Sadly, under the Keating economic regime, it is easier for businesses to retrench and relocate than it is to invest and remain in Australia.

        I do not doubt Labor's historical concern for the people of Australia, especially for the poor and disadvantaged. Indeed, it was Labor which instituted most of the great social reforms of the nine decades since Federation. Curtin, Chifley and Jack Lang were stars in the firmament of Australia's reform history. Universal suffrage, social security, sickness and hospital benefits and free education are rights and privileges that we owe to Labor.

For those Australians to whom its brand of moderate socialism once brought hope and opportunity, Labor has now led to the dole queues, to bankruptcy courts and foreign takeovers. Australians are bewildered, disillusioned, alienated and angry. The land of opportunity has eluded them, the welfare state has withdrawn, and now the god of economic rationalism has failed.

        Let us examine the economic fundamentals. The Budget projects a fall in business investment of 2 per cent. Investment is going into housing instead of into productive plant and machinery. Under the present deregulated banking system, this could lead simply to another property boom and another boom-bust cycle. The desperately low level of household savings will slide even further. Import penetration is rising in many sectors. Growth is estimated at only 3 per cent, but our current account deficit will increase by 25 per cent and our foreign debt will continue to grow.

The defence budget demonstrates graphically that Labor is unable to reorder its priorities to meet the challenges of the 1990s. The 1992 defence policy is essentially the same one put forward five years ago—a policy inspired by fear of the Soviet Union's naval and air base in Vietnam, and by the suspicion that the USSR and Libya were infiltrating the South Pacific.

        Today the Government released the new national drought policy and flagged the direction of the new rural adjustment scheme. The last major drought we had was in 1982-83. The breaking of the drought coincided with the election of Mr Hawke as the new Prime Minister. He was able to capitalise on this and form the basis of his Government's growth when agriculture was able to bounce back after the drought. Agriculture grew at the rate of 45 per cent, contributing to growth after that recession of 6 per cent. This was possible because, during the last drought, the National-Liberal Party Government stood by primary industry with policies that retained our breeding stock and other fundamentals so that rural Australia could grow and bloom again after the drought was broken. The Government spent $244m in those days on keeping the national herd and flock for the future, thus protecting Australia's nest egg and enabling the economy to be kick-started once the drought had ended. In today's values that would equate to $415m.

Today's national drought policy is long on rhetoric but short on what counts—money. In 1989, the Labor Government removed drought from the national disaster arrangement, which meant that the Federal Government ceased funding for drought from that time on.

The Government boasts that manufacturing exports have increased at a rate of 10 per cent this year to June last, but research shows that growth has been from a low base. Most of the export growth has been with elaborately transformed manufactures, and 60 per cent of these have received government assistance. Much export growth has been recession driven as many companies are forced to export to maintain factory viability. When the domestic market improves, these exports, sold at under cost, will reduce.

        This Budget has been totally irresponsible in the way that it has overspent to fund short term jobs. The deficit was to be reduced by 1995 under One Nation. The deficit is now promised to be reduced only as soon as possible. Sadly, this irresponsible Budget will have to be paid for, at great cost, by all Australians. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 per cent; the Medicare levy is to rise to 1.4 per cent; fringe benefits taxes are to be extended; the tobacco excise is to be increased by $5 a kilogram; higher interest rates are predicted. What sort of Budget is this?

        New taxes are inevitable. In fact, they are even predicted. The Government has foreshadowed increased taxes in 1995-96 if the deficit is not reduced to $5 billion or $6 billion. The Government has once again taken the wrong track. Through this Budget, the Government has deliberately not taken up opportunities to assist Australia to be competitive and to create real jobs and sustainable economic recovery. The vote buying potential of $1.2 billion for job creation schemes has been offered at the cost of neglecting to create real and sustainable jobs through the Government's encouragement of a climate for increased business investment and growth in our export earning industries.

It is the last Budget of a government that has squandered every opportunity Australia has had over the last 10 years. It no longer deserves the support of the Australian electorate.

        —Earlier this evening I was responding to a claim in Senator Short's motion that there had been a blow-out in the level of government spending in this Budget. I was referring to the historic record, which shows very clearly that that claim cannot be substantiated. In fact, the level of government spending this financial year in relation to our gross domestic product is 27.0 per cent. That is shown very clearly in table 3 on page 5.6 of Budget Paper No. 1. In 1982-83, the last year in which the Liberals were in power federally in this country, government spending was 28.8 per cent of gross domestic product. That is a much higher figure. Hardly can it be said, then, that government spending has blown out in this Budget.

        —Those people opposite sit there time and time again and throw at us policy questions and so forth. As soon as we get up to reply, they become very sensitive; they cannot stand the heat and they ought to get out of the kitchen. I refer—and I am going to really dish it out—to point (b) in Senator Short's motion where he refers to what he says are new taxes. Then he goes on to talk about bracket creep, which is also known as fiscal drag—the phenomenon of wage and salary earners being propelled into higher income tax brackets through the effect of inflation on prices and wages. Bracket creep is hardly a new tax. It is simply an aspect of an existing tax that is the phenomenon of people moving into higher personal income tax brackets as a result of inflationary pressures.

        I well remember the last Liberal Government which went to the people saying that it would act on bracket creep, it would act on fiscal drag. Mr Fraser went to the people and said that he would end taxation by stealth. That Government pledged itself to adjust all the income tax brackets for inflation. It actually pledged itself to every year increase the tax threshold for each bracket by the inflationary factor for that year. I think that lasted for about 1 1/2 years. After this very strong promise by the Fraser Government, the Liberal Treasurer at the time—I think it was Sir Phillip Lynch—then ditched it. He halved the factor; therefore saying that it was not important to adjust the tax brackets for inflation. Finally, we saw Mr Howard, the present spokesperson for industrial relations in the conservative Party, actually ditching the inflation adjustment completely—I think in the 1978 Budget.

        So let us not have Liberals coming into the Senate in 1992 lecturing to this Government about bracket creep and fiscal drag. The record shows them to be extremely wanting on this subject. The Liberals went to elections promising to adjust the tax scales for this phenomenon and they could not handle it. They got rid of the whole adjustment within about three or four financial years. They did it for a very clear reason. They did it for the reason that they believed there were more votes in it for them if they made discretionary income tax cuts every now and then. Instead of having tax cuts by adjustment of brackets every year, they thought there was more mileage in it for them to adjust the brackets just before an election and have very clear discretionary personal income tax cuts.

        The other thing I find totally nonsensical about this is that people in the conservative party are still going on about bracket creep when we have inflation in this country down to the rate of 2 per cent. Hardly anybody is getting pushed into higher personal income tax brackets in a situation where we have single digit inflation of almost the lowest possible magnitude. I can understand interest in adjusting income tax brackets for inflation when we had inflation running at 11 1/2 per cent, as it was under the Liberals when they were last in power. I can understand the imperative of talking about adjusting tax brackets in those situations for inflation. But the reality is, as I pointed out earlier, that inflation in this country is now in single digits. It is very low at 2 per cent per annum. One can hardly say that bracket creep is a major problem facing the Australian community when we have the inflation rate at such a low level and therefore very few people moving between tax brackets for illusory reasons—reasons of inflation rather than because their real incomes have increased.

        Senator Short claims in point (d) of his motion that the Federal Government is discarding the Budget's return to a surplus position in 1995-96. Point (d) of his motion is totally hypocritical when one looks at the record. The claim in point (d) is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black. Again, all we need to do to check these claims made by conservative politicians is look at the data appendices to the Budget. In Budget Paper No. 1 at page 5.6, table 3, we can find some delicious data going back into history which shows just how poor has been the performance of Liberal governments in this country on the question of Budget surpluses.

        Senator Short was lecturing us earlier tonight about not having a Budget surplus in this country. He was saying that this Government had discarded the effort to have a Budget surplus in 1995-96. As a front bench member of the conservative coalition in this Parliament, he was lecturing the Labor Government about not having a Budget surplus.

        Let us look at the record. Let us look at the data on page 5.6 of Budget Paper No. 1. There on the record we can see the outcome of all Commonwealth Budgets going back to 1953-54. There is data for 39 financial years. We can ask the question: how many Budget surpluses appear in that table, which goes back to 1953-54, the golden era of Menzies? Out of 39 years there were four years in which the Commonwealth Budget was in surplus. How many of those four years were years when the Liberals were in government?  None! Not one of those four years in which there was a Budget surplus saw a Liberal Government in power at the Federal level in Australia. In not one year were the Liberals able to bring in a Budget surplus. Yet they came in here earlier tonight lecturing the Labor Party about not having a Budget surplus three years into the future—in 1995-96. In the period after 1953-54, those people opposite could never deliver a positive balance, a positive outcome in the Federal Government in Australia. In that 39-year period there were 27 years of Liberal Government and in not one of those years was there a Federal Budget surplus. Meanwhile, Labor delivered four consecutive years of Budget surplus in this Government in the 1980s. So let us not have any more lecturing by honourable senators opposite, by conservative members of the Federal Parliament, about Budget surpluses, about Labor not having a Budget surplus three years into the future, in 1995-96.

        Senator Short also made the rather extravagant claim that this was a spend now, pay later `Bankcard' Budget—another case of the pot calling the kettle black. I have just pointed out that in a period of 27 years of Liberal Government there was not one Budget surplus at the Federal level in Australia. In every financial year of those 27 years, the Liberal Treasurer of the day spent more than was received in revenue by that Government. There was no Bankcard then; I do not think Bankcard existed in the golden age of Menzies. There was what we used to call hire-purchase. Australia paid very dearly for those years of Liberal governments. Basically, we paid on the drip-feed basis, not on the Bankcard basis. We paid on the hire-purchase system. As a result, public debt mounted up at the Federal level as the Liberal Party in government for 27 years in two periods delivered Budget deficit after Budget deficit after Budget deficit. Opposition senators came in here today and lectured us on not having a Budget surplus in 1995-96.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I would also like to look at Senator Short's claim in his motion that we are going to introduce a raft of new taxes. Let us look at the history of taxation at the Federal level in this country. It is very revealing. In Budget Paper No. 1, for example, on page 4.59, for those Liberals who are present who wish to check it, Federal Budget taxation revenue as a percentage of Australia's gross domestic product, as a broad percentage of our national income, is expected to be 22.2 per cent this financial year. In the last year of the Liberal Government in this country, in 1982-83, the percentage of tax to our gross domestic product was not 22.2 per cent and it was not 23.2 per cent; it was in fact 24 per cent. So, while we have Senator Short lecturing us about so-called new taxes, the record shows that the percentage of our gross domestic product accounted for by taxation now is 1.8 percentage points lower than at the time the last Liberal Government was in office at the Federal level in this country.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        We can see from those very clear figures that the share of our gross domestic product taken by government revenue is well below the share taken under the last Liberal Government. In fact, if we look at the concept the other way around, we can say that a great deal more revenue would have to be collected simply to reach that level obtained by the Liberals in 1982-83. In other words, conceptually, there is much room for extra revenue to be collected at the Federal level before this Government would see the proportion of gross domestic product taken by taxation rise to the level achieved by the Liberals in government in the early 1980s. Of course, we do not intend to take taxation up to that 24 per cent share of gross domestic product that the last Liberal Government had.

        These are some of the points that needed to be answered tonight. I think it is very clear that we have some very hypocritical points being made in this debate by members of the conservative parties who claim that somehow Australia is letting down the side by bringing in the Budget that it did on Tuesday night. Certainly, the objective facts show very clearly that this particular Budget is well in line with the historical trends in this country. It is a Budget where government spending has not blown out, as claimed by Senator Short; where government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product is lower now than it was at the time the last Liberal Government was in power; and certainly where government taxation revenue as a proportion of gross domestic product is lower than it was when the last Liberal Government was in power at the Federal level.

        Paraphrasing his interesting address, he clearly indicated that the Budget was a political document that has only short term objectives and that it certainly did not look beyond the next election, although I must say that he did indicate that he thought the assumptions underlying it were much more credible than, say, those in One Nation. Many of the comments made in Budget Statement No. 2 were quite gloomy and, to that extent, quite reasonable. He did, of course, raise other matters such as the problems involving the Reserve Bank perhaps getting itself locked into set interest rate positions. But, in general, he confirmed the view I had that this Budget is a very short term Budget and is a very politically oriented, next election Budget.

        If it is a next election Budget, what are the messages in it about when the next election will be? There is no doubt that if the basic messages of gloom are there, and are to be taken seriously, there is something to be said for Mr Keating perhaps taking the risk of having an election immediately. There is nothing in this Budget which shows that by next May there will be any basic improvement in the situation. Not even the multi-millions of dollars being spent buying short term jobs will resolve the problem. So we have to decide whether Mr Dawkins is the Artful Dodger, as Paddy McGuinness said, or whether Mr Keating is Mr Micawber. Mr Micawber-Keating is waiting in hope that something will turn up by next May to help his election prospects. Apparently, according to Paddy McGuinness, the Artful Dodger has come up with a lot of politically expedient stuff in the Budget which, of course, does nothing for this economy and really does nothing to create any lasting jobs.

        When we look at these two Dickens characters, I suppose we have every right to say, `What in the dickens is really happening?'. I fear that looking at this Budget for any kind of indication of a real sense of recovery or real prospects of improvement is not a very fruitful exercise. It was dramatic tonight to see the difference between the manner in which the Budget was brought down earlier this week by Mr Dawkins with its feeling of gloom, disaster and no real sense of any kind of progress towards resolving Australia's major problems, and the response by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) which gave a feeling of real excitement, direction, enthusiasm and hope for Australia.

        What is there in this Budget to make this Government's election prospects look any better? A bit of fiddling the books, I suppose; a bit of buying a few jobs; but, really, there is nothing there that does anything to improve the economy.

       The Budget does nothing for the private sector either by way of taxation concessions or rate reductions or by providing meaningful incentives such as for exporters. A great deal could have been done to provide stimulus to the private sector by such measures thereby enabling real incentive, real growth and real jobs that would last beyond the term of the next Government. In summary, the Budget was as we expected but ignores the need to stimulate real economic recovery.

       The Government has failed to provide any significant stimulus to business investment and it can be expected that there will be no significant growth in employment in the private sector.

Given the uncertain position of both the Japanese and US economies, this may be high risk assumption.

Business investment is down 2 per cent, but do not worry, the public sector is going to push ahead once again at the expense of the private sector.

        We have this ludicrous situation where GDP is going up by only 3 per cent, which is a tawdry level of recovery in view of the false expectations created in the February statement. Of course, Mr Hawke has pointed to those false expectations which have destroyed whatever credibility was left in the man who created this recession—the man who, in fact, engineered this recession—Mr Keating, who has proudly said that he engineered it.

      <para>
       There is a whole range of reasons why it is going to take considerable time to reduce unemployment to acceptable levels. One of the main reasons is that there is such a massive level of hidden unemployed and underemployed that if there is any indication of economic upturn, there will be more of these people, if you like, coming out of the woodwork, and being available for work.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        It is not just an assertion that these people are there. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has done a survey on both hidden unemployment and underemployment. The latest hidden unemployment figure shows something like 800,000 Australians prepared to work within four weeks—wanting to work, but not even listing themselves as available for work under the Australian Bureau of Statistics normal unemployment figures.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">

        This is for a variety of reasons, but mostly because there was no point in putting their names down because they did not think there were any jobs, or because they had accepted other situations such as Austudy to get themselves out of dole queues. There are 800,000 people who would rather have a job. The recent survey done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on underemployment showed that there was something like 600,000 people working part time who wanted to work longer hours and, in particular, wanted to work full time. So here we have something like 2 1/4 million Australians either unemployed officially; in the hidden unemployed, as revealed by the statistician; or in the underemployed.

        That is why we will have a massive overhang of unemployment that this Government will not be able to get rid of, firstly, because it does not have the capacity to do so, and secondly, because it does not have the money to throw at these schemes. All that the Government has done with its massive unemployment programs, using money that it does not have in the present Budget, is prevent unemployment from rising even further. That is all it is doing. It is not cutting unemployment; it is not getting jobs for the people who are unemployed now; it is simply stopping that number getting worse.

        This is evident from the figures in this Budget. The number of unemployed in the 1992-93 year is listed as being 10.5 per cent, as against the average of 10.4 per cent last financial year. This year, unemployment will be a fraction higher than it was last year. The only reason it is not an awful lot higher than that, is that the Government is throwing money into these unemployment schemes which simply provide temporary jobs at the expense of taxpayers or borrowers.

Unemployment is much deeper and more sustained in the current recession; and when the drought factor is removed from the 1982-83 recession, this is a far worse recession. As the Budget Papers say:

        It also says, and I repeat what I said earlier, that it will be the public sector—the Government—that will continue to support activity in 1992-93 with a pick-up of spending through the year.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While Australians, the bulk of whom are employed by the private sector, see no hope of major investment or major job increases in the private sector, we see it will be the Government that will be providing the stimulus and support to activity in 1992-93 with a pick-up of spending through the year.

       So what is happening with one of the key indicators? One of the key things that dominate our economy is the current account balance and it is going to worsen to about $15 billion or 3 3/4 per cent of GDP. I said that Statement No. 2 indicates the real severity of the problem. It certainly indicates that the longer this Government waits before it has its election, the worse off, basically, Australia will be. Page 2.74 of the Budget Papers states:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       During 1992-93, employment growth will be supported by declining real unit labour costs. This will reflect continued restrained wages growth and a forecast increase in productivity.

       But the problem here is that unless we get greater investment in plant and equipment—and remember, it is going to be minus 2—we are not going to get nearly enough increased productivity to lift Australia out of the mire.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Another matter of some concern in the Budget Papers is a hint of higher interest rates. The Budget Papers state:
       </tab>

       A significantly lower exchange rate than assumed would lead to upward pressures on inflation.

       However, the still moderate levels of expected domestic demand could dampen the flow-through of higher import prices to inflation.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the policy objective is to make certain that we do not get a much lower exchange rate, I wonder what the risks are of higher interest rates in order to keep the Aussie dollar up? We have already seen massive Reserve Bank buying of the Aussie dollar to hold it up. It seems that if this Government is committed to its stated policy objectives and to the forecasts that are in this document, it may well be that even higher real interest rates—and we should remember that interest rates are already very high in real terms in Australia, as the Reserve Bank annual report tabled today pointed out—will be needed to protect the Australian dollar in the dismal situation that we are now facing.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Of course, we are now facing another dismal situation, and that is the admission by the Treasurer that in order to finance the tax cuts that he is determined to have, he is going to have to increase taxes. We have already seen some increased taxes in this Budget. For example, another $120m or so is to be raised by taxing the fringe benefit derived by people parking in city parking stations. This is probably the only bit of investment stimulus that the Government is providing. It is giving an exciting new opportunity to business by, in effect, penalising people for parking in the city. It may well be creating an opportunity for businesses to build parking stations near suburban railway stations. This will mean that they will not be subject to this tax. I cannot see any other stimulus to business in this Budget. This indirect stimulus may be the only one.

        It is important to establish what taxes will be raised to pay for Mr Dawkins's tax cuts. We have heard in debates on the Fightback package that Mr Keating was a great fan of the GST. Honourable senators will remember that back in 1985 he got rolled by the former Prime Minister. Mr Keating, a former fan of this kind of tax, has repeatedly said in recent times that he attacks the tax because there is no longer any need for it; that there was a need in 1985 but there is not now because he has broadened the tax base. That is the line—the totally disreputable and nonsensical line—that Paul Keating, the Prime Minister, has spread around.

        There is no doubt that Mr Keating has increased the tax base. He imposed a tax on ice cream, flavoured milk, muesli bars and on orange and other fruit juices. Of course, they do not count as food in the opinion of a man who says that he would never introduce a consumption tax on food. This line is echoed, of course, by the clones on the Government front bench in the Senate. So he did broaden the tax base to a  degree—he  introduced  a

        Let us look at the facts. In 1985, when Mr Keating was claiming that there was a need for a GST, the share of total taxation revenue made up of income tax was 40.4 per cent. It is now up to 42.9 per cent. So he certainly has failed to broaden the tax base. He has imposed a greater tax burden on PAYE taxpayers since then. The burden of tax on ordinary working Australians who pay PAYE tax has gone up from 40.2 to 42.9 per cent since the time Mr Keating wanted to have more indirect taxes. Something like 60.4 per cent of all tax revenues in 1985-86 came from income taxes. The figure is now up to 68.6 per cent. I seek leave to incorporate in

        —The other side of this equation is quite interesting. The table shows that all of the other taxes, such as sales tax, which represented 30.4 per cent of taxation revenue in 1985-86 when Mr Keating wanted to increase them, have now fallen to 25.2 per cent of collections. It is clearly evident that the share of tax revenue made up of the sorts of taxes that Mr Keating wanted in 1985 has fallen dramatically under this Government. If these are the taxes that Mr Keating liked in 1985, they provide him with enormous scope to introduce greater taxes along those lines now that he is the boss. His then boss stopped him doing it at a time when those taxes totalled only 30.4 per cent of total taxation revenue. Now, they are only 25 per cent. So it is clear that this is a great area for Mr Keating to jump into.

        After all, he cannot do much more with income tax which already represents 68.6 per cent of total collections. If he is after some extra taxes, the only place to which he can turn is the other taxes area—things like petrol tax and sales tax. I might just mention that they are the taxes that we are going to remove. They are the taxes, particularly on business, that we are going to wipe right out. They are the hidden taxes that people do not realise exist. People do not know that they are imposed on orange juice, flavoured milk and even toilet paper, soap and detergent. All of these hidden consumption taxes will be removed and replaced by a fair and equitable goods and services tax which will pay for a reduction in income tax. That is the whole point of it.

        So we have a situation in which the tax bill of pay as you earn workers, who have to foot the greatest single sector of tax, has gone up since Mr Keating wanted to have a GST back in 1985-86 from 40.2 per cent to 42.9 per cent of the total bill. The ordinary Australian taxpayer is being slugged more and more and has to pay a bigger and bigger proportion of the tax burden of this nation under this Government.

We need to do this so that we can reduce Australia's costs, so that we can provide incentives for Australian producers and exporters, so that we can compete again, and so that we can create new jobs. There needs to be a fair and rational consumption tax system in Australia instead of the present unfair and totally dishonest tax system which allows this Government to pretend that it does not tax consumption while it raises $10 billion a year in tax through sales tax alone as well as another $7 billion out of the petrol tax.

Instead of reducing the price of petrol to business users by 26c a litre—and transport costs are one of the major elements of Australian costs, which are so uncompetitive compared with other nations around the world, particularly those nations selling us goods—we should recognise the benefits that come from reducing petrol tax, and see how we can create an environment in which the private sector can employ more people and how there can be more jobs.

Where is the evidence to show that what the Government says will happen, will happen if this is pursued? It is to be admitted that we are in hard times. It would be silly not to admit that. It is quite true. It is also true that there has been a tremendous change in the industrial, financial, social and cultural life of this nation over the last 10 years. It has to be said that no matter what party comes into power in Australia in future years, it will be inheriting and continuing the work that has been done by this Government over the last 10 years.

I suppose a 150 per cent allowance, in terms of a deduction under the Income Tax Act, for expenditure on research and development, does not count in the eyes of those opposite as doing something for business. That is one of the problems. They see business as simply an economic unit without any regard for the human dimensions of life. If business can be given an extra quid, that will do something for it.

        I will go through the Budget strategy. In this Budget the Government has used a fiscal approach. It has supplemented, as I said before, a sluggish private sector demand and initiated a series of employment related programs in order to remove the burden of unemployment on Australian families. As I understand the criticism from the other side, the Government should not have sought to remove the burden of unemployment on Australian families because the way it did it was not necessarily through the private sector. Since it was not through the private sector, the criticism is that in some way the jobs are tainted and should not be allowed.

        There are a number of fundamental reasons why the `shop until you drop' Treasurer had to make that comment in the Budget, and I wish to briefly touch on them. First of all, there has been a decline in our estimated deficits over the last three years. It is worth looking at them and reminding ourselves of them. The Government has estimated that this year we will have a deficit of somewhere between $13 billion and $14 billion. If we take into account asset sales, it is more like $16 billion. If we take into account other aspects and the inconsistency of the forecasting over the last 10 years, we could conclude that it could well be closer to $20 billion. I would certainly be prepared to lay a lazy dollar against the fact that it could well be closer to $20 billion than $14 billion.

        Looking at these particular figures, at what has occurred in the last two years and the projections for this year, it was predicted in 1991 that there would be a surplus of $8.1 billion; in fact, it came in at $1.9 billion, which meant that $6.2 billion was overspent by this current Government. For the last year, a negative balance of $4.6 billion or $4.7 billion was predicted; it came in at $9.3 billion. We are now looking at a situation where, according to the Government's figures, we are faced with a negative balance of between $13 billion and $14 billion as well as, as I have outlined, the effects of asset sales and other aspects. So we have seen an enormous turnaround.

        Senator Cooney mentioned that 3.3 per cent was not enough growth. I also believe that 3.3 per cent is not enough growth, but it is a lot more realistic than the figure of 4.75 per cent that was put before us in the One Nation statement last February. But it is not enough growth to avoid increases in taxation or, alternatively, cuts in government expenditure. They are the two options the Government has to balance its Budget: it either increases its revenue base or decreases its expenditure. At 3.3 per cent the growth will not be sufficient to raise enough taxes to pay for this deficit into the future and the promised tax cuts.

It recognises very clearly that income tax cuts and tax credits in relation to health cover and other measures primarily go to those on lower incomes. It will give them back their dignity.

        Looking at Senator Short's motion and the options before the Government, having regard to the way it has gone about things over recent years with its Bankcard mentality, the Government will have no option if it is to deliver those income tax cuts but to introduce some form of consumption tax. I believe it would be totally appropriate and correct, if the Government were honest about its intentions, for it to show commitment by putting before the Australian public a long term program to address the problems we have.

        Nobody can deny that we do have serious problems with our infrastructure and debt, whether it be on our current account or on our deficit. As Senator Boswell outlined tonight, we have enormous debt problems in the farm sector—some $105,000 net debt per farm in Australia. In some States, including my own State of Western Australia, it is almost double that. Yet those farmers, those individuals, go on producing an enormous amount year after year. If they are to be allowed to recover from that particular position to become effective employers again, we must take away those existing business taxes. Senator Short's motion:

       I challenge the Government to spell out quite clearly its intentions for the next 12 months: its capital works program and how that has to be started by December this year and end in December 1993. It needs to spell out its program and what it will do over the next three, four, five and six years in a much more succinct and fair manner. It owes that to the Australian public.

        While I am on that subject, the Government still has the opportunity to correct the injustices it has foisted upon many in the Australian community with this capital works program. As I have said before, I am not saying that there should not be some fiscal stimulus. I am saying that, if there is, it should be applied fair and equitably. This Budget begs the question: why does the City of Wanneroo get $7m—sorry, the City of Stirling get $7m and the City of Wanneroo, right alongside of it, get nothing?

If some of that fiscal stimulus had been directed towards the private sector, we could have seen some long term jobs put in place for these people.

In that rebuttal I undertook to provide further details on two things: firstly, a list of expenditures for travel and accommodation for industry, government and union officials and union bodies involved in developing the Government's construction industry reform strategy through the industrial relations working party—these expenditures were met under my Department's workplace reform program; and, secondly, details of any relevant expenditures under the Government's funding arrangements for the Western Australian Business Advisory Group, known as WABAG, and the Western Australian Trade Union Advisory Group, known by the awkward acronym of WATUAG.

An initial amount of $19272.00 based on anticipated expenditure (see footnote(1)) was approved by me in February 1991 under the Workplace Reform Program for activities relating to the Industrial Relations Working Party. A further amount of $20000.00 was approved by me in November 1991. Of the initial $19272.00, an amount of $15285.06(2) was spent in 1990/91. The remainder was reallocated before the end of that financial year to other projects under the Workplace Reform Program. Of the further allocation of $20000.00, $6131.00(2) was spent by end-May 1992. This left $13869.00 which was reallocated by end-May to other projects under the Workplace Reform Program.

The school was not designated as a specialised school in performing arts, sports development, science or maths, so some of the staff decided that the school would have a special focus on the environment. When some students attended the Pathways to the Future Conference in 1989, they came back with the idea of Pathways Now as one way in which the school could live out its environment specialisation.

         This year's conference was attended by eighty-two student delegates from 22 schools attended. After meeting in nine panel discussions in which they questioned adults about vital environmental issues, they went on excursions to see energy and regeneration projects and to explore ways to connect with each other and with the environment. They then developed 55 project proposals to implement in their schools on return and for circulation to give others ideas. These projects will be submitted to the Ministry of Education to stimulate ideas throughout WA. Through three mini-parliament sessions the delegates discussed the messages they would send to adult decision-makers. Their 26 recommendations follow.

I am pleased that the students have not written us off, for they still believe that the structures by which our society is governed have a place. But—and this is my second response—as parliamentarians we should all take this to heart. It is not only government that needs to listen to the people; it is all sides of this chamber and of the other place. The young people who bring this recommendation will soon be of voting age. If at that stage in their lives they believe that the voice of the people of Australia is not heard within these corridors and chambers, our democracy will be in grave danger.

         Recommendation 26 calls for conferences involving young adults and adults, particularly adults in power. They are very tactful not to say `older adults'. It is a call for participatory democracy and for turning upside down the present political debate. The recommendation also contains these words:

        At a time when youth unemployment is taxing minds all over the country, at a time of summits about the issue and at a time of Budget, this call is all the more pertinent. It demonstrates that there is a reservoir of creativity among our young people and that they have the ideas and the will to participate in our society if we have the courage to listen.

         Lastly, I draw attention to recommendation 4, which calls for a reduction of at least 10 per cent in Australia's defence budget, with the money being redirected into environmental projects—for example, reafforestation. Clearly, these students have recognised that we, the older generation, are stealing from them the planet they love and that we are killing it and the people of the planet. They are asking that we leave it in a habitable condition for them and for their children. It is a request we cannot ignore; nor can we push it away and declare it an idealistic fantasy. We are determining the shape of their future, not ours.

These students have looked at a range of issues over which they could have become very downhearted. But they have applied themselves to see that there is hope and work to be done. I pray that we will not stand in their way.

        Wayne Goss: No, no, Mr Speaker I am going to have to be very careful about this, I am going to have to be very careful because I have to defend the Government but at the same time I want to avoid the sort of impropriety which we have just seen from the member for Landsborough, by raising a matter which she knows is before the courts.

        Now, now, Mr Speaker, and what happened was and I haven't had a chance to check this yet, but I will check it and to the best of my recollection, sometime in 1990, I think it was one or two days after the Minister for Police had gone overseas, when the Minister for Police in 1990, had left the State and gone overseas I received a request from the Police Commissioner if he could see me in the Minister's absence and he said it was confidential and he needed to see me personally, I didn't know what it was about.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        When he came to see me I was very disappointed, I have not revealed this before because . . . as we all know, as we all know, the common wisdom and the media run campaign is very much one of suggesting that there has been a smear campaign conducted by the former Police Minister, against the Commissioner over the course of the last year.

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        But well prior to that in fact back in mid 1990 I was very sorry to say that the Police Commissioner came behind the Minister's back to se me, no, no to hand to me . . . the Minister was overseas and as soon as he went away the Commissioner came to see me to show to me a transcript indicating a certain individual, had discussed in a phone conversation with another individual, not the then Minister at all, the making of a donation to that member's election campaign. A member of the Labor Party for that member's campaign.

        Mr Speaker, what happened then was that I determined if a member of parliament, particularly a Minister, particularly a Minister had received such a substantial donation, then there were certain bench marks of propriety that that Minister would have to had measured up to, if he was to remain in my Cabinet . . . You mentioned pecuniary interests, someone did, that's one, that I would expect such a donation to be declared, another would be that I would expect, particularly if the payment was in cash as was suggested in the transcript, that, that instead of what happened in the past where it was put into somebody's pocket, that the second test would be, that it be fully documented and accounted for in the normal accounting records of the electorate organisation of that member.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        I made inquiries and I found, I was able to confirm that in fact, there had been a declaration of the donation by the member in his declaration of pecuniary interests, that furthermore the matter had not been placed in the members own funds, but had simply been passed on to the Electoral Executive Committee in the normal way that all donations are passed on, in various political organisations and in the Labor Party, and it was fully receipted and accounted for in the normal way.

         The questions were asked by the Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Mrs Joan Sheldon, to Premier Goss. Premier Goss freely answered two questions from Mrs Sheldon that were very important in the public interest about the planned downfall of Police Commissioner Noel Newnham. At no time did Mrs Sheldon raise in her questions that these issues were before the court. The facts were that it was the Premier who chose to identify that these matters were before the courts. Despite that knowledge, he went on to answer the questions primarily to defend the former Police Minister, Mr Mackenroth.

        There has been much ill-informed debate about this issue. There has been a range of arguments from some quarters that Mrs Sheldon had no right to raise this issue and that it should have been let lie. However, an examination of the transcript of the completed Coco trial showed why the Police Commissioner had reason to be worried about his new police Minister when he went to see the Premier in February 1990.

        The Crown says it shows a willingness on the part of those two accused, who have handed over a sum of $5000 in cash, indeed a preference as far as Coco is concerned, to have that money retained as a bribe.

       <para>
        While I am aware that the Crown did not offer any evidence that Mr Mackenroth had knowingly accepted a bribe, it was clear that the former Police Minister was prepared to support the former Queensland Supreme Court judge, Angelo Vasta. In Parliament on 7 January 1989, the honourable member for Chatsworth, Mr Mackenroth, made a lengthy defence of Mr Vasta, when the then judge was ordered to the Bar of the House to give reasons why he should not have been removed from the Supreme Court bench.

         In light of these circumstances Mr Newnham, the Police Commissioner, had been very concerned when he was handed a transcript of the Federal Police intercept of a conversation between the member for Chatsworth and Mr Coco. Even if Mr Mackenroth had not known that this $5,000 payment or donation or whatever they like to call it was meant as a bribe, it was an act of gross political stupidity by someone who was aspiring to become the Police Minister in Queensland in a few months.

         So, in my view, and I believe in the view of most Queenslanders, Mr Newnham was entirely justified in seeking a meeting with the Premier, Mr Goss, in February 1990 to discuss the transcript. He had a Police Minister who was clearly involved in a Federal Police investigation and may have been involved in a criminal trial. Mr Mackenroth was then the Police Minister who had the daunting task of introducing a raft of Fitzgerald reforms to clean up a police force and take on significant corrupt elements who were still in the Service. The fact that Mr Mackenroth was caught up in this investigation laid him open to serious compromise. If this transcript had fallen into the hands of corrupt elements of the Police Service, then the whole carriage of the Fitzgerald reforms would have been threatened. In Premier Goss's answer to a question by Mrs Sheldon on 8 May, the Premier said:

(and) the making of a donation to that member's election campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        Premier Goss made it clear in that answer that somehow he regarded it as improper for the Police Commissioner to see him about a matter of grave concern about his Police Minister. But what did the Premier suggest the Police Commissioner do with this material that he had come into possession of? Shred it? I expect this would probably be standard practice on these types of issues—destroy the evidence. Clearly it was from this point that this Labor Government decided that Commissioner Newnham was a loose cannon on the deck and that he had to go.

         The first public indication of this was when the details of an incident involving the Tasmanian driving licence of CJC Chairman, Sir Max Bingham, was leaked to the press. Then we saw the issue culminate in the ultimate display of sour grapes from the disgraced former Police Minister Mr Mackenroth, who made a number of extraordinary allegations against Mr Newnham, none of which could be proved. But, of course, Mr Mackenroth worked on the notion that if you throw enough mud, some of it will stick. For months Mr Newnham found himself in limbo, fighting for both his career and his reputation.

         The Premier brought special legislation to the State Parliament, supposedly to help Mr Newnham, but this was a public relations gesture. When the Police Commissioner was cleared by the Supreme Court, the Premier and his mates once again set about the task of seeking to destroy Mr Newnham and force him out of the job. What is most disturbing is that even details from the pecuniary interest files of Police Commissioner Newnham have been leaked to the press. In the

         Crime in Queensland is increasing by a general rate of about 25 per cent and, based on assaults per head of population, Queensland is, regrettably, the most dangerous place in Australia to live. What has happened to the war against corruption in the Police Service? The Government should ponder why police officers who have been investigated in the past or named at the Fitzgerald inquiry are openly cheering on the State Government's vendetta against Commissioner Noel Newnham. The public in Queensland is also wondering why the Government's thought police are working overtime to clean up the image of disgraced former Police Minister Mr Mackenroth while at the same time undermining the reputation of Police Commissioner Noel Newnham.

         —I rise tonight to bring to the notice of the Senate the plight of some investors who are in a most difficult situation. I consider them to be the victims of the unregulated investment system in this country. Their plight has been brought to my attention by the Australian Investors Association which has argued for years that our current laissez-faire approach to investment and investment promotion and advice imposes heavy costs on the unwary investor. Again, we see the effects of the `greed is good' decade of the 1980s bearing down on the ignorant and the vulnerable. In particular, the question of the remuneration of advisers is a key issue in these cases.

         Honourable senators will be aware that the same question is currently in the public debate in the area of superannuation where, in some cases, outrageous undisclosed commissions were paid to advisers—at a level well above a reasonable fee commensurate with the amount of services actually provided. The Australian Investors Association has recently received a number of complaints about financial distress being suffered by a number of investors in relation to negative gearing investment schemes that were heavily promoted by the Advance and Challenge banks. The experience of three parties in particular has been as follows.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The first party is that of the so-called independent advisers who, in most cases, derive their income primarily from commissions and are in fact sellers of investment products who strongly recommend those investments that pay a high commission and denigrate other investments that would often be more suitable for investors. In the negative gearing schemes they earned commissions of up to 24 per cent of the investors' capital. For an investor with capital of $30,000 they would earn $7,200 for, at most, a few hours work, often done by people completely without qualifications in  accounting, finance or an allied field. By contrast, if they had recommended low risk investments they would earn commissions of about $300 and on medium risk investments they would earn $1,200 to $1,800. The second case is that of the banks, which derive large income from two sources: firstly, interest on loans which they probably would not have otherwise earned; and, secondly, entry fees and management fees from the property trusts managed by their subsidiary into which the investment was made.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third case is that of the hapless investors who suffered losses of up to 200 per cent of their capital. They now face margin calls to pay cash to the banks or to provide acceptable securities. In the event of their not being able to meet the margin calls, the whole of the debt which was scheduled for repayment two years or so ahead can become immediately due. The final result is that they could lose the investment—namely, the property trust units—and still owe to the bank an amount that may be as large as their original capital. That would mean that they would not have the option of continuing to hold the units in the hope that in time there might be a recovery in value.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If the investors had been made aware of the full extent of the risk they would face, the fact that they could lose more than 100 per cent of their capital and that the gearing multiplied the transaction costs of about 10 per cent to a figure of 40 per cent of their capital—so that an increase of less than 40 per cent in capital would mean a loss to the investor—the investors would have no cause for complaint. But they were not informed of those facts. The promotional material of the banks and their subsidiaries and the comments of the advisers made little, if any, reference to such risks.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          False statements were made to the effect that the expertise of the property trust managers and the ownership of prime, well located tenants would ensure that the properties would hold their values. But past experience has shown that prime, well located properties were not immune to capital decline of 40 per cent or more in market slumps that occur from time to time.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Banks have an obligation under the common law to ensure that people executing documents are aware of the nature of their obligations. As a result of court decisions, some banks, for example, will not allow people to sign a guarantee unless they have previously sought independent advice and can produce a letter from a solicitor confirming that this has been done.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Obviously, the borrowers for negative gearing investments should have been made aware of the facts set out above, including the possible loss of over 100 per cent of capital and the fact that gearing could increase costs to 40 per cent of the capital. What makes the situation more significant is that some of the negative gearing investments were made in 1990 after the property slump had started, and after a decision of the NCSC meant that no unit holder in an unlisted property trust had an assured and unrestrained right to redeem units. The fact that clients may have been advised by a so-called independent adviser does not meet the obligation of the banks, because the very strong financial incentive for advisers to recommend negative gearing meant that their advice was not independent.

         One matter which these circumstances has brought to light is that the powers and jurisdiction of the banking ombudsman are inadequate. The ombudsman has no authority to act on claims against the subsidiaries of banks. I am not aware of whether this delineation is a deliberate one, but it does mean that a significant section of the financial system, which is controlled by the banks, is not covered by the excellent ombudsman arrangements.

         —I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a program called SURF SAFE, which was previewed at a special showing last night, Wednesday, 19 August. Many of us are aware of the recent tragedy at Kiama on 11 July where seven people drowned. The importance of a program such as SURF SAFE has been demonstrated by this incident and a number of others which are becoming commonplace on the coastline of Australia. Such accidents are preventable, but we cannot expect people to use commonsense and a cautious approach to our beaches if there is not sufficient prior knowledge and education relating to the dangers of the ocean.

         Mr Jim Bradley, the honorary national surf survival certificate coordinator for the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia, designed SURF SAFE. SURF SAFE is an audiovisual program aimed at every 10-year-old Australian schoolchild. It must be noted that a major feature of rescues is that victims do not live adjacent to the coastline. Instead, they come from areas some distance away—in most cases, in excess of 50 kilometres. Another startling statistic is that 42 per cent of rescue victims are children under the age of 16. These figures have been carefully analysed and SURF SAFE has been designed to cover the bulk of potential victims.

         SURF SAFE will consist of a 23-minute video, achievement certificates and a number of theory exercises. The program is designed to cover a multitude of areas including types of waves, surf awareness, exploring rock shelves, coastal development, survival rules, the importance of obeying flags and alarms, assisting others and what to do in basic accident situations. SURF SAFE, it is hoped, will result in a dramatic decline in the number of rescues needed and the number of accidents that unnecessarily occur.

         The problem lies not only in Kiama but all over Australia. It is impossible to rope or fence off the entire Australian coastline. To prevent accidents, we must increase and improve education relating to surf safety and awareness. We cannot afford such tragedies as that which happened at Kiama. The Surf Life Saving Association of Australia does its best to supervise and rescue thousands of people every summer. However, better education needs to be provided to Australians if we are to change the course of disaster along our coastline. Surfing and swimming are major developing areas in our culture, particularly among our young. SURF SAFE is a vital program, but it does rely on the support of the Federal Government and the residents of Australia.

         —Tonight I want to refer briefly to the deaths of three people, two of them being, in their different ways, outstanding Australians, and the other being a very impressive Australian by adoption. I refer in the first instance to Kenneth Myer and his wife, Yasuko, who died when their light plane crashed in Alaska a couple of weeks ago. Mr Myer had a reputation as an unconventional but a very caring leader of the Melbourne establishment who decided to move to Sydney. He spent, after standing down as Chairman of Myer Emporium, most of his time in Sydney.

         Kenneth Myer was born in San Francisco, the son of a Russian Jewish migrant who had business interests in Australia. His father's name originally had been Simcha Baevski, but he changed it to Sidney Myer. In 1929, Sidney Myer based his family in Australia and Kenneth, the eldest son, attended Melbourne Grammar and Geelong Grammar schools.

         After the war broke out in Europe, Kenneth Myer spent a year studying humanities at Princeton University in the United States before returning to Australia to join the Royal Australian Navy's anti-submarine service as a colleague in arms of my late father. He served in the Navy until 1946, attaining the rank of lieutenant and being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

         He was, of course, one of Australia's foremost patrons of the arts, serving as a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales since 1990 and Chairman of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust from 1969 to 1975. In the 1980s he donated a 200-hectare property he co-owned on the New South Wales south coast to the State Government. This has become a sanctuary for rare flora and fauna and is part of the Mimosa Rocks National Park.

         Ken Myer shocked the conservative establishment in 1972 when he signed the letter from prominent Australians urging the election of a Whitlam Labor government after 23 years of coalition rule. This caused problems in his family, with his mother, Dame Merlyn Myer, contacting the then Liberal Prime Minister, Mr McMahon, to dissociate the family from her son's statement. I must say that at some stage later it was suggested that he may well have been an appropriate candidate to succeed Sir Paul Hasluck as Governor-General, but instead the ALP government of the time proposed Sir John Kerr for the position. It is interesting to speculate on whether history would have been a little different had Mr Myer been appointed to that position.

         After the election of the Hawke Government, Mr Myer was appointed chairman of the ABC, but he quit three years later after a controversial time as head of the national broadcaster. I last spoke with Mr Myer not so long ago at a dinner that my wife and I attended at the home of Robert and Angela Raymond. Ken and Yasuko were speaking with great enthusiasm about their up-coming fishing trip to Alaska, despite Yasuko's difficulty in travelling following an accident in which a four wheel drive vehicle had rolled on her. Mr Myer had some useful words of advice to me about appropriate government policies for the arts in Australia.

         At the age of 71, he was one of the most energetic, lively and intellectually stimulating people one could hope to be involved with. I know all Australians will regret his untimely passing and that of his very supportive and very close wife. They had been together for 15 years and were utterly inseparable. If Ken Myer was to die in a plane crash, I think it was right that Yasuko should be with him.

         The next person I will refer to is Ron Saw, who was an old journalist mate of mine from the 1950s and 1960s in Sydney where we worked together. As a tribute in the

        He was a good mate and I must say that I had many lively times with him. I regret to say that in those days he had a glass jaw, which did not discourage him from expressing himself with more courage than sense in difficult situations—situations which I might say were often generated by his own ebullience when encouraged by a beer or two. At some stage he had worked for every proprietor in Sydney, having started off in Western Australia on the now defunct

In fact, the family had held the number one seat on the Melbourne stock exchange—I think the name of the firm was Saw, Reid and Co. Ron, who was quite a good Aussie Rules footballer, had no intention of becoming a broker and got a job on the Perth

         Ron Saw and I had lunch here not so long ago to talk about how governments could play a more useful role in preventing strokes and helping recovery. He fought his stroke and it is reasonable to say he almost won, but not quite. In 1967, Ron Saw and his third wife, Ellie, left Sydney for Noosa from where he wrote columns for the

We convey to his wife and family deep commiserations for the passing of an exciting and outstanding Australian journalist.

         I would like to make a few comments beyond that in terms of what has been put down. Firstly, it is interesting to note in terms of the accounting procedures, that all the overpayments, other than one which was $7.60 to a Mr Wayne Misdale who was a guest speaker at the working party, were to the Western Australian Builders Labourers Federation. All other claims were correctly paid.

         I now return to the substance of the question that I asked on that particular day. I want to highlight precisely the so-called allegations that I made. I asked—and I reiterated it in the debate that night—`Why has the Minister approved payments of $2,267 and $634 for travel?' Possibly I could have been more technically correct and used the words `agreed to', but in essence they mean the same.

         If we turn to page two of the letter that was put on the table tonight, the Minister quite correctly now informs us that this amount has, of course, not been paid. In any event, only a return economy fare would be reimbursed. What I want to say about that, and my question—and in the debate on that night I said I did not know at that time whether they had been paid—is that it is quite clear from the letter dated 1 June 1992 that the Minister tabled, that it was the intention, at least on 1 June, that these claims should be paid. If not, the 1 June letter by his senior adviser to Mr Terry Brosnan is not an accurate reflection of the discussions that were held. I refer in particular to that letter entitled `Reimbursement of Travel—WABLF'. It says:

       </para>
       <para>
        As far as I am concerned, the question that I asked that day was legitimate. It was the intention from this memo that those funds should be paid. When those funds were not available, as we have been told through the Building Industry Working Group, an attempt was made to find out whether funds were available under the WATUAG agreement.

         I have quite legitimate reason to believe that had I not asked that question that day, Mr Reynolds would have been paid. I also think it is fair to say that had I not asked that question, the accounting mistakes that were discovered and the overpayments that occurred would not have been picked up. I hope that the review of the accounting procedures will address and correct these problems.

         I shall leave my comments at that tonight. I stand by my assertion that my question was a legitimate one. There is no doubt that the intention was to meet the claims on these expenses. As I said, this is borne out by the letter of 1 June. I look forward to taking up the invitation issued by the Minister to discuss and look at the details further with officers of his Department.

         To go back one step, there has been a concern amongst all the farm machinery dealers and, of course, their clients throughout Australia that one of the changes which appeared to have resulted from the sales tax simplification procedures was that farm machinery held by dealers would in fact be subject to a sales tax of 20 per cent or so, whereas previously that had not been the case and that machinery had been exempt. That was the subject of consideration by the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. That discussion of the Committee found that there appeared to have been a misunderstanding on the part of those people who had been advising the farm machinery dealers in regard to the effect of the sales tax simplification proposals. Indeed, the situation is, as we understand it on the basis of evidence from the Taxation Office officials and recorded in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         of the Select Committee hearings which were held on 12 and 13 August last week, that there was a misunderstanding and that, in fact, the situation in practical terms is that there will be no change so far as farm machinery dealers and their equipment and parts are concerned from the situation now prevailing.

         That was a matter which had concerned, certainly, the coalition which has received hundreds of representations Australia-wide expressing concern about the matter. I understand that it was also a matter that had been raised with the Australian Democrats. Senator Kernot, Senator Vanstone and I raised the issue at the Select Committee hearings last week and received the assurances that I have just explained to the Senate. Subsequently, Senator Kernot has written to all the farm machinery dealers saying:

        The Australian Democrats support the current system of allowing retailers to purchase stock free of sales tax, where the eventual sale will be exempt from tax. I raised this matter with the Taxation Office officials at a public hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax recently and they informed the Committee that the current situation will not change.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no quarrel with that paragraph in the letter—it is factually correct—other than just making it clear that it was not just the Democrats who raised this matter and had it flushed out at the public hearings of the Select Committee; it was a matter which the coalition had been pursuing very diligently as well. Whether we beat the Democrats to it or not, I do not know. But it would be unfortunate if there were any implication that the decision that the Taxation Office officials gave to the Committee last week was due to the Australian Democrats rather than to the coalition. I think that we both played a part in getting the right decision conveyed to us; that there had been a misunderstanding earlier.

         Contrary to what Senator Kernot says in her letter, the GST does not apply to business inputs. There is no GST on business inputs. The whole of the goods and services tax is washed out of the production chain at each stage. That is why a goods and services tax is fundamentally different from a wholesale sales tax. A wholesale sales tax, by its very nature, gets caught up in the whole cost structure of the particular product that finishes up being sold. The goods and services tax, in complete contrast, gets excluded at every stage.

I have also been the recipient of some representations in respect of that matter. I had expressed my interest in it and I also examined the report when it was presented in the Senate. I wonder whether what the Taxation Office has said is sufficient for all time. I personally would like to see provisions in the legislation that would set at rest the minds of those in the agricultural machinery industry in particular, who made representations to me, to the Opposition, to the Democrats and, I suppose, also to the Government.

          I briefly want to advise the Senate that today something quite extraordinary happened in this House. Yesterday I became aware of the fact that six of the so-called Chinese boat people whose refugee status had been acknowledged by DILGEA had come to Canberra at the invitation of some Australian and Chinese friends. We all recall the quite remarkable stories of endurance which these people went through in November and December of last year in Western Australia before they were found.

          The true horror of the journey to Australia of these people is something that needs to be told at some stage. The horror of that journey was preceded by the great pressures that they were under in China. They are political dissidents. They have been persecuted in China. Because they expressed their views, a number of them were sacked from their jobs. They were pro-democracy supporters. One of them was a leader of the students in one of the major cities in south China and addressed pro-democracy meetings. Prior to the commencement of their journey, they were in hiding. The Chinese security police were seeking them out. That is some of the background. Today I invited them to come to Parliament House and invited senators and members to be present to hear some of their stories.

But if the information that we have is true—and it has been double-checked—that person when he came to Australia was subject to what can only be described as mental cruelty bordering on the shameful.

         I discussed this matter with my colleague Senator Short before he spoke earlier this evening. I said to him that it is quite clear that Senator Kernot does not understand what a goods and services tax is all about. I hope all senators understand that it is a tax on final consumption and that taxes on business inputs are rebatable. So there is not any tax as such. Even though it may be imposed in the first instance, it is then rebatable at the time the goods are sold. I said to Senator Jim Short, `Perhaps she just doesn't understand. Perhaps you could explain it'. As a result of a conversation I had with one of her colleagues this evening, in which he indicated to me that there are many thousands of letters and that she does understand it, as does he, I believe she quite deliberately left out the business about it being rebatable. The attitude of the Australian Democrats is: when these farm machinery agents panic about the Fightback goods and services tax and contact Opposition members, they will be able to explain to them that it is rebatable. So Senator Kernot has quite deliberately set out to mislead all of these people.

        (2) The estimates sought are not easily accessible, and since 1982, have been restricted to the four states which permit commercial harvesting of kangaroos.  An attempt was made in 1980-82 to obtain a national estimate of the Red (Macropus rufus), Eastern Grey (M. giganteus), and Western Grey (M. fuliginosus) Kangaroo populations in Australia by conducting aerial surveys over 75% of the continent and extrapolating estimates to unsurveyed areas. The report on the results of the 1987 aerial surveys examined population trends for an area of 2.5 million km(2) or 43% of the 1981 survey area but encompassing areas which contained 89% of the 1981 surveyed populations.

It should be emphasised that the values given reflect conservative population trends especially for Grey Kangaroos and not total population counts.

Where it is the policy of the relevant State Government to permit commercial use of kangaroos which may be proposed for export, it has been the practice for State wildlife authorities to prepare and implement kangaroo management programs.

        (1) Since 1987, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has received numerous requests from Senators and Members for  electoral roll data to be provided in electronic form. The Government's recent decision to do so directly resulted from requests by the Presiding Officers' Information Technology Advisory Group (POITAG) at its meetings in December 1990 and March 1991. Those requests did not specify WordPerfect as a required format.
