         This instrument amended clause 11 of Public Service Determination 1992/27, in respect of which the Committee gave a notice of motion of disallowance on 26 May 1992. That earlier Determination addressed a matter which had been investigated and reported upon by the Merit Protection and Review Agency. The MPRA advised that the calculation of leave credits for certain officers in the Australian Public Service was `unfair' and `inequitable' and recommended that the position be corrected, either by legislation or administrative procedures. Public Service Determination 1992/27 addressed this issue, but in a way which appeared to perpetuate an anomaly rather than solve the problem pointed out by the MPRA report.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         In its consideration of this matter the Committee asked senior officers of the Department to attend and brief it on this general question. The officers did so and later prepared a detailed paper on the options available to correct the existing position. The Department is now preparing a submission to the Minister based on the paper. Public Service Determination 1992/46, made before the Committee commenced its scrutiny of the earlier Determination, amended clause 11 of that Determination to correct drafting oversights which appear to make clause 11 ineffective. This present notice in respect of Public Service Determination 1992/46 preserves the option of the Committee to deal with this matter in its entirety.

         2.The Senate has authorised the Committee to scrutinise each of these instruments to detect and remedy possible breaches of parliamentary propriety and personal rights. The Committee writes to the Minister or other law maker in respect of any apparent defects, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears particularly serious then the Chair of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to take the ultimate step of disallowance. However, this step is rarely necessary, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         4.During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 784 instruments, which is average for recent sittings. Of these, 270 were statutory rules, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series of delegated legislation. The other 514 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of scores of different series.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         5.Each of the 784 instruments was scrutinised by the Committee under its four Principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders. There were 65 prima facie defects in these 784 instruments. The defects are described below under each of the four Principles.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         6.This Principle does not involve mere technical invalidity. Rather, together with the fourth Principle of the Committee, it covers every aspect of parliamentary propriety. However, the Committee is concerned that every instrument should operate validly in accordance with its parent Act or umbrella legislation covering regulations and other legislative instruments. Several instruments during these sittings appeared themselves to delegate legislative power invalidly. Another attempted to incorporate instruments issued by an international organisation  `from time to time' with no apparent authorisation in the parent Act. Several instruments appeared to operate retrospectively to the prejudice of a person other than the Commonwealth, with consequent invalidity under s.48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. This provision operates even if, as in one case, such prejudicial retrospectivity was only for one day. There were other breaches of the Acts Interpretation Act. Several sets of regulations appeared to have been re-made while required to be tabled, consequently being of no effect under s.48A of that Act. Other regulations may have been re-made while subject to disallowance, in breach of s.48B of the Act. One instrument validly revoked an earlier instrument but did not effect its obvious intention to make a fresh one. The operative words of another referred to attached `Tables' as  `Parts', and so appeared ineffective. Another had no operative words at all. Another referred incorrectly to entries in a Table. Another referred to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Ukrainian and Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republics, which no longer exist. The Committee also inquired about the status of an instrument which purported to amend an instrument disallowed by the Senate.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         7.The Committee is also concerned that the drafting, presentation and access of delegated legislation should be of a standard not less than that of Acts, even if drafting deficiencies do not affect validity. During these sittings two sets of regulations with the same name were in force at the same time. Another instrument connected a series of paragraphs with  `and' rather than `or', which resulted in an absurdity; another referred to a repealed Act; another referred incorrectly to the parent Act; another referred to provisions of the parent Act which did not exist; others had incorrect cross references; another had the wrong title; others had no citation or numbering; and another had wrong references to Schedules. Several instruments used vague and uncertain expressions; while others used outdated expressions such as `dietmaid' and `housemaid'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         8.As a result of action by the Committee, each instrument of delegated legislation is now accompanied by an Explanatory Statement or other explanatory material, which sets out its background, legislative authority and details of its provisions. During these sittings one Explanatory Statement had a wrong heading; another referred incorrectly to the title of its parent Act; another referred incorrectly to provisions in the parent Act; and another had attachments missing. The contents of some Explanatory Statements were also defective. One did not explain major changes in a levy; several did not mention that the purpose of the instrument was to implement undertakings given to the Committee; several gave wrong advice; several gave misleading advice; and others gave incomplete advice.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         9.Apart from possible invalidity resulting from unauthorised subdelegation it is a breach of parliamentary propriety if legislative instruments confer legislative authority without provision for tabling and disallowance. In one case Notes and General Notes in the body of an instrument appeared to include legislative powers. These Notes also conferred discretions on public officials. In another case legislative power could be exercised merely by notice in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Gazette

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         10.As with all its Principles, the Committee interprets its responsibilities to protect rights and liberties in a broad fashion. Thus, delegated legislation should not include inappropriate criteria for action by Commonwealth officials. For instance, criteria to decide whether a person was a  `fit and proper person' included a conviction for any Commonwealth, State or Territory law; and a similar conviction of an associate, widely defined to include a spouse, employer, employee, or an officer of a company in which the person holds shares. These criteria were not limited to the present, but extended back in time. The same instrument referred to an offence allegedly committed. Another instrument provided that an appointment to a statutory body was `at the pleasure of the Minister'.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         11.Obligations or duties imposed on individuals should be clear and unambiguous. Thus, one mandatory provision appeared to be impossible to meet. Notes in the body of an instrument mentioned an element of compulsion which did not appear to be authorised by either the parent Act or the legislation made under it. In another instrument a person was required to `show' that a state of affairs existed but did not indicate to whom this was to be done. Another penal provision used the scientific, rather than the common, names of fish and crustaceans.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         12.It may be a breach of personal rights if the Commonwealth imposes unreasonable conditions on those dealing with it. For instance, participation in one program was conditional upon a person giving a wide indemnity to the Commonwealth, including an indemnity from suit for incidents involving motor vehicles. Another appeared to give an unreasonable length of time to public officials to delay mandatory action. Another provision reduced fees if public officials did not meet deadlines, but expressly excluded the Commonwealth from any liability for loss suffered. In addition, the reduced fees applied for some breach of duties, but not others. The Committee was also concerned at provisions which enabled the Commonwealth to garnishee wages and salaries and accounts at banks and financial institutions. In another instrument, the Commonwealth required a sponsor to be responsible for the financial liabilities of the person sponsored, and for compliance by the person with all legislation and employment awards.

         13.The Merit Protection and Review Agency is a statutory authority charged with ensuring that actions and decisions in respect of a Commonwealth employee are fair and equitable. The Committee was concerned that two instruments only partly implemented an MPRA recommendation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         14.If delegated legislation confers benefits on individuals then it is essential that they be made aware of the benefits. One instrument provided that if a person failed to vote in an election then that person could either pay an administrative penalty of $20 or have the matter dealt with in a court, where the penalty was $50 plus costs. However, the form sent out to those persons affected did not advise that if the $20 was paid, then all liability was discharged, no further proceedings in respect of the matter could be brought, and the person was not regarded as having been convicted of an offence.

         15.The Committee ensures that administrative discretions included in delegated legislation are narrow in scope, provided with objective criteria to guide and limit their exercise, and in appropriate cases provide external review of the merits of a decision by an independent body such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
        </para>

        The Bill amends the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 to include in legislation providing for right of review of administrative decisions a requirement that persons affected by such decisions be notified of the decision and of their rights of review. This substantially gives effect to recommendations of the Administrative Review Council in its Report No. 27 Access to Administrative Review Stage One: Notification of Decisions and Rights of Review. The proposal formalises in legislation administrative practices which are already in place in major review jurisdictions. It reflects a recognition that a review is of no assistance to a person who does not know that such a right exists.

Part II of Schedule 2 lists bodies which are exempt for particular documents and is to be amended to delete bodies which have been abolished and to insert other bodies. Part II is also to be amended to delete bodies which are established under legislation which will be included in the new Part III of Schedule 2.

        The Australian Government Solicitor is presently authorised to act as solicitor for the Commonwealth and its officers. For the purpose of so acting, the Australian Government Solicitor is "entitled to practise as a solicitor in any court and entitled to all the rights and privileges of a solicitor in each State or Territory". Lawyers from the Office of the Australian Government Solicitor, which is within the Attorney-General's Department, are admitted variously as barristers, solicitors, and barristers and solicitors or legal practitioners (effectively barristers and solicitors). These lawyers appear regularly in courts and tribunals across Australia, from magistrates courts to the High Court. In jurisdictions which have a fused profession they appear frequently as counsel.

        The Australian Government Solicitor itself, the Commonwealth's `legal firm', is to be authorised to practise as a barrister, solicitor or barrister and solicitor. For the purpose of acting for the clients described in subsection 55E(3) of the Act, the Australian Government Solicitor will be entitled to practise in any court and to all the rights and privileges of a barrister, solicitor or barrister and solicitor in each State or Territory. This approach is consistent with the approach of sections 15 and 16 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983.

        It is necessary also to ensure that the persons who could be regarded as the `partners of the firm', namely the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department and persons appointed by the Secretary to act in the name of the Australian Government Solicitor, have the same rights and privileges as the Australian Government Solicitor. In practice, a Deputy Secretary (locally designated as the Australian Government Solicitor), the Directors of Regional Offices and Office and Division Heads in the Central Office of the Department are appointed to act in the name of the Australian Government Solicitor. Similar provision is to be made for other practising lawyers within the Department.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        As well as giving to those whom the Attorney-General has called the `partners of the firm' the right to practise as a barrister, solicitor or barrister and solicitor, it is important to ensure that they and the lawyers who work with them observe the duties and obligation which go with those rights. They are thus placed on a similar footing to lawyers in private practice.

        As the Attorney-General's Department moves into a user pays system for many of the legal services, it is necessary for the Australian Government Solicitor to have a legislative basis to charge clients for its services and to ensure that clients may recover those costs from other parties to litigation. The amendments will enable this.

        Amendments are to be made to the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 in relation to special federal matters. These are matters arising under federal law which the Cross-vesting Act requires, save in exceptional cases, to be heard in federal rather than State courts.

States and Territories will shortly be enacting complementary amendments to their cross-vesting legislation.

        The Bill will add to the existing list of special federal matters the giving of consent by the Family Court under the Family Law Act to step-parent adoption proceedings.

        The Bill will also amend the Cross-vesting Act to make improvements to the procedure for determining whether a State or federal court should hear a proceeding involving a special federal matter. The amendments to be made by the Bill will ensure that where proceedings involving a special federal matter come before a State court, that court will have regard to the general policy that special federal matters be heard by a federal court. It will only be in exceptional circumstances that a State court will decide not to transfer a special federal matter to a federal court. The Bill will make it clear that exceptional circumstances do not include the convenience of the parties.

        At present, complaints made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that an act is unlawful under either the Racial Discrimination Act or the Sex Discrimination Act are first investigated by the Race Discrimination Commissioner or Sex Discrimination Commissioner. If the Commissioner decides not to inquire into an alleged unlawful act, there is a right of referral of the complaint to the Commission for inquiry. This is so even in cases where the complaint is stale, frivolous; vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance or where those aggrieved by the act no longer wish the Commissioner's inquiry to be held. The amendments will replace the present system with a right to have the Commissioner's decision not to inquire reviewed `on the papers' by the President of the Commission. Decisions by the Commissioner not to inquire into a complaint will still be referable to the Commission for inquiry in cases where the Commissioner's decision is based on a finding that the act the subject of the complaint was not unlawful.

        Further amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act are proposed to implement recommendations of the Commission's report Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. At present insurance policies are exempt from the operation of the Act for any sex discrimination in them which is based upon actuarial or statistical data on which it is reasonable to rely and having regard to the data and any other relevant factors. The amendments will remove the catch-all phrase `and any other relevant factors' as a basis of discrimination in insurance, requiring that sex-differentiated premiums be justified by actuarial or statistical data. The exemption for discrimination in insurance based on such data is to be retained, but will generally only apply where insurers supply or make available the statistical or actuarial data used as a basis for sex-differentiated insurance premiums to persons seeking insurance who request access to that data. The new provisions are balanced by an extension of the power of the Commission under section 44 of the Act to grant administrative exemptions from the prohibition on discrimination. The amendments, which will strengthen the responsiveness and accountability of the insurance industry to clients, are broadly supported by peak insurance bodies.

        The Bill will amend the National Measurement Act 1960 to make consequential provisions resulting from the enactment by State and Territory Governments of the Uniform Trade Measurement Legislation, to include provisions for a broader range of legal measurements than are presently allowed for in the Act and to clarify Australia's obligations under the International convention on Legal Metrology and to ensure that legal measuring instruments in use in Australia comply with national and international requirements.

        As the amount of error determined for a particular measuring instrument may vary according to the test procedure adopted, and to ensure that verification, reverification and certification procedures are uniformly applied throughout Australian, the provision of test procedures in certificates of approval is necessary.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Uniform Trade Measurement legislation also requires that verification tolerances, which may have different values, are those permitted under the Act.

        The Act and regulations currently provide for the Commission to undertake pattern approval of measuring instruments used for trade. Pattern approval aims to ensure that measuring instruments are not capable of facilitating fraud, that they will maintain their accuracy between verifications and will not be adversely affected by changes in environmental conditions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is estimated that goods to the value of $40 billion are traded across Commission approved equipment each year. If measuring instruments do not comply with the approved pattern, then the community may suffer loss in two ways. Firstly, the non-complying instruments might include features that facilitate fraud. Secondly, the instruments might not be able to maintain calibration and might not be recalibrated unless it is in the vendor's interest to do so. Australia could also suffer loss of export revenue from the sale of resources such as coal, wheat, wool and sugar if non-complying instruments are used.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Act provides for penalties if instruments falsely purport to comply with an approved pattern, however no mechanism exists for instruments to be checked for compliance. State and Territory trade measurement authorities, a Public Service Board review of the pattern approval procedures and Commission risk analysis reports have each identified pattern compliance as an essential component in maintaining the integrity of the trade measurement system.

        In 1959 Australia acceded to the International convention establishing an international Organisation of Legal Metrology. The Organisation was vested with responsibility for determining international requirements for legal measuring instruments and Member States were "morally obliged to implement these decisions as far as possible". With the globalisation of trade the Convention has gained increasing importance and is in harmony with the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. The amendment clarifies Australia's measurement requirements under this convention and will be an essential component of mutual recognition agreements with Australia's trading partners.

         The amendments to the Australia Council Act 1975 will enable the Minister, rather than the Governor-General, to appoint, terminate the appointment of, and accept the resignation of, all members of the Council, including the General Manager, but excluding the Chairperson. A new section will also enable the Minister to appoint, and to terminate the appointment of, members (but not Chairpersons) of Boards constituted under the Act. These amendments will streamline the appointment process.

         The amendments to the National Gallery Act 1975 give effect to the change of the official name of the Gallery from `Australian National Gallery' to `National Gallery of Australia'. There has, in the past, been some confusion internationally about the status of the Gallery, as it is not immediately clear that it is the national art gallery and not merely one of a number of smaller galleries located in Canberra. The change of name is intended to chance the international profile of the Gallery.

However, these two notices of motion have now been standing before the Senate for some number of days.

         The question of an ethics committee was raised by a former Democrat, Michael Macklin, quite some time ago. Of course, the commencement of construction of a committee occurred in, I think, September last year in the House of Representatives. What we have here is an adding of a code of conduct to that committee. As I say, that particular reference has been before the committee and under quite intense consideration both inside and outside the chamber for some considerable time. It is therefore appropriate on this last sitting day that we debate this matter now, set up the committee and get the processes in order. It is almost certain that the substantive issues will be debated once this motion for suspension is passed, so I will not say anything more at this stage.

The first, as Senator Coulter said, relates to the extension of the mandate for this informal working group. If it decides to extend its mandate, that is within its own province. It is certainly not an issue that needs to be debated as a matter of urgency this morning, bearing in mind the program that is before us today and what I thought was the Australian Democrats' point of view that the program should take precedence. But if it is to be debated, I will be amending it to deal with the matter of urgency—that is, the need for a proper and full inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair.

         With regard to the second notice of motion, which deals with the question of the composition of this working group on standards, we will be moving to amend that as well, in order to delete the names of three members of the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party—the President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, who has been a party to the Marshall Islands affair, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr McLeay, and Senator Loosley—because this is all about a breach of ministerial standards by Senator Richardson, the leader of the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. We think it is an appalling irony that what is being asked is that a committee be set up, comprised principally of mates of the Right, to look at the standard of behaviour of Senator Richardson, the leader of that faction and, upon that, to devise a codified set of standards with which we all should comply.

         What should occur is what the Democrats were prepared to support a little while ago—a proper and full inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair to establish where fault lies in order that the Parliament might take the proper action that flows therefrom. It was only a few days ago that the Democrats called for an independent judicial inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter. Of course, when the Government said no, the Democrats rolled over and abandoned it. At the same time they were saying that perhaps the facts even demanded a royal commission into this matter. That seems to have been forgotten.

         I thought that the Democrats' charter was to ensure ministerial accountability. If that is the case, if they are prepared to stand by that charter, I would have thought what they would want to do today is to establish the facts so that these questions as to whether it is necessary to codify standards can be answered, and matters can flow from that. It is a matter of great regret to me, Mr President, that the Democrats have abandoned that charter of ministerial accountability that they put to the Australian people in the past. Nevertheless, in the course of the debate that will follow, because it seems that the Democrats have done another deal with the Government on this matter—of course, the deal is to get it off the hook on the Marshall Islands affair—we will give them the chance to face up to their responsibility again by moving the amendments that I have just outlined.

         Senator Coulter has flipped and flopped on this issue over the last four or five weeks. Firstly, Senator Coulter said to us that he was opposed to any inquiry. Then some weeks later, on 1 June, he came out with a very strong press statement headed, `Democrats propose an independent judicial Marshall Islands inquiry'. I invite Senator Coulter and the other Australian Democrats to re-read that press statement. It was not, by and large, a bad press statement; it contained a few words that I might query, but I thought he outlined the issues very neatly. He did not propose any wishy-washy motion to look into a code of conduct of Ministers. What he said was that he wanted a full, fair dinkum inquiry. The reason he said that was as follows:

        It is questionable whether certain people, including ministerial and departmental staff, have been overtly compliant in assessing the business dealings of Mr Symons.

         I found it intriguing that Senator Evans, above all, should say, `Look what happened in New South Wales'. I say to Senator Evans, `Look what did happen in New South Wales. There was an independent inquiry'. That is what he is so dead scared about. This whole grubby affair, which Senator Evans has been involved in from day one, is not going to be resolved by the inquiry that is being proposed, dominated by the Labor Party, with no reference at all to the particular activities of the Marshall Islands affair, and with the committee itself being under the control of the New South Wales Labor Right. What Senator Coulter has done is try to cover up his flip-flops on the issue. He has gone to his Party, and clearly a majority in the party room has said that his press release of 1 June no longer stands. A majority of people in that party room were not prepared to stick with the tradition of the Australian Democrats and support a proper inquiry to make sure that we keep the Government honest.

         It is very interesting that, although Senator Richardson was forced to resign, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has already indicated that Senator Richardson would be welcome back in the Government at some later stage. The Prime Minister has not conceded any fault on the part of Senator Richardson. Senator Coulter asked Senator Evans a similar question here: whether, on reflection, Senator Evans's behaviour in agreeing to the phone call that Senator Richardson made to the Marshall Islands was an appropriate use of his authority as a Minister of the Crown. Despite all that has happened, on reflection, Senator Evans has failed to admit any guilt or concede any problem in relation to that matter.

         What we have is a grubby affair involving at least two senior Ministers of this Government. We have a Prime Minister who has not conceded any fault whatsoever and we have a department which seems to have been paralysed over the whole affair. That is the message that certainly comes through the papers tabled by Senator Evans. Senator Coulter is not prepared to stand up for what he has argued for in the past. He has flip-flopped around on this issue. Apparently, he no longer supports his strong and worthy press release of 1 June. Now it is pretty clear that the Australian Democrats have ducked the real issues and have done a deal with the Government. As a result, we are not going to have a proper inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair.

         The motion that Senator Coulter has moved does not in any way touch these vital matters.

The Marshall Islands affair is the most important one at the moment, but it is by no means the only one. If one went through the Keating Ministry, one could point very easily at a considerable number of Ministers whose actions are at the very least questionable and which should be looked at in considerable detail. Yet Senator Coulter and the Democrats are not prepared to put proper procedures in train in this place that would enable that to be done.

         I say that it is about time Senator Coulter and the Democrats came clean with the Australian people in terms of their bona fides. Every action that you have taken as a party in this place—at least for the last three or four years, and I believe well beyond that—is in total contravention of what you claim you stand for. You have a great opportunity today to put the record straight on that. You have a great opportunity to show, by joining with the coalition in seeking a proper inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair, that your whole raison d'etre in this place is valid. If you do not support us today—as you have continued to indicate you will not—then I believe the bona fides of the Democrats and even the raison d'etre of the Democrats will be, as we have all known for so many years now, totally invalid.

          —I believe that it is important that these two matters be dealt with now. The committee should be properly constituted so that it can get on with the business of deciding not only on a code of ethics but also on a code of conduct for Ministers. This is the subject of the principal motion, that the working group developing the code of conduct for senators and members be given the priority to develop a code of conduct for Ministers, and that the terms of such a code of conduct should be transmitted to both Houses of the Federal Parliament on or before the first day of sitting in 1993. There are several aspects to that.

          A moment ago we heard the Opposition arguing as if this committee would actually decide definitively on the code of conduct. Of course that is not the case. The committee, like all other committees, would be reporting back to both Houses of the Parliament. It would be for the Parliament to decide—whatever came out of that committee—whether either of those terms of reference was adequate or not. It seems to me that that rather undercuts some of the objections which the Opposition has made to the composition of the committee.

          Moreover, it seems to me that in the absence of an existing code of ethics or code of conduct for Ministers, it ill behoves the Opposition to cast aspersions on particular people who might be on that committee. There is no objective standard, as yet, by which the behaviour of those people can be judged. For the Opposition to be pointing a particular finger at the New South Wales Right, however they may have behaved, is simply to do that in the absence of the very thing that this committee is designed to look into. As Senator Evans pointed out a moment ago, for the Opposition to be pointing such a finger the very day after Mr Greiner in New South Wales had sought to argue a difference between corruption and technical corruption, is, to say the least, a bit choice.

          According to the notice of motion, which was moved just this morning by my colleague Senator Kernot, the actions of the Tasmanian Liberal Government certainly smack of `mates'. I use that word quite deliberately because there you have a liberal government which has decided to pay the legal costs of Mr Edmund Rouse, who was gaoled for his part in the affair of bribing a person; and of the former Premier, Mr Robin Gray, and Mr David Mcquestin, thus overruling the findings of three Supreme Court judges that Messrs Grey and Mcquestin should pay for their Supreme Court action. These payments did not extend to eight other witnesses, including Mr Jim Cox. If the principal complaint by the Opposition is that the New South Wales Right is looking after its mates, then it seems to me that really they should cast the mote out of their own eye before they point to the mote in the eye of anybody on the Government side.

          The debate which briefly preceded this debate was couched in terms which seemed to indicate that the principal concern about behaviour was in relation to the Marshall Islands. But surely we have example after example—not just in this Parliament but far more widely throughout Australia—of behaviour that many of us would regard as unacceptable. It is therefore appropriate to go much more widely than simply a consideration of the Marshall Islands affair.

          In relation to the Marshall Islands affair, Senator Kemp indicated earlier that at a previous time I had put out a press release calling for an independent judicial inquiry. He was quite correct. At that time that was the appropriate way to go. In some respects it would still be an advantage to go down that path. However, that path is not available to us and, moreover, the alternative being offered by the Opposition is simply unworkable.

I make no judgment as to whether he is guilty or not, but it is a possibility. Therefore, he would not be available now because of the problems of sub judice unless a council of at least equivalent legal standing were established in Australia, which we cannot do, and/or he may not be available for an extended period beyond that. Pursuing that path is not possible because one of the key witnesses before such an inquiry would not be available.

          I think Senator Kemp made the point a moment ago that Senator Richardson has not admitted fault. Certainly it is the case that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not admitted that what Senator Richardson did was in any way faulty.

          Senator Evans also has not admitted fault. But I must say that when I asked Senator Evans the particular question to which Senator Kemp drew our attention a moment ago he did say—and this is the relevant point—that people of good conscience have different views about that particular matter. That matter was whether it was appropriate for other senior Ministers to seek to intercede when a legal matter was before the courts in a foreign country. That, of course, is the very issue: that people of good conscience can have different views. Senator Kemp may believe—as I believe—that the behaviour of Senator Richardson in seeking to intercede was inappropriate, and it was inappropriate for Senator Evans to provide that advice. I do happen to hold that view. Senator Evans holds a different view. Surely it is appropriate that this committee look at those situations, which it can adequately do, and then come back with a recommendation as to whether that is appropriate.

          I also hold the view that Senator Richardson was wrong in providing that reference without going through proper procedures to satisfy himself as to the past business dealings of Symons, the present business proposal, and also to know more about the character of Symons himself. Again, it is appropriate for this committee to look at those matters and, if it is appropriate for Ministers to give references under those sorts of circumstances, to outline the procedures that Ministers might go through before such a reference is issued. It is quite easy to conceive of a set of procedures which might be followed. Senator Richardson might, in fact, have gone to certain authorities and sought information as to Mr Symons previous business dealings. He may well have sought other character references, and may have sought a lot more detail as to the proposals which Mr Symons was at that time intending to launch in the Marshall Islands.

          If that is done, it seems to me that we will then have a yardstick by which the actions of Senator Richardson can be judged, albeit retrospectively. If that committee recommends, and the Senate and the House of Representatives accept, that there should be a procedure by which Ministers who are asked to give such a reference should proceed, and if Senator Richardson did not proceed according to those standards, then at least retrospectively we do have a judgment on the action of Senator Richardson. Surely that is as far as we can reasonably go under these circumstances.

          I think Senator Short pointed out a moment ago, and I certainly pointed out yesterday, that there is a great deal of disquiet in the community as to the behaviour of politicians—not just in this place, but generally around the country. That disquiet, in my view, is justified. It goes to the matter of the broad ethical behaviour of politicians, and it goes to the matter of the detailed day-to-day behaviour of politicians in this chamber in relation to the conduct of debate. While that is dealt with elsewhere, it is important that this matter be delayed no further—that it is dealt with now. Given the fact that the general proposition has been around for a long, long time, the Opposition certainly has had plenty of time to come forward with an alternative. It has failed to do so. It is therefore appropriate that we pass these two motions now and get on with the business. If we are dissatisfied with what the committee comes back with, then let us have another look at it. But at least this committee must report by the first sitting day next year and we will have something concrete before us, instead of the lack of procedures which we have had so far.

         Sadly, let us make no mistake that what we see today is an arrangement between the Australian Democrats and the Government which lets the Government, in particular its Ministers, off the hook. It is a deal designed to ensure that there is no proper parliamentary inquiry to establish the outstanding facts in relation to the Marshall Islands affair.

          It is really beyond my comprehension why the Democrats are so blatantly prepared to abdicate their responsibility to help ensure ministerial accountability in this way. At times I think it is simply that they are a soft touch; at other times a deal. All I can say is I hope the Democrats got a good price for their deal because when they leave the chamber at the end of this debate, the Government will be laughing at them. The Government will be laughing at the Democrats because by the deal, the soft touch or whatever it has done with the Australian Democrats, it has ensured that there will not be a proper inquiry to establish these facts.

          Let us look at the motion and the amendment that I have moved. What the Australian Democrats want to do is to extend the charter of this so-called informal working group to develop a code of conduct. What is the history of that? Madam Deputy President, you might remember that a few years ago Senator Macklin of the Australian Democrats moved a motion in this place to set up a formal parliamentary committee to look at the desirability of developing a code of conduct on ethical behaviour of members of parliament.

          It is interesting, in the light of the new morality of this Government, to look back at the response of Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, when he responded to Senator Macklin in that matter. He did so on 22 December 1989. He was asked why the Government was not supporting Senator Macklin's motion. The answer of Senator Button, not very long ago, was:

          But, not very long ago, Mr Mack, the independent in the House of Representatives, raised the question again and put it in a question to the then Prime Minister. He used some statements of Mr Temby and ICAC in New South Wales as a basis. He said, `Is it not time to set up a committee to codify standards of behaviour of members of parliament?'. Mr Hawke at that time obviously believed that there was some reason to give benefit to Mr Mack, and said okay. But instead of setting up a proper parliamentary inquiry in which there would be a balance of representation between the parties—as is the normal case in relation to these things—he instructed the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, two members of the New South Wales right of the Labor Party, to set up this informal working group and to write to party leaders and request nominations. It had no formal parliamentary composition at all. It was not set up as a result of any reasoned case. It was set up simply as a result of the then Prime Minister wanting to give benefit, for some reason or another, to Mr Mack; and we can only speculate on what that might be. As a result of that, this so-called working group was put together.

That has now been changed. Very generously, they have said that we can have two members of the Liberal Party to their five members of the Labor Party! And Senator Coulter comes in here today and says, `Do not worry about that because there is going to be an Australian Democrat on it'. We have seen this morning to what extent we can rely upon the Australian Democrats to ensure proper accountability of Ministers of this Government; that is, as soon as the pressure is put on, they go to water. They will do it when it is at the easy stage of a matter but, as soon as it becomes difficult, they go to water, do a deal with the Government, put it aside and pursue it no further. That is the body whose mandate Senator Coulter and the Government have conspired today to extend, to try to develop a code of conduct not only for members but also now for Ministers.

          We say that what the committee should do, if it is to be the working group—it would be much better if it were a proper parliamentary committee—is take the example of the Marshall Islands affair and get to the bottom of it. We have already seen that there was sufficient misbehaviour by one Minister that he had to resign over the matter. Of course, he should have been sacked by the Prime Minister in any event, but he resigned. The committee should look at the matter and establish the facts. Then, on that basis, it should determine whether there would be any worthwhile purpose in trying to codify standards of behaviour of Ministers. That would develop a sound basis for its work. It would have the side benefit of the Parliament then being made fully and properly aware of the circumstances and facts of the Marshall Islands affair, which facts will not be made available to us in any other way. That is why I moved my amendment.

          Let us address for a minute or two the question of why Senator Gareth Evans is so opposed to the issue of the Marshall Islands being further explored. The answer is that if Senator Evans applied the standards that he sought to apply, in 1982 when he was in Opposition in relation to Senator Durack, he would have hung his head in shame and resigned weeks ago over this matter. There is little doubt, on what facts we know, that Senator Evans has acted improperly in relation to this matter. First, he has acted improperly in authorising Senator Richardson—presumably on the instructions of Senator Richardson, because that seems to be the power of Senator Richardson within the Labor Party and the power of the New South Wales Right faction of the Labor Party—to make contact with the President of the Marshall Islands to seek benefit for a relative of Senator Richardson, Mr Symons, who is now under arrest in the Marshall Islands on forgery charges.

          That was an astonishing thing for a Minister for Foreign Affairs to do—to authorise one of his Ministers to make direct contact with the head of state of another country to seek benefit for one of Senator Richardson's friends and relatives. The Minister has given no adequate explanation of that at all. One would have thought that he would have, firstly, gone to his Department and said, `Let us establish the facts of this matter of Mr Symons who has been arrested in the Marshall Islands'. He might even have sought the advice of his Department, but Senator Evans is a particularly arrogant Minister. At least when he authorised Senator Richardson to make this incredible incursion into the affairs of the Marshall Islands, one would have thought he would have put it on the records of the Department so that, when the officers of the Department were further dealing with matters relating to the Marshall Islands and Symons in particular, they would at least have known of the involvement and intervention of their own Minister, Senator Evans.

          He failed to do all these things. One can only wonder why. One can only suspect it was because of the incredible power and influence that Senator Richardson seemed to wield within the Labor Party, the same power and influence that, when he took Symons around to see the President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, and introduced him to him—although Senator Sibraa had previously known him in the Young Labor movement—and said,`Give this man, my friend, some help', Senator Sibraa was well-prepared to do another incredible thing. He contacted the Australian mission in Washington direct and asked that it help Symons. Did he contact the Department also and check the circumstances of what Symons was seeking to do?

          Symons was holding out that the Australian Government had been asked by the Government, and in particular the President, of the Marshall Islands to help in this matter. Did he check that out? Did he confer with the Minister for Foreign Affairs? No, of course he did not. He simply picked up the instruction of Richardson because Symons had been introduced to him by his factional leader, Senator Richardson, the Minister in question, and he wrote off to Washington without checking with the Department or taking any of those usual precautions. After that, did he drop a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or drop a note to the Department in Canberra so that they would at least know what he had been doing and the action he had taken? Of course he did not, because there is a different set of standards when Senator Richardson issues an instruction. So we see constant action which in all circumstances, to give it a generous interpretation, would be unusual and, to give it perhaps a more balanced interpretation, would be incredible, simply because it was on the basis of an instruction of Senator Richardson.

          Senator Evans wrongly authorised Senator Richardson to intervene in the affairs of the Marshall Islands. If one picks up Senator Evans's own book on foreign affairs one sees cautions within it about the way in which one should deal with the small island states, because they could so easily misinterpret interventions or actions. That is exactly what occurred in this case. Anyone reading the transcript of the preliminary hearing in the Marshall Islands will find from the words of the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands that that is exactly what occurred. This was not just any Minister that had made contact with the President of the Marshall Islands, according to the words of that Attorney-General; this was a particularly powerful Minister. He was right. This was Senator Richardson. On that basis alone, Senator Evans should be prepared to have the full circumstances of this matter investigated.

          On all the precedents, he knows that he cannot get away with that, and that is why he is so keen to bring this matter to an end. On 7 May, when he came in here and said, `I know nothing about it', that was not a valid excuse because his personal officers had known these circumstances for over a month. He made the position even worse later in that day—he should have learnt about it personally months ago—when he finally became aware of the full circumstances. But rather than come back and correct the misrepresentation that he had made in Question Time, he chose to leave it in the hope that the matter would die during the ensuing two weeks in which the Senate was going to be up, and that it would not progress further.

          Well of course it deteriorated, because he would not take action. The Prime Minister had to cause an investigation of the matter within his own Department. Out of that we found finally the further letter from Symons to Senator Richardson, which was evidence of the fact that Senator Richardson knew in great detail of the scheme in the Marshall Islands, and further developed the case of Senator Richardson misleading the Senate. Senator Richardson then had no alternative but to resign.

As I said, Senator Evans has still not adequately explained his agreement to allow Senator Richardson to telephone the President of the Marshall Islands. He still has not told us what was the end result of a proper investigation—which was not taken, of course—into the suggestions that Senator Richardson had been contacting others within the Marshall Islands, Cabinet Ministers as well as the President, and on matters that went beyond the return of the passport.

          We even found this yesterday in an answer to Senator Teague, when we had asked the Minister why in fact were there not, on the documents that he had released, suggested answers to questions from his Department. The answer we got back from Senator Evans was that his office had told the Department that they did not wish to have such things, because these matters would be dealt with within his personal office. He did not want his Department involved in this matter because this was a political matter. He had been instructed to act by Senator Richardson, he had acted and knew that he had acted wrongly, and they wanted to keep it in the club. They did not want to bring in the wider bureaucracy because that becomes embarrassing.

At least one Australian citizen has lost a quarter of a million dollars, and the ill-gotten gains of this scheme, at least in part, seem to have filtered back into this country.

The object is to create, by all the familiar methods that are associated with these inquiries, the impression that there is something to be hidden, something to be investigated, something to be defended. The object is to hope against hope that, arising out of all of this, there may be some new political scalp achieved at the end of the day.

          There are rules governing ministerial behaviour which are reasonably well established in their basic content and shape, even if they are not terrifically precise at the margin. Some of these rules, for example the code of conduct suggested in the Bowen report on public duty and private interest, have been adopted over the years as a statement of broad principles applicable to Ministers and other public office holders. Again, chapter 2 of the published Cabinet handbook sets out the conventions and principles which apply to Ministers in particular, covering collective responsibility, Cabinet confidentiality, ministerial responsibility for proposals, declarations of interest, caretaker conventions in election periods and so on. It is an attempt at some kind of a codification of the basic Westminster rules governing ministerial responsibility.

          The terms of reference, in a nutshell, are to develop a code of conduct for members of parliament addressing the ethical responsibility of Federal parliamentarians generally. As the letter makes clear, the working group is also to have a role in developing appropriate means of disseminating information about the code, such as seminars for members and senators.

          The committee as it is presently established was set up to establish a code for parliamentarians generally rather than Ministers in particular; but I think it would be acknowledged that essentially the roles and responsibilities of Ministers are incremental to those of parliamentarians rather than being different in kind. What makes a Minister's role especially complex and pressured in the Australian system is that there are so many roles simultaneously demanding or requiring to be played. This particular matter was addressed in an interesting discussion of this by former Prime Minister Hawke in his Garran Oration in 1988. What Mr Hawke made clear in that speech in a neat summary was the extraordinary diversity of roles and functions that Ministers play. It is not only the responsibility derived from the Constitution to administer one's department, and not only one's overriding responsibility as a member of the executive Government with its associated responsibility to Cabinet and Cabinet committees. There are the legislative and parliamentary obligations, the unavoidable party political duties inside the Parliament and in the broader party organisation, and the quite specific responsibilities that we all have in relation to our electorates and constituents.

          That combination of responsibilities can sometimes create difficult situations for Ministers. It may not be inappropriate at all, from that particular perspective, for the group that is being charged to look at the particular responsibilities of members of parliament generally to also have the task of looking at the possible development of a code of conduct for Ministers. It is the interrelationship of the Minister's responsibilities with those of the ordinary member of parliament that produce some of the more interesting, difficult and sensitive questions that arise in practice. It may well be that the working group can do a very useful job in defining the elements of this ministerial code. Maybe it will prove not to be able to do the job—other attempts in the past have tended to have floundered in this respect—but at least it is reasonable that this group be given the opportunity to try.

          Finally, so far as the membership question is concerned, it is obviously important that the Liberal senators opposite should make up their minds about who their particular candidate for participation in this group should be. It really is rather extraordinary that so many months should have elapsed with the Liberals opposite being unwilling to exercise the most fundamental of all their responsibilities to this Parliament by contributing a member of that particular group. It is really a classic demonstration of the lack of interest that the members opposite tend to have on these ethical questions—questions of principle—except when they see a potential victim on this side of the chamber in their sights.

          What the Democrats are seeking to do in this instance, entirely legitimately, I think, is to raise their sights to these larger questions of policy and principle. That was exactly the issue which had been raised by Mr Mack in August or earlier last year and which the Speaker and the President sought to address by establishing this working group. But such was the lack of interest in the exercise on the part of the Opposition that in all these months it still has not got around to appointing a member to participate in the group.

          There is no ground whatsoever for criticism of the participation of Senator Sibraa and the Speaker, Mr McLeay, in the group. The inquiry that is being proposed is not into the Marshall Islands affair in any way that could raise questions about the personal participation in the exercise of Senator Sibraa. The terms of reference that are proposed for the Committee are the policy issues that have naturally arisen as a result of some of this discussion. There is no reference to the Marshall Islands in the terms of the motion. There is no case for using the working group as a vehicle for raking over the coals on this miscellany, this ragbag, of issues that we have heard about and will no doubt hear about ad nauseam in the time ahead.

          So far as Senator Loosley is concerned, all the fulmination in this respect has been entirely wasted. He is no longer a member of the committee. He took the view some little time ago that since his position on the committee was likely to generate controversy, whether justified or not, it might be appropriate for him to stand down. He has done that, and Senator Jones has replaced him. Similarly, if some questions should arise at any stage during the working group's deliberation when some question of potential embarrassment to any member of the committee is concerned, including either of the Presiding Officers, I am sure that in accordance with the normal practice and principles of commonsense and decency that apply in these situations, appropriate ways would be found of addressing that possible conflict of interest situation that might arise. But there is absolutely no basis whatever for proposing that the two Presiding Officers who set up, in total good faith, this working group to look at an issue of principle and an issue of policy which has not been systematically addressed in the past, should in any way resile from their responsibilities just because some sleazy attack, of the kind that we have become all too familiar with over the years, on the New South Wales Right and all its works, should be made by the Opposition. The issues here are issues of principle. That is the basis on which the Democrats have moved the motions now before us. I commend them for it.

It seems to me, if I may test my memory, to be only a few days ago, probably last week, when we were castigated roundly by the honourable senator who has brought this matter into the chamber today for wishing to discuss youth unemployment and to suspend Standing Orders to do that. Youth unemployment is the cancer that is eating Australia to death. With the aid of the Government, we were not permitted to bring that matter back for discussion in this chamber—but it is quite okay for us to take an hour or two or three today to bring up this rubbish that will not make one iota of difference to any single member or senator in the Parliament of Australia if it lives for 1,000 years.

Is it to cover the sort of gesture that we saw Senator Evans make to one of his colleagues in the chamber a few moments ago? Is it to cover intonations in the way things are said? Is it to cover interjections in or out of the chamber? Is it to comply with the approach that Senator Evans himself may have to matters of morals and ethics and so on—or Senator Button, or, say, Senator Bolkus and perhaps Senator Loosley?

How could the views of the sorts of people that I mentioned, the senators opposite, possibly produce a uniformity of approach? Is it designed just to fool the electorate? Is it seen to be a way by which a few votes can picked up? Will it change the fundamental attitudes of the people who come into this chamber, or the other one? Is it going to make them different people? Whom do the Democrats hope to impress? Do they see this as a means of gathering up a few more of one of these minority groups? What can it do? Senator Evans was good enough to run through a list of attempts which have been made but which have changed nothing. As he admits, with the best will in the world and with all the people who have done this, nothing has been achieved. We are now looking for yet another committee to see why it did not work and why such a person as Senator Richardson chooses, despite all the morals, ethics, codes of conduct and things that there are, to go his own way.

First, I think that the control of conduct of parliamentarians is being taken too much away from the Parliament itself. It has always been my view that the Parliament, by and large, should look to its own order.

The reason I say that is that, to work out a proper standard for parliamentary and ministerial conduct, we need two things: experience of what it is like to be a parliamentarian, and a strong sense of morality. Ethics is simply that—a mixture of experience in a particular field with a sense of morality. I think that what bodies like ICAC, royal commissions, judicial inquiries and criminal justice committees lack is experience as politicians—experience of what it is like to legislate and what it is like to be a Minister. That is why Senator Coulter has brought forward a motion that should be supported by us all. I think that we can, as a group, so conduct ourselves that it becomes a good committee.

I am not against that as a proposal—especially in this particular instance—but it should be a proposal when a matter arises, as is proper when the Senate looks at issues. He wants a judge of the superior court of the Commonwealth—or the State or the Territory—to advise the committee on the conduct of its inquiry, and for the committee to be pretty well bound by what that judge says.

There will be real problems with a judge being willing to perform that function, and, in any event, there are some real problems in the Constitution in terms of the separation of powers. But in any event, the major concern is that it is for the Parliament itself and not for a judge to tell us what to do and how to conduct ourselves. If we as a chamber cannot work out a series of points to put into a code of conduct, we have come to a very sad situation indeed.

Indeed, in the end we might decide not to establish a code of conduct. It may be that, on the basis of what Senator Coulter's motion states, the development of a code of conduct is found to be inappropriate in all the circumstances. But it is a very sensible proposition to look at it. It is a much more sensible proposition at this stage than wanting to go off to a judicial inquiry or a Senate inquiry, motivated in part by a desire to win political scalps. That is not said to the Opposition in any derogatory sense, but it would clearly be a very big coup if an inquiry could find a damaging piece of evidence against the other side; if it could go on a fishing expedition and find something that could be used against the other side. If one conducts an inquiry with that sort of motive, with that sort of intent, if only in part, then it is a very unfortunate way of going about things.

Our responsibility is to see to our own conduct, to see that we conduct ourselves in a proper way. If there is criminal conduct anywhere, that can be dealt with by the courts, as is normal. But with regard to this idea of creating one body to look after another, in the case of ICAC, in the case of the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland, in the case of any judicial inquiry, none of them was elected. I would have thought that the sanction on the sort of conduct, for example, that Mr Greiner pursued should have been dealt with at the ballot box and by the people in the Parliament. He went ahead and set up ICAC and he set up a particular person, Ian Temby. He left it to one person to decide the issue of whether a government should stand or fall. That seems to me to be wrong.

          —I commence my remarks by suggesting that the least surprising comment that I have heard during my time in this Parliament was when Senator Evans stood up and said that he did not support an inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair—or, as Senator Archer renamed it, perhaps appropriately, the Evans affair. It was interesting that Senator Evans pointed out the fact that he was quite happy to allow an investigation into the development of a code of conduct. But he did warn us—accurately, I think—that he did not see much coming out of an investigation, and that perhaps it might be of some value at the margin. I think Senator Evans was right on that point.

          Our system of government, the Westminster system, has had some 200 years of experience in developing standards and conventions to govern the behaviour of Ministers. Senator Evans drew our attention to a number of weighty tomes on this very issue—the issue of ministerial responsibility. Of course, as ministerial standards have developed over time, there have been many commentaries made on it. I do not think the issue is that we lack proper guidelines on ministerial standards. The guidelines are there; they are writ large in the history of this Parliament and in the traditions that we have inherited from Westminster. Perhaps the guidelines could all be put in one volume for the convenience of members of parliament. Those who are concerned about these issues know where to look, know what the experience is and know what precedents have been established. The reality is that little, if anything, will emerge from this inquiry.

          I also agreed with Senator Evans when he said—he made it very clear—that this will not be an inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair. How accurate Senator Evans was when he made that comment. What Senator Coulter has done today—and this is a heavy responsibility that Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats must now bear—is to attempt to bury the Marshall Islands affair. Time, of course, will tell whether it will be buried once and for all.

          Many issues will have to be explored in the course of the debate. I will be going through some of them. Senator Hill went through some of them. Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats have joined with the Australian Labor Party in this final attempt to bury the Marshall Islands affair. This is the same Senator Coulter who, just three weeks ago, came out with all guns blazing on this issue. What Senator Coulter was doing then was reflecting the community concern that had arisen as a result of this affair. He was reflecting the editorials that had been written in a number of newspapers. Above all, I think he was reflecting a very real concern that had emerged during the debate on the Marshall Islands affair about innumerable unanswered questions.

          I remind Senator Coulter of the remarks he made when moving a motion which, among other things, called for an independent judicial inquiry to report within eight weeks on the appropriateness and propriety of the conduct and decisions of Ministers, ministerial staff and departmental officers in relation to the business activities of Gregory Symons. This is what he said:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Throughout much of the questioning in these last couple of weeks, there have been implications—and I do not put it any higher than that—that members of ministerial staff, other Ministers or bureaucrats perhaps have been leant on to further the interests of Mr Symons. So far, we do not know whether that has occurred, and in answers to those sorts of questions Senator Evans principally but also others have said, `You provide the evidence and then we will carry out an inquiry'.
        </para>
        <para>
         Then Senator Coulter made a very significant statement. He said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It seems that that is really the wrong way to go; that with all the evidence within government departments it is appropriate that that evidence be brought out from there rather than that those who are in the dark as to what might have gone on be required to produce the evidence first of all. We make no judgment in relation to these matters as to whether these intercessions by other persons did or did not take place, whether they were or were not appropriate, and to what extent they may have furthered the business interests of Mr Symons.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is pretty strong stuff from Senator Coulter, supporting his call for an independent inquiry into this issue. He put his name to a press statement which further spelt out these issues.

          So what has happened in the last three weeks or so which may have turned the mind of Senator Coulter? Senator Coulter put forward the proposal for an independent inquiry but then—surprise, surprise—the Government said it did not want to have one. Did Senator Coulter really feel that he could make this proposal, which was well-founded, and then decide that because the Government did not want to have an investigation into the activities of its senior Ministers and major government departments, the proposal should be dropped? That is essentially what he said. He argued strongly. He put the proposal forward. The Government did not want an inquiry into its Ministers and major departments, and therefore he dropped the proposal.

          He said to us, `There was no alternative'. There are many alternatives. I wonder whether Senator Coulter has had a chance to look at the history of inquiries that have been carried out by the Senate and at the way in which an independent inquiry can be established. I suggest there are a number of ways to do them, one of which is set out in the motion that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, has moved. In that motion Senator Hill picks up the major themes that Senator Coulter is concerned about and proposes, among other things, the appointment of a judge of a superior court to that inquiry.

          What we had was a very clear alternative that could have gone forward, but what Senator Coulter has done, in a somewhat disgraceful manner, is to attempt to turn the fire back on the Liberal Party, to attempt to raise this spurious issue that somehow the real issue that was involved here was the lack of a ministerial code of conduct. We have a ministerial code of conduct. It is writ large in the conventions and precedents of the last 200 years. In an attempt to take the heat off the Government and off himself, the senator has tried this pathetic stunt, which I suspect will blow up in his face—as it duly should. He seemed at one stage to recognise the need for a major inquiry, an independent inquiry to suss out all the facts that are involved in this issue; yet now he says that he believes the real issue to be a code of conduct.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The issue is not a code of conduct. It is the willingness of a Prime Minister to enforce proper standards of government. We saw in the case of Senator Richardson that only when this Parliament was able to drag out the facts, only when we were able to table documents which Senator Richardson said he could not find, only when we were able to pursue the questioning, did we come to the facts of the case and the involvement of Senator Richardson in this matter. But even having established that Senator Richardson had misled this chamber, having established all that, we still have not been able to get a statement from Mr Keating that there was anything wrong with the behaviour of Senator Richardson.

          It is not the code of conduct which is the problem in this case. We know that when Ministers mislead the Parliament they must face the ultimate sanction. It is the behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and it is his failure to enforce, at an early stage, proper standards of ministerial accountability which is the problem. I suggest that not only is Senator Coulter trying to divert the issue from the Marshall Islands affair—why, I do not know—to the issue of the code of conduct, but the code of conduct is not the issue. It is the willingness of senior people, of political leaders, to enforce a proper code of conduct. In the case of Mr Keating, his values are writ large. Mr Keating has failed to condemn the behaviour of Senator Richardson in any way whatsoever.

          Can a ministerial code of conduct deal with the astonishing behaviour of Senator Evans? It must be obvious to the most junior consular officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs that one thing not to do is to get oneself involved in the judicial process in another country. It would have been the most obvious principle that the newest, most junior members of the Department of Foreign Affairs know. That is their code of conduct. But here we have a Minister, Senator Evans, who still stands up and tries to justify his absolutely disgraceful behaviour, and who still has not conceded that there was anything wrong with giving approval to Senator Richardson to phone up the President of another country to seek a special favour for a colleague of Senator Richardson.

          There are large numbers of matters which must be explored but will not be explored till we have a proper inquiry put in place. I suggest that the chances are that in the fullness of time, we will have an inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair. It will not happen today, because of the Australian Democrats, but doubtless as more and more material emerges in this particular area we will find out. We need an inquiry into the ministerial accountability, particularly as demonstrated by Senator Evans; we need an inquiry to look at the astonishing behaviour of the Department of Foreign Affairs in this whole issue, and the astonishing behaviour of some of its officers.

          Much of the behaviour of the Department of Foreign Affairs may be accounted for by the fact that Senator Evans made it very clear—and he confirmed that in his remarks today—that the Department of Foreign Affairs was to avoid at all costs any inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair. We have had a major issue running in this Parliament for some two months now, and not one briefing note on a possible parliamentary question has appeared from the Department of Foreign Affairs on this matter. I believe the Department of Foreign Affairs was, to a certain extent, warned off looking at any element of this Marshall Islands affair.

We want to find out, as Senator Coulter has told this chamber before, why the Department behaved as it did, why the Department did not provide adequate briefing notes on these matters, and why the Department whited out certain briefing notes that were made public. There are a large number of issues which I believe have got to be fully explored.

          One of the questions that was put to Senator Evans the other day was a request from Senator Baden Teague for copies of the transcripts of the Symons court hearing in the Marshall Islands on 14 and 15 May. Senator Evans said, some one month after this event—and I do not dispute what the Department have told him—that these transcripts are not available. But we do have a report of some of the evidence that was put before the court at that time, and this evidence has simply not been covered in this country.

          I invite Senator Coulter to listen to this. This is evidence that was led in the inquiry by Mr Strauss, the lawyer employed by Mr Gregory Symons.

Of course the Government does not want an inquiry; but with their alleged commitment to proper accountability, and with their alleged commitment to proper standards in government, one would have thought the Australian Democrats would have been strong supporters of such a motion.

          Senator Evans knows full well that the full facts of this matter can only emerge when we have a proper inquiry and when we have the opportunity to speak under oath and under parliamentary privilege to officers of the Department to give them a chance to explain whether their Department behaved in a sloppy and incompetent manner in relation to the Marshall Islands affair or whether the Minister was determined not only to hide from the Australian people what was occurring, but also to prevent his Department from looking closely into these matters.

          So there are many issues which must be explored and which will remain to be explored. Why did Senator Evans, for example, agree to Senator Richardson making this phone call? Did he seek any advice from the Department as to the nature of this call? Did he seek advice on the appropriateness of allowing Senator Richardson to make such a request? Was there possibly any other alternative? There is no evidence that having agreed to this astonishing phone call—a phone call which ultimately led to the downfall of Senator Richardson—Senator Evans took any chance to consult his Department on the protocol of the matter. If he had, his Department would have made it very clear to him that it was a very risky and silly thing to do and that the code of conduct of the Department would certainly preclude such behaviour.

          There is no doubt that the Marshall Islands affair has left a volume of unanswered questions. That has generally emerged as a result of the precipitate departure of Senator Richardson.

In fact, that is exactly what Senator Evans said today.

We are not getting an answer. His precipitate departure—defended by the Government as being the action of a man who had done nothing wrong; his resignation was simply to protect the Government from an outrageous and disgraceful set of attacks—raises in itself the very question: if the Government says he has done nothing wrong, what has it got to fear from an inquiry?

          The more the Government protests that Senator Richardson did nothing wrong and his resignation was evidence of nobility rather than culpability, as long as the Government maintains that proposition, I believe it is essential that that proposition be tested. The Government's refusal to test that proposition puts it totally and absolutely in doubt. Senator Coulter's preparedness to go along with the Government over that and to accept by inference the Government's claim that nothing Senator Richardson did was wrong strikes me as absolutely extraordinary. His committee will do nothing to establish the facts of this matter.

          program, Symons did not even need to have Senator Richardson in the country in order to get access to the resources of his ministerial office, because Senator Richardson says he was overseas when the faxes were sent to Suva. He said he only found out about them after the Marshall Islands affair blew up. Of course, we all know about the Multiplex letter which—unwittingly, I believe—told the absolute lie that Chang Jr, one of the Chinese involved in this matter, was going to work for Multiplex in Australia, although there is a question of doubt about the meaning of that letter.

          Another matter that is clear is that surely Senator Evans must have known the significance of Senator Richardson's reference and his phone call. Everyone involved in this affair agrees that the letter of reference that Senator Richardson wrote for Mr Symons had a big effect on the Marshall Islands Government's decision to help Mr Symons initially. It is clear that the fact that Senator Richardson was backing him was very important indeed. In fact, Michael Bonney, who was also conned by Mr Symons, said that it was certainly one of the major factors in his credibility for the undertaking of such a project. It was not just Mr Bonney, the ABC said, who was impressed with Mr Symons's credentials, especially the personal reference from Senator Graham Richardson. It is clear the personal reference played a key role in the Marshall Island Government's decision to allow the whole venture to go ahead. But nowhere in that reference is there any mention of the string of Symons business failures or his near bankruptcy.

         —This is the last day when Bruce Webster will be the senior announcer of the parliamentary broadcasting network. Bruce will be retiring from the ABC after a stint at the Olympic Games in Barcelona, where he will be studio anchorman and also commentator on the opening and closing ceremonies. That is not new to him: he worked with ABC radio at the Melbourne Olympics also.

         In his early work with the ABC, Bruce served in Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland as a broadcaster. In fact, he was the regional manager of the ABC in Cairns. One interesting story about Bruce relates to his time in Cairns. A local journalist with the ABC took ill and a replacement was sent from Brisbane. This replacement was very critical of the standard of news copy and the standard of stories on ABC radio in Cairns and he decided to do something about it. He was a pretty objectionable character, by all reports, but he fell into a trap well and truly set for him by Bruce.

         The new, hot-shot journalist from Brisbane got a really good tip that there was a dinghy missing in Torres Strait and he was given a telephone number for the fishing board, which it was expected would have further information. The new journo from Brisbane thought that this would be a terrific story. It would have not only local interest but, obviously, State and national interest as well. He contacted the telephone number that was given to him for the fishing board, and the story was confirmed by a gentlemen at the fishing board, in a very heavy southern European accent. The new journalist thought he had really something to go on with and things were looking pretty good, until someone in the ABC in Cairns suggested he take it a bit easy because no-one knew of anyone with a heavy southern European accent working for the fishing board in Cairns. He was told to check with the fishing board.

He was very highly critical of this journalist and how he brought his profession into disrepute. At the end of that conversation the journalist turned round and found Bruce Webster laughing behind him. The phone number he had been given was Bruce's home phone number. I understand that there was no more nonsense from that hot-shot journo in Cairns.

         After that, he became active in parliamentary politics, and on 8 February 1975 he won the Pittwater by-election in Sydney, following the resignation of the former Premier, Robin Askin. He did it with a pretty solid 63 per cent of the primary vote in the State seat of Pittwater. He was re-elected in the 1976 general election—that was when the Wran Government was first elected—suffering a very small swing of 1.8 per cent, but being re-elected with 61.2 per cent of the primary vote. I can recall at that time, as a young activist in the ALP, being very concerned about Bruce Webster's promotion in the Liberal Party. He had by then become the shadow Minister for Mines and Energy. There were problems with the leadership in the New South Wales Liberal Party. Many of us thought that Bruce Webster would be a very likely prospective leadership contender for the Liberal Party and might well have been very dangerous indeed for New South Wales Labor, if he had accepted that role.

         What in fact occurred is that Bruce Webster basically loathed parliamentary politics, and the conflict that went with it. He found himself, he said to me, in a state of constant conflict, and that is at all levels: conflict in the Party, conflict in the Parliament, conflict in his own electorate and conflict in his own electorate conference. After what turned out to be a very short parliamentary career, Bruce decided to resign. He was not happy and he gave it away. As most people sitting in this chamber know, it is very unusual in Australian politics for someone to resign after a fairly short parliamentary career in a safe constituency for their Party. He did that. Very few of his parliamentary colleagues had any knowledge that he was going to do that, when he decided to resign just before the 1978 State election. I think for Bruce it may well have all been summed up by him receiving from his electorate conference as a farewell gift a little model of a square peg in a round hole.

         He had no regrets about his resignation from parliament, but it did give him a unique insight into the institution of Parliament and, of course, unique knowledge of how it worked. He had only a very short period active in party politics, a very brief fling indeed, and only a comparatively short time as a member of the Liberal Party, in fact. But he has remained very active in terms of his community service since giving parliamentary politics away.

         He had a brief stint as news director for 2UE in Sydney from 1978 to 1979, and went back to the ABC in 1979. In 1986 he transferred to Canberra as the senior parliamentary broadcaster, and he set about attempting to make the parliamentary broadcasts a great deal more relevant and more interesting than they had been, which, I must say, is no mean task, because when someone like myself makes a speech like this, the parliamentary broadcasters can say very little except perhaps, `Senator Faulkner, Labor, New South Wales'. Of course, they come into their own during divisions. Bruce's record at the moment is 12 divisions on the trot in the House of Representatives when he has had to keep commentary up. In fact, he fronts Question Time on television and has kept a commentary going there for some 47 minutes, which is no mean feat, as I think everyone would know.

We had an intake of six new Guides and I asked Bruce if he could brief them for two hours on the institution of Parliament, not knowing that he was taking leave. As always in his usual very helpful manner he delayed his departure to spend the time with them and give them the most encouraging welcome anyone could expect on commencing a new job, apart from of course giving them a tour of the building that very few people ever get to see and passing on his vast knowledge of Parliament.

Sadly, I hope not uncharitably, I believe it is true to say that his view of our history is a very unique view, and sometimes I suspect that he may even be trying to rewrite our history. But be that as it may, I think he has perhaps not gone far enough back into history to look at the question of the Australian flag. I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to make sure that some of his colleagues tell him a little more history than he knows already.

         , which is still a venerable paper today I am glad to say, was a very keen proponent of the ending of convict transportation. He got like-minded people together in Launceston, a very small provincial town at that time, and formed the Anti-Transportation League. As part of that—this is 1849—the Reverend John West designed a flag for the Anti-Transportation League. That flag was produced by the needlecraft of the ladies of Launceston, and it was used in lectures all over Australia.

         In 1851 the delegates from Van Diemen's Land went to Melbourne for the second inter-colonial conference of colonists, and it was then called the Australasian Anti-transportation League. The delegates to that conference in Melbourne were so taken with Reverend John West's flag that the women of Melbourne made a copy of the flag which had been embroidered in Launceston. At that time there were five of the colonies in the League. It was called the Australasian League for a very good reason: New Zealand was one of the colonies, as were Van Diemen's Land, Victoria, New South Wales—which still had Queensland as part of it at that time—and, I think, South Australia. Those five colonies were represented on the flag designed by Reverend John West.

This is the one that was made by the ladies in Melbourne in 1851, but it was an exact copy of the one made by the ladies of Launceston in 1849. You can see the Southern Cross, and each of those stars of the Southern Cross represented one of the colonies involved in the Australasian Anti-Transportation League.

         Many copies of that flag were produced and, interestingly, it was flown on inter-colonial schooners trading between the colonies for some time. The motto of members of the League was `The Australians are one'. Their flag was described by them as a tangible symbol of unity and was adopted as their flag at that Melbourne conference in 1851. It has since been claimed that it was the forerunner, both of the Victorian flag and eventually of the Australian flag. The interesting thing is—this is the lesson that is to be learned from this little story—that the purpose of the League was not only to end transportation but also to cement the ties between the colonies, and to produce some form of government, in those colonies, in which the colonists would have complete political power. They claimed that they were intent on removing the misrule of Downing Street; they wanted to get rid of the misrule of Downing Street.

         The push for independence that this League started in 1849 demonstrated an independence of spirit which has been part of our history since that time. For over 100 years, nearly 150 years, we Australians, in our various colonies and then States, have been demonstrating an independence of spirit. A battle first of all with Britain, which sent convicts to Australia, and then a battle to achieve representative government in the colonies. We have all taken that independence for granted until, just recently, we find we have a Prime Minister who tells us that we have never been independent.

The sudden craze to get rid of a flag which is based on this flag, which has its origins in this flag, is a nonsense. That flag demonstrates beyond any shadow of a doubt that we have had an independent spirit. That flag is an integral part of our history.

That has been the way of it in this country for 150 years. It is a nonsense to try to produce a diversion now based on the flag. I hope that he will learn a little bit of history from the flag produced by the ladies of Launceston.

         I want to speak briefly today about a related matter which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has raised for public debate: whether Australia should move towards a republic. I pointed out in this chamber that within the ranks of the republican movement there is fairly substantial division. We do not actually know what sort of republican constitution the Prime Minister supports. All we know is that he does not support the Constitution which has carried us through 92 years, probably making Australia the world's oldest continuous democracy. We know that he does not support our current Constitution; we do not know as yet what sort of republican constitution he supports.

         There is some division in the ranks of the republicans. There are those who adopt the minimalist position. In other words, they want to leave the Constitution as far as practicable in its current form but remove references to the monarch. These people I would classify as following the general views of Mr Thomas Keneally. There are quite a number—for example, Donald Horne—who have said that they really want what they would describe as a full revamping of the Constitution. We can wonder as to what form this huge revamp would take; there are some who would prefer an American type constitution and some who have other views. There are tensions within the republican movement and as this debate continues it is quite possible that we will find further fractures appearing amongst the republicans over what sort of Constitution they want to support.

         It is an interesting thing that so often, in these debates between one's heart and one's head, the heart seems to rule the head—particularly in politics. If there is any value at all in this debate which has emerged, it will require the rational, practical reasons to be laid out before the Australian public. Those views will have to be forcefully expressed. One of Australia's great achievements, to my mind, is its Constitution. I find it a bit obscure why an academic has suddenly adopted the view that we should overturn what is by all accounts a well functioning constitution. It is not a perfect constitution, and certainly it is a constitution which has some problems, but it is a constitution that has served this country particularly well and a constitution which is worthy of strong support.

         Professor Winterton in his article said that it demonstrates how an Australian republic could be implemented while leaving intact all the essential features of Australian government except the monarchy. Two features of the minimalist position need to be clearly identified. First, even the minimalist proposal involves a substantial rewriting of the Constitution. Certainly a glance at the draft constitution put forward by Professor Winterton reveals the extent of changes that must be made to our current Constitution. Second, it is incorrect to say that it is possible to remove the position of the monarchy and the role of the Governor-General from our Constitution and have our system of government remain unchanged, as Professor Winterton asserts. Even the position advocated by him will have significant ramifications for the Australian system of government.

         There are essentially three major problems with the position put forward by Professor Winterton. The first is that Professor Winterton fails to deal with a central question in a republic, how the substitute head of state is to be chosen. Every possible method for choosing a substitute head of state raises serious problems. A directly elected president could rightly claim more authority than the Prime Minister of the day, and could upset our system of government by seeking to exercise that authority contrary to the conventions applying to the Crown and the Governor-General under our current arrangements. An indirectly elected president—elected, for example, by the Parliament—would likely be the product of a backroom political deal resulting in the selection of a party hack or an innocuous identity.

         —Okay, the press got it wrong. The second serious problem that emerges from Professor Winterton's proposal is the question of how to make a president subject to the conventions which apply to the Crown and the Governor-General. These conventions, which underpin our constitutional arrangements, are well understood and fairly well established. They provide a flexible yet certain framework within which our institutions function. Indeed, they are an essential element of Australia's constitutional system.

         By their very nature, these conventions derive their authority from the Crown. With the removal of the Crown, all these conventions will not necessarily survive, particularly when an elected politician is substituted as head of state for the monarch and the Governor-General. As Professor Cheryl Saunders, Professor of Law at the University of Melbourne, has observed, there is no point in removing all references to the Queen and leaving a vacuum in the Constitution. At that point, Professor Saunders says, we are in total chaos.

         The third, and equally serious, question relates to the position of the monarch in each of the Australian States. Each State is a constitutional monarchy in its own right, with its own link to the Crown. Unless the republicans are unconcerned about having an anomalous situation in which Australia is a republic federally while some or all of the States choose to remain constitutional monarchies, they will certainly have to address this problem. I can draw attention to the dangers of that process by citing a remark made by a gentleman who is head of the Australian Republican Party and who was quoted in the press as saying that it is possible that the move to a republic would lead to the secession of States. As Senator Walters is here in the chamber, I point out that the ARP spokesman suggested that Tasmania would be the first State to secede.

What other country in the world would overturn a successful working constitution for totally spurious benefits in an attempt to settle once and for all an old world debate?

         This debate as to whether we should move to a republic or retain our current Constitution is not a reflection of Australian concerns. Senator Ray, who is a great student of the political process, would know that in all the surveys of what concerns Australians most—and I have been following those surveys for 20 years—there has never been any concern expressed by Australians about their Constitution or about their flag.

         —Senator Ray, in an interesting way, has actually confirmed my comment that there has been no concern expressed. The people certainly have concerns about the Keating Government—there is no question of that—but they have expressed no concerns about the Constitution or about the flag. This is a totally contrived debate which has been brought before the Australian public by Mr Keating, and it really harks back to some views that have their roots in the old world rather than in the new world.

         I would like, in the time available to me, to look briefly at Professor Winterton's solution to the problem of how we may incorporate all the constitutional conventions which govern the workings of our Constitution actually in a constitution. Professor Winterton's draft attempts to overcome this problem, which is, I repeat, the problem of confining the role of the President to the conventional role of the Governor-General, by writing that role into the Constitution and then, to avoid giving it constitutional rigidity, by providing that that role may be changed by ordinary legislation passed by the Federal Parliament.

         It is here that the draft of Professor Winterton gives rise to potentially the greatest problems. Proposed new section 60A provides that the President is to exercise and perform his powers and functions in accordance with the constitutional conventions relating to the Governor-General, but then goes on to provide that these constitutional conventions do not have the force of law.

         A constitution, however, as you will know, Madam Acting Deputy President, is the supreme law of the country. One would have to ask, if the conventions under Professor Winterton's proposal do not have the force of law, what purpose is served by referring to them in this way. The section proposed by Professor Winterton is an empty section and, in consequence, when exercising a proposed legislative power, the Parliament would be filling a legal vacuum. The proposed new section 51(xi) would allow the Parliament to legislate concerning `the exercise of any power vested by this Constitution in the President, the President-in-Council or any other person or authority exercising executive power of the Commonwealth'. This provision would allow the Federal Parliament, which means any party or combination of parties with a majority in both Houses, to alter the Constitution in the most radical way, by ordinary legislation without a referendum.

         The brief remarks that I have made in this chamber suggest that very real problems will emerge if the proposal floated by Mr Keating is proceeded with. It will cause great division in the Australian community. That would not worry Mr Keating. He is probably the most divisive Prime Minister that this country has had. Whatever faults may be attributed to Mr Hawke, and I have attributed a few in my time, I feel that Mr Hawke would certainly have avoided such a divisive act. Australia has a successfully working constitution, and it is surprising that academics such as Professor Winterton see the need to overturn a document that has served this country well.

Our media roles overlapped for many of the years that he was in New South Wales in the media in some distinguished roles which Senator Faulkner mentioned in his speech. We were certainly contemporaries in the media in the 1950s and 1960s. He did very well in that area. His social conscience has been evident in a lot of the activities that he has carried on. For example, his spirit of community service prompted him to spend 15 years with the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, and he has been heavily involved in the scouting movement. Those feelings of community service prompted him to go into State Parliament as the member for Pittwater.

         First, we must avoid the common fallacy of supposing that freedom and discipline are inconsistent. It was that rugged thinker, Jeremy Bentham, who said that the mark of a good citizen was `to censure freely and to obey punctually'. The notion is, after all, not a complex one. The discipline we must look for is not the discipline of the slave, but the discipline of the volunteer. Such discipline does not take the form of a compulsory obedience to a higher authority, but is based upon an intelligent understanding of the fact that order and sanity are essential if the liberty of the individual is to be reconciled with the rights of other individuals. For many people, the desire for freedom appears to connote an impatience of government or, at the very least, an indifference to government. Such a view is among the deadliest enemies of liberty, for the responsible individual, not the irresponsible individual, is the real basis of a truly free society.

         My protest is against that false humanitarianism which does not strengthen but corrupts; which does not rest upon the view that I am my brother's keeper, a view which is the noblest embodiment of the Christian philosophy, but rests upon the belief that my brother should be my keeper, and that I should leave my troubles to him. The protection of the poor and the weak, and the elimination of the causes of poverty and weakness are undoubtedly the supreme business of politics. One can recognise that without in any way ceasing to insist that the first duty of every man is to do his utmost to stand on his own feet, to form his own judgments, and to accept his own responsibilities.

        That speech, as Bruce said at the time, summed up his view of individual rights and that, of course, naturally explains why Bruce Webster felt such a strong commitment to the concept of parliament. It was in his role here, after he had decided that being a member of the parliament was not for him, that he was able to express or to give effective substance to those views he had of the importance of the parliamentary system, the significance, or the utmost role—the major role, of course—that individual freedom must play in any democracy, and the role of the parliament in preserving that democracy.

         I must say that Bruce Webster has been consistent to those principles with absolute fairness. As Senator Faulkner noted, he has been fair. There is no question of political attitudes intruding at any stage in Bruce Webster's role here in the Parliament. Underneath it all, there is the evident view of the primacy of the rights of the individual. For that I commend Bruce Webster.

         It was because of my longstanding friendship with him that, when he was the member for Pittwater in the New South Wales Parliament, he opened my first electorate office in Campbelltown in 1975 when I was elected the member for Macarthur. Bruce, as was his wont, travelled to Campbelltown on his motorbike; a clear view that the adornments of status were not for him. I do not know whether many other members of parliament would have decided that they should travel as perhaps many of their constituents could only travel, and that was by motorbike.

         Bruce was never one to lord it over anyone else, no matter what his role, no matter that he was in some instances, for example, in an executive position in the media. Bruce was a man of the people because he believed in people. I am overjoyed that, during his time in the parliaments, both as a member and as someone in a key role in the Parliament communicating itself to the people, Bruce Webster has always remained a man of the people concerned with the rights of the people. I hope that in his retirement from this job he finds another satisfying way of expressing his belief in the rights of Australians and in the principles of freedom that he has espoused all his life.

I was asked to withdraw that and I refused to do so. After a lengthy debate across the chamber, I was finally named and a division was called. Because it was very late at night and the Labor members had all gone home, we won the division. The Government was defeated. There was a lot of discussion of what should take place and whether this was the first time such a thing had ever occurred. Bruce Webster was ahead of us all. He had already told his listeners that a similar occurrence had taken place a long while earlier, when Senator Willesee had been at the centre of a similar defeat of the government of the day. Such are the powers of recall that Bruce is so lucky to have.

Those 18 years included 10 months BBC training and 18 months in Cairns as a regional manager. While in Cairns he founded the still thriving Cairns Little Theatre.

         —I rise today in this public interest debate with two matters which I wish to put on the public record. Last week this chamber, under the rush of the guillotine, debated cognately four Bills: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bills (No. 2) and (No. 3), the Pooled Development Funds Bill and the Development Allowance Authority Bill. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), together with the tax Bill on self-assessment, were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on Friday 5 June, before the second reading stage. The rush through the House of Representatives was most unfortunate, and reported on at the time.

         I mention that today because the time span to gather material meant that the possibility of inviting witnesses to that Committee debate was greatly diminished. However, despite this, the impact of the infrastructure borrowing as portrayed by clauses 34, 35 and 36 and the opportunities that provided in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) was such that the Opposition was contacted by a number of industry sources with concerns and, in some part, with enthusiasm. They contacted the Chairman of the Finance and Public Administration Committee and requested to appear as witnesses at the Committee hearings. Due to time constraints of the hearing and the unfortunate appearance of extremely heavy fog in Canberra on 5 June, which prevented the plane bringing the witnesses from Melbourne to Canberra from landing for several hours, the witnesses were unable to appear before the Committee until 12.30 of the day of the hearing. Although it had been scheduled to finish at 12.30, the hearing was extended by leave. We are grateful to Senator McMullan for that extension. But because of the time constraint, time was not available from the Government in respect of the issues raised.

        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1992 LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I appreciated the opportunity of appearing as a witness before the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 5 June 1992 during its deliberations on the provisions of clauses 34, 35 and 36 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 3) 1992 dealing with infrastructure borrowings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The major thrust of my submission was that the Bill should be amended so that Limited Partnerships would be able to utilise infrastructure borrowings for the purpose of financing the three specified forms of infrastructure facilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An issue central to the acceptability of Limited Partnerships having a role as the owner and controller of an infrastructure facility is that they should not be able to be used in a way which would cause a loss of revenue to the Treasury in excess of the loss which would be occasioned by the proposed provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I submitted that there would not be any material loss to revenue (and potentially, no loss) if limited partnerships were to be compromised only of entities which were taxable as companies under the income tax law. It was unfortunate that a detailed report I had prepared in support of that view could not be presented to the Committee due to time constraints.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That report provides a comparative analysis of the taxation issues which arise under the traditional forms of ownership of major projects which would be suitable for private investment and transport and electricity generating infrastructure facilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It concludes that the availability of deductions under the income tax law (and therefore the potential to impact the revenue) to an unincorporated joint venture of limited liability companies would be no different if a major project was owned by a limited partnership comprising companies limited by shares. A joint venture comprising limited liability companies is one of the most common forms of undertaking a major project to be owned and operated by several participants. It facilitates the agreement of the sharing of the commercial risks and benefits of a project between the parties and its financing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I understand that it is the view of the Australian Taxation Office that members of limited partnerships whose liability is limited under the provisions of the partnership agreement would, if limited partnerships were permitted, be able to share in the losses of the partnership in excess of their capital contribution and therefore in excess of the risks that they are assuming by that capital contribution. The point can be made that the same result could arise under an unincorporated joint venture structure. As there is no greater impact on the revenue, this is not a valid ground for excluding limited partnerships from consideration.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A further view of the Taxation Office is apparently that limited partners do not participate in the management of a limited partnership and are therefore similar to shareholders in a company. Accordingly, as the issuer of a direct infrastructure borrowing must meet the test of intending to "own, operate and effectively control the use of, the facilities on which the money will be spent", a limited partnership must fail this test because a limited partner is not in a position to exercise effective control and is not exposed to the risks associated with ownership.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Such a proposition fails to recognise the commercial basis under which a limited partnership would be formed where each potential partner would have a real interest in negotiating the appointment of the general partner (whose liability is unlimited), the level of partnership capital, funding etc.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposition also fails to recognise that major project financings are generally undertaken on a non-recourse or very limited recourse basis where project risk is mostly taken by the financiers particularly having regard to the commercial viability and cash flow certainty of a project.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Taxation Office arguments are all the more difficult to accept when it is recognised that the effect of an infrastructure borrowing by a limited partnership, because of the non-tax deductibility of the interest, will be to increase the taxable income or decrease the loss of the partnership which will be borne by the limited partners.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The policy of the One Nation initiatives on infrastructure borrowings is intended to permit the loss to the revenue to fall on the providers of finance under an infrastructure funds facility. That policy objective would be met if a limited partnership was able to issue infrastructure borrowings. No additional loss, which could have an impact on the revenue, is capable of being created.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senators will recognise that there are many complex commercial and financial issues involved in the determination of the best structure available to own and finance an infrastructure facility. Taxation is but one of these. It is submitted that if it can be demonstrated that there is no greater impact on the revenue than would be the case under alternative structures that would meet the tests of eligibility to issue infrastructure borrowings, then there is no policy reason why a commercially acceptable limited partnership should be excluded. I believe that I can demonstrate the validity of that submission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If Australia is to continue to encourage overseas equity participation and funding for its major developments we must be able to demonstrate that we can achieve "world best practice" in this area.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Limited partnerships are accepted in a number of Australian States and in many developed countries, including the United States of America, as an appropriate entity for carrying on a business.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our taxation laws should not preclude the use of this form of business undertaking. In fact, limited partnerships have been recognised as an acceptable business entity for taxation purposes since various Australian States introduced their respective legislative regimes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I believe that limited partnerships should be permitted to issue infrastructure borrowings, and that I can demonstrate that not only will there be no or minimal impact on revenue, but there will be greater efficiencies in the structuring, ownership and funding of major projects in Australia.

         The second matter I wish to raise is also connected with the debates surrounding the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3). In the week preceding the Committee hearings my attention was drawn to an article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         describing the retrospective effect of the amendment to clause 73B of the Income Tax Assessment Act on the eligibility for the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development. The Opposition contacted Mr Graeme Carew of Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu, the source of the article, requesting some further information. This material was presented at the Committee hearings and was tested with the Taxation Office. Unfortunately, Mr Carew, the only one with intimate knowledge of the matters to hand, was not present.

         Later in the debate the Government gave a further reply to the concerns raised during the Committee hearings but, on this occasion, a response was made in the chamber and, once again, Mr Carew did not get the opportunity to explain his position. I am most concerned that the natural course of justice, of which we are proud, and rightly so, should prevail in this chamber, and that Mr Carew be given the opportunity of responding.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I refer to comments made by Senator McMullan before the Senate Committee on Finance and Public Administration on Friday 5 June 1992 in respect of my strong objections to the retrospective amendment of section 73B of the Income Tax Assessment Act.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Senator McMullan expressed puzzlement that Deloitte had not written to the Government or the Taxation Office in respect of the amendment. He also said that we should have made it known that we had a client that was adversely affected by the proposed amendment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Let me take that first issue. By the time that the amendment was able to be examined, the Government had already guillotined the Bill through the lower House. Our advice was that the legislation was already scheduled for similar summary treatment through the Senate. With all respect to Senator McMullan, my long period of serving Governments of both sides whilst holding senior positions in the Taxation Office has seen very few occasions where a Government has reacted favourably to concerns expressed by professional advisers. I did not expect it to do so on this occasion. Hence, the only opportunity to have the retrospectivity denied was to apply to those parties who could have the power and the willingness to do that, that is the Coalition and Democrats. Accordingly, I did so and, quite correctly, Senators Short and Watson took up the issue ultimately with no success.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Secondly, the Taxation Office was fully aware of the strategic effect of the amendment upon a case involving one of my clients. On the day before the Senate Committee's hearing, Mr Hood rang me in Albury to discuss the case. It is a matter of fact that he and I are in accord that my client will ultimately succeed despite the amendment. My concern with the retrospectivity is not because I believe that my client will be denied their claim by the change to the law, but that the Industry Research and Development Board (IRDB), which had threatened that they would seek to have the law retrospectively amended to justify the disallowance of the claim, will cite the amendment as grounds for disallowance. This will put my client back to the same position as it was 3 years ago when the process of appeal against a previous decision of the IRDB began, with continued costs of pursuing that claim which we and others (including it seems Mr
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Hood) regard as legitimate. The tactical advantage claimed to have been taken away by Mr Hood is not one that we have ever argued or considered arguable, rather it is one that we believe has been presented to the IRDB by the amendment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the light of the above observations I regard Senator McMullan's comments which infer that Deloitte acted improperly in not advising the Government and the Taxation Office of the position to be quite inappropriate.

This Bill represents the next logical step in that process.

        —by leave—I should like to associate myself with the felicitations that have been extended to Bruce Webster on his retirement, this being his last day in association with the direct broadcast of parliamentary proceedings. Bruce has seen many changes in the time that he has been with the Parliament in that capacity. He was a member of the New South Wales Parliament and he has had quite a varied and interesting career. I believe that, as a parliament, we have been well served by Bruce Webster, both in the radio broadcast medium and in the television broadcast medium. I wish Bruce and his wife and family a very happy retirement.

        I am sure that Bruce will not entirely retire. No doubt he has many stories to put down in writing. If not, I certainly would like to see organisations throughout Australia invite Bruce Webster as a guest speaker. I am sure they would find him most interesting and it would help in understanding of the workings of the Parliament as well.

        While I am on my feet I would like to mention—he would not want me to do it, but I have the last say—that my Principal Private Secretary will be leaving me on Friday next week. Denis Strangman, I think, has the distinction of being the longest serving staffer of any honourable senator or member currently serving in this place. There may well be persons who have served longer in the parliamentary departments. He has served people in this Parliament as a staffer for a total of 26 years. He has an extraordinary breadth of knowledge and, indeed, is an extraordinary person. His knowledge of the Public Service, coupled with his knowledge of the operations of this place, is unique. He has served me and the Parliament extremely well.

        He is going back to the department from which he was seconded to my staff 17 years ago. He has written and studied extensively in the area of parliamentary archives. He has written a most interesting journal article, which is longer than the essays that I have normally been associated with, on the archival records of the Parliament. It is very interesting indeed. People may like to get hold of it. The Clerks would know whether one is able to get hold of it yet. Likewise, he has published a bibliography on race walking. He has also written local histories of various other parts of Australia, including dabbling in the history of the area from which the Deputy Clerk of the Senate comes. I take the opportunity to thank him publicly for the service that he has rendered to me and to thank him particularly on behalf of all of those who are connected with the Senate.

         The Democrats are supporting this legislation. We believe that the legislation is the beginning of the end of a long period of abusive behaviour by two Commonwealth corporations, Australia Post and AOTC, towards their compensable employees. Hitherto, neither Australia Post nor AOTC has been subject to the jurisdiction of Comcare when interpreting or administering the provisions of the Comcare Act, and they have used certain of its provisions to justify video surveillance, phone tapping, doctor shopping and harsh and arbitrary rulings. They have gloated about the number of long term compensation claimants they have managed to remove from their books by unfairly denying their claims. Neither the claimants nor the Minister have had the means, apart from moral suasion, to seek redress.

         My colleague Senator Robert Bell has raised this matter many times in this place and has been active in ensuring that Democrat concerns about this issue will be addressed by this Bill. In his absence, I wish to reiterate his view and the view of all Democrats that it is imperative that the powers of the Commission are fully and properly exercised in relation to the licensing function. We have asked the Government to give an undertaking that the Commission will make it a condition of any licence that Comcare itself will be an arbiter in any complaint made by a claimant about a delegated authority, and that this avenue of appeal will not prejudice any later appeal to the AAT.

         We have also asked that the Commission award licences on a State branch basis to ensure that Comcare can more directly and closely monitor the performance of those States where the greatest number of problems have been identified. The powers given to the Commission under the licensing arrangements are considerable and wide ranging and will, we hope, resolve many of the problems that some claimants have suffered hitherto.

Why did the Minister mislead the Senate by stating this sum when the gross rental on the completion of the building has been calculated to be around $386 per square metre per annum, calculated in accordance with the agreement for lease entered into by the Commonwealth?

         —This is what one could call a rather curious question. The Senate has addressed this issue on a number of occasions. The first occasion on which it was raised, I think, was in a press statement by Senator Parer on 16 January this year. A couple of weeks ago we spent a few afternoons and nights on this issue. In the context of those discussions in this place, questions were asked and copious documents were tabled both by me and by Senator McMullan.

         During those debates it was made very clear by me and by Senator McMullan—in fact, it was stressed quite consistently by the Opposition—that the point went to the actual level of rent. We made clear that the rental agreement provided for—I must apologise because the precise details are not here; I will go on my memory—$280 per square metre per annum, plus $42.88, I think, per square metre per annum which would also be by way of costs that would have to be incurred by the Australian National Audit Office.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As part of the agreement, as part of the documents tabled, and as part of the answers that I gave and that Senator McMullan gave, it was acknowledged quite clearly that there were mechanisms in the lease to ensure that there was an increase of rental in accordance with those mechanisms. The point that Senator Parer made at the start was that when Audit actually went into the building there would already have been an increase in the level of rent it would have to pay. That was acknowledged both by me and by Senator McMullan. So $322 per square metre per annum is the ab initio amount in the lease and, as I say, mechanisms are in the lease documents and the agreement for lease to provide for increases. Whether or not that takes it to $386 per square metre per annum, I do not know, but if it is in accordance with the mechanism that is provided in the lease it is $386 per square metre per annum.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In regard to those mechanisms in the lease—I can anticipate a supplementary coming on—they provide for a certain rate of increase for the first period. There would then be a review after four years of the percentage of increase that is in the lease, and thereafter, after nine years, those rates of increase would once again be reviewed, but reviewed not less than the amount that is in the lease.

         So, what are those amounts and how were they arrived at? I need to go to this because it is important. Those amounts range from between 9 per cent and about 10.5 per cent. As I say, I have not got the precise figures. What I do say is that those figures that were entrenched in the agreement are within—

         —Senator Bishop refers to the commercial nature of the proposition; my answer goes very much to the commercial nature of the whole deal and the proposition. As I said, it was available to all. Fourteen consortia tendered for it and, of those 14, this particular one was accepted. One reason why it was accepted was that, pursuant to report No. 496, I think, of the Public Accounts Committee, the Auditor-General was encouraged to find premises in the Parliamentary Triangle. This was a good proposition within the Parliamentary Triangle.

         In terms of the rent, I made it very clear in my first answer to Senator Bishop that there was a mechanism applying to rent ab initio—from the date of the lease to the date of occupation—and mechanisms to increase it thereafter. In terms of its commercial nature, the land was bought by the Labor Party from the ACT Government when Chief Minister Kaine was in occupation. He sold the land to the Labor Party. The Labor Party paid $1.7m for it, plus another half a million dollars, which Trevor Kaine ensured was incurred by the Labor Party, for offsite works in relation to that land. An all-up price of $2.2m was paid for this land. The proposition was handled without interference by government and it was entered into by those responsible for it.

While it is simply not possible to predict the outcome of those deliberations, I can at least assure Senator Coates that Cabinet is well aware of the Labor Party platform's objective to move from our present ODA to GNP ratio of 0.36 per cent to a ratio of 0.4 per cent by 1995.

         The international target of 0.7 per cent in the ODA to GNP ratio was reaffirmed recently at UNCED in view of the pressing need to support sustainable development in developing countries. The Government does remain committed to this target. However, the speed with which we can move towards 0.7 per cent depends very much on economic performance and the budgetary realities. I will certainly be ensuring that the merits of additional funding for the aid program are put before Cabinet and certainly hope that an increase will be possible. Would that I were in a position to give Senator Coates a guarantee of the kind that he asks for.

         We have to acknowledge the competing pressures on the Budget. It will be difficult to balance the priorities within a pretty tight environment. In that respect, a spectacular contrast will still be evident between whatever outcome we produce and the Opposition's policy on the aid program. The Opposition does quite unashamedly intend to pillage the aid program in order to fund its GST package. It  plans—it is quite articulately stated in the public record—to slash $200m from the aid program: $154m in the first year and a further $55m in the second year. Based on this year's aid budget, such cuts would see our ODA to GNP ratio nosedive.

         What Senator Tate has generally been commenting on is the ramifications of a particular decision by the Australian Defence Force, me and Minister Bilney in terms of our international obligations. I am not going to close my mind to those; I have my own interpretation of them. I have looked at it very carefully. I am sufficiently convinced that the decision that both Mr Bilney and I made was properly based in international law. Many other signatories to that agreement have made absolutely the same decision; the UK through to the US through to New Zealand have made the same decision.

         —The Federal Government's responsibilities for providing commercial and safety services to the shipping industry are discharged by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Since the Authority's establishment on 1 January last year, as part of the maritime reform program by Senator Collins, it has been highly successful in enhancing the efficiency and containing the costs of its services. In line with the Government's cost recovery policy, the Authority's commercial shipping services will be fully cost recovered from the industry by 1993-94 rather than subsidised from the taxpayers' pocket.

         The Authority administers three levies applied to commercial shipping to fund most of its activities. They are the maritime navigation levy, which maintains the network of maritime or marine navigation aids around the Australian coast; the oil pollution levy, which provides for oil pollution prevention and recovery measures; and the maritime regulatory levy, which recovers the costs of regulatory and survey functions, including inspection of foreign ships trading to Australia.

         Last year the Authority was able to offset the introduction of the new regulatory levy by a reduction in its navigation levy. This meant that all levies and charges overall were held constant in money terms. This year the Authority will again reduce its levies and charges from 1 July. A change to the levy structure will result in some 3,500 of the 4,000 merchant ships that visit Australian ports each year having their levies reduced. Meanwhile, the levy rate on the remaining 500 ships will remain unchanged.

         This represents a multimillion dollar saving for the commercial shipping industry. The Authority estimates that the shipping industry will have saved about $9m in reduced levies and charges over its 2 1/2-year lifetime to the end of the next financial year. The new levy structure will particularly benefit Australia's exports as large bulk carriers which ship most of Australia's mineral and bulk farm trade will have their levy charges cut by several thousands of dollars per quarter. In addition, the Authority will be making a 17 per cent reduction in its fee-for-service charges for ship survey, design and certification work, which will make its regulatory charges extremely competitive with those of other countries.

         —The last question is predicated on an answer to the first question being yes. The Government does not propose to introduce lower wages and a subsidy for young unemployed. The Government wants to carry through the recommendations of the Carmichael report, which is to take wages for young workers away from wages being determined by their age to a wage based on their competency, their skill and experience, and their time spent in productive work. Under this new system, wage determination will therefore be a combination of those three things: competency, skill and experience; and time spent in productive work. More importantly, the more training young workers undertake as a consequence of this, the higher the qualifications they will obtain and in terms of the competency and skills component of the wage structure, the higher their wage will be as well. We think it is a repositioning of wages and a recognition of the skill and training component to fuel the need in this economy for a highly skilled work force and for young workers to be given access to that sort of training.

         It is not a situation, which is characterised more obviously by the Opposition's approach, of simply reducing youth wages. This is a high wage scenario; we are not into a low wage scenario. Unlike the Opposition, we are not in a situation of wanting to slash youth wages and create an underclass of working poor who will then be picked up as cheap labour and displace more mature workers in the work force in the more menial or labour oriented tasks. In order to ensure that that is not the case, there will be a floor. The floor will be based on the level of Austudy and will be paid by the Government. If the award rate is lower than the floor wage, we will make up the difference between the award rate and the floor wage.

         . John Stone, who is a former member of this place and the coalition, is, of course, advocating that we follow the New Zealand model. Under the New Zealand model there is no minimum wage at all for young workers—none whatsoever. Under the direct contract bargaining system in New Zealand, if an employer proposes to a young worker a wage lower than the dole—bearing in mind there are unemployed people ready to take that young worker's place—and the young worker refuses to accept it, that young worker can be dismissed and is not then eligible for unemployment benefit for six months. That is the bargaining position in New Zealand. It is a low wage, exploitative bargaining position and it is certainly not one that we will follow.

         I also do not know from where the sudden paranoia has developed on the front bench of the Opposition to foreign equity in terms of sales of anything in Australia. The Government is proposing to allow Qantas to do what any airline in the world has to do in order to survive; that is, to form firm alliances with other airlines. That is precisely what the  Government proposal does. That is a world trend now which is well entrenched and accelerating. Any airline which wants to succeed in what is cutthroat competition in this industry has to form alliances with other airlines or die.

         The letter from Mr Beale claimed that the Government would be selling off the airlines to overseas interests and forgetting about the Australian public and the employees of the airlines. Of course, the Government is not doing anything of the sort. In the proposed sale of 100 per cent of Qantas, at least 65 per cent of the shares will be available to Australian shareholders. Sensible opportunities will remain, which I can tell honourable senators Qantas is extremely anxious to take up, of forming alliances within that minority percentage with overseas carriers—not just in terms, of course, of the capital involved, but in terms of the opportunities to form synergistic benefits between the airlines concerned.

         I note with interest comments made by another one of the many Opposition spokespersons on aviation, the honourable member for O'Connor. The Opposition seems to have, to my knowledge, about 12 spokespersons who regularly comment. The honourable member for O'Connor also had a view that he expressed publicly on aviation policy. He was publicly reported as saying that the Government's policy would not necessarily increase international air travel as no overseas country would allow `open slather without a trade-off'. I repeat that: no overseas country would allow open slather without a trade-off. That statement is absolutely correct and is completely at odds with the Opposition's aviation proposal in the Fightback package which in fact proposes exactly that: the Opposition would provide extremely valuable—and I mean valuable in dollar terms—rights to international carriers without negotiating any reciprocal rights for Australian carriers. It is an outrageous policy. As I have said before, and I will conclude on this point, in the national interest I ask the Opposition to reconsider—as clearly some of its own members are reconsidering—that particular aspect of the

         I hoped this would have been a matter for debate, not Question Time, but Senator Alston has asked the question. We cannot accept the amendment because, apart from other reasons, the Opposition forgot to move, with the amendment it did move, at least two consequential amendments to the Bill. We now have an amended Bill that has gone from the Senate to the House of Representatives with one clause that says that one of these transponders has to be used exclusively by the ABC but which contains two other clauses, which the Opposition forgot to amend, which totally contradict that. So the Opposition has made a hash of that as well.

I conclude by saying that not only has the Government publicly asserted, as Senator Alston knows, its strong support for the ABC to become involved in pay television, but also it has provided up-front a commitment to fund the ABC to the tune of $12.5m to help it get into it. That is totally contrary to the Opposition's policy, which is to cut $50m a year from the ABC's recurrent budget. What the Opposition wants to do—and we know it—is to allow the ABC to get into pay TV so that it can cut off its public funding completely.

But we do have a preliminary response of enthusiasm for the inclusion, for example, of proposals made initially by Australia, together with New Zealand, Canada and the Nordics, which include improved information gathering, an integrated peacekeeping mechanism and the creation of a peacekeeping reserve fund.

         It is just too early to comment sensibly, I think, on the recommendations about the creation of a rapid deployment force and a number of other matters of that kind. This is an issue that has in fact been around for almost as long as the UN has existed. There is provision for the identification of forces that can be earmarked for UN use. That has not happened and countries have not been willing for the whole history of the UN so far to put themselves in that position to respond rapidly in that way. There are a number of pros and cons to the argument. I will be in a better position to give Senator Bourne a more considered answer on this when we resume.

         The Government is firmly committed to the tariff changes outlined for the car industry in March last year. They were made on the basis of a full and thorough Industry Commission inquiry into the car industry, the automotive industry. The consequences for investment if the alternative tariff arrangements were put in place would be, indeed, severe.

         Comments attributed to Bosch Australia, as I said, have been confirmed in a news release this morning. Since 1985, this Government has had in place a clear policy framework for the automotive industry. The stability of that framework, in the process of transition from high protection to low protection, is very important to the program, particularly to investment, and crucial to the investment decisions which both the car manufacturers and the component producers must make if we are to increase our competitiveness.

         I want to make it clear that the Government will remain committed to that policy. The only threat to it, to a stable policy environment, is the one which has been articulated by Opposition spokesmen and is in the Fightback document on zero tariffs for the automotive industry. Let me set the record straight. From January next year the tariff rate for passenger motor vehicles will be 32.5 per cent, phasing down to 15 per cent in the year 2000.

         Going with the commitment to tariffs is a commitment to export facilitation for the automotive industry. That commitment to export facilitation led to something like $1.2 billion of automotive component exports last year. The simple fact is that zero tariffs mean no export facilitation, and no exports in a volume related industry means no automotive industry at all.

          Despite that, and despite all the industry's warnings, the Opposition sticks with its commitment to zero tariffs and refuses to face the realities of the international automotive industry. That was on display here last week. One had the Western Australian second-hand Japanese car led recovery, articulated by Senator Campbell and Senator Panizza with great passion.

        Then Senator Evans was asked another simple question on his Government's record with ODA. Did he answer that? No, he wanted to talk about our policy. If he wanted to be truthful in the few minutes which he took to answer that question, he could have told us that when he came to office ODA was about 0.47 per cent of GDP and that it is now about 0.33 per cent. Every year the Government promises to increase overseas aid, but it has reduced it. Now the Minister condemns us for keeping our promises, for being truthful and for being prepared to go to the Australian people. That was the second abuse.

        The third abuse was by Senator Collins himself and it was the oldest trick in the book. If a Minister does not want to answer a question—and it was a simple question about government policy in relation to the ABC and what it would do in response to the resolution of the Senate last night—the oldest trick is to take up the technical argument. The Minister said, `We queried the drafting of the amendment. We have had our draftsmen looking at it all night'. I see Senator Collins is smiling. He recognises that it is the oldest trick in the book. He spent nearly 10 minutes talking about the drafting of that amendment rather than answering the simple question which was asked. Then Question Time ended with a dorothy dixer to Senator Button who wanted to give us a lecture on tariff policy.

And what did we get today? Five questions were asked from this side of the chamber. Government Ministers are determined not to answer questions any longer in this place. We should have the right to ask a reasonable number of questions in order to meet our responsibility of trying to keep you lot honest.

        Eleven questions and five supplementaries were asked today. The Opposition asked five questions and five supplementaries, which is the equivalent of 10 questions. Numerous points of order were taken and there were numerous disruption to Ministers answering questions, which produced longer answers. Senator Hill has taken the opportunity to move the suspension of Standing Orders on the basis, he says, that the Opposition had only five questions.

I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Prime Minister to the fact that no small business organisations have been included in the July unemployment summit. Is the Minister aware that the small business sector already employs nearly half the private sector work force and accounts for 96 per cent of all firms in operation? Is the Minister also aware that if every small business in Australia took on just one extra employee, every Australian looking for full time employment would get a job? I ask the Minister: If finding jobs for Australia's unemployed is now supposed to be the Government's number one priority, why then has the Government deliberately omitted one of the biggest employers in the private sector work force from attending the summit, or is the summit merely a publicity exercise designed to take pressure off the Government's lack of initiatives in this area?

         I am able to advise Senator Patterson that the Government, through the Australian Sports Commission, boosted its contribution to Australia's paralympians to almost $1m only a few days ago, following the announcement of a further grant of a quarter of a million dollars. This latest contribution was prompted by the Government's concern and disappointment over the continuing financial plight of the Australian Paralympic Federation. Specifically, funds have been provided in the following areas: $386,000 directly to national sporting organisations for the disabled for the preparation of teams; $450,000 towards team costs, including assembly, outfitting and transportation; and $100,000 to be borne by the Government to cover the costs of the summer Paralympic training camp at the Australian Institute of Sport.

          Bound for Glory

         . In that situation, I believe the best way in which the Paralympics could be helped would be for Australians to purchase that particular CD so that profits from their sale—given the fact that there would be substantial profits, given the very generous voluntary contributions by the various performers and those who put the CD together—would go towards supplementing the Federal Government's contribution to this very important event.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane on 25 June 1992 relating to the approval of travel expenses.

       I move to take note of this answer because what I believe to be a very serious matter has been brought to my attention relating to the approval of Government expenditure for travel expenses made by Mr Kevin Reynolds, the Secretary of the BLF in Western Australia. In my view, this was done on the basis of helping out a mate. The guidelines that were set down and approved by the Minister for Industrial Relations for the building industry work change assistance industrial relations working party stated quite clearly that a total of up to $20,000 can be approved under work change assistance for the reimbursement of costs relating to the implementation—I underline the word `implementation'—of the building industry working party. Council members were specifically informed in a letter from the Minister dated 23 October 1991 that `your representatives will be expected to meet all travel and other costs related to attendance'.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        There has already been substantial expenditure by the Government on Mr Reynolds amounting to $4,336 and $1,669 pertaining to establishment fees. This matter raises some very serious questions. I can accept that a government has the right to override a department and advice from its advisers if it is part of government policy, but this matter raises the question of the overriding of that advice. It is quite clearly spelt out on the papers which I wish to incorporate—and I have been given approval to do so—that this expenditure was, firstly, outside the guidelines which had been set down and, secondly, against the advice of the Department and, as I have already stated, the advice of the Minister's advisers.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Furthermore, there is a handwritten note to the Minister on a departmental minute which reads, `Minister, what was 17 December meeting?'. So his adviser did not even know whether this expenditure was related to the purpose for which it was being paid. So it begs the question: is it government policy to pay the expenses of its mates so they can come to Canberra at taxpayers' expense?'. I believe taxpayers have a right to know the answer to that question.

        On the setting up of these guidelines, if the Minister is to make a decision to allocate expenditure of further public funds, he should make it in a clear and open way so that the public and this Parliament knows about it. Clearly, that has not been done in this case.

        As I understand it, these additional payments to Mr Reynolds have already been made or they are about to be made. That brings very seriously into question the position of this Minister in relation to the payments to Mr Reynolds. From the note on this paper, certainly the Minister's own adviser is very suspicious as to what this expenditure related to. Certainly, the expenditure is outside of the initial instruction on expenditure relating to this particular working party. I believe the Minister has a duty to explain to this Parliament—he has not done so at this point in time—why this additional expenditure was approved and whether anyone else has been paid additional moneys in this area outside the original instructions.

        It is a very serious matter. It is also an abuse of taxpayers' money. It also comes on the heels of a question that Senator Kemp asked on 2 April 1992 concerning an additional $50,000 of expenditure in regard to union amalgamations.

        —I note for the record that I certainly approved leave for the incorporation of these documents. Before I come to the moment of this matter, I say that these documents apparently have been illegally leaked from my Department, the Department of Industrial Relations, to Senator Crane. At no time during his speech did he make any explanation of how he came by them or why he is in possession of documents that legally he is not entitled to be in possession of.

        I make no objection to the fact that this issue has been brought forward. We have in this Parliament a process called Estimates committees whereby the Parliament inquires into departmental expenditure. In essence, I imagine that I am answering questions which would in any case arise during an Estimates committee procedure. The point, for the record, is that these documents are illegally in the possession of Senator Winston Crane. I understand that there are three documents: the document dated 6 May 1992 from my Department, written on its letterhead; and the two documents on the letterhead of the Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers WA branch both dated 20 January 1992.

        The first thing that has to be said about the documents is that when I was asked a question a few minutes ago by Senator Winston Crane on this matter, he referred to a meeting with the Minister on 17 December 1991. Now that I have the documentation I can see that that was in reference to a meeting that had occurred in the past. The importance is that it occurred in a way which is not relevant to the allegation. That is what I am meaning to say, Senator Short; I thank you for looking quizzically in my direction.

The first thing is that the departmental minute is not addressed to me; it is addressed to Mr Mason, who is a member of my staff. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time I have seen this document, and that is not surprising. Literally millions of documents go through my office every week. This is one addressed to a staff member, not to me. Therefore, it is not surprising that I have not seen it.

        The second thing I say about it is that it refers to payments that have been made to Mr Reynolds to ensure progress in building industry reform. That apparently refers to some payments that have been made in order to enlist the cooperation of a key figure in the building industry reform process to that reform process. If one reads the letter—it is incorporated, so everyone can—one sees that it is not apparently the subject of the allegation that is made against me now.

That does not allow Senator Crane to close the debate in the way that would normally occur. Senator Crane, if you had wanted to move a different motion which would have allowed that to occur, you could have done so.

       I went away to do some homework to find out from the market exactly what was the position. Mr Andrew Robb commissioned a survey of the market by Price Waterhouse, who has today reported on a survey of leases available in the Barton area and leases that had been entered into by the Australian Government—that is, the Commonwealth—concerning various departments. None of them meet the favourable, slush fund type conditions that are available in the lease for the Australian Labor Party. For starters, the length of the lease is from three to 10 years, the rentals are much lower and certainly there is no 9 per cent annual increment in the levels of rental.

        Having been handed this survey, a further question was then asked, again by Mr Robb of Price Waterhouse—to compare the ALP lease with the survey of leases that had been entered into by the Australian Government. Its quote is—I put it into the record now—after appraising the market as it is, as follows:

       and we have difficulty, unless there are facts of which we are not aware, concluding the arrangement is a good commercial proposition for the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       In other words, it is not a good commercial proposition for the Government. I would charge Senator Bolkus to find any evidence that he can to try to refute the statement that this is not a good deal for the Government, because the documentation that he has presently put on the record does not do that. When we have more time we will go through it item by item.

      </para>
      <para>
       The second point concerns Senator Bolkus's statement that the departments looking for office space were the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the Australian National Audit Office, the Industry Commission, the Attorney-General's Department, the Public Service Commission, the Fisheries Service and the National Food Authority. The third point is that on the following page he said:

        The next question that was signalled was: what are the rental levels for the various major areas of the ACT? We have received Australian Valuation Office advice which suggests that the rentals for the various areas are as follows:

        The next question that would have been put to me was: how does the rental for the subject building, the Lend Lease proposition on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, compare with the rest of the market? I am advised that the prime net rental is based on $280 per square metre as at 1 January 1991, escalated at a fixed percentage of 10.5 per cent till occupancy. I am further advised that outgoings have been estimated to be $42 per square metre, and that this all up compares favourably with similar standard buildings in similar locations.

        My fifth point is that the Minister said today that, all up, he was unaware of the exact figure but that from memory it was between $380 and $386—or he agreed that that may be the correct figure. I have a copy of the lease of a building, as I mentioned before, which is a five-year lease, in contradistinction to the 15-year lease that the ALP has negotiated with the Commonwealth Government. It is for $315 per square metre, with an option of a further five years commencing on 1 January 1996.

        There is obviously a case to answer. This is a comparable building, built at the same time and of equivalent standing. It is not a 20-year-old building, as the Minister suggested it might be. It has similar outfittings. There is an enormous disparity—$70 a square metre over a 15-year lease period as compared with a five-year lease period. I do not believe that it can be left hanging in the air. The Minister has to answer. How was this negotiated? Why is there an enormous disparity in the return? I thought of the word `sophistry'. Sophistry is a subtle, tricky, specious but generally fallacious method of reasoning. I think the Minister is acting in an extraordinary manner to produce an answer which gives the lie to the figures that are available on the market. I believe that he has a case to answer.

        I was very tempted to get up and say that I do not need to reply because nothing new has been produced at this stage. But let me go through the assertions made. Senator Bishop goes to the commercial nature of the lease and makes some points about that. At the outset I suggest to people who might be listening, particularly AAP, which has been religiously following the Opposition's pursuit of this matter—I think it is the only organisation that has given the Opposition a run—that maybe this time they should actually listen to me as well before they go off and blindly write their stories. It is a suggestion only.

        The basic point that the Opposition is putting to us is that it is a generous commercial proposition. But let me put a couple of points on the record. The first, a basic point, is that we are talking about a market which has collapsed over the last 18 months or so. That has meant that a lot of players in the market are, of course, much keener to get rid of their properties at this particular time, and we are finding that all over the place. Price Waterhouse says, `As you are aware, we have recently carried out a survey of leasing activity within the Barton area'—it has looked to see what property is available.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The first point is that between early 1991 and mid-1992 there has been a major change in the market. Property that was commanding particular prices then can command nowhere near those prices now. That is pretty well understood in the marketplace, and it was understood at the time. Let me put one item on the record to reinforce that point: it is very easy to go and see what is on the market now and compare that to 18 months ago. But look at John McEwen House: as I said, and I will keep on saying, it is a building that is some 20 or 30 years old. On a short term rental arrangement, that is commanding $330 per square metre per annum.

I think the public record shows that for John Curtin House something in the vicinity of $400,000 or $500,000—I am not sure on the figures—was provided by the owners for the fitout.

        Tourism House was built at the same time as nine other buildings and there were no pre-existing commitments. So it is part of the marketplace. Property owners are really undercutting each other at the moment to make sure that they have tenants.

So, given that on the one hand one has a fitout figure—as I recollect, of some $400,000 to $500,000—and, on the other, there are no fitout concessions, it is obviously very hard to compare.

        We have briefly reviewed rentals in other CBD areas of Canberra such as Woden and Civic and note that in many cases base rentals are less then those of Barton.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        As an example the Sir Keith Campbell Centre located in Woden has 6,500 square metres of vacant space. This building is six years old and from discussions with real estate agents it is believed the owners of this building will fully refurbish it to the tenants requirements with a free fit out and charge a base rent in the vicinity of $280 per square metre.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Discussions with real estate agents indicate the commercial rental market is very competitive and there is still a relatively high vacancy factor (for Canberra). We note the Burns Building has been vacant for more than a year.

         Yields and Capitalisation Rates
        </emphasis>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Yield on an investment refers to the return on the cost of the investment. For example, a savings account will currently offer a yield of around 6% per annum and shares in BHP, on a purchase price of $14.28, will show a yield of 2.83% and an investor would receive a dividend of 40 cents.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the property industry yields are sometimes referred to as capitalisation rates and the capitalisation rate really means valuing a cash flow at a given yield. For instance, if we talk about a capitalisation rate of 7.5% we mean an investment bought at a given price would return 7.5% eg $1,000 capitalisation cost would return $75.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Capitalisation rates (or yields) reflect the quality of the investment. First class investments such as the State Bank Building in Martin Place are currently valued at yields of 5%: the Grosvenor Building in George Street is currently valued at a yield of 5%. These reflect that the value is perceived to be of a quality investment. However, a building in Collins Street could be valued at a yield of 10% as the valuers would perceive that that would not be of the same quality, with bigger tenancy risks, as the abovementioned properties.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Attractive CBD properties in Canberra City, with varying lease terms in the building, let to reasonably good tenants, show yields between 7.75% and 9%.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ALP property, having its income capitalised at 7.5%, would be considered reasonable and saleable due to the unusually long lease, the high rentals with an unheard of built in rental escalator of 9%, in a location adjoining Australia's Parliament House.

       I want to put on record my appreciation to Senator Tate, Mr Crean and Mr Simmons for taking note of the urgency which I stressed in relation to the local government information services program. It is a very valuable service which puts people living in remote country areas in almost the same category as someone living in the suburbs or in the provincial cities in terms of having access to Commonwealth services and information. So it is a very important service.

        I am very pleased to hear that Mr Crean, who is funding the service at present, is considering an extension. The current trial service concludes at the end of this month. I urge Mr Crean to consider very favourably the continuation of that service. I also urge that the service be extended through the auspices of local government throughout Australia.

        In three instances the trial service was conducted through local governments and in other instances through the DSS, the DPI and various other government agencies. I understand the service has not been quite as successful in those other agencies but it was very successful in the case of the three local authorities. I urge Mr Crean to consider extending the service through the auspices of local government.

        —I will proceed to make a personal explanation, Mr Acting Deputy President. On 18 June, in the course of the tabling of a report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, I made a contribution to the debate in which I canvassed the implications of the rising cost of age pensions and the effect that progress in biotechnology would have over the next 20 or 30 years.

        In response to an interjection from the other side of the chamber, I made passing reference to the term that was specifically proposed. At no stage did I advocate euthanasia or indicate that it was something that ought to be pursued in any shape or form. Indeed, I was at pains to point out that it was an abhorrent notion. It is perfectly clear from the thrust of my remarks that I was drawing attention, as have many other commentators, to the likelihood that medical costs of surgical treatment and the care of the elderly may well fall as a result of the accelerating pace of technological change and dramatic reforms in biotechnology. In no way, shape or form was I advocating euthanasia, nor was I suggesting that that had relevance to the debate, other than in the way in which it was proffered. I therefore deplore the way in which these words have been extracted from the

        The concern that I have is not simply that several nights ago in this chamber, Senator Sherry, who was present during that original debate, chose to take those words and put them forward to imply in a snide manner that somehow I was such an advocate. What is of much greater concern is that yesterday Dr Blewett allowed himself to be asked a dorothy dixer which again used the same selective quotations. I then wrote to Dr Blewett in the following terms:

        It is, therefore, with the greatest sorrow that one finds that not only did the matter surface in the House of Representatives today but that in no less than three separate questions asked of the Prime Minister he continued to defame me in this despicable manner. I can understand the political desperation of someone whose policies are in tatters and who is clutching desperately to try to divert attention from himself, but I cannot abide anyone, either inside the Parliament or outside, seeking to denigrate and crucify someone on the basis of facts which he patently knows to be untrue. It therefore sickens me to find that the Prime Minister of this country can stoop so low at the very time when a Premier of a leading State of this country has just been forced to resign because of one isolated failure to meet the highest standards of political integrity.

My whole religious upbringing has made me acutely aware of the sufferings that can be experienced in old age. Those experiences are very close to me at present.

        It is therefore difficult to imagine a more serious calumny than to suggest that someone was an advocate of that practice. There may well be some people in this country who would see it as an easy way out. There are a lot of people who take short cuts in life. I personally hold the view that those who suffer most in this life are the ones who are most likely to get their reward in the next. Therefore, there is a greater purpose to be served by those who do endure suffering towards the end of their lifetimes.

        But I have to say, with the most seriousness that one can bring to a very serious matter, that it should be possible to refute in the strongest terms something that goes to the core of one's own integrity and the principles that one holds dear, and to make it in such categorical terms and in such a way that outside this place would be a very commonplace and natural response. One does not have to go to a football match or be at a party. One just has to be in any discussion where someone rejects a proposition and says `rubbish', `lies', `nonsense' or whatever else. In the circumstances it strikes me as—perhaps precious is not the right word—not doing justice to the gravity of the matter for the Parliament to take the view that somehow one cannot reject in those strong terms something that goes to the very heart of a member's, or a senator's in this instance, integrity.

        We do not have to have much more than a passing knowledge of what goes on in the House of Representatives to know the sorts of rhetoric and expletives that are used on occasions. `Stuff up' now seems to be common parlance in this place, although I would have thought until a couple of days ago that it was unparliamentary. If one looks at the Prime Minister's use of the English language, it is quite clear that almost anything goes on occasions in that chamber.

         Quite clearly, Senator Alston feels very deeply about the particular matter over which he feels he has been maligned. For him to have made that explanation and to have used the word he did is perhaps outside the normal language of this chamber. For us to accept the very gravity of this situation and therefore refuse to take that next step to actually move a motion would be an appropriate way around this problem.

        The whole object of allowing discretion is that discretion is to be exercised on its merits. In other words, it does not become a precedent. One cannot simply say that because Senator McMullan was able to describe me as a windbag, that authorises everyone else to use that term in the future. It is to be judged on the circumstances at the time and in the environment of the issue. It is not a sufficient starting point for your deliberations, Mr Acting Deputy President, to say that you cannot contemplate a refusal because somehow it might tend to lower the standards of the chamber or encourage others to do likewise. They would do so at their peril; they clearly would not be able to draw any comfort from a special case or a single instance where a judgment was made on the facts and on the merits.

        In those circumstances, I say to you again that my explanation is very much directed not just to my personal circumstances but to the gravity of the allegation, and to what I regard as perhaps one of the most serious things that could ever be said about anyone. If you regard murder as a capital offence, and there are not too many offences more serious than murder—treason used to be but perhaps that has fallen into disuse—it follows that a capital offence is the most serious crime known to the criminal law. Euthanasia is clearly in that category. We do not condone euthanasia in this society. It is a shorthand expression for committing the crime of murder in compassionate circumstances.

Yet that is precisely what is being said here, and what was said not just on one occasion by Senator Sherry two nights ago and by Dr Blewett yesterday, but in the most calculated and cold-blooded way on three separate occasions in the House of Representatives, where it was deliberately designed to bring maximum political attention to an issue. Whether that was for diversionary purposes or out of political desperation, I do not know. The fact of the matter is that one could not imagine a more serious calumny than to use that expression about any other member of parliament or, indeed, any other citizen.

        Mr Acting Deputy President, if you do not regard that as sufficient to satisfy the discretion vested in you, it is very hard to imagine what the draftsman was contemplating when he provided that discretion. Otherwise, the standing order would simply say, `If you use objectionable words and you refuse to withdraw, you must be named—out'. That is not what it says. The standing order is clearly designed to recognise the circumstances of people's actions, whether they be the use of objectionable words, persistently and wilfully refusing to conform to standing orders or persistently and wilfully disregarding the authority of the Chair. You may make a judgment that the person who is prima facie guilty is not in control of himself any more—he may have any sort of condition or illness which makes him less than fully responsible.

         I have to say that that was probably an extreme example, but we do find many examples of people being called upon to withdraw comments where, by no measure, is there any precedent for them being unparliamentary and offensive—they are in the English language—but people withdraw them at the request of the Presiding Officer for the smooth running of the Parliament. I have been called upon to withdraw. I called a senator an ignoramus—a perfectly good English word which means a person ignorant of the facts. In my view, it is in no way unparliamentary. The Presiding Officer at the time—a Labor Presiding Officer—called upon me to withdraw. I had to say to him that I thought it was a long way from being unparliamentary.

         Apart from those words which would be illegal to use in the street, swear words in the common parlance which are obviously unparliamentary and in my view obviously should remain so—one should not be able to say in this chamber things which would be illegal in normal language used to a citizen outside—there are probably two words, of those which one can legally use elsewhere, most consistently regarded as unparliamentary. They are the words `liar' and `hypocrite'.

         I was in here last night or perhaps the night before when Senator Alston was calling me a hypocrite. I said, `Look, I am not going to call on him to withdraw that because I do not regard his double standards on that matter as important'. I said to him, `The next time you are interjected upon, you will show that you have double standards. You are prepared to use words like that to others but you are not prepared to accept them'. I think that quite clearly would be true. That is a matter about which I am quite relaxed. History will vindicate that. I am relaxed about him using unparliamentary language in calling me a hypocrite, but the honourable senators opposite cannot have the standards that they seek to apply to others and not apply them to themselves.

         Senator Alston had ample opportunity to make his proposition. Right at the end, having had all that generosity extended to him, he threw in this extra allegation. He had on several occasions, once by way of me raising a point of order, strayed so far that his speech was not a personal explanation but an attack on the Prime Minister. Right at the end he said, `The Prime Minister has told lies'. If anybody on this side of the Parliament—or might I say on Senator Coulter's side—had said on any occasion that any member of Parliament had told lies, those opposite would have leapt to their feet and called for it to be withdrawn.

         I have to say that, if this motion is moved and defeated today, we will be setting a very substantial new standard. We will be saying that any word can be used in this Parliament as then it is up to the person who used it to seek to make an explanation about whether or not it is justifiable. That is fine by me. I have the view that we should be more open about the language that is used in the Parliament. I have the view that honourable senators have all been excessively precious for the four years that I have been here and that we should be prepared to put up with more robust language. I have tried to apply that principle to myself, as I say, with regard to things which those opposite have said about me and colleagues. But what I am saying is that those opposite should seek to apply to themselves the standards they seek to apply to others.

         During the course of the debate and the various points of order that have been taken, Senator Alston has indicated to me quite clearly what his viewpoints are. He has explained why he acted in the way that he did. I have indicated that the three options are an apology, a withdrawal or an explanation to my satisfaction. Since I originally indicated to Senator Alston what could occur, I have listened very carefully to what he said. I believe there is, of course, a fourth option and that is a question of a substantive motion which is entirely in the hands of the Opposition in regard to this issue. I do not think there should be any discussion in this chamber about what I or anyone else can do about the Prime Minister and what he says.

        —Before this matter was interrupted, I had been making the general point that if one does not know what has been going on how can one decide what to do about it? That is why I was saying there is a need for an inquiry, but not simply what may well end up being a phoney committee really capable of achieving nothing because it did not know what sort of behaviour it was required to deal with.

        Among the many questions that need to be answered arising from the Marshall Islands affair, for example, is: who benefited from the disappearance of $1.25m from Hong Kong under the Symons scheme; who are the beneficial owners of a Virgin Islands company called Inter-China Enterprises Ltd which was set up by Mr Symons's Hong Kong lawyers? Inter-China Enterprises Ltd was incorporated on 3 January 1990. It has an IBC number, 23450; and a registered address, care of Arias Fabrega Trust Company, British Virgin Islands, Cutless Buildings, Whickham's Cay, Roadtown, Tortula, British Virgin Islands. Those are some of the questions that should be pursued by any proper inquiry.

        Surely, it would be proper to examine payments relating to coal dealing in the Hunter Valley between Symons and members of the New South Wales Right in which Senator Richardson—then Mr Richardson—is alleged to have played a role. What are the links that Mr Symons had with WA Inc., particularly the link through Mr Keith Gale? These two people shared offices and were effective partners. The payments by the Western Australian Labor Government to Mr Gale were washed through Mr Symons's company, Bittai Pty Ltd, because the Western Australian Labor Government did not want people to know it was paying money to Mr Gale. Mr Gale is the bankrupt white collar criminal well known for his activities, yet he was able to get an export development grant through his now collapsed company, Interex Pty Ltd. All these matters have to be looked at. No-one is looking at them and, under this arrangement, they are not going to be looked at.

        What are the links with Mr Noel Ling, a mate of members of Labor's New South Wales Right, who ran a chain of failed English language schools for Chinese students? He got hundreds of thousands of dollars in export development grants. It has cost the Australian Government multi-millions of dollars in compensation to these Chinese students which the Australian Government is now trying—so far unsuccessfully—to recover from Mr Ling. Mr Ling appears to be an associate of Mr Symons because Mr Ling lent Mr Symons $282,000 by buying out a National Bank mortgage on Mr Symons's home. I have a copy of that mortgage certificate dated 30 March 1990. It was lodged by Mr John Kinna, a Sydney solicitor, who also happened to be a director of Mr Gale's Interex and who appears to be involved with Mr Ling in a lot of these failed enterprises. Just what is this group? How significant are they? Here they are in a matter of some substance relating to education schemes—and an education scheme which Mr Symons tried to introduce in his stunt which has brought him before the courts in the Marshall Islands.

        I am intrigued to know—and I think the Senate would like to know—the answers to a whole lot of questions. For example, why did Senator Richardson feel that he had the capacity to instruct a public servant in 1987 to take action on an immigration matter? I have a letter dated 19 August 1987 from the Minister for the environment and the arts to Mr McCann, the Regional Director of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Perth, the last paragraph of which states:

       I would have thought it would have been more appropriate to ask the Minister for immigration whether he would give such instructions, not the Minister for the environment and the arts. Strangely enough, of course, that matter related to an immigration application for Mr John Davenport under the sponsorship of Taurus Resources NL of Western Australia which was closely associated with Mr Symons's failed company, Feedtech. I think it is appropriate that `taurus' means bull, and there seems to be a lot of that around in these ventures.

        Matters which should be examined relate to whether people actually phoned Senator Richardson, as suggested by Mr Symons, when they were to check on his status and standing and what it was that Senator Richardson did reply to these people if they did in fact ring.

As I said, we do not know what the problem is, so it is pretty difficult to work out how to resolve it.

        I want to refer to a point that was made by, I think, Senator Hill at the beginning of the debate. We will have a very heavily politicised approach if we go down the road which the Opposition is suggesting—an approach which I believe cannot get at the very things that the Opposition is saying it wants to get at simply because a number of the witnesses, particularly the key witness, Mr Symons, would not be available to the committee.

        The Opposition has been arguing that it would like to know about a number of things. Senator Baume said that there are a number of things that the Senate would like to know about. I am sure that there are a lot of things that the Senate would like to know about and pursue, but some of them are not particularly relevant—specifically the matters which go to possible criminal behaviour. Picking up Senator Baume's remarks, I instance the $1 1/4m that has disappeared somewhere in Hong Kong; the matter of a company set up in the Virgin Islands; and the matter of whether Mr Symons legitimately had access to Australia's educational institutions when he was offering those facilities to overseas students and whether he was misrepresenting himself or his company in relation to the offer of those services. Those sorts of criminal matters, while they might be of interest to the Senate, are matters that really should be dealt with in the courts. They are not the sorts of things that the Senate should get bogged down with.

        In answer to Senator Walters, it would not be possible with a code of conduct to stop that sort of behaviour. But clearly, by setting an objective measure of what is expected of Ministers beforehand, if that sort of behaviour was regarded in that code as unacceptable and a Minister then indulged in that sort of behaviour, I think there could be agreement generally in the chamber that that Minister had behaved outside the established code of conduct. Then there might be general agreement that that Minister should perhaps no longer be a Minister or that that person should be censured, depending upon how seriously the code of conduct was breached. No code can stop somebody breaking a code, just as the existence of a law does not stop people breaking the law, but at least the law's existence allows one to make some better objective judgment as to whether the behaviour is acceptable.

        Specifically in relation to the issuing of a reference, Senator Evans made the point that it could well be advantageous for the committee to which a matter was referred to establish a set of procedures whereby a reference may or may not be issued. To use Senator Evans's words, that would get many people off senators' and Ministers' backs. One could then say, `I'm sorry, I can't give you a reference because I have to run this through a certain set of procedures', or `I have run your request through the set of procedures and it simply does not measure up. Therefore, I can't give you the reference'. I believe that many of us would find that highly desirable.

        The structure which I have suggested allows us to get to those matters which are of relevance to the Marshall Islands matter and which are already on the table. They are the matters which deal with the issuing of the reference; the way in which Senator Richardson used his influence with other Ministers, particularly the President of the Senate, to get his cooperation and assistance. For instance, if there were a code of conduct which said that Senator Richardson as a Minister would have to have satisfied himself as to X, Y and Z before giving a reference, clearly he would have done that before he went to Senator Sibraa and sought his cooperation in furthering the interests of Mr Symons.

        It seems to me that that matter is covered. The evidence that we need for the committee to take that into account and to lay down a set of criteria is already there. We do not need retrospectively to look for further evidence. Similar arguments apply to the phone call to the President of the Marshall Islands. Is it or is it not appropriate for a Minister to approach a president of a foreign country asking for intercession on behalf of an Australian who is already before the courts? If it is, what sorts of checks and assistance should guide a Minister in so doing? Should the making of those approaches be the sole prerogative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs?

However, certainly the other matters that she raised, such as the phoning of the President of the Marshall Islands and the form of the permission to make that phone call by Senator Evans, would fall within the purview of the committee.

        The code will not stop bad behaviour, but it will give us a measure by which we can judge collectively and premeditatively what sort of behaviour we regard as ethical on the part of members and senators and what sort of behaviour we regard as acceptable for Ministers.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 to take account of the change of title of the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees of the Senate. The Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 provides for the exercise of the statutory powers of the Presiding Officers—the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives—in the event of the holders of those offices resigning, becoming incapable of acting, ceasing to be members, leaving the Commonwealth or dying in office, and in the event of a dissolution of the relevant House.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Sections 5 and 7 of the Act provide for the Chairman of Committees of each House to exercise the statutory powers of the relevant Presiding Officer in appropriate circumstances. When the Act was passed in 1965 the Deputy Presiding Officer of each House had the title `Chairman of Committees'. In 1981 the title of the Deputy Presiding Officer of the Senate was changed to Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. The title `Chairman of Committees' is now used only in relation to the function of the office as Chairman of committees of the whole.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Act has not been amended to take account of this change and, while the Act remains unamended, there are potential difficulties. For example, when signing documents on behalf of the President in order to conform with the Act, the Deputy President must sign as Chairman of Committees, a title which is otherwise not used except in relation to committees of the whole. While it is unlikely that instruments signed by the Deputy President would be held to be technically deficient as a matter of law, it is possible that they could be. It is therefore desirable to update the Act to take account of the altered title.

         I rise to speak on the report presented to the Senate entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Advice on Funds Allocated to Higher Education Institutions: Report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its Higher Education Council
         </emphasis>
         . Essentially, this response shows why NBEET will be abolished by a coalition government. The document's supposed purpose is to provide formal advice on the allocation of funds to higher education institutions, as notified in the ministerial higher education funding statement for the 1992-94 triennium and the extent to which these allocations conform to agreed funding principles.

          The response we have received on this rather extensive policy is a pitiful two pages long. Considering the standard of commentary by NBEET, however, I suppose one should be grateful for the brevity of the report, given the waste of public resources that would have occurred had the report been longer. This report touches on the issues of shifts between the undergraduate and postgraduate load, the allocation of undergraduate growth and the mainstreaming of equity funding. It has also had the gall to support one of the most damaging policies of this interventionist Labor Government, that being the institutional profile process.

          This policy has had a detrimental effect on our higher education institutions. It has been the ultimate tool of government intervention in higher education. The education profile process has allowed this Labor Government to dictate to our higher education institutions the direction of course development and a lot of their research. It is simply not the role of government to interfere in universities in this way. What this ALP Government should have been doing over the past nine years is solving the very real problems facing higher education in this country.

          Our universities are suffering from massive overcrowding; students cannot get into lectures and tutorials; libraries are being run down; and capital works are being neglected. In addition, even though our universities are overcrowded, there is still a record number of 50,000 eligible students who cannot be found a place in tertiary education. The figure is even worse for vocational education, with 150,000 eligible students being unable to find a place in TAFE colleges.

          As we can see from this report, the Government is doing very little to correct these enormous problems. However, the coalition has recognised the problems and intends to implement policies to do something about them. The coalition will provide an additional $245m over the rest of this decade in the area of research. Freedom to set their own courses will be returned to universities, ending the process of bureaucratically administered profiles.

          We will give universities the freedom to offer additional places to Australian undergraduates beyond government funded places on their own terms. We will establish an effective student market in higher education by a recurrent funding of systems through national educational awards and scholarships. These measures will restore independence to universities and increase support for their basic research effort. Links with industry will be encouraged in ways which will enhance research opportunities rather than through the disruptive ad hoc policies pursued by Labor.

          Clearly, it is time for this Government to abandon its current attempt to administer higher education in this country. The coalition's Fightback policies need to be implemented before this Government completely ruins the higher education sector. This Government is not meeting the demands being placed on the sector, nor is it giving universities the freedom to save themselves. The report from NBEET on the funding of higher education for 1992-94 does not provide the Senate with any confidence that this body has any idea of how to solve the very real problems that are facing this vital sector of education in the next triennium.

         The document I wish to speak to is the ministerial responses through NBEET to the discussion paper entitled,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Review of the Commonwealth Capital Grants Program for Non-government Schools
         </emphasis>
         . I am afraid I must state that it is really a very poor response from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) on such a crucial issue. It is again a case of this Labor Government spouting platitudes and not actually getting anything done. This is in vivid contrast to the policies espoused by the coalition in the Fightback reform package, which recognises the importance of non-government schools in our schooling sector.

          I have recently addressed meetings of parents who have been very concerned about the way in which this Labor Government has been treating the non-government schools sector. This sector is becoming more and more important as parents are voting with their feet. In 1989, 26 per cent of school children in Australia attended private schools. This increased to 27 per cent in 1990 and to 28 per cent in 1991. It is going up one percentage point a year.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          If parents want private education for their children, governments should not stand in their way. Indeed, they should positively assist. Non-government schools are an essential component of Australian schooling. The vast majority of children in these schools are from families in the low to middle income range. The willingness of parents to commit their own resources to schooling on a large scale makes possible a saving to the taxpayer of $1.6 billion. Government funds are therefore able to be concentrated on government schools. At present, private school funding is not based on any secure principle, and it is giving rise to considerable uncertainty among parents and within the community.

          I recently attended meetings of concerned parents in Gosford and Lismore involving 1,100 people in all. They were demanding a dramatic increase in capital funding for the non-government sector. A conservative estimate of the funding required by the year 2000 for capital works on the far north coast for the Catholic education sector is $39m. The equivalent figure on the central coast is $19m. That is an incredible burden to be placed on these educational communities.

          It was inspiring to note that these people managed to actually raise 75 per cent of the funds themselves, but this level will be harder and harder to maintain with increased demands on the sector. Fortunately, the coalition recognises this and intends to provide significant relief for this burden. This is a much more appropriate response than the empty rhetoric that the Government has given today in this report.

          As they affect education, the decisions announced in Fightback express the strongly held philosophy of the coalition that parents have the right to choose a school for their children which reflects their values. We have also been concerned for some time at the very great demands being made on parents and communities to support the building of new schools and to refurbish existing schools. The requirement for infrastructure has increased substantially because of the higher retention rates and changing curriculum requirements in these schools. The real annual value of the non-government schools capital works grant has declined by almost 30 per cent under this Labor Government over the last 10 years.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The coalition believes that the community interest in a viable and high quality non-government schools sector is no longer being adequately addressed in the capital works program. Accordingly, the incoming Liberal and National Party government will double the annual size of capital grants programs for non-government schools from its 1991 level to $162m a year. The increased payment under the program will commence in the 1993-94 year. This level of grant will still require a substantial contribution to capital development from parents and communities supporting non-government schools. However, the current burden will be greatly alleviated by this increase in funding.

          Therefore, it can be clearly seen that only the coalition has the policies to help the embattled non-government schools sector as we offer a dramatic increase in financial support. The Minister's response before the Senate today does not propose this and only provides that the Government has very little commitment to support the private education sector. I feel that it will pay for this attitude at the ballot box.

         Yet again, I would like to congratulate the Auditor-General in taking up the matter of a conflict of interest within the Department of Administrative Services. I highlighted this issue some 18 months ago when the Department, through its information technology section, entered into joint ventures with companies in the private sector. At the time I made the remark that this put the Government and the Department in an impossible situation. It meant that the Department whose major function was to purchase information technology and computer-type equipment was in partnership with others in the public sector and thereby quoting for business while it sat in judgment of the tenders. The audit report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANAO has also suggested that reforms and changes to the public sector should appropriately weigh and balance their effect on important and long-standing principles such as public accountability, equity, integrity, ethical standards and due process.
        </para>
        <para>
         I drew attention to equity, integrity and ethical standards some 18 months ago. The overview of the audit report goes on to point out:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The reforms which have taken place have required public sector managers and regulators to focus on and give greater attention to issues like risk management, meeting client needs, standards of public sector conduct and behaviour vis-a-vis the private sector and conflicts or potential conflicts between regulatory and commercial responsibilities.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         Paragraph 3 of the overview points out that the involvement of the Department of Administrative Services in the acquisition of IT as a tenderer and an adviser raises the question of conflict of interest. As you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, it is important that a government have propriety and probity, particularly when it comes to matters such as purchasing. If that collapses, the whole substance of that government being a major purchaser goes into jeopardy. Paragraph 4 of the overview states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government also determined that DAS:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .could continue to provide advice to agencies on IT acquisitions on a fee for service basis
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .could tender for public sector IT business either through joint ventures or in its own right where it could be established that DAS enjoyed no special advantages by virtue of its position as a Government department.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is where the conflict of interest lies. The audit report also points out:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One of the principles embodied in the Code for dealing with a potential conflict of interest is for the separation within the organisation of the organisational units involved in the activities which give rise to the potential conflict.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         This matter has been discussed at a series of Estimates committees. The Department has claimed that it can put up what it calls `Chinese walls'—that a barrier can be set up between the various sectors of the Department, thus giving credibility to one part of the organisation buying and the other part supplying. The Audit report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the establishment of `chinese walls' does not in this case resolve completely the potential for conflict of interest.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a point that we on this side have been making for the past couple of years. The report continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANAO believes, therefore, that DAS should be divested of one of the roles it performs in IT acquisitions, perhaps to another agency within the same portfolio.
        </para>
        <para>
         I have some problems with that. It seems to me that DAS has no role in the provision of services; it has a major role in the acquisition of services. More importantly, the Department, in its purchasing function, must be seen to be absolutely above reproach.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is my view, and the view of the Opposition, that the role of government should be to acquire the essential goods and services with probity and propriety. No matter what safeguards are in place, what Chinese walls are erected, if DAS is in partnership with any organisation in the private sector and is successful in bidding for government tenders on which it itself has a role to play, there is no way in the world that anyone in the private sector will believe that the decision was above board. I am amazed that the Department persists in going down this track; if this were done in the private sector, it would be the subject of investigation. It is absolutely impossible for a person to be the buyer and the seller, particularly with the large amount of money and the sort of equipment which is involved within the public sector. For the Government to go into partnership with the private sector is absolutely reprehensible.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I was visited by one of the participants with the Government. That participant—it was a reputable company—put to me the argument that it was in partnership not so much to obtain business in Australia but because it was thought that it might be of benefit to be joined with the Government when tendering overseas where government participation was seen as being a plus. I do not think anyone could swallow that. It is totally irresponsible. Rather than having, as is suggested by the Auditor-General, a separate section of the Department do it—I guess he means that the purchasing department of DAS do it rather than the information technology section—it would seem that the Government should get out of these commercial operations and address itself to acquiring the essential goods and services it needs for the operation of government. If the Department takes that route, it will save the taxpayer millions and millions of dollars.

          —I join Senator Parer in speaking to Audit Report No. 43, 1991-92. I stress the importance of this report. Senator Parer has made a first class case as to why a government department, morally, ought not to be involved with a joint venture in the private sector. The concept that a department can somehow erect a Chinese wall and have its functions seen as being proper is just not possible.

         The Audit Office recognises the problem and the fact that government, as a matter of policy, has decided that it is okay for these joint ventures to take place. The Auditor-General is saying that he wants the Department and the Government to look at the question again so that they may come to a different conclusion. The response of DAS to the recommendation is this:

         That is clearly nonsense. DAS continues:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         DAS accepts, however, the external perceptions that a potential for conflict exists, and needs to be addressed. Accordingly, the Department has changed its structure to impose greater organisational separation between the area providing IT procurement advice and the area providing IT services. The procurement function will be part of a newly established `Office of Purchasing', responsible directly to the Secretary of the Department.

         That is not adequate. Let us understand the mammoth amounts of money we are talking about. Last year—and it took me a long time to find these figures—the Federal Government and its agencies spent $4.1 billion on IT procurement.

          Part of the problem with the procurement of IT by the Federal Government—I exclude some of the agencies from these comments—is the fact that we do not have accrual accounting. That means that in a single year under cash accounting a department can buy IT, it has a value in that year, and an appropriation is required. The next year it has no value at all; it does not have to be accounted for. Until such time as we move to full accrual accounting, we will not know whether purchases of information technology are necessary, being utilised, effective, and accomplishing whatever the aim was that they set out to achieve.

          Once upon a time, large purchasers of ADP, as it used to be called, were subject to scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee. Indeed, that was a task that first got me interested and made me learn about computer technology when I first came into this Parliament because I was required to sit on a committee dealing with the approval of those purchases. That function has now gone from the Public Accounts Committee and has been replaced by the creation of ADP acquisition councils which are meant to oversight the purchase of expensive information technology.

          The Auditor-General in directing people's attention to this conflict of interest has done a great service. Certainly it highlights for me the need to look at the policies of procurement as a whole. I feel that since the time we moved away from the previous situation where procurement was governed by finance regulations, we now have the situation where the guidelines as published are just that—guidelines. They are not subject to tabling and disallowance.

          There is a great deal of disquiet in the way that it is open, should someone wish to do so, for a person in the public sector to draw up his own favourite list and ask his first best friend and two or three others to register expressions of interest in a field in which clearly they have no competency. The evaluation process then becomes meaningless. I would recommend that there be a great deal of investigation, and perhaps the implementation of a two-stage tender process to avert the enormous cost that can be run up where a large tender is to be dealt with. I cite examples of the Tax Office procurement of information technology worth about $1 billion. It can cost a competing firm in excess of $1m or $2m or $3m to prepare a tender. If one were to look more at the process of a two-stage tender under which the first stage is wide open and where in the second stage, dealing with the more technical matters, a smaller group would be involved, I feel the process would be much fairer.

          I have grave concerns about the way the procurement process now operates where the Government through its departments spends in excess of $8 billion annually on procurement. Those opposite cannot tell me the temptations are not there. In this whole area of information technology where we see arguments coming from Australian manufacturers that they are disadvantaged in competition with overseas manufacturers, it can be quite attractive to someone who wants to buy information technology to have written into a contract by the supplier that at the supplier's expense there will be need, for instance, to go to Paris twice a year to consult on the most up-to-date methods concerning that purchase. I really think there is a need to look again at the system of procurement. It needs to be tightened up so that there are not abuses of the system.

         Briefly, I will quote the report's key findings. These were:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .IT system development methods in DILGEA have been ad hoc and inconsistent in the way systems were documented, programs written and projects managed.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .The consequences for DILGEA have been delays in improving services, such as processing international passengers at entry points, and additional costs in bringing new systems into production.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .The lack of in-house standards and consistency in systems could lead to difficulties in future maintenance of systems, and in DILGEA's current plans for greater integration of its current systems.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .Changes to systems in production are not adequately controlled and documented.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .There was scope for greater participation by user management groups in the development and maintenance of systems.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .There were no firm agreements between IT management and users on acceptable levels of service in terms of system operation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .Better accountability of IT providers to user groups would provide a means of ensuring that systems are meeting user needs and the agreed system requirement.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .There was limited quality control of systems developed in-house. Apart from Internal Audit activities which commenced recently, there was no review of practices for compliance with acceptable standards.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .Disaster recovery planning was limited. However, many systems must be capable of 24-hour and remote operation to support program management, particularly in the control of entry to Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         They are fairly damaging comments about the in-house development. On the implementation of the purchase system, NOMAD, the Audit Office found:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .Users had difficulties in operating the personnel management system, and had avoided controls and manually duplicated some system functions.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .Users needed training in the system and a larger commitment by management was necessary for the system to work effectively.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .There had been no evaluation of whether the personnel system had met the cost and efficiency aims held for it, after being in place for over two years.
        </para>
        <para>
         It seems the old classic situation, namely, `We cannot deal with you as efficiently as we did in the past because we have introduced a computer'. That is what this report seems to be saying about the Department of Immigration in various matters. It seems to me most unfortunate and there is clearly a need for an improvement. In fact, the Audit Office says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The ANAO is concerned that the IT management deficiencies found at DILGEA could be a reflection of a wider problem in Departments, in a lack of recognition that IT development groups should be principally responsible to operational user groups for the provision of services. This relationship, backed up by accountability, is the best guarantee that expensive IT systems meet user requirements in a cost effective way.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I want to make the final point that, as I mentioned earlier, the Audit Office ordered the implementation of the personnel system widely used in the Department, and found considerable user difficulty with the system. The system was not providing the necessary level of support to users, resulting in avoidance of controls and manual duplication of system functions. There were substantial gaps in user knowledge of the capabilities of the system and evidence that users had encountered operational difficulties in the day to day use of the system.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This personnel system had been in operation for over two years. There had been no evaluation of how effective its introduction had been in meeting the original aims of automating the personnel function and saving resources. The Audit Office doubted that it had achieved these aims and recommended that such an evaluation should be accorded priority in view of the substantial increase in support departmental users would need to help them work effectively within the system. The Department has agreed to this.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          As the Auditor-General says, this problem is not just confined to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, but it could be a reflection of a wider problem in departments. It seems most unfortunate that when these expensive systems are introduced, there has not been an effective and proper utilisation of the systems, nor training for the systems, nor determination of the proper methods to be applied in using these systems.

          I do not know to what extent the responses to the Auditor-General's reports are going to encourage departments to be more efficient and more effective, and to save taxpayers' money, but there is no doubt we should be grateful to the Auditor-General for once again drawing to the Parliament's attention some serious failures in achieving what should be greater efficiencies within departments. Some Ministers get up and say, `There is no way we can save money', and sneer at Opposition insistence that government has to become more efficient and that money that is being wasted can be saved under such proposals as Fightback. Yet the Auditor-General is demonstrating that waste and inefficiency is going on within the Government. Quite frankly, it is about time the Government really did something serious about it.

          —Prior to the dinner adjournment I sought leave to move a motion in respect of the Auditor-General's Report No. 53. I will now speak to that motion. I do so with a sense of irony in that earlier in the day I was speaking about the rort, as I have called it, of the lease that has been entered into between the Labor Party and the Commonwealth in order to provide accommodation for the Australian National Audit Office. When I say that I am speaking on this report with a sense of irony, it is because this report deals with the Australian Customs Service and its accommodation, and the controversy that arose with regard to the selection of consultants and the selection of the building in which it was chosen to take out a lease for the Australian Customs Service.

          I want to read from page 26 of the report, which is a letter from the Auditor-General to none other than Senator Bolkus. Senator Bolkus referred this matter to the Auditor-General for investigation. Had the Labor Party not tainted the Auditor-General, wittingly or unwittingly, I would have referred the matter of the Labor Party lease to the Commonwealth—where there is a non-commercial lease entered into which will render a capital profit in one year of $15m and $58m over 15 years—to the Auditor-General, just as Senator Bolkus has. But, because of the nature of that lease, in my estimation the Auditor-General has been placed in jeopardy. Therefore, I am unable to refer the matter to the Auditor-General for him to investigate. It is a most deplorable set of circumstances. Therefore, we have to find another avenue to find the truth of the matter of just how this gift of taxpayers' money to the Australian Labor Party has been brought about.

         This is what the Auditor-General is being asked to do and that is what he set out to do. Yet in his own premises, where he will now be obliged to reside, we have a lease which is way outside the normal terms and conditions set for leases. There is a bankable arrangement which means that had the agreement to lease not been signed, the Labor Party could not have afforded to build its building. The agreement to lease was signed on 8 April 1992 and the first sod was turned on 24 April 1992. No lease, no building—courtesy of the taxpayer.

The fourteenth, being the Labor Party one, was not sent. It was communicated in a private conversation of which there is no record, and the Labor Party was not disclosed as the landlord or the owner. The Audit Office believed, until months afterwards, that it was Lend Lease who was the landlord.

And any appraisal of all the correspondence which is tabled will show subterfuge and coercion. The Australian Property Group, which is criticised in this report as having a conflict of interest, is the same Australian Property Group which any reading of the correspondence shows was tending to push the Australian National Audit Office into panic and into pleading with the Department of Finance to give it approval to move into this building, which it finally did.

          As I said, the real irony is that normally this 15-year guaranteed lease with a five-year option to extend to 20 years, and a rental with a 9 per cent annual increment with only the lessor, not the lessee, having the right to review the rent, will result in a figure in excess of $100m being paid to the Labor Party in rent. The documents that I tabled in this place earlier today show that no other government department which has leased property in the surrounding area, the same area, has had a lease of similar terms, length or conditions.

What he neglected to also tell us was that the Department of Finance is providing a further $3m for the rest of the fitout. What do honourable senators think $400,000 is going to buy for a fitout besides power points and a few extra leads? It sure is not going to provide for any partitions or any of the fundamental things that are regarded as essential to a fitout.

          It will cost over $17m—a generous amount—to develop the building. The building would be able to be sold for in excess of $33m the day it is completed, giving a clear profit of $15m. If the Labor Party holds it for an extra year, the profit will be $17m; if it holds it for five years, it will be $29m. This amount will increase until the end of the lease after 15 years and probably five years beyond that. At 15 years there will be a property mark-up of $58m—a nice little laundering exercise of taxpayers' money through the Australian National Audit Office to the Australian Labor Party so that it can circumvent its own legislation on disclosure and have plenty of cash for its war chest.

One might ask oneself how we are going to determine what really went on. The proper procedure is to pursue these matters through the Australian National Audit Office, just as the Minister wrote to the Auditor-General and asked him to investigate the circumstances surrounding the lease of the building in Melbourne for the Australian Customs Service. Yet I cannot refer these matters to the Auditor-General for the simple reason that, by virtue of the Labor Party's actions, by first deceiving him and the Department of Finance, the Auditor-General has been put in a compromised position.

          Reading the detailed audit findings that applied to Customs raises the following questions: were the leasing processes in accordance with the departmental and/or Audit Office policy, including the requirement to obtain value for money? Did they comply with the conditions of the Land Acquisition Act 1989? Is the issue of value for money stated in the procedures or is it simply implied? Did the processes followed by the property consultants result in the fair treatment of the various tenderers and parties involved?

It is absolutely necessary that there be an independent adjudication and, presumably, the easiest way for the Government is through a parliamentary committee. At this stage, I will leave it to the Government to do this. It does not comply with the minimum standards that would apply in any other case, and it needs to be dealt with accordingly.

The Committee was again assisted by Mr Theodore Simos QC, whose incisive work in connection with the hearings is gratefully acknowledged. There is much more that needs to be said about a reference which took 19 months, 48 meetings of the Privileges Committee of the Senate and the participation of at least six QCs, but not today in deference to the pressure on the Senate's time.

Nonetheless, it is seriously perturbed about a number of issues arising from its consideration of the matters referred to it, and the recommendations set out in paragraph 16 of chapter 4 reflect those concerns which are discussed in more detail in the body of the report.

         On 14 December 1989 the Senate adopted a nine-part resolution concerning the examination of annual reports by Senate legislative and general purpose standing committees. Amongst other matters, the resolution required that I, in my capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, after consulting with the chairs of the other standing committees and having regard to the list of statutory authorities, non-statutory bodies and companies maintained by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, present to the Senate each year a report indicating whether there are any bodies which do not present annual reports to the Senate and which should present such reports (Journals of the Senate 1989, p. 2378).

         It is my view that it is a minimum requirement of proper accountability that all government bodies which operate as discrete entities should report annually to Parliament on their operations, irrespective of any legislative requirement for them to do so. On this basis, the Committee staff have compiled lists per portfolio of bodies which have apparently not reported and I have circulated these lists to the relevant standing committee chairs for comment.

         The comment, both formal and informal, that I have received to date has led me to defer making a definitive report on non-reporting bodies at this stage. There appears to be some lack of agreement on a number of fundamental issues, issues which in my view warrant further examination. They include the following: the Government's exclusions from its definition of non-statutory bodies; the reporting of Government companies; and the reporting of minor or inactive statutory authorities. Differing views also emerged on what degree of compliance with the Government's reporting requirements actually constitutes reporting. The question of separate reporting, as opposed to reporting within the annual report of a related body, was also of concern.

         At present, for example, Commonwealth State bodies and ministerial councils are exempted from the Government's reporting requirements for non-statutory bodies. Nevertheless quite detailed reporting is provided by some such bodies; the resolutions of others are tabled; and yet others do not even acknowledge their existence. Companies limited by guarantee present special problems. In some cases, this corporate form has been chosen to carry out a function which is mainly a Commonwealth initiative or is mainly funded by the Commonwealth. In other cases, the involvement of the Commonwealth in the company is merely as one of several significant parties and funding is not primarily supplied by the Government. While the basic assumption that all such companies should report to Parliament has received support, the issue of the nature and extent of their reporting is one that requires more deliberation.

         While the number of bodies not reporting is small compared to the total (and the number of significant ones is smaller still), I am concerned that there are some Commonwealth bodies which are apparently not meeting their responsibility to account properly to the Parliament for their activities. I am also mindful of the already heavy burden of paperwork which we as senators are subjected to and I do not wish to add to that load unnecessarily.

         The report which I have just tabled on behalf of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts presents the Committee's findings and recommendations on an inquiry into the Department of Defence supply system redevelopment project or, as it has become more commonly known, SSRP. SSRP aims to create a common core computing system to cater for the supply needs of the Australian Defence Force. The title of the report,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          A champagne taste on a beer income
         </emphasis>
         , sums up SSRP. It is a project which seeks to do too much. Having commenced in the mid-1970s, SSRP is not scheduled for completion until 1998.

A significant amount of the Committee's inquiry was taken up examining various aspects of the DESINE contract—a five-year contract with IBM which makes IBM the sole supplier of computing equipment for Defence up until February 1994. Although the DESINE request for tender explicitly set out a requirement for network architecture supporting open systems, the Department of Defence was later to describe the solution it acquired through the DESINE contract as an implementation of systems application architecture, or SAA as it is more commonly known—an IBM proprietary architecture.

          I will tell people what that means. Proprietary architecture is designed, basically, to ensure that purchasers buy only one brand name. Open systems, to which this Government is committed, is a policy whereby one is able to buy many brands and have them interlinked. That is perhaps an oversimplification, but that is the distinction.

          The current trend in computing is towards open systems. By this I mean a situation where different computer networks can talk to each other and where applications or programs can be moved from one brand of computer to another without change. The Committee was concerned by the possibility that the Department of Defence could be unable to move from IBM equipment at the end of the DESINE contract without incurring untenable costs and delays through having to redevelop all the systems developed under IBM's systems application architecture. The Committee believes the Department's commitment to IBM, and more particularly to SAA, unless carefully managed, will leave it with no easy path to open systems and other vendors' solutions, and thus competition.

          The operating system most commonly associated with open systems is called Unix and throughout the inquiry there was considerable debate on the role of the Unix operating system in the DESINE environment. This issue was not resolved to the satisfaction of the Committee and the Committee remains concerned about the manner in which Unix solutions were passed over in the initial tendering process. The Committee is of the view that a departmental working party, known as the Unix working party, should be reactivated to explore options for the introduction of alternative Unix solutions.

          The Committee concludes that with the DESINE request for tender the Department set out with a clear intention to support international standards for open systems, but that the outcome of the tendering process left it with an unsatisfactory solution. At best, IBM may prove SAA to support open systems and, at worst, the Department has acquired a proprietary architecture which directly supports only IBM proprietary products.

          Examination of the DESINE request for tender has drawn the Committee's attention to the fact that billions of dollars are spent on information technology by the Commonwealth each year but that very little is known about the equipment and systems owned by the Commonwealth departments. To remedy this situation the Committee has recommended that departmental annual reports contain a comprehensive listing of current information technology assets—the listing to detail the quantity and current value of these assets.

          The DESINE contract contains a clause which makes IBM the sole supplier under the contract. This clause was the basis of much questioning during the inquiry as the Committee sought to ascertain why it was written into the contract. It became apparent that, from the view of the Department of Defence, having a contract with one vendor would enable it more effectively to achieve its standardised computing environment.

          The Committee is of the view that no future information technology acquisition contract should contain a sole supplier clause, nor should any such contract be written so that another sole supplier situation can eventuate. Of the DESINE contract itself, the Committee believes that a contract like this must never, ever be entered into by the Commonwealth again. While it is right and proper that a commercial organisation such as IBM should negotiate the best contract for itself, the Commonwealth must also maintain strength and expertise in its negotiating. The Committee sees that there are significant problems when the negotiating skills of the Commonwealth are not up to scratch and, regrettably, this appears to have been the situation in the case of DESINE.

          The Committee found that throughout the life of SSRP, its subprojects have continually fallen behind schedule. The three main causes of slippage were: difficulties in staffing the project, a scarcity of funds, and overly optimistic assessments of what subproject deadlines should be. The Committee's assessment is that the slippage is to a large extent the result of poor administration and management of the project at a global level.

It considers that there is insufficient evidence to show that the common core approach will produce a system in a reasonable time frame and with a positive cost benefit ratio which will effectively satisfy the requirements of the Department and the three Services. Cost estimates of the project have been of continuing concern to the Committee. Six analyses of costs and benefits for SSRP were provided to the Committee. Inconsistencies in these analyses caused the Committee some concern and led it to conclude that SSRP's costings are not accurate.

          The Committee is particularly concerned that there is a significant commitment by the Department of Defence to the long term engagement of consultants and contractors for the implementation of the project. The Committee is of the view that the engagement of consultants and contractors should be for specifically designated tasks which are both measurable and to be achieved over a fixed period. It is of paramount importance that the necessary skills transfer to the departmental staff occur when there is an ongoing requirement for those skills. There is a significant benefit to be gained from the external scrutiny of major projects being undertaken by Commonwealth agencies and the Committee considers that external review of SSRP and DESINE should not stop with the completion of this inquiry.

          The inquiry into SSRP has been one of the more complex and technical inquiries to be conducted by the Committee. It required the examination of a number of difficult information technology issues upon which even experts could not agree. With the finalisation of the inquiry with this report, it is to be noted that, as with all inquiries by parliamentary committees, changes in the area of investigations occur not just because of a report and its recommendations, but because of the raising and consideration of issues during the inquiry. This has undoubtedly been the case with the inquiry into the Supply Systems Redevelopment Project.

         The Committee's Inquiry into Research and Development was started in 1989 to review research and development in the public sector.

The Report that I am tabling today contains the Committee's conclusions and recommendations relating to its first term of reference, R &amp; D in the public sector. We will table our report on R &amp; D in the private sector during the Budget session of Parliament.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         In the present economic circumstances, there are great pressures to cut costs and use public funds as efficiently as possible. The Committee therefore paid considerable attention to the best way of wisely managing the considerable assistance provided by the Government for R &amp; D—$2.6 billion this financial year. We concluded that two points are important and have made recommendations to this effect.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The first point is that the public sector research organisations should not be involved in fields in which the private sector can expect to conduct R &amp; D for profit. The primary aim of public sector research organisations should be the conduct of longer term, basic research and research for the benefit of the community as a whole. For example, they should be involved with research on such topics as public health and understanding the environment and how our society is adjusting to the changes that it is experiencing.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee's second point is that priorities for spending on research should be determined in the light of criteria selected to obtain maximum benefit for the nation. This means considering the wider public interest as well as possible economic returns. A method of using criteria like this to set priorities for spending on research has been developed by CSIRO and picked up and used by a variety of organisations. The Committee believes that this is a valuable approach that should be further developed and widely used in priority setting exercises.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If decisions are to be made about what research the public sector should carry out and which areas of research are most important, information must be available to decision makers. The Committee found that much of the necessary information is lacking and several of the Committee's recommendations are directed towards ensuring that it is collected and accessible to those who need it.

         Commercialisation: its Impact on the National Research Effort
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Research organisations have, for some time, been facing pressures to cut costs and focus on commercial applications for their research. As this has happened, it has become clear that a new balance must be found between the traditional roles of these organisations and their research staff and the new one that emphasises commercialisation. For example:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         How should an organisation's research effort be divided between the short term process of developing applications for their research and long term basic research that may show no returns to the nation for many years, if at all? and
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         Can researchers cope with the demands of managing their research to tight targets, selling their ideas to industry and working within the constraints of a commercial timetable? Asking researchers to assume tasks additional to their research has required organisational changes and changes to the culture within which they work.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We need to strike a balance between long term basic research and shorter term strategic and applied research. How this balance is struck is vital. The private and public sector both warned that it would be a fatal mistake for Australia not to maintain its research capacity and the flow of information about the fundamental natural and physical processes of the world. This information is the foundation of applied science and an important step on the path to the ultimate commercialisation of research results. It is therefore essential that, in the current emphasis on the commercialisation of R &amp; D, we do not overlook the need to continue basic longer term research and maintain the national capacity to do so.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         Firstly, we need to be aware of the costs of commercialisation when public sector research organisations are charged with commercialising their work and we need to provide for these needs to be met;

        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         Thirdly, what charges should be made for research contracted from public sector organisations by outside bodies?
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee favours passing on the full cost of carrying out such work for the private sector.

A good case exists for such public interest projects being carried out without full cost recovery.

         —In addressing the Territories Law Reform Bill 1992 which is before the Senate this evening, it is important to also take this opportunity to comment on the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which has been tabled and which has very direct application to the piece of legislation that we have before us.

         It is important to recognise that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) has just moved for an extension of time to enable further Committee consideration. We need to be reminded that, because of the guillotine and the deal between the Government and the Australian Democrats, only one hour was initially available for this discussion. We have now extended that by another 30 minutes. That is a total of 1 1/2 hours for a very important piece of constitutional legislation.

         This matter will progress from here this evening into the House of Representatives where I will be watching with particular interest for the amount of time and the detailed debate, other than the Minister's second reading speech, that will take place in that chamber on this important piece of legislation.

         We have seen highlighted through the process of the Senate Standing Committee, which considered this matter for approximately four hours last Monday, what I can only describe as paternalism, colonialism, ignorance and arrogance on the part of the Government in the way in which it has dealt with this legislation. The Opposition certainly supports the thrust, tenor and main principles of extending a legal regime to the Indian Ocean Territories, but only after the full support and concurrence of the communities, involving a lot of consultation. It is not a matter of the Government clicking its heels and jumping to the tune of departmental bidding. There has been a lot of departmental work on this issue, and I acknowledge that, particularly by the various administrations.

         Firstly, let us look for a moment at the genesis of this legislation. It can be traced to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Islands in the Sun
         </emphasis>
         report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs brought down a year or so ago. In dealing with this legislation here in the chamber, we have not had explained to us, either in the Committee hearing or here, the differences between that original report,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Islands in the Sun
         </emphasis>
         , and the matters which surfaced in the Government's responses or in this legislation. There has been no schedule setting out the differences because of the haste that the Government uses when it is pushing a hidden agenda such as this.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, in the Senate Standing Committee hearing another WA Inc was revealed—a special deal between Labor governments. So far on this issue, there has been only an exchange of correspondence between former Prime Minister Hawke and an Acting Western Australian Premier. I refer my colleagues to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         of the Senate Standing Committee hearing on 22 June when I questioned the Western Australian representative. On that occasion I asked Mr Mulhall:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Has this matter been presented to the Western Australia Cabinet?
       </para>
       <para>
        He replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No, not to my knowledge.
       </para>
       <para>
        I asked him further:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Have there been any agreements between departments or agencies of Western Australia and any Federal agencies at all?
       </para>
       <para>
        His answer, a bit further on, was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our legal advice, from a meeting that was held on 16 June, indicates that Western Australian agencies should not enter into agreements in advance of enabling legislation and in advance of a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the Western Australian Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        My third question was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Is there any draft complimentary legislation already prepared in Western Australia?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Mulhall replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is no draft legislation in preparation at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are direct quotes from the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        . This is a farce, a charade and an administrative arrangement. Thirdly, we are aware of the constitutional aspects of this legislation. The voice of the people of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Islands has not been properly heard. It will be very interesting to hear the comments of Mr Snowdon, their representative in the House of Representatives, in this gagged debate tonight. Of course, there has been no voice or representation in the Western Australian Parliament with regard to the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is, of course, the possibility of a constitutional challenge. That was brought out in the Senate Standing Committee hearing when Senator Vanstone asked the company, Phosphate Resources:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Do you rule out Phosphate Resources challenging this legislation if it is passed?
       </para>
       <para>
        The director of that company, Mr Huston, replied in one word—no. Fourthly, there has been no answer from the Government on the issue of citizenship and how the application of laws relating to Western Australian local government will change the ethos of representation. The reciprocal benefits and responsibilities of the islanders have not been explained.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Fifthly, we need to look at the way in which the legislation has been considered, which makes a mockery of Labor's so-called constant and touted from time to time consultation process. Just who could make comprehensive submissions to the Senate Standing Committee in the time allocated? The Christmas Island residents were very concerned about this and one of the witnesses who appeared on Monday, Ms Choy Lan, said in her evidence:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        The comments from Cocos (Keeling) Islands were reflected in many angry submissions to the Committee that were faxed in last weekend, particularly the concerns from the local council chairman, Haji Wahin bin Bynie, and I draw that submission to the attention of anyone who is researching this matter. Patronising comments have been made by Labor Government Ministers and departmental officers in the evidence to the Committee and in this Parliament. As far as Christmas Island is concerned, I refer in particular to the evidence in that Senate Committee hearing when I said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . we have got to be careful here that Christmas Island is not being sold a pup in this instance. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments which have just been moved by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) do not acknowledge the consultative process; nor is there any indication that there will be a process with the elected representatives on either island. It is not incorporated in the legislation. That was looked for and sought by the residents of the island. It came out again in the Senate Standing Committee hearing the other day. I refer to comments made by Senator Spindler when he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a move to exempt certain legislation, there is another option to get it on the floor of the Parliament in response to a Consultative Committee request to exempt certain legislation? . . . So I am really looking for a mechanism that the Government can offer in that legislation to enable that to be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Cooney, said:
       </para>

        What he is saying is what sort of controls can the islands have once the Bills go through. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence of Lillian Oh, Secretary of the Union of Christmas Island Workers, is very important where she said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What we are suggesting is that that is the whole process of consultation. You do that first. You can identify what areas are not going to be applicable, or what clearly are not going to be applied, and then you have a more informed judgment as to what is going to happen on the island, rather than trying to change it the other way around.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further on, Ms Oh said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The availability of resources is another point; but I think the consultation, especially from the union, is very important.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer the Senate to the dissent of the Opposition senators, Senators Vanstone, O'Chee and Kemp, where the recommendation was made that the Bill be postponed in its enactment for a period of at least six months until the residents of the islands have been properly consulted, advised and educated in relation to the operation and effect of the new legal regime. Where best can we see this concern illustrated than in a couple of late submissions that came to the Committee. One came from three imams on Home Island, which is part of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and the other from the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils Inc. This submission reflected the particular Muslim reaction to the imposition of the family and marriage law. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate those two submissions in

The Government has not yet been able to guarantee us that our traditional practices will be able to continue. So we are not yet able to say that we agree to the new laws.

        So we would ask the Government not to impose the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act yet. We ask for more time to talk with the Government about these laws, so that we can seek together the solution that is most suitable in terms of the traditions, needs and rights of the Cocos Islanders. It can be said that religious traditions and customs are very important in the life of Cocos Islanders.

         We understand that shortly the Senate is due to consider the above bill leading to the introduction of mainland laws in the External Territories of Australia namely Christmas Island and Cocos Island. Whilst other laws do not present any problems or raise any concerns the anticipated introduction of Marriage Act 1961 and Family Law Act 1975 effectively replacing and repealing the existing Muslim laws affecting important and sensitive matters relating to marriage, divorce and inheritance rights of the Muslim majority of these Islands raise issues of great concern to the Muslim community of Australia at large.

It is unfortunate that this Federation and its Law Reform Committee was not even aware that a public hearing for one day was being held by the Standing Committee on Monday the 22nd June, 1992. Therefore, in the interest of natural justice and in deference to the wishes of second largest religious community of Australia namely the Muslims of Australia, we appeal to you to speak in favour of delay of discussions and to provide opportunity to our representatives to voice these concerns before a Parliamentary Committee.

         —I thank the Senate. As I said earlier, the challenge to Warren Snowdon, Federal member for the Northern Territory and for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island—Mr Snowdon is known for his constant criticism of supposedly unfair and unjust programs when it suits his political agenda, particularly when they affect his Aboriginal constituents in the Northern Territory—is that he must now set aside his usual political opportunism and prove his consistency of both argument and principle by adopting the same advocacy for his Indian Ocean Territory constituents. Otherwise, he proves only his shallow commitment and narrow political focus and reveals that he is only the mouthpiece for Labor's socialist Left faction in Canberra. If he agrees to the hasty imposition of this legislation tonight, he is acting against the expressed will of his own electors.

         The haste of this legislation and the paucity of detail only shows that the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has done a major snow job both in Canberra and on the islands. The inadequacy of the legislation and the lack of community support will come home to haunt the Labor Party, the Parliament and the Department.

         We are well aware that much of the haste for this legislation is predicated on the casino on Christmas Island and the need for gaming regulations. A cloud now hangs over that casino because of the investment issues that have become very apparent in the media in the last week or so, and the fact that there is no commitment—which has been reinforced now for over a week—as to a major stop-work project on a $50m program.

        As you would be aware the Committee is currently inquiring into the Christmas Island Rebuilding Program which was referred to it by the House of Representatives on 25 March 1992. In public hearings on Christmas Island and in Perth and Canberra the Committee has taken evidence from a wide range of persons and organisations and while on Christmas Island had the opportunity of inspecting both existing facilities and the proposed sites for the new facilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Unfortunately due to the pressure of other inquiries the Committee will be unable to table its report on this project before the winter recess. However the Committee believes that its attitude toward the rebuilding program and the $37m already committed should be made known to the Government so this can be taken into account during Budget considerations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the committee has concluded that there is a need for the upgrading of the public infrastructure on Christmas Island to align conditions with mainland standards, indeed many of the facilities are in an appalling state, the Committee believes that the priorities determined by the Government for inclusion in the $37m committed over the next five years do not include all the essential items.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I should say at the outset that the Committee agrees with the priority given to new and upgraded sewerage works, water supply works and the new hospital. However, it became obvious to the Committee during its inspection that the wharf facilities are completely inadequate and in need of urgent upgrading. The Committee was advised by the Christmas Island Administration that the rebuilding program will more than double the current usage of the already inferior infrastructure of the port. The port infrastructure is obviously vital to the success of the rebuilding program, for if it fails the whole rebuilding program will be severely compromised.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee strongly recommends to the Government that in relation to the wharf facilities the following item be included in the first five years of the rebuilding program:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

         minor upgrading of the wharf to support the crane.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In relation to the new hospital it is clear to the Committee that the removal of the sand and aggregate plant from the site of the new hospital should also be undertaken in the first five years of the program. The Committee understands that the removal of the sand and aggregate plant would require expenditure on water and power supply to the hospital site.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee realises that to accommodate these changes it will be necessary to either exclude some existing items from the $37m already committed or to increase the amount committed at this stage.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Your department has advised that this would necessitate deferring the police station and also expenditure of some $700,000 proposed for the combined schools and housing items. However before any item is excluded the Committee believes that the Government should consider increasing the amount to be committed over the next five years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In conclusion I would like to emphasise the Committee's support for the rebuilding program but stress that the priorities should be reviewed as detailed above. In addition, the Committee is of the view that current Christmas Island residents and others who are prepared to invest in the future development of the Island, should be encouraged in their efforts by the provision of at least the $37m and possible additional funds to address the immediate health and safety issues. However, prior to the final commitment to the total ten year program, the Committee believes there should be a re-assessment of the success of the initial funding which may lead to changes in the priorities and/or funding levels.

There is no doubt that all parties and all interested groups, both on the islands and on the mainland, support the thrust of the legislation. As Opposition senators pointed out so tacitly and so correctly in the report, the Standing Committee only met for a very brief period on Monday; heard evidence from representatives of only one of the affected islands—Christmas Island; did not hear and did not consider in detail any of the submissions from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands; and many members of the Committee, before deliberating on this report, had not read the detailed submissions that came in a couple of days before the report.

I want to see a proper administration.

         —The Senate is tonight debating the Territories Law Reform Bill 1992. The Bill will amend the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act and repeal existing Indian Ocean Territories laws, unless specified in new schedules. It will apply Western Australian laws as enforced from time to time, including some 700 pieces of legislation which will now be applied to Christmas Island. It will also, from time to time, subject to modification by ordinance, introduce laws made under the Christmas Island Act or Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act and extend appropriate Commonwealth laws.

         The reform that will affect these islands is a far-reaching one. To a large extent I share the concerns expressed by Senator Tambling. We are faced with a population which has a unique ethnic mix. We also face a legal history which has given that population laws which, in many respects, belong to the past and no longer have any relevance to a modern community. To that extent, one would welcome the reforms which will be introduced. Indeed, all parties have stated that the substance of the Bill is supported.

         I find myself at variance with Senator Tambling when he says that there has been no consultation, no education and no advice given to the people of Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands. At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Works we heard considerable evidence of consultation which has taken place on those islands. Whether it has been sufficient to make people aware of the laws that will be applied to them is another question. But there has been some consultation. The question certainly arises of just how long a consultation process can be continued before laws that are in keeping with modern times are introduced.

         On hearing all the evidence, I was also impressed with the evidence given by the representative of the Christmas Island Community Legislative Consultative Committee, Mr Terry White, who said that, on the basis of examining the total body of some 700 laws which were going to be applied to the islands, there was real concern with only about 33. Nevertheless, these concerns are real.

         Some way had to be found to ensure that the laws were not imposed on the people of Christmas and Cocos Islands without them having some possibility not only for consultation but also some effective influence through this Parliament. In that way they could ensure that, if there were real concerns and they found that certain laws were not appropriate for their conditions, these laws could be disallowed, and the people, through their consultative mechanisms, could make their views known to Parliament and the Senate. I gave an undertaking that we would listen carefully to their concerns.

         As Senator Tambling mentioned in his speech, at that Committee hearing I was looking for a mechanism that would enable the people of the islands to bring before us laws that they felt were not appropriate for their communities. I refer to my recommendation in the Committee report that the Bill could be passed subject to amendments which ensure that the existing and subsequent Western Australian and Commonwealth legislation which is to be applied to the islands be brought before the Commonwealth Parliament at three-monthly intervals by way of schedules, any part of which may be disallowed by the Commonwealth Parliament. This would be preceded by consultation with the island's consultative committee and adequate resources would be provided by the Commonwealth for this consultative process. I will return to the consultation process and to the resources for that process in a moment.

         I wish to pay tribute to the officers of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories who, until about 12 o'clock on Tuesday night, engaged in a considerable amount of work to put this requirement into legislation, to wit, the amendment that the Minister read at the beginning of this debate. I suggested that an additional gloss would be useful. That was in response to the concern expressed in the last minutes of the Committee meeting by people from the Christmas Island community who said that, in some instances, they might need more time to consider legislation before they actually made their views known.

         I therefore suggested that it would be appropriate for the Australian Parliament to be able to make a choice between three responses to legislation placed before it in the form of schedules, any part of which could be disallowed. Apart from letting the legislation pass and, therefore, perpetuating the law in its application to Christmas Island, we had the choice of disallowing it. I suggested that it would be useful to have a third choice where we could ask that these Bills be brought before the Australian Parliament again within a three-month period. This provision should apply only to the first batch of 700 Bills and subsequent schedules which are brought before this Parliament should be brought before it at six-monthly intervals. That should provide sufficient time for the consultative process to take place on the islands.

         I have had the draft Bill examined. I find that it does implement the requirements which I have stipulated in my recommendation. On that basis, the Australian Democrats will support this legislation. However, there is one proviso. In discussions with the Minister and departmental officials, it was agreed that it was impractical to put the provision of resources for the consultative process into legislation. There will be general assistance by the Commonwealth to ensure that consultation takes place and the results of that consultation will be brought before this House. Therefore, I request the Minister to give an unequivocal assurance to this House so that it is in

         —Senator McMullan will be able to tell us. I can only go on what is known to me. I did not need to rely on the material that was tabled by Senator Tambling because it had been reported to me quite reliably that there had not been consultations with the people about the operation of this measure as from 1 July 1992. There would be one way of settling all of this: the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), Senator Tambling, me and anyone in the chamber who wants to accompany us should go to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands on Monday of next week and take a survey of the people there. We could take interpreters and find out whether there have been consultations. My advice from the islands is that consultation has not taken place, that the people would not have a clue about the operation of that particular legislation which will operate from next Wednesday and which relates to the most important contracts that people enter into between themselves.

         That is a very important matter for us to be considering. In my view, it is extremely important that we do not pass this measure until such time as we know that that consultation has taken place and that there is agreement in respect of that matter. It is all very well to say that the decision was made and the referendum was undertaken. That is true. Referenda are often undertaken, but people expect that the consequence of the vote will be explained to them before the next process takes place. We have had a number of referenda in Australia. Before a referendum people are given detailed information about the proposal. After the proposal has been adopted a further step is taken, generally in the form of legislation which comes before the Federal Parliament. It is at that stage that further consultation can take place with affected individuals.

         Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell the Committee what consultations have taken place.

         —I share Senator Harradine's concerns on this matter, particularly with regard to the application of the Family Law Act and the common law of Western Australia which will be embraced by this legislation. That was brought out in the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Monday. I think it is important to put on the record the comments of Haji Wahin bin Bynie, the Chairman of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Council. He said in the submission to the Senate Committee:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Council is very concerned that the islanders are not fully educated or made fully aware of the proposed laws and how these will affect them in their daily lives—politically, socially and financially. The Department of Territories has been sending teams of persons from various Commonwealth and state departments to visit the islands. However the Council is of the view that despite this, insufficient information has been disseminated to the community. It is only last week that the Minister appointed a Community Legal Adviser but this is only 2 weeks before the proposed laws are implemented and enforced.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Council is concerned that several issues have yet to be resolved especially those that impinge on the culture, customs and tradition of the islanders. There are also several issues that have to be considered by Council in preparation for the introduction of the proposed laws. Of immediate concern is the land tenure system and its application thereof affecting the whole community. A decision has yet to be made on the lands held on trusts by the Council. The Council is still in the process of liaising with the Department of Territories on the trust documents and the alienation of the lands thereafter to the community.

        It has also been brought to the Council's attention yesterday that the Muslim Ordinance of Singapore shall be repealed and replaced by the Commonwealth Family Law Act and the Marriage Act. This will radically change the customs, culture and tradition of islanders which is contrary to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding.

        They are the issues that Senator Harradine and I share a concern about. Obviously the consultation process with the Australian Democrats is a much better one than that with the islanders of Cocos and Christmas Islands. Very obviously, Senator Spindler was given the opportunity on Tuesday night to work with officers on an amendment and then was given a handwritten copy of the amendments in advance of them coming here and being made available generally. I can certainly indicate that I was not invited to participate in the drafting of any amendments whatsoever and I was handed a formal copy of them only this morning by the parliamentary liaison officer in this place.

         Very obviously, the process of consultation, or deals that are done, with the Democrats certainly show out. I am surprised that Senator Spindler obviously has not read the detailed submissions that went to the Committee on Monday from the islanders. Even though Senator Spindler calls for an assurance from the Minister about the consultation process, quite frankly it is not good enough.

Senator Tambling also made a very unfortunate political attack on the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) whose principal contribution in this matter has been to be one of those who has persuaded the Government, and ultimately the Parliament, that the current unsatisfactory body of law in general on Cocos and Christmas Islands cannot be allowed to continue, and he has brought this major reform which will improve the rights of all the people in that Territory. It is a very positive contribution. He has also supported the substantial public works, which will be very good for the island, over Senator Tambling's opposition. We know that he is scrambling to catch up from the adverse reaction to his opposition to that. It probably explains some of his enthusiasm about this particular matter.

         There are a lot more general remarks I would like to make, but it would be unfair not to take up the limited time to respond to Senator Harradine's points.

         There has been a very large amount of consultation generally about the application of laws to these two islands—the Federal laws and relevant State laws of course principally. There has been extensive work by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which visited the islands twice and had a large amount of consultation. Fifty officials from the Western Australian and Commonwealth agencies have made visits there, 100 impact statements have been sent to representative bodies, law reform newsletters translated in Chinese and Malay have been sent to both newsletters, videos have been sent, there have been local radio and television broadcasts and Chinese and Malay speaking community advisers have been appointed to provide advice on the impact of particular laws. That is not exclusive to the family law area but it includes the Family Law Act. That part of it is general.

         There is some specific action as well concerning the Family Law Act and the Muslim community. My advice is that the Territory administrators met with the imams in mid-1989. The Cocos administrator advised that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands imams had no difficulty with the extension of the Marriage Act, confirming that Muslim marriage on Cocos Islands is already monogamous, and they were happy for the courts to decide on family law matters, particularly custody of children after divorce. I am advised that the Islamic community on Christmas Island at that stage accepted the argument that Islamic communities on the mainland accept and operate under the Federal Acts. It was also noted, I am advised, that Muslim, Chinese and European communities tend to marry or divorce off the island anyway.

That means that the word `strictly' will not be inserted before the word `comply' in the Act. I will not go over the debate we had on this point the other day, particularly at this hour of the evening, other than to note that inclusion of the word `strictly' was either unnecessary or had implications that the Government had not sufficiently spelt out—implications which could have posed considerable difficulty for applicants for dumping inquiries, particularly those engaged in the production of raw materials for processed products.

        I regret, however, that the House of Representatives has not acceded to the Senate's other request, namely, to reduce from 25 days to five days the time limit for the prima facie stage of a dumping inquiry. The reasons that have been given by the House for not acceding to that request are basically that five days leaves insufficient time to give effect to the requirements of the GATT anti-dumping code and the requirements of Australia's domestic legislation, and also that a five-day prima facie period effectively would nullify the other reforms in the Bill enabling the Australian Customs Service to supplement an application for dumping relief with other relevant information.

        The coalition's anti-dumping policies, which were published many months ago now, include a five-day prima facie stage for a dumping inquiry. That remains our policy and we will proceed to its implementation on coming to government later this year or early next year. However, the coalition will not continue to press for a reduction to five days in this Bill. Although this Bill goes nowhere near far enough in ensuring that adequate remedies are available to Australian producers against unfair practices, particularly by our major trading partners, it is at least an improvement over the existing situation.

        In particular, the changes in the Bill to the tariff concession system should make for more balanced decisions where a local producer will have to demonstrate in the future a capacity to produce the items in question. Of course, as protection winds down over time, the use of tariff concession orders will also decline. The Bill also implements various other changes to anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements, including the adoption of changes to the Anti-Dumping Authority timetables that were proposed by the coalition more than a year ago. This eventual though belated adoption of the coalition's proposals is, of course, welcome.

        I believe it is time that our Department of Small Business, Construction and Commerce saw as part of its task a responsibility to ensure that Australian manufacturers face a level playing field. It is a misnomer to call this the prima facie stage if we ask our manufacturers, our producers, to prove in that stage virtually all the aspects of a case that they would have to make to achieve countervailing duties when dumping occurs. That review of procedures is well and truly overdue.

        I derive some comfort from the statements made by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) at various times that the Government is preparing legislation which would introduce the countervailing duties at the end of the prima facie stage. When that actually happens, when that legislation is in place, then I could accept that a 25-day period would be realistic. But when we proceed during the prima facie stage no further than simply to say, `You now can have an inquiry as to whether you should have countervailing duties to protect you from dumping', then I really do not see why our Department cannot get its act into gear and protect our manufacturers when they are crying out for help at a time such as this. Thousands of jobs are going down the drain on a weekly basis because we reduce our tariffs but allow other countries, through their exporters, to compete on our market virtually unhindered.

        I express very profound disappointment about the fact that now both the Government and the Opposition are not prepared to take up the cudgels on behalf of Australian manufacturers and are prepared to sacrifice Australian jobs when they could assist in keeping some jobs here. They are exporting this work to Taiwan, Korea, the United States, Japan and other countries that use our lax provisions—provisions which assist importers and act against our manufacturers. The  net effect is that we will lose more jobs and that the one million unemployed that we now have will be exceeded in the very near future.

        I shall speak only very briefly to this matter. I suppose that most sections of the Constitution can be a puzzle, but section 53 certainly has some difficulties. Whilst it is clear what the general intent is, in a particular instance this may lead to some confusion and to a difference of opinion between people who are of goodwill, who try to look at the section with a fair mind, and who are quite apart from those who have an institutional interest in the pre-eminence of one chamber rather than another.

         When one has the combination of the difficulty of the section and the territorial imperative, which sometimes grips those who advise us in these matters—I am referring to those in both chambers—I believe that there is always the possibility of a difference which requires more time for reflection than is accorded to us on this last night of the sitting. That is why the motion that I have moved has been cast in a way which is probably rather unusual.

         When I moved an amendment in relation to the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill, I thought that all I was doing was creating a situation where money which would otherwise be payable to the State of Tasmania would be paid to the municipalities of Tasmania. In other words, there would be a shift away from a grant to the State  to a grant to the municipalities. A slightly higher amount would go to the municipalities and, therefore, a correspondingly lesser amount to the State to enable municipalities to carry out road programs. I certainly had no impression that I was doing anything which might increase a charge or burden on the people. For that reason I believed that an amendment was quite in order.

         However, the House of Representatives has taken a different view. I must say that the opinion of the Clerk of the Senate on this matter—which I have had a chance to read, but which I have to confess I do not fully comprehend and have not digested at this moment—does not seem to put it quite as simply as that. It seems to make a claim that, where an amendment simply effects a discretion which a Minister may have as to the level of expenditure which might be attained to advance a particular matter, it does not amount to a provision which could be characterised in terms of section 53 as a proposal to `increase any proposed charge or burden on the people'.

I think there does need to be reflection over the winter months on the matter that has arisen as to the correct procedure that ought to be adopted between the two Houses. In the end there has to be a meeting of minds between both chambers in order for the matter to proceed through the Parliament and to the Governor-General for assent so that a law is effected at the end of the process.

         There is a difference in procedures; they are constitutionally mandated. We have to abide by the Constitution. I do not believe that it is justiciable, in the sense that the High Court can peer over our shoulders and decide whether we got it right between our two chambers. What occurs between the two chambers or within the walls of each chamber in these matters, is a matter for us. Nevertheless, we have a real obligation, despite the fact that the High Court will not be able to give a definitive view, to do our best ourselves to abide by the Constitution. I think we need more time to reflect on this matter; hence the motion I have moved tonight is in the peculiar form that it is. Without conceding that Senate amendment No. 2 should have been a request, I nevertheless request the House of Representatives to amend the Bill in accordance with that amendment. It is cast in that way in order to enable the legislation to be dealt with, but without prejudice to further consideration of the constitutional issues involved.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The House of Representatives has returned the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 with a claim that one of the Senate's amendments should be a request. That claim is based on poor advice and a lack of understanding of the issue. During the debate in the House of Representatives the Rt. Hon. Ian Sinclair, MP, expressed a wish "to understand why the clerks in the other place believe the resolution [amendment] to have been within its [the Senate's] power". It is regrettable that the House has not been given that understanding hitherto. I hope that this letter will assist.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Before I go to the matter in issue, I note that the amendment was moved in the Senate by the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, and now apparently the government's advisers have decided that the Minister was wrong to move the amendment. The government's advisers do not understand the question of amendments versus requests. This is demonstrated by the fact that last week government amendments were circulated to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992, a bill which the Senate clearly cannot amend, and it was only when I pointed that out that the amendments were withdrawn and changed to requests.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The matter in issue is the provision in section 53 of the Constitution whereby the Senate may not amend any bill to increase any "proposed charge or burden on the people". An amendment which would have that effect must be put in the form of a request.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is clear that this provision requires a request where an amendment would increase expenditure under an appropriation. It is also clear that there must be a necessary and direct increase in expenditure for a request to be required. If one takes the view that a possible or indirect effect on expenditure is all that is required, as some of the government's advisers occasionally seem to do, then virtually every amendment will have to be a request, because virtually every amendment can be seen as having some possible or indirect effect on expenditure. Apart from a misinterpretation of the Constitution, this will involve many more bills coming back to the Senate to be finally dealt with after they have been returned to the House. An amendment should be put in the form of a request only where it would necessarily and directly lead to an increase in expenditure. This principle has been followed in moving amendments in the Senate over many years.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the case of this bill, the effect of the Senate's amendment would be to raise the upper limit within which the relevant minister may, in effect, determine the amount of a grant to a state. The amendment therefore does not necessarily and directly involve an increase in expenditure, but merely enlarges the area of a ministerial discretion within which expenditure may be made.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1981 the Senate considered amendments involving a similar principle, and determined by resolution that it was in accordance with the Constitution for the Senate to amend a bill to remove a ministerial discretion to reduce expenditure. This resolution may be regarded as establishing the principle that an amendment which affects a ministerial discretion to authorise expenditure does not have to be in the form of a request, and that a request cannot be required simply on the basis that the discretion might be exercised in such a way as to increase expenditure. This case is discussed in Australian Senate Practice, 6th edition, pp. 607-10.
       </para>

        All of the relevant issues are treated more fully in a paper which was tabled in the Senate on 6 March 1989, a copy of which is attached. Also attached is a recent letter on a relevant recent case.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is quite clear that the Senate's amendment does not need to be a request. The analysis which has been put here has never been explained to the House or answered. The claim made in the House of Representatives message, which, with the wider issue of the interpretation of the relevant constitutional provision, has also not been explained to the House, is based upon a misunderstanding, the essence of which is that anything possibly involving money must require a request.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As is also pointed out in the paper tabled in the Senate, the difference between amendments and requests under section 53 of the Constitution is essentially a procedural difference, which affects the procedural method by which bills are dealt with by the two Houses. As a constitutionally-mandated procedure, however, it must be taken seriously and properly observed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The line apparently being taken by the government's advisers, if accepted, would lead to more amendments being put as requests, which would cause considerable inconvenience to both Houses, quite apart from the distortion of the application of the constitutional provision.

         and as the Speaker seems to have acknowledged but then to have taken no notice of, both the Minister's speech and the explanatory memorandum quite clearly indicate that this amendment in no way will increase any burden on the Australian people. What it is really doing is saying that money that was allocated for Tasmania, for local government purposes and for local government roads purposes in particular, is being directed away from the State Government for use on local roads towards local authorities for use on local roads. The upper limit of the money the Commonwealth will give to the State of Tasmania—and it does not apply to the Northern Territory as it is only specifically in relation to the State of Tasmania—will not alter. Accordingly, under section 53, nothing we do to amend this particular Bill will in any way increase any proposed charge or burden on the Parliament.

         Finally and briefly, I think my colleague the member for New England, the right honourable Ian Sinclair, was right in the first instance when he said in the other place that it was simply `a re-apportionment of moneys'. It seems to me that Mr Sinclair, no doubt through his very long and wide experience in this Parliament, has quickly grasped the issue. Unfortunately, he then seems to have been talked out of it, but I suggest that he was right in the first instance.

But I think Mr Fischer is not quite right on the mark in his comments about the Senate and the way it deals with these matters.

I just regret we are at a stage in the proceedings where it would not be well looked upon by my colleagues if we took the matter any further at this stage.

         Fourthly and finally, I happened to be watching the direct live television broadcast of the House of Representatives debate on our message. At that time there were very few members in the House of Representatives and it was handled by interruption of the business that was then being transacted. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who was discussing industrial relations, took his place while the Speaker came in and made the announcement to the House of Representatives. Then, with no more warning than that, the member for New England, the right honourable Ian Sinclair, with whom I had dined just half an hour earlier, quickly jumped to his feet in his usual manner. I say `usual manner' because of his experience and knowledge of the law and the Constitution. He made a very constructive point with regard to what we, in very loose fashion, see as the money power of the House of Representatives. It was in such general terms that I fully understood the motivations both of the Speaker and of Mr Sinclair in their rather unresearched but immediate constructive remarks protecting the constitutional rights of the House of Representatives.

        —Well, I will not spend much time on that at this stage. The necessity for this procedure stems from the fact that a few months ago Senator Parer moved a disallowance motion in this place. That motion was not debated in the Senate, but not dealing with it had the effect of precluding further action by the Government for a six-month period from the date of it not being dealt with.

        I will refer to the relevant provisions in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to lay the groundwork with respect to this. Section 48(5A) of the Act says that if a disallowance resolution in respect of regulations has been moved, but that notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on, or the motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of, the regulation specified in the motion shall thereupon be deemed to have been disallowed. Therefore, for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act, in law, the regulations which were the subject of Senator Parer's notice of motion in this place are, pursuant to that section that I have read, deemed to have been disallowed.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        What is the effect of that? The effect of that becomes quite clear when one looks at section 49(1) of the same Act. It says that if a regulation is deemed to have been disallowed under section 49(1), then no regulation which is the same in substance as the regulation so disallowed, or deemed to have been disallowed, shall be made within six months after the date of the disallowance. The result would be that any regulations that would be made to provide for free time with respect to State elections would, pursuant to the Acts Interpretation Act, not be able to be made for six months from the date of the disallowance or the deemed disallowance.

        The Government is obviously very keen—and we had this debate some time last year—to ensure that the full impact of our legislation in this area takes effect. The question was basically whether to have a massive debate a few weeks ago in response to Senator Parer's notice of motion, or whether to have one later in the session. What has obviously happened is that we are having one later in the session.

        The Government's intention is to draft a comprehensive set of regulations to cover State, Commonwealth and Territory elections to provide for free time pursuant to the Act that was passed in this Parliament. To do that, and for the regulations to have the effect of applying in those States that are mentioned in the notice of motion, we have to do one of two things. Either we cannot bring them into effect for six months from the date of disallowance, or we have to move the notice of motion that is before the chamber at the moment.

        I am sure that there will be some debate on this legislation, which has attracted some controversy. I could go back through the debate, but that would not serve the purpose of this Parliament all that much. However, I want to make the point that progressively over the last seven or eight months we have had more and more indications of the success of the Government's proposals last year. I think as time goes by there will be a growing acceptance of what we did last year and of the necessity for it. We will have a repeat of previous debates on this matter. A lot will be made of the fact that some people claim that this side of the Parliament, in a party sense, is broke, and that that is why we have actually introduced this legislation. I do not think that is a fair assessment; in fact, I am quite sure it is not.

       There is a clear acknowledgment by the Opposition of the necessity for legislation such as this.

        Everingham's intervention in this process is not just one-off. During the Tasmanian election, Michael Hodgman, a former member of the House of Representatives, discussed the legislation which is the subject of debate tonight. What he said is reported in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Age
        </emphasis>
        of 1 February 1992. As a consequence of that, it was pretty clear that politicians were getting closer to the electorate. He basically said something that I have believed in all along in this debate. He said, `I think people are very glad not to see politicians in their living rooms all the time'. In the context of that, it is interesting that the Tasmanian campaign director, Mr Bob Lister, is on the record as saying that he did not believe the ban caused any disadvantage for any particular party.

        We have a change of government in Tasmania. We had  massive turnouts in that election. For instance, the voter turnout for Denison in the 1989 election was 92.14 per cent. Without advertising, the turnout in Denison for the State election was 95.8 per cent. That rejects the claim that people would not know about elections. It is also interesting to note that in the Entrance by-election in New South Wales conducted at the start of this year, the voter turnout was 91 per cent despite the fact that the poll took place during school holidays and postal voting was not available.

        As the second leg of the Government's program, we were very keen to ensure that the costs of campaigning were reduced.

It is a course which limits the capacity to advertise on electronic media, a medium which has been recognised as being the Bermuda Triangle of campaign spending. That is why other countries have done it and that is why we have done it. The evidence so far has indicated that we have been successful in that respect.

I expect that will happen over the next month or two. Once that is in place, obviously free time will apply in all State, Commonwealth and Territory elections into the future. The two objectives which set the Government on its course at the outset will then have been achieved—namely, the disclosure of parties funding; and a decrease in the necessity to raise and to expend millions of dollars.

        The assertion made by senators on the other side of the chamber that this has been done to satisfy one party is not confirmed by facts. As I have pointed out, the Queensland Liberal Party President is one person who has been honest about this. If one were to look at the Liberal Party across the country one would find that it, like other parties in the process, is stretched for resources. The rhetorical point to be made is that if we, as major political parties, cannot afford to be part of the process, then what hope do other individuals in our society have? It is a very democratic measure and I urge the Senate to support it.

        A deal was first struck with the then Leader of the Democrats, Senator Powell. Ironically, it was because of that perceived deal that Senator Powell found herself in trouble and the benign Senator Coulter then decided he would make a challenge. I can recall having a debate on Brisbane radio on the Haydn Sargent show with Senator Kernot. I said, `It's perfectly obvious, isn't it, that a deal has been made between Senator Powell and Senator Bolkus'. She hesitated and said, `I hope not'. Out of all that came a new leader and a promise by the Democrats that they would not support this attack on freedom of speech.

Out of all this came all sorts of freebies for the Democrats which they never would have been able to support in a future election campaign. It was from that point that grubby self-interest became the guiding light of the Democrats except, to be fair, for Senator Sowada, who did not at any stage support the rest of the Democrats on this atrocious Bill.

In subsequent debate in this place, Senator Bolkus made some remarks; in fact, he made the remarks publicly through the press. It was reported that Senator Bolkus accused the Opposition, me in particular, of running a very emotive and very dishonest campaign. I believe that Senator Bolkus sailed very close to the wind with those statements. The last thing in the world that could be said was that that campaign was dishonest.

        The Clerk in this chamber gave me an opinion at my request. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to respond to requests, whether it be from the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Democrats. In subsequent debate—and this is the reason for our amendment to this motion—he was ferociously attacked by this particular Minister because he responded to my request and gave me the opinion that he did.

        I subsequently gave notice to disallow the regulations made under the Political Broadcasts Act 1991 on the condition that the Minister table the advice given to him, because he claimed that his advice was correct and the advice given to me was incorrect. It was a matter of, `We have put up our legal advice'—it was an opinion, and everyone knew it was an opinion—`you put up yours'. The Minister refused to do that. Therefore, when I gave my notice to disallow I put the requirement in it that he would provide his legal advice, at which stage those particular regulations would have been accepted. He refused to do it. With the effluxion of time—the 15 days after that notice of motion—there was no response whatsoever from the Minister which meant that the regulations had been disallowed. Hence, we are now at the position we are in today where the Minister has to bring in a notice of motion to the effect that, in accordance with the Acts Interpretation Act, these particular regulations would be allowed.

        The question one asks is: why is the Minister now bringing in regulations with regard to New South Wales? I think we can understand how these regulations occurred. Initially, when there were rumours floating around that this Act was going to be introduced, I asked the Minister in this place: is it a fact that Mr Hogg, the General Secretary of the Labor Party, is behind a move to ban all political advertising on radio and television? He denied it in the Parliament and subsequently came in and introduced it.

        What happened recently? We have had some problems in New South Wales in recent weeks. I guess what happened is that the phone rang and Mr Hogg said, `Is that you, Nick, the leak? It's Hogg here'. `Yes, Paul, mate', said the Minister, `What can I do for you?'. Mr Hogg said, `No, no, Nick, it's not the PM, comrade; it's Bob Hogg, General Secretary of the Labor Party. You know, we're both in the socialist Left'. Just because he said `Hogg', the Minister thought it was the Prime Minister.

        The Minister said, `I cannot bring in new regulations for five months because the previous regulations were deemed to have been disallowed, but with the support of the Democrats we could seek approval in accordance with paragraph 49(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act'. Hogg said, `They have already sold their souls; they've already taken the money instead of principle'. The Minister responded, `Listen, Hogg, you should be all right. Senator Sowada will probably support the Opposition if she's consistent. By the way, comrade, are you paying for this phone call?'. Hogg said, `Well, no, comrade, but the Party is. Why do you ask?'. The Minister then said, `Well, it's something that haunts me from time to time'. That is the background to where we got to today. These regulations had to be brought in.

        We have seen this sort of behaviour a couple of times in the last year or so where the Clerks have been subjected to what can only be described as political attack.

The mindless and needless attack on the Clerk by Senator Bolkus was most unfortunate and needless.

        The reason I rise in the debate this evening is to draw attention to one of the concerns which was predicted at the time of the Select Committee on Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures and which, in my view, has now come to pass. It was certainly not mentioned by Senator Bolkus in his remarks. Senator Kernot, who is now in the chamber, will recall that there was concern. In the attempt to ban political advertising on radio and TV by political parties concern was expressed that special interest groups may be able to pick up broadcasts where the major political parties were banned. Unfortunately, this has occurred.

In general, I have no objection to interest groups strongly putting their views—they are entitled to put their views—but in this case we are dealing with a movement that is receiving very large handouts from the Government, handouts of the order of $40m. Honourable senators will remember the massive amount of money given in special grants to trade unions and the ACTU and the grants that Senator Cook gave to assist with union amalgamations. All this has added up to millions of dollars from the taxpayer.

The unions are now planning to run a $10m campaign against the coalition. The trade unions have received $40m from the taxpayer. We in this Parliament are concerned to ensure proper accountability of taxpayers' funds. I believe that what was predicted at this Committee has now come to pass. This will not be the last time that this issue is raised in the Parliament.

The making of regulations for New South Wales is necessary. There is absolutely no need to recanvass all the old arguments. You boys can fight all you like about who has raised the most funds, but it will not make any difference to the opinion of the Democrats.

The issue before the chamber tonight is a different one. As I said earlier, I have received no written legal advice on the need for this exercise this evening. There is really nothing else that needs a reply, other than for me to indicate that the Opposition has clearly lost the debate tonight.

          Second, as a fundamental principle we endorse the right of any person, employed or unemployed, to exercise their democratic rights, including the right to protest. We also endorse the right to privacy.

         In his report, the Privacy Commissioner quite rightly points to the sensitivity of actions which touch on the exercise of civil and political rights. But our democratic society is one in which rights are accompanied by obligations. Individuals must exercise their rights consistent with those obligations. Employed people have obligations under industrial law and people receiving income support payments such as Job Search allowance have obligations under social security law. Rights cannot be exercised with complete disregard of those obligations. The striking of a balance between these rights and obligations can be complex, and goes to the very heart of the issues canvassed by the Privacy Commissioner.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Similarly, the right to privacy, whilst of paramount importance, is not absolute. There is a longstanding tension between minimising fraud on the public purse and minimising intrusion by government bodies into the personal affairs of citizens. Again, a careful balance must be struck. The community expects no less. In working to achieve this balance, we welcome the involvement of the Privacy Commissioner.

         The particular and general issues raised by the Privacy Commissioner in relation to the operation of the Privacy Act deserve careful consideration by Government. A working group, chaired by the Attorney-General's Department and including representatives of the Department of Social Security, the Australian Federal Police and the Privacy Commissioner, will examine these matters.

         The Government accepts the comment of the Director of the Privacy Compliance Unit that the release of the information by the Australian Federal Police was not in accordance with its own internal procedures governing the release of information, but notes the Director's comment that the release was inadvertent—paragraph 3.2 of his report. The AFP officer who released the original list on or about 20 December 1991 was not an authorised records review officer under the AFP's internal procedures. The Government accepts the Privacy Commissioner's finding that the internal policy of the AFP relating to the release of information was not adequately implemented in this case.

         Shortly after the inadvertent release of the information, the AFP examined its internal procedures to ensure that as far as possible there would be no recurrence of this kind of incident. The Commissioner advises that the AFP's training relating to the release of information has been upgraded, that the AFP is confident that effective internal mechanisms now exist to control the release of information and that the need for proper supervision has been reinforced.

       <para>
        The Privacy Commissioner recommends that the Australian Federal Police undertake procedures, including the training of its officers, to prevent the recurrence of this kind of mistake.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As Senator Tate said, the AFP has taken action to address this issue. The Privacy Commissioner recommended that the Privacy Act be clarified in relation to whether agencies, once they became aware that information has been supplied mistakenly or without proper authority, are entitled to continue to act on the information or should return it to the source agency. Finally, the Privacy Commissioner concludes that he does not agree with the contention that the disclosure, even if authorised, did not breach information privacy principle 11 because it conformed to exception (e) of the principle. However, the Privacy Commissioner concludes:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It would greatly assist the effective administration of the Privacy Act if Parliament made it clear what, if any, constraints are meant to be provided by exception (e).
       </para>
       <para>
        Information Privacy Principle 11(e) states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A record-keeper who has possession or control of a record that contains personal information shall not disclose the information to a person, body or agency (other than the individual concerned) unless:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        (e)the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of the public revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the Privacy Commissioner's conclusions are pretty clear cut. First of all, he states that there has been a breach of information privacy principles 4 and 11. He expresses concern about the Social Security Act in so far as it outlines the circumstances in which a request can be made by the Department for information. Thirdly, he expresses concerns that the Privacy Act does not allow or preclude agencies from continuing to use unauthorised information rather than returning it to the source agency and, finally, recommends that the AFP should institute procedures to prevent the recurrence of such a mistake.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Privacy Commissioner's recommendations are clear cut because it is clear cut as to what actually happened. He lists in this report day by day the events that occurred. I will not go through all of those at this stage, but first of all DSS asked for the names of Aidex demonstrators despite its supposed expert knowledge of the Privacy Act. Secondly, a list drawn from the police records containing the names, addresses and dates of birth of 238 individuals was given to DSS by the AFP. Thirdly, the DSS distributed the list to regional offices and provided instructions for the review of those listed. Fourthly, one DSS officer even managed to get another copy of a part of the list from the AFP despite the officer in charge of the strategic intelligence in AFP advising the potential privacy constraints. Fifthly, three weeks after the release of the information, written advice was provided by the administrative law branch that the information should not be released. Sixthly, DSS had no record of receiving this advice from the administrative law branch.

         This is bureaucratic bungling at its worst in the AFP. It had lost advices; one area did not know what the other area was doing; and a total breakdown seemed to occur between junior and senior officers in the AFP. In the Department of Social Security, from the Secretary down, we had either a lack of knowledge of or a complete lack of respect for the Privacy Act. It was the Secretary who annotated the original press clipping and sent it to the Privacy, Fraud and Control Branch of DSS. I admit there is a possibility that the interpretation of that annotation on the press clipping could have been interpreted as `Can we obtain the information?'—in other words, as a question or as a  direction. Perhaps we should have expected the Secretary not to have put such an ambiguous note on the press release. Presumably the AFP liaison officer in DSS was either from the Privacy Branch or in contact with that branch, yet no-one in DSS, from the Secretary down—including the Privacy Branch—had seen fit to take account of the important privacy considerations.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Then we have the Government's response to the Privacy Commissioner's findings. It claims that it is a case of weighing up a person's rights and their obligations as social security beneficiaries. There are also claims of a longstanding tension between fraud and privacy. What evidence did DSS have that any of the other 200 protesters on the list, bar one, had anything to do with DSS? These claims just do not gel in this case; nor does the claim that the release of the information was inadvertent. It is not really a valid excuse. The admitted fact of the matter is that the release by the Australian Federal Police was in breach of its internal procedures governing the release of information, as well as a breach of the Privacy Act.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, it is not good enough for the Government to rely on the fact that the AFP examined its internal procedures after the release of the information. The coalition welcomes the setting up of the joint working group to examine the matters in the Privacy Commissioner's report. I give notice that we will be making sure that this working group is not just a damage control mechanism which will gloss over these very damning findings.

        That is something that we as a Senate could legitimately address because it is, as Senator Tate has said, a balance between fraud and privacy. We have to be very careful at any stage that information is passed between departments, especially at a junior level or without proper authority. We need to examine that and to respond as a Parliament to the Privacy Commissioner's concerns. I hope that in some way, especially through the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, we can address the two issues that the Privacy Commissioner has raised.

         , which relates to the release of information by the Australian Federal Police to the Department of Social Security. I do not intend to rehearse all the details that have been recounted by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and so ably by the previous speaker. However, I shall try to lift out one or two of the major, valuable conclusions that the Privacy Commissioner has drawn which should be considered very closely by the joint working group but which also set up certain standards.

         In the first instance, the Privacy Commissioner says that the disclosure of the arrest list information by the Australian Federal Police to the Department of Social Security was unauthorised. To a large extent that relates to the actual regulations of the Australian Federal Police, the mix up that occurred between various levels in the AFP. But also it leads back to the basic question of whether the Department of Social Security was in the first place entitled to make that request in the form in which it was made. We need to consider this matter very carefully. This is not just a conflict between fraud and privacy, as has been said before; it is much more sensitive because it concerns the exercise of civil and political rights. We must be certain that in our system, in a democracy we do not allow departments—which are understandably and justifiably concerned about protecting the Federal revenue—to encroach upon the civil and political rights of citizens.

         I note that the Privacy Commissioner in this report refers to the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security and the Australian Customs Service as having an almost unlimited licence in our system. In the perception of the community, they have licence to pursue people who are suspected of defrauding the public revenue system. In this case the Privacy Commissioner found that the request was informal. It was not a formal request. However, it extended to 283 people who had participated in the Aidex demonstration.

         The starting point of this exercise was a press report and a photograph of one demonstrator—one person. As it happens, that person's name was not included in the list of the 283 people whose names were requested by the Department. Therefore, we need to draw the conclusion that the Privacy Commissioner—and I heartily agree with him—found that section 11E, which enjoins government departments and officers to protect public revenue, does not entitle them to go on a fishing expedition. It does not entitle them to ask for the names of whole classes—whole groups—of people simply because they have engaged in political behaviour which was similar to or the same as the political behaviour of the one person that they had possible reason to believe should be investigated as to whether any fraud on the revenue was being committed.

         That is probably the single most important aspect of this report to which we should pay attention. Potentially it sets up a guideline for the future that government departments would be well advised to follow. Obviously the Australian Democrats welcome the recommendation of the Commissioner that the procedures both in the AFP and in the Department of Social Security be tightened and overhauled to ensure that the delegation of decision making to staff is properly supervised and that privacy considerations are protected at every turn.

         One other matter to which I would like to briefly refer is the recommendation by the Privacy Commissioner that the adequacy of the training of officers of the AFP be examined. I believe that matter requires detailed attention, in particular from the point of view, on which this report touches, where we have a potential conflict between the exercise of civil and political rights in demonstrations by Australian citizens extending to civil disobedience protests where the behaviour of both the protesters and the police officers requires examination and where we need to set up some standards.

         I believe that the training of officers goes beyond the principles of privacy. I believe that we need to consider that on occasions, when we are looking at the behaviour of police officers, it may be useful—it may even be imperative—that they do not insist upon enforcing the law to its very letter when it concerns people who are engaged in a political civil disobedience demonstration.

I congratulate the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). I think the setting up of the work group is very important. It does worry me—and it has worried me about the whole AIDEX issue—that several issues have involved the question of people with power suppressing other people. There is a common theme. I do not want to develop it except to say that I am concerned that in both the AIDEX dispute, which we are not dealing with, and the AIDEX demonstration a question of a lack of training and discipline was involved.

         While I congratulate the Minister, I am concerned. I think in both cases it comes back to the fact that we cannot blame officers if they are not trained properly. But in this case and in the case of the AIDEX demonstration itself I think it is necessary to look at the balance. Unfortunately, in this issue, I think we have a good example where the balance was not understood because of the lack of training and understanding of the people concerned.

        This Bill implements the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf, both of which were done at Rome in March 1988. The convention and the protocol were drafted at an international conference convened by the International Maritime Organisation to discuss international measures that needed to be taken to protect ships and fixed platforms from acts of terrorism.

         in the Mediterranean Sea, during which an American tourist, Leon Klinghoffer, was murdered. That incident exposed deficiencies in international law which were fatal to attempts to bring most of the terrorists to justice. I will not now rehearse the facts in that incident. They are dealt with in some detail in various accounts. Suffice it to say that at the trial that subsequently took place in Italy only five of the 15 accused appeared before the court and the three life sentences that were imposed were imposed in absentia on terrorists who were still at large.

         This unsatisfactory outcome was due, at least in part, to uncertainties about the legal position of each of the parties involved. The ship sailed under the Italian flag, the first port of call after the hijack was in Egypt and the principal victim was a citizen of the United States of America.

         It is instructive to consider what would have been the position if the convention had been in operation when the incident occurred. Italy, as the flag state, and Egypt, as the state in whose territory the offenders were `found', would each have had jurisdiction and would have been obliged to consider whether to initiate prosecutions themselves or to grant extradition to another state. The United States, as the state of the victim's nationality, would also have been able to establish jurisdiction under the convention. There would be clear obligations imposed on the relevant states to take action so as to ensure the alleged offenders did not escape prosecution. A legal regime of this kind would clearly have been preferable to the situation which obtained at the time and would constitute a greater deterrent to any future terrorist act of this nature. Apart from this specific instance, the convention and the protocol deal comprehensively with acts which endanger safe navigation or operations.

         Countless well-meaning programs devised by countless well-meaning Ministers and bureaucrats may well have given these people a warm inner glow, but these have often led nowhere or, even worse, have cruelly raised expectations only to dash them subsequently. The Government seems to believe that another $50m per year over the next five years, on top of the $1,150m that is spent per year on Aboriginal assistance, will make the difference between success and failure. So far, we regret to say, there has been a lot of failure.

         The simple fact is that the Aboriginal people want to be more responsible for themselves collectively and as individuals.

They, perhaps more than any other group in the country, cannot understand why, in a nation that is so wealthy and well placed as Australia—apart from this current recession that we had to have—they have been allowed to fall or have even been pushed so far off the pace.

         The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talks of creating jobs for the Aboriginal people and of creating economic independence. But the only answer has been to offer more money, with little improvement in the effectiveness of its delivery or accountability. There are, of course, many other and more immediate ways to give the Aboriginal people a better chance to make it on their own.

         For example, why will the Prime Minister not agree to the mining of Coronation Hill and let the Jawoyn people get on with their own lives? Why will he not let Aboriginal people negotiate directly with mining companies? Is the Prime Minister seriously saying that Aboriginal people are incapable of doing so? Is he saying that they have to be protected by two central land councils which, in so many instances, put political interests ahead of those of the Aboriginal people? There is no doubt that many Aboriginal people wanted to negotiate directly with the mining companies but were denied the right by the power of the land councils. Empowering the Aboriginal people to do that would deliver more economic independence than any quick-fix job creation program that the Government can dream up.

         Despite all ATSIC's good intentions and devoted workers, the fact is that in its current form ATSIC has failed the Aboriginal people, and it has failed them principally for two reasons. First, it remains predominantly a Canberra-based operation with 88c in every dollar of its spending still being decided in Canberra; and, secondly, it has an incredibly unwieldy structure of 60 regional councils and 850 regional counsellors, which has yet to produce the outcomes we are all promised. In the whole present ATSIC structure, where is the accountability and where is the performance? Where are the benchmarks against which to measure the desired improvements in Aboriginal health, housing, education and employment opportunities? Where are the deadlines against which these performances must be assessed?

         The long term success of ATSIC is vitally dependent on accountability, upon how the money is spent and upon how Aboriginal organisations and programs are monitored. We are still a long way short of attaining that success. For example, Aboriginal programs run by the Department of Employment, Education and Training are clearly in a mess. Successive Auditor-General's reports have highlighted a number of DEET's inefficiencies. We have referred to them here in the Senate often: insufficient verification checks for applications, total lack of coordination with other departments and no procedures to avoid duplication of benefits. A recent Auditor-General's report stated that auditing was not undertaken in relation to $80m of expenditure under Aboriginal education supplementary assistance because auditing had revealed that the departmental records were not adequate to determine whether payments were accurate or not.

         Promises are made that things will change, but little ever seems to happen. Not only is maladministration wasting taxpayers' money and building unnecessary duplication of services but, most importantly, it is denying economic and social opportunities to the Aboriginal people—the very thing it set out to achieve. There are 1,300 to 1,400 agencies involved in the delivery of Aboriginal assistance. For example, even in the State of Victoria, there are about 174 organisations for just over 12,000 Aboriginal people—that is one organisation for every 74 Aborigines. Clearly things have to change.

       I will give a brief explanation so that honourable senators will not head for the exits. Very rarely do honourable senators head for the exits during the adjournment debate; they all stay. But I want to make it absolutely clear that a procedural motion has been moved so that when the drafting of amendments has been completed we will come back and complete work on the broadcasting Bill. This is not a normal adjournment of the Senate. We will dispose of at least some of the adjournment speeches that have been listed tonight for the adjournment, but the House will still be in session after that.

         —I rise to speak very briefly and to bring the Senate's attention to several puzzling questions that need to be raised about a proposed Commonwealth office block for Newcastle. I will tell the Senate about the way in which the proposal has been mishandled by the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Social Security and then raise the matter of contradictory statements by the respective Ministers for those departments in relation to this proposal.

         To quickly paint the picture for the Senate, two constituents asked me to look into the proposal that the Department of Administrative Services, via the Australian Property Group, had been looking at—the possibility of a Commonwealth office block in Newcastle. The Department of Social Security in Newcastle was looking for new office space. The Australian Property Group obviously felt that it might be able to take this opportunity to test the feasibility of a Commonwealth office block for the city. This would bring together the various Commonwealth departments into one area and create a badly needed stimulus for the Newcastle CBD and the Newcastle construction industry. The Department of Social Security would be the major tenant in such a building.

         In order for its proposal to be taken more seriously by both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Finance, and ultimately the Cabinet, the Australian Property Group sought information so that its proposal could be as detailed as possible and therefore have a higher chance of success. Opengrand Pty Limited and the Doran group of companies, both of Newcastle, were able to provide such information. At no stage did the Australian Property Group suggest that the project was going ahead.

         Opengrand had an initial meeting with the APG in May 1990. Then over the period up to January this year the APG had several meetings with Opengrand and sought information on site costs, tenant and space requirements, an architectural brief and concept proposals. The APG also inspected possible Newcastle sites, and Opengrand was given a tour of the Parramatta office block to see the preferred layout.

Then in January this year the Department of Social Security advertised that it was looking for office space. Obviously, the Commonwealth office block was no longer a consideration to that Department.

         On writing to the respective Ministers to discover what was going on, I was informed by the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) on 10 April this year that the option of a Commonwealth office block was not considered practical and that the DSS had been advised by the Department of Administrative Services that it never had any plans for such a proposal. The letter from the Minister said it had been copied to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus). Three days later I received a letter from the Minister for Administrative Services informing me that DAS was currently considering the feasibility of constructing an office block in Newcastle but that no commitment had been given and none would be given until the Commonwealth Government departments in the area indicated their desire for space in such a building.

         I also find it deplorable that ALP members of the House of Representatives, who are supposed to represent the people in Newcastle, have practically ignored this proposal. They have not put their weight behind the idea and used their influence in their own Government. What good is having a voice in Canberra if that voice is not used at all? Surely, they can see that this project would be of enormous benefit to Newcastle, but it looks as though the people of the city have been taken for granted by the Labor Party yet again.

         —I think it is rather appropriate that I rise in this forum, particularly at this late hour, to discuss circuses. To be more specific, I am referring to the amendments to the Animal Welfare Bill 1992, currently before the ACT Assembly. The original Bill going through the Assembly required that circuses needed permits to be able to operate in the ACT and that strict animal care conditions must be met. The penalties for running a circus without a permit are $10,000 or one year's imprisonment or both.

         That Bill was supported by circus operators who rightly believed that if the circus animals were being mistreated in any way the circus involved should be prosecuted. Adequate penalties for any such offences are already set out in existing ACT legislation, not to mention that a code of practice exists in New South Wales. In the last couple of years there has been much improvement in the traditional circus industry because of the sensitivity and the sometimes exaggerated claims of animal liberation groups around Australia. Circus people are fighting for their lives and their existence. The circus industry has existed in Australia for over 150 years and is a part of our heritage. I believe that the circus people themselves are very well aware of their responsibilities but, unfortunately, they are sick of being misrepresented by these pressure groups.

         The animal welfare groups have exerted this pressure on the ACT Assembly, despite the fact that no circus in the ACT has ever been charged or convicted of committing any act of cruelty against animals. The Labor Caucus of the ACT Assembly has decided to amend the Animal Welfare Bill by inserting clauses to ban the exhibition and caging of exotic animals. These exotic animals to be banned will include giraffes, lions, monkeys, bears, elephants, tigers, cheetahs, pumas and leopards. In other words, these amendments effectively ban traditional circuses from operating in the ACT.

         The question that must be asked is why the Labor Government of the ACT Assembly is attempting to ban a popular form of family entertainment. Mrs Lorraine Grant, who is the performance director of Ashton's Circus, said that the last time the circus was in Canberra was April this year and 27,000 people from Canberra went along in the three-week period to see that circus. Obviously, Canberrans do not subscribe to the same sorts of attitudes that the ACT Government does.

         Why is there all this concern about a few exotic animals in circuses when the Assembly has many other more important things to deal with? Important matters which seem to be of very little concern to the Assembly include brothels, treatment of the mentally ill and abortion. We have seen just this week that it has legalised abortion clinics here. It seems to be okay to have abortions and murder innocent young unborn children, and it is okay for Canberra to be the pornography centre of Australia, but if someone wants to come along and have a traditional circus with a few animals acts, that is not good enough at all!

         The Publication Control (Amendment) Bill 1992 is currently before the Assembly, the key element of which is the banning of production and sale of X-rated videos in the ACT.

         A similar attack was made on the circus industry in North Sydney last year. I made the point in an adjournment speech that I made in the Senate that the North Sydney City Council had been lobbied very successfully by animal liberationists and it went ahead and decided to have a referendum. The referendum was held without giving the circus people any chance to prepare a case and after letting the animal liberationists spend a month putting their case. Sixty per cent of people in North Sydney voted in favour of allowing traditional circuses, with animal acts, to perform in North Sydney. That was a watershed decision for the circus industry. The industry thought that that should be the end of these sorts of pressures being put upon it, but not so. The animal liberationists just moved their campaign into Canberra. They have sucked in this particular Labor Government. As I said, there has never been a recorded case of a circus having been prosecuted in Canberra.

         This ACT Labor Government fell for the old thimble and pea trick that the animal welfare organisations have played. They gave the Government a list of 42 incidents that have happened since ANZFAS has been keeping records of circuses. I had a look through those incidents tonight. Out of the 42 incidents there are only six or seven cases of cruelty to animals. There were quite a lot more cases of cruelty to humans where the animals have had their revenge on some of the humans who had been mistreating them.

         Senator Sherry spoke on superannuation when the Committee presented its report on 18 June. He spoke to the Bill on 23 June. To a significant extent, he dealt with the Labor Party's policy on superannuation and he referred to the differences between that and our policy. That is, of course, legitimate debate. But then, for some reason best known to him, he went on to say in relation to pensions:

        What is the reality of the Opposition's policy?

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reality of the Opposition's policy is that in 30 to 40 years time, based on contribution levels of 5 per cent, it will effectively halve people's pensions.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not true, but that may be his understanding of it. He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That is the Opposition's policy going into the next election—to halve pension payments. That will be the outcome.

        We have Government Ministers commenting on our policy in just about every answer in every Question Time. They all attempt to present it in a way that indicates that they have read the Fightback package.

         It is very clear that Senator Sherry has not read the Fightback package—otherwise it would not be possible for him to make this assertion. It is part of the misinformation that Labor Party members keep spreading. They make assertions such as this, designed to frighten people, just as they will tell people that the GST is 15 per cent on top of what they pay now. Of course, that is not true, but that is the only level on which the Labor Party can attack our package; it cannot go to anything more substantial than to indulge in such scare tactics.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is very clear from the Fightback package that there are numerous provisions which greatly assist pensioners. In fact, they are very specifically dealt with. One paragraph says:
        </tab>

        More specific measures to compensate and assist age and service pensioners and retirees include—
       </para>
       <para>
        and the second measure is a GST tax credit. There are a range of other health insurance credits. The first point mentioned is:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . direct increases in age, service and all other pensions by eight per cent to over 28 per cent of average weekly earnings;
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason that I very confidently quote that and say that that is specifically an increase in pensions, and deliberately so, is that on 18 June when Senator Sherry was speaking again on the presentation of the report he referred to the Labor Party policy, relating it specifically to women, which was why I spoke on the superannuation Bill the other night. He said:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         With regard to those persons who do not spend significant time in the work force—that includes, particularly, women who, for significant periods, are in many cases bearing children—it is important to emphasise that the current old age pension will be maintained.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Everybody knows that the current old age pension is 26 per cent of average weekly earnings. If Senator Sherry had read the Fightback package, he would have read that our proposal will lift it to 28 per cent of average weekly earnings when he himself clearly knows that it is presently—and likely to remain under the Labor Government—26 per cent of average weekly earnings. Every time the Labor Party does this it is necessary to get up and explain where it is wrong. It may be that Senator Sherry was misunderstanding what it meant. I do not know whether he misunderstood or not. I cannot tell what his state of mind was when he made his remarks in the first speech he made when referring to our policy. I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the facts and to where he is quite wrong.

At this point, I seek leave to table two sets of documents, one headed `Rutland Contractors' and the other `Jeff James (Constructions) Pty Ltd', which outline some of the substantial problems which exist with this particular Council and its operations.

         —I thank the Senate and I thank Senator Collins. I wish to quote from one of the reports prepared for Rutland contractors by Kinhill Cameron McNamara. This relates to some difficulties it has had with the construction of the Black Boy Creek access road. It asked the consultants Kinhill Cameron McNamara to investigate some of the difficulties it was having with the Council. In particular, it was having a great deal of difficulty because the Council had snatched from it the contractor's performance guarantee—its bank guarantee. It is alleged that the Council claimed this bank guarantee before the end of the six-month defect liability period and without giving any reason why that guarantee should be called in. Subsequent to that, the Council provided the contractors with a list of supposed defects and purported to extend the length of the defect liability period for a further six months. Kinhill Cameron McNamara investigated many of these claims and found them to be without substance or found them to be design faults for which the contractors were not responsible. It is very disturbing to note the conclusion of the report, which says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is our firm professional opinion that the administration of this Contract warrants investigation and that particular decisions by the Superintendent, Mr Brian Hogan, and/or the Woorabinda Land Council or the advice upon which they have acted have been unfairly onerous to the Contractor, AJ &amp; KM Rutland.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        That is very disturbing in itself, but it is disturbing because it is just one of a number of complaints of this nature. Very serious allegations have been raised with me by contractors in relation to Mr Hogan and his associate, who masquerade under a business name but who are alleged not to be qualified for the task for which they hold themselves out. In so doing, they are really conning the Aboriginal Council and nobody else because they are giving advice which they are incapable of giving. They are exercising supervision over matters which are beyond their capabilities. That is one matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are also concerns about their previous business dealings and the results of those previous business dealings that also deserve consideration. It has been alleged that at some time when they were consultants to the Council or shortly before one or both of these gentlemen was a bankrupt. Of course, I would have grave concerns about somebody who was a bankrupt, if it was so shown, being an adviser to an Aboriginal council, or any other council for that matter.

         I believe that these matters deserve very serious consideration. The list of concerns that was given to me is several pages long. I do not intend to go into it tonight. Suffice to say, I hope the matter will be taken up by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). I am sure that the Minister would also be very concerned about these allegations, as I know he is particularly interested in improving accountability and ensuring good administration of Aboriginal councils and good advice to the Aboriginal councils themselves. I close by saying that I hope the Department of Aboriginal Affairs will contact me to discuss these matters in detail but, in any event, if it does not do so, I shall be raising the matter in Estimates in substantial detail.

         —Today in Question Time and following Question Time in noting my answer, Senator Winston Crane made what he described as a serious charge against me and which I regard as a serious allegation. He said:

       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Why has the Minister approved payments of $2,267 and $634 for travel and related expenses for 3 December 1991 and 17 December 1991, respectively, to his mate Mr Kevin Reynolds, the Secretary of the Western Australian Builders Labourers Federation, as these payments are clearly outside the terms of his own letter and against the advice of his own Department and his own adviser?
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the allegation put in positive terms by Senator Crane. It is an allegation which is not true. No money has been paid to Mr Reynolds for claims for travel to meetings in Canberra on either 3 December or 17 December last year and no decision to do so has been made by me.

         I want to go to the facts and not the untrue allegations that Senator Crane is making. I also provide all documents and all possible details in making this full statement. Mr Reynolds travelled to Canberra from Perth for meetings on 3 December for three purposes: first, the launch of the Government's building industry reform strategy—Mr Reynolds played an important role in developing this strategy through the Government's working party on industrial relations reform in the building industry—secondly, for the inaugural meeting of the Government's Construction Industry Development Council; and, thirdly, and most importantly, for a meeting with me as Minister for Industrial Relations to discuss further Government legislation arising from our 1990 legislation which contained the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Mr Reynolds's discussions with me on this critical issue were necessary, irrespective of any other business he had in Canberra that day. He travelled to Canberra for that meeting at my express request. The meeting was required at that time because the Government was in the process of drafting the Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration Consequential Provisions) Amendment Bill to apply to certain specified State associations of the BLF to enter a form of registration with the BWIU and allow for further amalgamation.

         Because of the time and distance involved in travel from Western Australia, as Senator Crane would well know, it was sensible to have this meeting in conjunction with the launch of the building industry strategy and inaugural council meeting. I stress the importance and necessity to have this meeting at this time. The meeting, of course, was necessary in Canberra, as the Senate was sitting in all of December that year.

         On 17 December Mr Reynolds travelled from Melbourne to Canberra to continue the discussions of 3 December on the legislation and the amalgamation with both me and Mr Stan Sharkey, Federal Secretary of the BWIU. On 20 January 1992 Mr Reynolds wrote two letters addressed to the Department of Industrial Relations, one seeking reimbursement for a return air fare Perth-Canberra for the meeting with me on 3 December, and the other seeking reimbursement for an air fare Melbourne-Canberra-Melbourne and one night's accommodation in Canberra for 17 December. Both meetings extended over a number of hours; both were held during the evening because of parliamentary and other commitments earlier on each day. My Department subsequently put formal advice to my office dated 6 May 1992 arising from Mr Reynolds's requests for reimbursement. That advice was tabled by Senator Crane today.

         My Department advised that Mr Reynolds's claims were outside the conditions governing payment for travel and costs related to the Government's industrial relations working party which the Government funded and that, furthermore, members of the council had been informed by me in a letter dated 23 October 1991 that their attendance at council meetings would be at their own cost. A member of my staff, one of my advisers, Mr Ashley Mason, notated on my Department's advice of 6 May that in his view we should not pay for Mr Reynolds's expenses for 3 December, but indicated that he did not know whether we should pay for the expenses of 17 December. His view was based on the understanding that the purpose of the 3 December meeting travel was to attend the Construction Industry Development Council.

        The In Principle Reform Agreement (copy enclosed) is the cornerstone of the strategy.

        It must be stressed that the framework for the Code is at a very early stage of development, and that there will be extensive consultations with all sections of the industry and relevant areas of Commonwealth, State and Territory administrations before it is finalised. It is intended that the Code be progressively implemented by the Commonwealth and its agencies from 1 July 1992.

        To facilitate the process of workplace reform, the Government has already provided considerable assistance to the building and construction industry through the Workplace Reform Program by providing grants for the engagement of workchange advisers. The work of the advisers has been crucial at the workplace level, and this important contribution will need to continue in close consultation with the work of the Reform Agency.

        The Government has proposed a funding package to facilitate the implementation of the strategy, but its finalisation is dependent upon there being a significant contribution from the industry both in cash and in kind, and it is in this area that we invite the immediate attention of your organisation.

         The Opposition has launched a systematic campaign over a period of months seeking to smear me and, through me, the Government in this place. Senator Crane has played a key role in that campaign. It is in my view an abuse of the Senate and, if it continues, I believe that the Senate should censure Senator Crane.

         One final point: material that Senator Crane tabled this afternoon was material which he obtained improperly from my Department. This raises two serious possibilities. The first is that material may have been leaked selectively in order to mislead Senator Crane into believing that I had improperly authorised expenditures when I had not. That is the most honourable interpretation I can give to the situation that Senator Crane is in—that is, he is being duped.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But there is a second possibility. If the foregoing is not the case and Senator Crane has been provided with additional material of a kind that I have now freely incorporated within the record of the Senate, Senator Crane himself has a case to answer. If he has a full set of documents, he would know that the allegations he made this afternoon are wrong. In that case, he has committed a very serious abuse of the Senate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Furthermore, if Senator Crane has a full set of the documents, why did he not table them all when he raised those issues this afternoon? The answer is clear. If he has a full set of documents, he himself is using them selectively to try to cause malicious damage to both me as a Minister and the Government. In either case, these are serious abuses of the Senate and warrant serious consideration on all sides of the Senate.

         Senator Crane referred to amounts of $4,336 and $1,669 today. These figures are in the documents tabled not by Senator Crane but by me. Senator Crane obviously therefore had access to those figures which are in documents he did not release. Senator Crane should indicate from where he obtained those figures because it would appear that prima facie he falls under serious possibility No. 2 outlined above. If he does fall within that possibility, he has acted mischievously and maliciously and should be censured.

         However, I totally reject the proposition of the Minister that I have acted improperly in any way. I asked the Minister a question today relating to some documents that, to put it quite bluntly, were leaked from either his office or his Department—they both leak like sieves. That is why I have them in my possession, and for no other reason. I make the point at the outset that I did not obtain them improperly. I acknowledge quite clearly that I also had the document relating to the figures I quoted this afternoon, but those figures were not relevant to my question.

         I want to make reference to the note about these meetings, because I certainly got the impression from the Minister here tonight that, in his view, those meetings were legitimate in terms of the program, yet his own adviser wrote on the note that he did not even know what the meeting was about. The letter to Mr Mason with regard to reimbursement of travel from the WABLF says:

        My question today did not relate to those particular claims. The Minister has tabled documents relating to those claims and they are currently before the Senate. As I said earlier, I had those documents but did not incorporate them in

        because they did not relate to my question. When looking at the documents it is interesting to note that the airfares are for 18 April, 18 May and 17 July. Those dates match three lots of expenses for accommodation on 18 April, 18 May and 17 July but there are also additional accommodation claims on 14 February, 7 March, 13 March and 25 March. The claims vary significantly. It is interesting to note the claims for accommodation. One claim is for $517.50 and another is for $172.50.

         I raise those particular claims because there are cents attached to the dollar amount. I have stayed at many hotels during my life and I have never had a room hire charge which ended in cents. I question whether all of those accommodation claims were for accommodation or whether they included other items. I also ask the Minister whether invoices and air tickets accompanied these claims.

         This afternoon I referred to airfares from Perth to Canberra and return of $2,267. At that particular time the highest first class fare between Perth and Canberra, going through Sydney—which most honourable senators would know is more expensive than travelling through Melbourne or Adelaide—was $1,850. There is a significant difference between the going first class rate and the claim.

I have put down a full and open statement, tabling documents that are new and fresh, to all of these allegations so that not only are the allegations answered but all of the circumstances surrounding or pertaining to them in any way, shape or form are covered as well. This is a complete, open and thorough statement. It establishes that the allegation made against me by Senator Crane in

         Senator Crane made some fresh allegations. As I recall them, those fresh allegations were that somehow or another I am party to a falsification of payments based on reimbursements made on accounts delivered to my Department. In the first instance, I have never seen those accounts and it is not something that in the ordinary course of events I would expect to see, nor would anyone want me to expect to see them. The reimbursements that were made for this particular series of meetings concern not only Mr Reynolds—about whom I have tabled a complete set of reimbursements—but also the MBHR, the Victorian Department of Labor, the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union of Australia, the Building Industry Specialist Contractors Organisation of Australia, the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors and the Building Owners and Managers Association of Australia. I have said in my statement that as soon as I can collate all of those expenses I will make a statement and make them available publicly so that they too could be scrutinised.

         Mr Reynolds was one person. All of the individuals who represented those organisations were other persons who obtained reimbursement. I note that there is nothing wrong in that, and that was acknowledged this afternoon. What is now being alleged is that amounts were improperly reimbursed by my Department. I never saw the claim; I never authorised the reimbursement; but I have absolutely no grounds for believing that officers of my Department have acted improperly or have reimbursed beyond what is the required level. I have no reason for believing that. As Senator Crane has made the allegation—

After I had explained that I would look at the  documents put before us carefully and assess them, Senator Cook made further claims that I made allegations against him and his Department. I did; it is true. It is indeed true that I asked whether there were tickets and supporting documents for those particular claims. I think that is a reasonable question. The Minister chose not to answer that and instead came out with a barrage of allegations against me.

         It is indeed unfortunate that the Minister has left as he raised again this issue of there not being sufficient money to pay these accounts. Yet we see on this particular departmental minute which I tabled here today headed `Reimbursement of Travel—WABLF', that even though Ashley Mason—picking up the Minister's words—said, `We should not pay for Reynolds' expenses', he has also written on this particular document that there is $13,000 left in the fund. That seems to me to make a mockery of the claim that there was no money in the bin to pay these additional funds. I would be rather interested to see what has actually occurred here today in terms of the matters I raised in this chamber in Question Time and again here tonight.

         I wish to follow this through to get to the bottom of all those expenses—not only those that have been paid to Mr Reynolds, but also those that have been paid to other bodies. There was initially a sum of $19,000, as we were able to extract through Estimates and other means. If the level of expenses and the number of organisations that it has been claimed have been paid this money for setting up this particular fund, at the sorts of levels that these accounts amount to—some $10,000—one must also beg the question of whether that really represents the amount.

         I will leave my comments at that, except to reinforce the question why, even though it was indicated that there was $13,000 left in that particular fund, all of a sudden after a question is asked, is the finance not available? I would be interested to look at the document of 1 June because I think that would reveal a lot to this chamber in terms of what the instructions were from the Minister to his Department with regard to payments to Mr Kevin Reynolds.

It will depend significantly on their ability to ensure that they are truly reflecting the community attitudes of taste and decency in relation to the classifications for pay TV and what level of violence and depictions of sex should be allowed.

         I moved a previous amendment which, unfortunately, because of the time limits that were on us, caused us some considerable problems in explaining the meaning of the proposal. I reiterate that I was a bit sorry to see that proposal go down the gurgler without any real discussion about it. My amendment really was to ensure that prior to appointment to the ABA there would be broad consultations made. That recommendation was in a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee of which many of Senator Schacht's mates were members. In fact, John Langmore and Colin Hollis were on the Committee, and John Sanderson was the Chairman of the Committee, as far as I can remember.

         Over the last few weeks, in what was a rather rapid introduction into this portfolio, I have actually succeeded in speaking to a wide range of people who would be considered by everyone to be the serious contenders for pay TV. Some of those people have agreed with the Government's proposals wholeheartedly; others have agreed to them with reservations; and some have opposed them.

They all said one thing to me, and I can assure honourable senators that this is an absolute fact. They said, `Look, whatever else you do—whether it is four transponders and two, or three transponders and one and one and one, or six transponders or whatever—get on and do it'. That is a consistent theme that I have heard for the last three weeks from them all. They all said, `Look, we think this has some problems with it'. Others said, `We're on the beach and we intend to stay there'. That is a quote from one of the very serious contenders; one with a wallet, I might add, that actually has the finance to support it. They said, `We have some concerns about it. We think it can be fixed up around the edges by enhancing a few things, but get on with it'. That is what they all said to me.

         The reason I raise that is deliberate. The shadow Minister did say in his address—and I thank him for it—that as concerned as he was about the Government's proposal, he still thought that it was a commercially viable proposal. I thought that was an extremely responsible thing for him to say. I noted it and I thank him for it. It would have been irresponsible for him to have publicly talked it down. I know he wants pay TV. He might not be personally enthusiastic about it, but I know he wants to see it for this country because of the jobs that it will create. It will create jobs if it is given an opportunity to do so. I acknowledge the statement that the shadow Minister made that, despite his concerns and despite the fact that he thought the commerciality had been eroded to some extent, it was still a commercial proposition. I thought that was a responsible thing to say when, if he had been after the points, he could easily have gone the other way and said that he thought it was a lemon. He did not say that.

They have a principled position on this, which I respect, but I do not think they have a very real position on it. I think their position on most things is principled and unreal. I have made that point before many times in debate, and I might add so have members of the Opposition on regular occasions.

I got sick and tired of people saying, `It only has 80 people. Why worry about it?' It all adds up; that is my view. But this one could genuinely have produced 4,000 jobs. That is not an over the top assertion. Senator Alston knows it is true. The shadow Minister knows it is true. I have had all the people who were going to provide those jobs trooping through my office telling me that it was true—the people who were going to make the plastic dishes; the people who were going to train the installers. Whole business were going to be set up. Honourable senators should have a look at New Zealand if they do not believe me—it is over there to have a look at. It is a tiny market compared with ours, but it is a very viable business. I know that Senator Powell has seen it because she told me. It is a viable business for New Zealanders putting this stuff in in such a small market.

This is going to totally destroy whatever interest was out there—and the interest was intense—in putting anything together, in raising finance and even in investigating whether it is now possible.

She does not want to do it in front of the children. She is delighted, and saying so, that it will be buried in a Senate committee. But the industry will not be delighted—and the shadow Minister knows it and so does everyone else on that side. The industry was keen to get geared up and get going. Its representatives have been trooping through my office one at a time. I must have seen, I think, 20 or 30 of them in the last fortnight all saying the same thing: `It might not be the best, it might not be the flashest, it might not be the one we wanted, but for God's sake do it'.

The wowsers might; the Tasmanian mafia might; and the people who do not want adults to see anything that is not produced by Walt Disney will love it. But the people who were actually prepared to put an industry together and employ a very large number of Australians in doing it will hate this decision—and they will let the Opposition know, I have no doubt, if they have not done so already. They will hate this decision. It will sap business confidence at a time when we can do without it being sapped.

         It is preposterous hypocrisy to have someone getting up and pretending that somehow a delay whilst a Senate committee considers what has been said to us on many fronts by the industry to be a totally unworkable proposal should somehow almost kill the future of pay television in this country. I find it an extraordinary proposition to hear Senator Collins stand up with a straight face and say that what they all said consistently was, `We don't care what model you come up with, for God's sake, put it through'. I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind saying, `I've got $500m in my back pocket; I'm prepared to put it on the table and walk away with a smile in 12 months time'. That is not what they are saying to us. They are saying to us, `For God's sake, what about what the Democrats are saying? A seven-year exclusivity period is about the only way in which the Government will get its mickey mouse four transponder licences into viable shape. This is an infant industry which needs all the protection in the world'. People would not have a bar of it.

         People from very diverse sections of the industry sat around the table all pleading with us in one shape or form to have the matter delayed to expose the absolute nonsense that arose late at night when Senator Collins got rolled. I would have thought that takes a bit of doing, but he got rolled last night as well. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has once again told him that he will not have a bar of the ABC being in pay television. It is an outrageous situation to find Senator Collins now coming in here and pretending that somehow the future of pay television is on the line because a committee is to look at something which his Party has been instrumental in deferring for the last 10 or 12 years. Who else ought to claim the credit for the current moratorium? Why have we a moratorium on pay television in this country? Because the Government insisted on it. Mr Duffy, when he was communications Minister, insisted on it.

I want to reassure the Minister, in case he has forgotten how to count, that there will be pay TV. The Labor Party supports it and so do the Opposition parties. The Government has the numbers for pay TV. The Australian Democrats quite openly acknowledged that it did not want pay TV, but we can count as well. So when the Government decided that the moratorium would be lifted our game had to shift. We then had to take on board the task of seeing that, if we are to have pay TV in this country, a few benchmarks were put down towards which we could work when presented with whatever proposal was eventually going to come out.

         The two basic benchmarks were the Australian television consuming public in all its technologies and, as a spin off of that, the viability in particular of the free to air operators, both commercial and the ABC, because for a very long time, probably forever, the majority of Australians will be free to air television watchers. We have looked at the various proposals that have been put forward—we have all waited with bated breath—and we finally got the one that we did. Within that period of time those concerns were paramount to us.

        It goes on. As of tonight the intention is to explore these concerns and also, since the prospect has been raised by the Opposition, to do what we believe, in the end, is the best to provide for involvement by the ABC, which will make a marked difference to what Australians receive via pay television.

         I am not saying that pay television should not deliver this, that or the other thing, but I am saying that through some of its broadcasts it should be producing something that is worth while. I am absolutely positive that it will when the ABC is involved. The sooner that happens the better. The more security and the more assistance that the ABC has in doing that the better. For these reasons, we are certainly very happy that our initial proposal for reference of the pay television provisions of the Broadcasting Services Bill to a committee has been accepted. We support the amendment.

         He went on to say something even more extraordinary, in defending a decision to send this commercial matter off to a Senate committee. I make no bones about saying this. He went on to say—and Senator Baume quoted him with support—not only that 4,000 jobs were not going to make much of a dent in a million, but also that those jobs may last for only 12 months and then fall over and people would be back out of work again. I tell those opposite that the cold, hard fact is—and Senator Baume, who has had some commercial experience, knows it—that that is what happens in the labour market all the time with businesses.

The amendment purports to remove part 7 from the Bill, I presume; it does not do it. It says that `Part 7, pages 39 to 45, clauses 93 to 114', will be removed. The only trouble is that it still leaves two clauses of part 7. That is easily fixed, but that will have to be amended, if the Senate agrees, to read `pages 39 to 46' and `clauses 93 to 116'.

         —I rise to oppose this amendment. I do so knowing full well that the Democrats and the Opposition have the numbers to carry the amendment. We have heard much from Senator Alston tonight, saying that the reason for this is that an endless number of people have come to see him, lobbying the Opposition and saying that the model that the Government has proposed was unworkable, flawed, et cetera. I say to Senator Alston that some of us have been involved in listening to people for nearly two years, lobbying on various forms of how they want to see pay television operate in Australia.

         The best quote of all—it has been hackneyed around and I have used it before—is that it is a bit like Mandy Rice-Davies saying, `Well, they would say that, wouldn't they?'. The endless interest groups want to get a structure that favours their particular interest and their particular advantage. Dare I say it: there is an endless range of structures that can be put in operation about pay television. When this Committee returns with whatever it may recommend—with majority or minority reports—about a possible structure for the operation of pay television, there will still be endless whingeing and complaints from interest groups in the community who say, `This system won't work, this won't operate' because it obviously does not suit their vested interests.

         What we have operating in pay television in any structure we look at, no matter how we try to structure it, are three conflicting principles: firstly, having a model that provides competition; secondly, diversity of ownership; and, thirdly, having exclusivity or monopoly operation to get the thing going to encourage investment. In many ways those three principles are in conflict with each other. As we try to balance out the issues of competition, diversity of ownership and exclusivity, we will end up with differences of opinion and we will not be able to satisfy all of them.

         I suspect that after another three or four months the Committee will come back with a different model. There will be complaints and belly-aches about it. Whatever is finally adopted will not be perfect. After 18 months to two years of listening to all the various propositions, there is no perfect model. Technology itself will overturn any model that I, the Opposition or anyone else may care to adopt. It may last four or five years. Whether it will be a mixture of satellite delivery, fibre optic delivery, microwave or narrowcast delivery—

         —All I can say to Senator Alston, in some sense of weariness having been at this for about 18 months, on the issue of exclusivity, for example, is that I have had people sit in my office and say that they want 15 years exclusivity to make a quid. Some people want that. Others come in and say that they do not want any exclusivity at all. Others want no cross-ownership rules at all. Others want absolute cross-ownership rules. As we hear it all, we can make a good argument for most, if we deal with it rationally, but in the end we will have to come up with a model and it will not be perfect if we go on the basis of trying to get a consensus amongst people.

         Another thing that will lead to endless conflict in the model is the argument over how much program content restrictions or Australian content rules are applied vis-a-vis free to air rules. We will also have arguments about how much of it should be made in Australia. What are the industry specifications? Should we insist on how the first operator structures its black box and decoder so that every subsequent operator has to use the same black box and the same decoder so that we get one industry standard?

         There will be an endless range of opinion about that and arguments that if it is given to the first one, it will then set the tone for the rest of the industry. The Government is obviously aware, as I said before, that the Opposition has the numbers to impose the referral of this matter to a committee and as a result some of us have been asked to volunteer to go on the Select Committee.

         —One thing we know for certain; whatever deficiencies Senator Alston has, Senator Kemp has no chance of rolling him in the party room to get on a committee after his startlingly bad performance on the ad ban Select Committee. The only thing I have to say with some slight joy is that Senator Walters will not be on this Committee with me. After putting up with Senator Walters on the 0055 Committee, that is a matter of great relief.

         I conclude with remarks about the 0055 Committee, which is the shorthand name for it. It is true that people like Senator Walters are greatly concerned about restricting people's access to material that does not fit their criteria. Senator Walters and her ilk are the last great censors. They try to control what adults should be able to see and make choices about seeing. That is not surprising. She has always had that authoritarian streak about her. It has certainly come out in the 0055 Committee.

         I look forward only in one sense to being a part of this Committee; that is, again seeing the range of opinion put forward. Senator Alston has put forward the Opposition's amendment here tonight, but he will find that there are a lot of people who will oppose what the Liberal Party proposes for pay television. Whatever is put up, there will be strong opposition to it. This amendment is unnecessary, but the Opposition has the numbers to carry it. I hope that when we come back in September, despite the whingeing from various vested interests, we can establish pay television in Australia.

Not one of the operating companies in this group—quite apart from Mr Keating's private company and quite apart from Euphron, which we only found out as a result of searches that he half owns—has presented an annual report to the Australian Securities Commission which has been in a state to be communicated to the public for three years. In other words, the public has no access to any reports of substance of any of these companies, which are companies involved in a multi-million dollar joint project. This is the matter of substance.

         —I draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that the Brown and Hatton group which was formed in 1988 did not put in a tax return for 1988-89—I suppose there was nothing to report anyway. It did put in a return for 1989-90 on 10 January 1992. A couple of weeks later it received a letter from the Securities Commission asking it to put in a meaningful return that included such vital elements as the statement of the accounts and so on. In other words, the return was a phoney return. That letter of early January had not been responded to, so there was no annual return available for public scrutiny by, when I last checked, 20 June this year.

         Another return was magically put in earlier this month after this matter became public. It has still not been processed. When we look down the list—Jensay, Brown and Hatton Wholesale, Brown and Hatton Rural, Olympia Refrigeration and so on—we see that no return has ever been submitted. This is a serious matter. In fact, it has been raised consistently by the Australian Securities Commission. In a press release on 11 December 1991, the Australian Securities Commission noted that nearly 80,000 penalty notices had so far been issued to companies and directors which had failed to lodge annual returns in response to earlier warnings. The ASC warned that failure to respond to these notices could result in substantial fines and the cancellation of company registrations.

         This matter has come to the attention of company directors. I would have thought that those companies involved in schemes in which the Prime Minister is a major shareholder would have felt at least some duty—some duty to him—to put in returns. I stress that this Government sought to divert attention away from that serious matter by playing the goat, concentrating the issue entirely on the Prime Minister's own late return. The substance of this matter is serious and cannot be concealed by Senator Ray's ridiculous interjections, such as the one he made tonight.

        This statement is significant because Mr Keating acquired his interest while Mr Hawke was still Prime Minister. It would be reasonable to ask: did the then Treasurer, when he acquired this interest on 15 May 1991, advise the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke—as he was required to—that he had acquired a $430,000 half interest in a holding company owning a piggery and a refrigeration fabrication business. Mr Keating was obliged to tell Mr Hawke. I wonder whether he did. Perhaps the media would like to ask Mr Hawke. It is interesting that we have a pattern of concealment. I wonder whether it was also concealed from Mr Hawke in defiance of the Cabinet handbook.

         There is also a requirement in the Cabinet handbook which obliges Ministers to declare:

        Any other matter which may give rise to a conflict between duty and interest . . .

        The handbook further states:

        I assure the Prime Minister that the ownership of a large piggery operation involved in a multi-million dollar joint venture is not an interest which can be said to be shared with the rest of the community. The handbook continues:

        Any such declarations will be recorded by Cabinet officers.

       <para>
        That seems pretty straightforward. I wonder whether the Prime Minister has ever made such a declaration in relation to the Danpork multi-million dollar, multinational pig joint venture in which he holds a half interest in the Australian holding company. Mr Keating might like to address these sorts of matters instead of just ringing up newspaper editors and abusing them for having dared to write about his interests and wealth. Fortunately,

         In conclusion, the companies in which the Prime Minister has major investments have an appalling record of failing to submit annual reports. The Prime Minister has an obligation to reveal whether he met the requirements of reporting of the Cabinet handbook. We have already seen that in his statement of declaration of interest there was no suggestion that his interest was a half interest and that he had a nominee on the Board of the company of which he said he was not a director. He said that he did not have control when, in fact, he shared control. In this overall pattern of concealment one simply wonders what on earth is going on. Why has it been taking place? What are the potential conflicts of interest? Will the Prime Minister and all his companies eventually come clean?

If detailed information on Australian policies with regard to a particular issue is required, I would be happy to provide it. In brief, however, Australia is strongly supporting the concept of state liability for nuclear damage. A key objective is to seek a commitment from states hosting nuclear facilities that adequate compensation will be available to victims of damage arising from those facilities.

        (4) It is not possible to provide an accurate accounting of annual expenditure on support for Australian delegations to the negotiations on nuclear liability as costs relate to both salary and travel expenses. Following is an estimate for each year based on the airfare and travel allowance costs of non Vienna-based participants in the negotiations. (It should be noted that in most cases Australia-based delegation members would, while away from Australia, attend at least one and possibly more meetings or conferences unrelated to nuclear liability. The following figures do not take such other duties into account, nor the time of Vienna-based officials on the delegations and Canberra-based officials who contribute to the briefing for the meetings.)

        (1) As I have advised Senator Bell in answer to previous questions on this matter, Evandale Hospital is a State Government facility and responsibility for it rests with the Tasmanian Government. While the Commonwealth approved the transfer of the bed approvals to Evandale Hospital, this was at the request of the State Government. Subsequent to that, it was the Tasmanian Government which decided to close Evandale Hospital.
