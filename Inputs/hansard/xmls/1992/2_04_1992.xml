Honourable senators would know that the Civil Aviation Authority, under its extremely competent board and senior management, has been implementing the policy of the Government in undergoing a very major restructuring of the organisation which, over a period of five years, will lead to a reduction of almost half its staff.

The charges cover en route air traffic control services, terminal navigation and rescue and fire facilities.

         The CAA has also adopted the approach of buying systems which are already available and has avoided, where possible, the higher risk and often expensive approach of developing its own systems. The TAATS project is the most recent example of this new approach, I am pleased to say. The dramatic efficiency gains achieved by the CAA in a very short time are to be commended. This further advances the efficiency gains already enjoyed by the aviation industry and the travelling public as a result of the Government's micro-economic reform program.

         The major airlines have cut their own staff by around 30 per cent in the past 12 months and are also carrying 30 per cent more passengers than they were prior to that time. This has flowed through to consumers, with average air fare costs falling significantly since October 1990. The CAA's reduced charges will assist the airlines to operate even more efficiently and maintain these competitive air fares.

         —Senator Loosley would no doubt have seen a report in yesterday's newspapers suggesting that the United States trade representative, Carla Hills, released an indicative watch list of countries which the United States considered were costing its exporters millions of dollars. The report suggested that six pages of the report had been devoted to Australia's sins. This matter was raised with me by United States officials twice two weeks ago today. It was raised by firstly Barbara Franklin, who is the new United States Secretary of Commerce, and by Carla Hills's deputy as trade representative, Mr Moskow. They both suggested that if we were to proceed with any Australian content rules on pay television, they would be particularly horrified. They also suggested that our rules on advertising, even the recently liberalised ones, and our rules for Australian content quotas on free to air television now were in some way hindrances to their trade. I took particular offence to that line, given the real relationship between the two countries in trade overall, but particularly in film and television production.

         I pointed out to both august United States representatives that we were generously allowed to compete for about 8 per cent of their sugar market and 2 per cent of their dairy market and no more. They were able to wage war on our wheat farmers in markets all around the world and even on the very question that they were raising with me, the United States provides about 80 per cent of Australian imports of television and film and there is, of course, only a tiny percentage of ours going over there. In fact, the trade deficit just on this one matter, that is film and television, is about $316m on the last available figures. So the United States, with its massive entertainment industry, is able to have a huge trade surplus with Australia on this one question, yet any attempt by Australia to have local content rules to make sure that our own identity, our own culture, is in some way protected will apparently bring about retaliation from the biggest brother.

         It is worth noting that Australian drama—the centrepiece of local content rules—accounted for 597 hours out of 4,914 hours available across the three networks in 1988-89. So we are looking at only one-eighth of the time on drama being taken by Australian drama because of local content rules and the United States wants to tell us that it thinks that is too much. Anyone who has watched the latest cultural offering from the United States, a program called

Secondly, does the Minister think it is fair to continue to penalise unemployed people who are trying to help themselves and the community?

Obviously, during a recession when unemployment numbers are very high, it is particularly important to allow for voluntary work and not to be overly harsh on those who participate in it, remembering always that the basic test for receipt of unemployment benefit is being available for full time work. I do not think one can undermine the test significantly, but certainly there is room at the margin for movement. I thought that movement had been occurring.

         —I have seen claims by the Opposition that savings of that magnitude could be made out of the Overseas Property Group's budget. In the Opposition's consumption tax package there is a claim that $20m can be saved out of that budget of $130m. Up until the last couple of days we have proceeded on the basis that those savings could have been made, as was indicated in the Fightback document, by the process of commercialisation or contracting out. The only problem has been—as I indicated two days ago—that, of the $130m budget for the Overseas Property Group, already $127m is contracted out to the private sector. So, if one believed the Fightback package, that degree of savings would have to be made out of an all-up sum of $3.3m. Obviously, that is impossible.

         —He now says that is right. If the Liberals by some chance get into power, there will be a reduction in the Overseas Property Group's budget of $20m. Leaving aside the basic inconsistency between Senator Parer's statement the day before yesterday and the Fightback document, and leaving aside the fact that the Opposition has ditched the approach it was going to take in this area of the commercialisation process reducing costs by $20m, let us allow the Opposition the indulgence of being able to cut $20m from the Overseas Property Group's budget by a reduction in running costs.

         There are two problems with that, and I think the Senate ought to be aware of them. First of all, when one impacts on recurrent costs, one impacts on costs for which we have been committed and for which we are committed under legal obligation. Whether we are committed to residences, offices or whatever, we have contractual obligations. So, mechanically it is not that easy.

         There is, however, another problem with the proposal, and that comes from the basic situation that the Opposition does not really understand what its proposal here entails. I am really sorry that Senator Hill is not at the table to listen to this, because it impacts directly on his shadow portfolio interests. If we were to cut the Overseas Property Group's budget by $20m, we would have to cut out 47 of our 74 overseas posts; that is, two-thirds of our representation overseas would have to be reduced. This would impact in a number of ways. Regionally, the Opposition would have to close posts in Fiji, Kiribati, Micronesia, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Vietnam.

         The Government has announced that there is a problem in industrial relations in this country that has been around for a long time. The problem is that there are some employers in Australia who want to tip people out of work, undercut the award rate, and introduce people in their place on so-called artificial and contrived contracts which style them as independent contractors. Therefore, for people working happily away under an award system, we find this unscrupulous practice of putting them out of work and replacing them with people who are genuinely covered by the award but who are on artificial contracts that get around the award. That creates industrial relations problems. This Government intends to provide the umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission, with the power—

         I might say that what clouds this debate is that both the MBA and HIA put out press releases yesterday of a highly excitable nature, apparently based on rumours they had heard. They never spoke to me about the issue before they put them out. It was a question of shoot first and ask questions later. When I saw these press releases I rang the HIA and I spoke to the executive director. I told him what the case was. I asked him to modify his position, based on the right information. I do not know whether he has done that. I certainly hope he does. It seems to me that there is a sense of the Wills by-election in the air and some people, in order to make a political point, are stirring up mischief to create an impression that housing prices might be doubled or tripled or quadrupled. The fact is that they are missing the point.

         The second part of the supplementary question is: what is custom and practice in this case? Again, in each particular case it would be a question of examining the particular features of that industry or that area of employment. Since people in the housing industry knee jerked into a response before they had spoken to me about the matter yesterday, might I say that custom and practice in the housing industry, in the cottage industry, is by and large a question of subcontract labour.

         If there is a matter of this character being brought before the Commission for determination, I imagine that the Commission will have regard to what is the prevailing custom and practice in that particular industry. If it were housing, that would be subcontractors, not awards. But in other areas the custom and practice may well be different. On a multi-storey construction site in the middle of the central business district of a capital city, custom and practice would be award coverage. Should people wish to then try to break that down by introducing sham contracts, the Commission would have regard to that area of award coverage and award against the so-called independent contractors.

         —The reports are not so much that aid has been cut off generally to the refugees in the camps but, rather, that it has been cut off from Cambodians newly arriving in those displaced persons camps along the Thai-Cambodian border.

          There has been concern about the number of Cambodians moving to these camps over recent days in order to benefit from the resettlement aid to be offered under the repatriation program organised by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Under that program, provision had been made for resettlement in Cambodia of more than 350,000 displaced Cambodians from the camps, and each family of repatriates will receive funds, building materials and other assistance to help their resettlement in Cambodia.

         We do not yet have any confirmation of the reported decision by the UNHCR to suspend assistance to new arrivals in the border camps, but it is perfectly possible that such a decision has been made in order to avoid a kind of revolving door situation developing. I am confident that the UNHCR officials on the ground are best placed to judge the best way to deal with this particular problem.

         —We have not taken a stand in favour of protection; we have just taken a stand against zero protection of the kind that is being advocated by the Opposition. The protection that we are talking about is one that after 1996 will amount on products generally to an average rate of five per cent, which will amount to 15 per cent so far as the automobile industry is concerned by the year 2000, and will amount to 25 per cent maximum so far as TCF is concerned. It is a 5, 15, 25 set of rates that we are talking about, as distinct from the zero, zero, zero rates that are being proposed in a scorched earth fashion by the Opposition. That is the difference between the Opposition and the Government. It is a difference, when you look at it in the larger context, that is at the margin of the debate about protection because the Government's anti-protectionist credentials are and will remain absolutely impeccable. We are the Government that has succeeded in bringing down rates very dramatically from the absurdly high and counterproductive levels that were being maintained through the Opposition's years of government. We are the Government that is getting rid of quotas completely from all areas of industry sectors by 1993. We are the Government that has made a dramatic series of endeavours to bring down the protective barriers that have existed and have reduced the competitive efficiency of the Australian economy. Nothing that the Prime Minister or anyone else has said has cut across that.

         As to the reports coming out of the United States, let me say this. The US trade representative is required by  US legislation to furnish reports each year to Congress identifying practices in specific economic sectors which it regards as preventing US companies from receiving fair access to the markets of its trading partners. These reports are designed essentially to assist the US Administration in developing its trade negotiating priorities over the coming year. The report claims, as Senator Teague has said, that Australia maintains unfair trade barriers against US products, particularly in the areas of broadcasting, which was the subject of Senator Richardson's earlier discussion, intellectual property and government procurement.

I ask: firstly, is the Minister aware that the United States Navy's procedures are designed to cope with an uncontained core meltdown, in contrast to Australian port safety plans, which are based on the much more benign contingency of a contained meltdown? Secondly, is he aware that United States procedures require evacuation zones to be set according to measured radiation levels and could extend to a distance of miles, whereas Australian plans limit the zone of immediate evacuation to a 600-metre radius? Thirdly, is he aware that the United States Navy requires tugs to be available within one hour of the accident if towing of the stricken vessel is required, whereas Australian plans provide for towing to occur up to 24 hours later? Finally, what action does he propose to take in view of these discrepancies?

         In the case of the myriad applications that came forward, I adopted the departmental recommendation in every case except this one. Therefore, out comes this `kick the union can, get stuck into a Labor government' attack to the effect that, God help us, a Minister, out of about 49 different applications, rejected one of them, and changed it. The money was spent according to the provisions that we have set down, and which have been under the scrutiny of this Senate in successive Budgets, which have formed the basis of spending for union rationalisation—to promote and educate union members on the virtues of that course and to help defray some of the legal expenses.

         —I ask a question of the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is it a fact that Telecom's new Chief Executive has decided that centralisation of Telecom's functions to Melbourne and Sydney is to be a prime method of achieving overall staff reductions? Pursuant to this policy, has Telecom decided to abolish its highly efficient Tasmanian region and transfer its functions to the less efficient Melbourne based regional headquarters? I am advised that the decision is likely to result in the loss of up to 300 jobs in Tasmania. Can the Minister tell us how many jobs are likely to be affected; how many positions and high level functions will be transferred interstate; and, if efficiency is the name of the game, why penalise the remarkably efficient Tasmanian operation and lump it in with the less efficient one?

That will mean some changes to the organisation over the next few years. Some of those changes no doubt will involve the removal of some people from some regional areas. It will be a case of looking at efficiency, but also balanced against what Telecom can lose by moving people out of those areas.

         To give some examples, there are places in Australia where regional offices are staffed for such things as repairs or complaints. Often those offices are not staffed 24 hours a day, but for only part of the day, and there is simply no efficiency in maintaining them. Most of those though are fairly small operations and I doubt very much if any involve more than a handful of jobs, and nothing like 300. Although rationalisation will be taking place, one also has to balance it against what one will lose. With a competitor looming up in Optus over the next couple of years, Telecom has to be concerned that whatever decisions it takes do not lead to lots of people switching en masse to the competitor because of Telecom's own actions. Therefore, I am trying to sort out with the Managing Director and the Chairman of Telecom the policy that Telecom will adopt on this question. It was one of the matters that I raised with them yesterday morning. I expect to have an answer by the time the Parliament resumes in three weeks and will be happy to share the results of that with Senator Harradine.

I do not know where Senator Lewis could have got that information from.

According to the newspaper reports, at a meeting that I had yesterday—in fact, I had two meetings yesterday—with representatives of Civil Air, the air traffic controllers union, the people concerned had threatened industrial strikes if the decision to choose Thomson was not reversed. I must clearly have been at another meeting. Nothing of that kind was said or even suggested. The meeting was, in fact, an amicable and very productive one and it concerned mostly the involvement of the air traffic controllers themselves in assisting with the design of the workstations that will be required—that is, the actual workface the controllers themselves will operate with whatever system is chosen.

         —I withdraw, Mr President. The rank hypocrisy of the Opposition on this question—and it is pretty rank—would be demonstrated by a very simple proposition. If I were to take the outrageous action that Opposition senators want me to take, which is to politically direct—without having had any personal involvement in any of the process, in any of the detailed evaluation of the highly complex technical specifications—the CAA to choose one tenderer over another, I would be in here being censured for political interference in what is supposed to be an independent tender process. It is an outrageous proposition. I will not be directing the CAA to change its decision on the preferred tenderer. It really is a nonsense.

It is related to the potential impact, for example, of the restructuring on the number of their employees who work for the organisation. That matter is being expedited with consultations between the CAA and the union representing the engineers.

        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Walters on 1 April 1992 relating to waterfront reform.

       Thank you, Mr President. I thank the Senate. Yesterday, I asked Senator Collins—he will remember, I am sure—the following question:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       How can the Minister for Shipping and Aviation justify the claim that he is achieving waterfront reform when I have been provided with two quotes: firstly, to ship a 20-foot container loaded with household effects from Hobart to Tilbury, London, at the cost of $A2,000; and, secondly, to ship that same container from Hobart to Brisbane for the cost of $3,500?
      </para>
      <para>
       In answer, Senator Collins said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The difficulty with the question is that the shipping rates from Australia to London have absolutely nothing whatever to do with waterfront reform. In fact, the total component of stevedoring costs on a sea journey of that length would be less than one per cent. The question of shipping freight rates, I repeat, which was the gravamen of the question, is almost totally unrelated to waterfront reform or stevedoring costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       That answer shows the Minister's ignorance. Let me give the Senate some information. I have substantiated that just under 50 per cent of charges are land-based. Twenty-six per cent of charges are Australian land-based, not one per cent or `less than one per cent'. Twenty-three per cent of charges are European land-based. The 23 per cent are the Hamburg costs, but it is uniform all over Europe. If the Minister would now like to direct his `less than one per cent' being land based, I would appreciate the opportunity of getting him to do so. I challenge him to say that I am totally wrong.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">

        I am well aware that the Minister has also been told of this because Transport contacted the same sources that I did. I will be most interested in the Minister's answer. Is he going to change it from `less than one per cent', or what percentage does the Minister now claim applies?

        —Let me finish, Senator Hill. I will be brief. The reason that Transport contacted the source is that, out of courtesy to Senator Walters or any senator who asks questions in here, I try to get the most complete answer that I can. I have some additional information which I will now provide. It needs to be made clear that comparisons of shipping freight rates—and that was the problem; not the waterfront stevedoring charges—such as these are fraught with difficulties, as I have pointed out to the Senate many times before. Great care needs to be taken to ensure that like is compared with like, as I have also pointed out many times before.

        Freight charges are struck as a result of commercial negotiation between the customer and the shipping company. As a result of that commercial negotiation, the rates will vary very significantly in this industry—and they do—even for similar containers over the same route, for any number of reasons, including seasonal demands on shipping space, the relative level of shipping services and the overall balance of exports and imports.

        The cost of moving a container from Hobart to Brisbane cannot readily be compared with the cost of moving a similar container to Tilbury in England. For a start, there is no direct shipping service from Hobart to Brisbane, and the cost, whichever route is taken, will include significant elements of land transport charges; that is, from Hobart to Brisbane, not from Hobart to Tilbury in England. Information supplied by my Department suggests that the $2,000 quote to Tilbury is low. The charge quoted from Hobart to Brisbane is more difficult to judge, as it includes significant land transport movements. Using the most direct shipping service, Hobart to Sydney, the average wharf-to-wharf charge is currently around $1,375. The container would then need to be transferred by either road or rail to Brisbane. If the quote is accurate, $2,100 of the charge could represent the land transport component or other ancillary charges.

        It needs to be made clear that very little of the overall charge in either of these cases, or indeed the difference between them, has anything to do, as I said yesterday, with the cost of stevedoring. Stevedoring represents a small proportion of the total freight charge. The average stevedoring charge in Australia currently, because of the significant reduction, of somewhere near 30 per cent in the last 12 months in this charge, is now somewhere between $180 and $200 per container.

But if the radar system on the ground is not showing any aircraft in the particular situation, then the radar system is at fault.

        The basic point is this: in any modern air traffic control radar system there is a primary radar which detects and shows the presence of aircraft; there is an SSR, a secondary surveillance radar, which interrogates an instrument in the aircraft, the transponder, and it identifies that particular aircraft. It appears—and this is a very important point—that there is a basic fault in the Thomson-CSF systems. The fault is that when four zeros are set on the transponder, or if perhaps the transponder has some faults in it—in other words, the pilot sets the code he is asked to set and a different signal is transmitted—this brilliant Thomson system—

        —It tells the signal coming in from the secondary surveillance radar to ignore the primary surveillance signal that an aircraft is present, and indicates that there is no aircraft there. The aircraft then becomes invisible on the radar screen. The system that Senator Collins and the CAA have bought for us—the radar systems provided by Thomson-CSF and installed now at Cairns, Coolangatta, Mount Macedon and Gellibrand—all have this basic flaw in their systems. Apparently the new TAAATS system of Thomson-CSF, which will be an Australia-wide system, similarly has this flaw in it.

        That raises some very important points. The first is, despite what Senator Collins says, very exhaustive checks were made, not only of that F28 aircraft but three Qantas 767s which also were invisible. No mechanical or electronic fault was shown in those aircraft. The second very important point is that the F28 and the three Qantas Boeing 767s, within a short space of time, both preceding and after the Cairns event, flew through one or all of Darwin, Brisbane and Sydney airspaces. The radar systems in Darwin, Sydney and Brisbane are all very old hat. They are at least 20 years old. Yet all those aircraft flew through and were correctly identified on the radar screens by the air traffic controllers at those airfields at the time with the air traffic control radars. So it is a reasonable presumption that there was not a fault with the transponders in those aircraft.

        Let us look at the significance of it. If Senator Collins has bought a system where one can dial up four zeros on a transponder and become invisible, or get a pretence or a presentation of invisibility on the air traffic control radars, what a bonus it is for drug runners coming into Australia. They just have to dial up four zeros on the transponder, and fly into Cairns with invisibility—as we know drug runners are doing in north Australia at present. Think of all the billions of dollars the Americans could save on their stealth technology with their defence aircraft if they had a radar system in the hands of the enemy with that sort of nonsense.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The other argument that is advanced by Senator Collins and his people is the fact that some of these aircraft, like the Boeing 767, have two radar aerials for their transponders; one on top of the aircraft and one on the bottom of the aircraft. They say, `Well, you get interference with the propagation of the radar signal'. Again the evidence is against that. Boeing 767s have been in extensive use around the world for about 10 years. The problem has not appeared anywhere other than at Cairns and Coolangatta. In this particular case the aircraft flew through Sydney, Brisbane and Darwin and there was no problem at all.

        I bring this fact to Senator Collins's attention because he will never bring it to the attention of the Senate: the great Thomson-CSF system at Cairns, which has a recorded history of something like 23 or 26 significant failures since it was installed and which, of course, is 20 months over time on its installation, on three days in the last month had significant shutdown times.

        On 25 March the primary radar was shut down for 4 hours 55 minutes while the magnetron was replaced, and it was replaced because when the system was bought the CAA accepted the Thomson-CSF proposition that it be a magnetron rather than a kylstron, which is at the heart of the radar system, the transmitter. On the next day, 26 March, the primary radar was shut down for 1 hour 26 minutes. On the third day, 27 March, the primary radar was shut down for a motor change for three minutes. That is a total of three shutdowns in three consecutive days totalling 6 hours 24 minutes, and all this from a new radar installation which was supposed to meet a requirement of four minutes down time per calendar year.

        In a sense, Senator Collins has been abused for what it is alleged he said in Question Time. If that is going to be done, why have we gone into a debate that is not going to get us anywhere? The normal manner to bring on debate in this House is to give notice of a motion and the matter is brought on at a later time. It seems to me that we are now entering into exchanges of abuse across the chamber, which do not help the situation. If there is a diminution of safety, or if planes are flying around the sky and they could be flying around there more safely, surely a reasoned and extended debate could be had. It seems to me that we are getting a very short distance by simply getting up and speaking off the tops of our heads about an important matter, which everybody agrees it is. Rather than a debate about air safety, it is an attack on Senator Collins. I suppose we could all go ahead and attack Senator Collins—he is big enough to take plenty of attack—but how far that gets us in debate today is very doubtful.

I take this opportunity to read to the Senate a letter that I received from the Estimates Committee secretary in response to a number of queries I made as to when those answers were going to be forthcoming. The letter, dated 31 March 1992, reads as follows:

        Why did the Minister hold onto the answers? Because he did not want the detailed answers to come back to honourable senators so that we could check those answers and check the truth and the accuracy of some of the technical answers and responses that related to those questions on notice. We are seeing Senator Collins not only misleading the Senate but also trying his damnedest to ensure that the information that Estimates committees require and that honourable senators require is not presented to them in a timely fashion so that they can verify it before they go on to having an Estimates hearing that kicks off on aviation at 4 o'clock in the morning. That is what Senator Collins is doing.

        When we got to the hearing, we found that some of the answers that were given to the questions on notice were incorrect anyway, because those answers, again, attempted to trot out the same old line that the only fault was in the transponder. The gentleman from the CAA, Mr Kendall, admitted that not only 0000 transponder codes but also any transponder code ending in a double zero could lead to the aircraft not appearing on the radar at all. He admitted that it could not fix it at the moment and it could give no assurance that the aircraft would not continue to disappear off radar screens. I suggest that considerable opprobrium attaches to a Minister who holds on to answers which subsequently turn out to be incorrect, but which may have been found to be even more incorrect if senators on this side of the chamber had been given a decent opportunity to check the accuracy and veracity of those answers before they went on to a 4 a.m. hearing on aviation in the Estimates Committee.

        —There is no doubt that the people who have to operate this system are concerned about it. For some reason or other, the air traffic controllers say that the Hughes system does not cause them so much concern. I do not say to the Minister that he ought to direct the CAA as to what it should do and that it ought to take the contract off one and give it to the other. That is not the point. The point is that the system must be safe.

        What has happened here is that the systems which operate currently in Australia are so far out of date that they need to be replaced. What is happening is that the Minister is trying to jump to a new, untried system and there is great concern about its safety. There is great concern, in particular, about the system which is operated by Thomson. I think Senator MacGibbon said that on 26 occasions there have been failures and breakdowns in the system. This involves much cost to the Australian people. It cost $5.5m in Melbourne to try to fix up the system. We now have the Minister continually misleading the Senate about the safety of the Thomson contract. The CAA is proceeding to negotiate the terms of the contract with the preferred contractor—it is not going to be an open tendering system—

        On behalf of the 217 Residents of the Cardinal Gilroy Retirement Village whose signatures appear on the attachment, we have taken the opportunity of writing to you as one of our respected parliamentarians, seeking your support of the endeavours of the silent majority of Australian citizens in opposing the ready availability of violent and pornographic materials in our community.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are confident that you will not discount our representation on the basis of our being only a group of oldies from one Retirement Village (not even in your own electorate) because, as we are sure you will appreciate, we are representative of the whole community given the extent and disbursement of our families with whom we have regular contact. Further, we are sincere, experienced, senior Australians well qualified to understand the marked decline of social and moral standards.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are concerned about our children's and grandchildren's future when much of what is offered to them as entertainment seems to rely heavily either on excessive violence or else on near pornographic use of human sexuality. Is the result of this dubious entertainment the increasing levels of violent crime which we are now witnessing within Australia? (Please refer to the essay by Robert Manne on page 46 of the January 6th, 1992 issue of Time Magazine.)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We believe that it is time that a wide ranging Parliamentary enquiry into violent and pornographic entertainment be established. Are you prepared to support its establishment and ensure that the recommendations flowing from the enquiry are acted upon?

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Will you join us in opposing the ready availability of violent and pornographic material (especially that coming from the A.C.T.) in order to make Australia a better place for us and our families—the very future of Australia?

         The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has been actively pursuing the task set by the Senate to inquire into Australia's relations with the republics of Latin America. One hundred and twenty submissions have been received and eleven public hearings held, including hearings in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide as well as Canberra.

         It was obvious to the Committee from the very beginning of the inquiry that it had been given a very substantial task. The terms of reference are wide-ranging as the Committee is required in effect to look at every aspect of the relationship between Australia and Latin America, a region that encompasses over 20 countries. Even focussing on the major republics in the region has meant looking at the many and various aspects of Australia's relations with eight or so countries. As material before the Committee was studied and examined, new witnesses were approached for further information on a significant number of issues.

         The Committee has already begun intensive work on the draft of the report and has approved four chapters already, while still awaiting further evidence on some issues. In fact, only this morning the Committee held what will probably be the last of the public hearings with the Ambassador of Peru. There are still a number of important issues that require close and detailed consideration before the report can be finalised. New information still is being received.

         The Committee has come to the conclusion that it should seek a further extension of time to report. The Committee is confident that an extension to mid-June will enable the Committee to do full justice to the important task before it.

         One of the instruments provides extensive safeguards for persons who elect to pay an administrative fine for an offence rather than have the matter dealt with by a court. However, there is no provision for persons affected to be notified of these safeguards, which may mean the difference between, on the one hand, paying a fine of $200 and not having a conviction recorded or being convicted and, on the other, paying a fine of $1,000 or being sentenced to imprisonment for six months.

         Another instrument provides for garnishee of wages, salaries and bank accounts with no immediate indication of appropriate safeguards. The third instrument provides for appointments to an important statutory authority to be terminated `at the pleasure of the Minister'.

        These Regulations implement administrative details of the Fisheries Management Act 1991, providing for the administration of fishing concessions, operation of boats and equipment and surveillance and enforcement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Regulations provide for certain offences to be dealt with by an administrative fine, rather than a penalty imposed by a court, in the same way that numbers of minor traffic offences, such as parking, are dealt with. If a member of the public elects to pay an administrative fine then the Regulations properly provide extensive and adequate safeguards. These are that the person's liability in relation to the offence is taken to be discharged, further proceedings cannot be taken against the person and the person is not to be regarded as having been convicted of the offence.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, the beneficial effect of these appropriate safeguards may not be enjoyed by persons accused of offences, as there is no provision for them to be informed of these rights. An entire regulation prescribes what must be included in infringement notices sent to persons affected, but this does not include notification of these valuable safeguards. The Committee considers that personal rights are only effective if properly communicated. In this case it would appear that such notification rights are essential.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the present case the matter is particularly important because of a great disparity in penalties. The administrative fine for any offence cannot exceed $200, yet the penalties imposed by a court for the same offences range from, in one case, a fine of $500, in six cases a fine of $1,000 and in an unspecified number of possible cases imprisonment for six months.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        These Guidelines relate to management of debts due to the Commonwealth in respect of student assistant schemes. Although the instrument is called Guidelines, the parent Act requires that these be observed by the Minister and other officers. The concerns of the Committee relate to personal liberties, appropriate review rights and legal validity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Many of the Guidelines grant important discretions. Thus, there are provisions for an officer to review an objection to a withholding from an entitlement. There is also provision for a debtor to satisfy the Department of a matter within seven days. Another provision appears to grant a discretion as to whether failure to pay a debt was the fault of the debtor. There are other discretions to write off a debt entirely, to waive a debt, and to approve repayment by instalments.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Most of these discretions provide criteria for their exercise. However, these criteria themselves include other discretions. Some discretions are subject to presumably internal review. However, there is no indication whether any of these discretions are subject to merits review by an independent tribunal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some of the discretions have serious implications for personal rights. Thus, one provision is that a section of the Act may be used to garnishee deductions from salary or wages or from an account at a bank or other financial institution. In this case the Committee would wish to be satisfied that the provision is justified by the parent Act and that there are appropriate safeguards for a person affected, including independent review of the merits of any action.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Guidelines only relate to the exercise of powers under the parent Act. That Act includes extensive review provisions and it may be that the discretions in these Guidelines are included in decisions made under the Act and are subject to such review. However, the Committee would wish to receive express confirmation of this.

        These Guidelines, among other things, provide for the appointment of the Commissioner, other members and deputies to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. This is a statutory body with important functions and wide powers. The PHIAC is also a body corporate, which may hold and dispose of personal property and may sue and be sued in its corporate name.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Guidelines provide that the period of appointment shall be "at the pleasure of the Minister". Although such expressions were used in the past, the Committee now regards them as archaic and generally inappropriate. Such appointees should be only removed for proven misbehaviour or physical, mental or other forms of incapacity. The Committee is always vigilant to protect personal rights and liberties. In this case the personal reputations of persons could suffer if they were removed without reasonable cause. This would be particularly serious for appointees to the PHIAC who presumably will be eminent people. In this context the Committee noted that the Commissioner may be appointed on a full-time basis. On its face, it is not acceptable for a full-time Commissioner of an important statutory authority, together with all of his or her members and deputies, to hold office at the pleasure of the Minister. In addition, the independence of action of the appointees would appear to be compromised.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Committee believes that it may be appropriate to obtain an undertaking to amend the Guidelines to meet its concerns.

         I refer to VHF High Band Frequency Plan (148 to 174 MHz) and VHF Mid Band Frequency Plan (70 to 87.5 MHz), Statutory Rules 1991 Nos.354 and 355, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 27 February 1992.

         Both Plans and their Explanatory Statements are very similar in content and wording, apart from one dealing with high band and the other with mid band frequencies. The following comments therefore relate generally to both sets.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Clauses 7(3) and 9(3) provide for important discretions. Clause 7 provides for channelling arrangements for band segments, but then clause 7(3) provides that different arrangements may be authorised to "provide for more efficient use of the spectrum". There are no criteria in the instrument itself to guide and control the exercise of this discretion, although there are criteria in a Note, which does not appear to be part of the Plans. It is usual to include such criteria in the provisions of the instrument itself. Also, there does not seem to be any indication of who is to exercise this discretion, apart from the Notes, and no reference in the instrument to any review.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Clause 9(3) provides for exemption from compliance with clauses 6 and 7. The Committee accepts that these exemptions may be authorised only until the relevant conversion date, but these run until 1 July 1998. Again, there seems to be no criteria in respect of the discretion, no procedures for its exercise and no indication of review.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The General Notes and Notes are generally helpful. Users are assisted by such material. However, as mentioned earlier, some of the contents of the Notes may have been better included in the instruments themselves. This category includes Note 6 on page 9 of Statutory Rules 1991 No.354, which appears to be legislative in nature. Note 6 also appears to give a discretion to the Secretary or to a delegate of the Secretary. There are discretions in Notes 3 and 5 with no indication of any review of these discretions.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Finally, clause 4 specifies conversion dates. However, General Notes 4 and 8 provide that each Regional Office of the Department will develop and manage the detailed conversion program and that "individual users will be required by the relevant Regional Office to convert their service earlier than the relevant State conversion date". This appears to include an element of compulsion which is not provided for in the legislation. Admittedly, General Note 9 sets out some criteria for conversion. Nevertheless, the Committee asks whether this discretionary compulsion is authorised by the parent Act. Again, if it is authorised, is there any review of the compulsory requirement?

         The making of Frequency Band Plans
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         4. The Radiocommunications Act 1983 (The Act) establishes the statutory framework for management of the radio frequency spectrum in Australia. A key element in the Act relates to the making of frequency band plans. Band planning is the mechanism by which spectrum allocation can be adjusted to provide additional capacity for both new and existing services. The process of making band plans has been adopted as a means of coordinating changes in spectrum usage in a manner which provides for the maximum amount of consultation with users and which avoids the need for achieving change through the abrupt cancellation or non-renewal of licences.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         5. The statutory requirements for public consultation in sections 19 and 20 of the Act are really minimum requirements and in practice it is necessary to have a far more extensive process of consultation throughout the development of new band plans. The making of the VHF plans was the culmination of about three years of development involving a number of intermediate levels of consultation with industry and users. The formal gazetting for full public comment in May 1991, in accordance with the Act, was the final step in the consultation process. It resulted in a number of significant changes, particularly in regard to minimising changeover costs to existing users.

         Decision-making context of the Plans
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         6. Before specifically addressing the Committee's concerns about the Plans, I would like to make some comments on the decision-making context in which the Plans operate. The two main types of decisions made under the Act where a decision-maker will refer to the Plans are:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (i)under section 24 and subsection 25(1) of the Act, when deciding whether or not to grant a transmitter licence authorising a person to operate a transmitter on a particular frequency; and
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (ii)under subsection 25(3) of the Act, when deciding whether or not to vary a condition of a transmitter licence by changing the frequency on which the licensee is authorised to operate a transmitter.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         7. It is relevant to note that paragraph 24(2)(c) of the Act provides that in exercising his or her licensing powers, the Minister shall have regard to whether or not he or she is satisfied that the proposed operation of the transmitters is in accordance with the appropriate frequency band plan. Also, paragraph 25(1)(a) provides that a transmitter licence is subject to the condition that the holder of the licence shall not operate, or permit the operation of, the transmitter except for a purpose specified in the licence, being a purpose not inconsistent with a purpose of a kind specified in the appropriate frequency band plan under subsection 19(2).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         8. Decisions made under section 24 and 25 of the Act are subject to internal departmental review and subsequent review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by virtue of section 86 of the Act.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         9. Other decisions made with reference to the Plans relate to test permits (section 10), frequency reservation certificates (section 21), and temporary permits (section 35). All these decisions are similarly subject to review under section 86 of the Act.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         10. It is important to note that all operative decisions made with reference to the Plans are made under one of the abovementioned sections of the Act (the `substantive' powers)—none are actually made under the Plans themselves. Where the Plans provide for discretions on divergence from the purposes for which any particular segment of the radio frequency spectrum may be used, those discretions are actually exercised under one of the above sections. The Plans in themselves do not create any new non-reviewable discretions.
        </para>

         Clause 7(3)—criteria for allowing different channelling arrangements
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         11. In your letter, you mention that the criteria, which may be taken into account in exercising the discretion of whether to allow channelling arrangements other than as provided for in the Plans, are set out in a Note which does not appear to be part of the Plans. You also comment that there is no indication of who is to exercise this discretion.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         12. Taking your second comment first, those officers in the Department who are delegates of the Minister in relation to the `substantive' powers of the Act will be the officers who may exercise the discretion when exercising those powers.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         13. In relation to your first comment, the criteria set out in the Note are meant as a guide only, without intending to limit the range of matters which may be relevant to considering whether a proposal would provide for more efficient use of the spectrum. It is expected that in each individual case, the particular circumstances of that case are considered in deciding whether to exercise the discretion. As the discretion is exercised as part of the exercise of a reviewable `substantial' power under the Act, should an affected person consider that an irrelevant consideration has been taken into account, or that a relevant consideration has not been taken account, that person would have a right of review under section 86 of the Act.

         15. You will note that subclause 3(3) of the Plans provides that wherever `authorised' is used in the Plans, this refers to an authorisation given by the Secretary of the Department, or by an officer of the Department authorised in writing by the Secretary, for the relevant purpose. It is intended that the `authorised officers' will be the more senior delegates of the Minister for the purposes of the `substantive' powers under the Act.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         16. Subclause 9(3) makes it clear that temporary exemptions under this clause may only be granted for the purpose of facilitating implementation of the Plans. As there are many services which are affected by the Plans, it is impossible to anticipate at this time the detailed movements of services in each city or State which will be necessary in order to meet the conversion dates set out in the Plans. As you noted in your statement to the Senate on 3 March 1992, the General Note in clause 2 of the Plans sets out measures to minimise the impact of the cost and disruption for users in converting to compliance with the Plans. These measures are meant as a guide to the decision-makers in each State and Territory exercising the `substantive' powers in the Act.

         17. It is relevant to note that subclause 9(3) is in a very similar form to subclause 11(4) of the Radiocommunications-Australian Spectrum Plan, Statutory Rules 1990 No.413, which provides that, subject to subclause 11(1) of that Plan, each frequency band may be used by services other than those identified in the Spectrum Plan on a transitional basis to facilitate new or revised allocations of frequency bands.

         25. I trust that the above comments meet the Committee's concerns. It may be helpful if the General Notes in the Plans were amended to include a message to the effect that the notes are intended as a guide to decision-makers when making decisions under the Act. I understand such a change would not require compliance with the extended consultation procedures for making frequency band plans required by sections 19 and 20 of the Act, because the General Notes are not part of the provisions of the Plans. I would be happy to make myself and officers of my Department available to meet with the Committee to further discuss the matter should the Committee so desire.

The Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, Senator Zakharov, has written to me and formally raised as a matter of privilege under standing order 81 the alleged intimidation of witnesses which is the subject of the report which the Committee has just presented. The essence of the matters raised in the report is that certain witnesses have been threatened in consequence of evidence given before the Committee. The Committee has recommended that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee, and Senator Zakharov has asked that I give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee.

         This reference was one of two given to the Committee relating to services for people with disabilities; the first of these reports,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Accommodation for People with Disabilities
         </emphasis>
         , was tabled in May 1990. The inquiry into the reference on employment predated that report and hearings extended over the period early 1989 to late 1990.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Over that time, there have been considerable changes in service provision and in development of new services. The Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement, signed in mid-1991, has clarified the respective Commonwealth and State/Territory responsibilities, with accommodation and related services being provided by the States, and employment services being a Commonwealth responsibility. This reflects the belief of many witnesses that it is essential for employment services for people with disabilities to be operated by the Commonwealth, which has the major responsibility for employment and labour-market programs.

         Many witnesses also believed that departments such as the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) ought to assume responsibility for all employment options for people with disabilities in order to move away from the suggestion that people with disabilities should be assisted by Health and Community Services  departments. The Committee has not supported this idea in full. Its evaluation of DEET programs has led to its concluding that, while the Department has established many useful programs, the value of these to people with disabilities, and particularly to people with severe disabilities, needs to be carefully assessed. The Committee acknowledges the development by DEET of a Disability Strategy and of special units such as Disability Access Support Units (DASUs), and believes that these may provide valuable support to people with disabilities. Nonetheless, it has concluded that the transfer of employment options from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to the Department of Employment, Education and Training would not be in the best interests of people with disabilities for some time.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the reasons for this is the difficulty faced by generic services in meeting the wide range of needs of people with disabilities. This has been a difficult issue for the Committee, but I believe it has been addressed through proper consideration being given to a wide range of factors that must necessarily impact upon access to services and the extent to which services can provide opportunities for people with disabilities. Because this area is one which has been the subject of division and debate for a number of years, it was essential for the Committee to stand back and look at many of the attitudes which have influenced those involved. These include service providers, consumers, parent groups, advocates, and government departments. Much evidence presented to the Committee argued passionately for and against a number of different service types, and discussed in detail the problems with service provision and differing philosophies and experiences.It was clear that the issue was of profound concern to a substantial number of people. It also became clear that, in many instances, there was little available information on a number of important issues and that this affected the extent to which people with disabilities had access to services, and to services which were appropriate.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In placing services within a broad context, the Committee considered the availability of data and of uniform terminology. It found that absence of comprehensive data, including data on school leavers ready to enter the workforce, was still a major problem. The Committee acknowledges the development within departments of new data collections, including those which will help assess the need for services. Nonetheless, the Committee is sufficiently concerned about data and definition problems to have made a number of recommendations in the first chapter about the need for improved data collection and the development of uniform definitions. This would help towards an assessment of unmet need.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In considering the broad context of employment options, the Committee was also concerned to identify issues of access and equity which it believed were not sufficiently taken into consideration in the planning of services or in the evaluation of successful service operation. Consequently, the Committee has referred in the second chapter to a number of factors which it believes could seriously affect access. These factors include socio-economic background, gender, culture and race, geographic location and age. The Committee believes that it is essential for funding departments and service providers to be aware of such issues, particularly insofar as they may seriously affect the awareness of individuals or groups as to the need for, and the existence of, services. Consequently, the Committee has emphasised these matters, including the need for research on factors other than disability which may limit access to services.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The issue of access and of equity has also been examined. Much of the evidence received by the Committee spoke of the negative perceptions held by some people in the community about people with disabilities, of the need for changes to legislation, of the importance of education and information programs, in order to establish a legal base for change and to change community attitudes about the extent to which people with disabilities could contribute to society through work and other activities. The Committee supports the proposed Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation and has made recommendations concerning types of discrimination which should be addressed and the need for affirmative action principles. Recommendations have also been made about continued information and education programs.

         One of the major concerns expressed by witnesses was the need to create a positive image for people with disabilities, and for employers and government departments to become more aware of the importance of positive attitudes and of taking into account the particular needs of people with disabilities. However, it also believes there is room for improvement, particularly in the public sector, which is often seen as failing to live up to its own message through providing new employment options for people with disabilities. Again, while acknowledging gradual improvements in the public sector as an employing body, the Committee notes that it is essential for bodies such as the Australian Public Service to set an example. While a diverse economic structure, multiskilling, workplace reform and rapid technological change may have meant a restructuring of industry which can lead to shrinking job opportunities, the same factors may also contribute to the creation of increased job opportunities for people with severe disabilities as well as for those with mild to moderate disabilities.

         Many witnesses argued that access to education was crucial to later effective access to meaningful employment, and regarded access to mainstream school education as the best option for many children with disabilities. The Committee was particularly concerned to examine the transition from school to the workforce since this was identified as a major factor in determining an individual's success in obtaining satisfactory employment and in retaining skills. Again, the issue of data was raised, and it appeared that no adequate statistics were available Australia-wide on the numbers and needs of those who left school each year and how far such needs could be met. While it is obvious that a number of factors will affect access to appropriate education and to transition services, the Committee believes that such services are crucial and that governments and other education authorities must give top priority to identifying needs, providing work experience, setting up effective transition services, and establishing referral and counselling services which ensure that students do not miss out on employment opportunities and access to other community activities.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Although the Committee has placed particular emphasis on the importance of equity in access to school education and to transition programs, it also believes that tertiary education has a major role to play. Both TAFE and universities provide opportunities for people with disabilities, but in many cases the lack of adequate resources, and difficulties of access, meant that individuals with the ability to take advantage of opportunities were more frustrated than assisted. The Committee has made recommendations, including a recommendation on annual reporting by tertiary institutions, on access of people with disabilities to education services.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Committee believes that its examination of a range of access factors has provided a solid basis for its evaluation of current and future employment options. Its objective was to see how these options operated, whose needs they met, how they could be improved, and whether they addressed the concerns voiced by many witnesses. Such concerns emphasised, in particular, the fact that too often 'employment' was seen as a full-time occupation for people who, while initially requiring assistance in accessing employment and in learning additional skills, would nonetheless demonstrate consistent skill maintenance or improvement. Yet, as a number of submissions pointed out, consistent upward progression and increasing development of skills was not possible for all people with disabilities, nor was full-time employment. The effects of different disabilities were therefore considered in order to determine the range of needs and the types of services which might be needed.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Committee has emphasised that standard full-time employment options cannot be utilised by a number of individuals; and, while it acknowledges that some options are available which can meet the demand for part-time work or job-sharing, believes that a priority should be to develop further employment options.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In particular, the Committee has considered the need for more flexible concepts of employment to be developed which would include work, study, recreation, etc. Such options may be of considerable benefit to the community. For people whose skills may decrease rather than increase, and for those with fluctuating work patterns, unpredictable behaviour, and some psychiatric disabilities, such flexible options may well be the only suitable and satisfying type of employment likely to allow their meaningful participation in the community.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To a degree, some existing work options may be able to offer such flexibility, and the special Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service units for people with psychiatric disabilities are a welcome move towards assisting a group of people with disabilities who have had limited access. Nonetheless, the Committee's consideration of new employment options (such as Competitive Employment Training and Placement—CETP—services and Supported Employment services) has led it to conclude that there is still room for these services to meet the needs of those more difficult to place. The Committee wishes to acknowledge that these options have provided varied work and employment opportunities, to people with mild, and moderate to severe disabilities, including intellectual disabilities. Nonetheless, the Committee also believes that these services have not been sufficiently evaluated to identify why some individuals benefit greatly from them, and others do not, or why access is easy for some and not for others.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Once again, the Committee is concerned that equity in access may not be available, and that the pressures placed on services to demonstrate success may have led to the 'easier' clients (including those with a supportive family) obtaining services more readily than the more difficult, or alienated clients. This was suggested by a number of witnesses, including those who operated such services and those who operated sheltered workshops. If this situation has occurred, it is imperative that the funding Department (Department of Health, Housing and Community Services) assess its own expectations and the pressures it may have placed on organisations, and determine if genuine equality of opportunity is being provided to people with disabilities.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A further major concern which the Committee has in respect of `new' employment services relates to the funding arrangements and the evaluation of services. One of the reasons for the setting up of this inquiry was to examine the ways in which new services differed from traditional sheltered workshops and how they provided opportunities to people who were considered to be less well served by established service types. In assessing evaluation and accountability processes, the Committee was concerned that inadequate funding appeared to have been provided for training and development of service providers, and that the Department itself had little information on the new services, with little accountability apparently being required. The Committee's consideration of sheltered workshops has identified a number of management problems which had become entrenched (as well as discriminatory practices which devalued clients). The Department was obviously well aware of poor management practices, limited accountability, and inability of workshops to meet the objectives of the Handicapped Persons' Assistance Act 1974 (replaced by the Disability Services Act 1986), and should have made every effort not to reproduce these problems in new services. The Committee believes that regular evaluation of, and reporting on, all services is required, that adequate funding be provided for training, that accountability processes be instituted, so that problems can be identified quickly and addressed with expert assistance. While in agreement with the general direction of new service types, the Committee believes that the goal of flexibility is best achieved through establishing firm parameters for services to work within.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In considering current and future employment options, the Committee undertook an evaluation of sheltered workshops, supplemented by visits to workshops in a number of States and discussions with service providers. The Committee has heard evidence from a number of organisations and individuals on the disadvantages of sheltered workshops and of the effect of certain attitudes and practices on people with disabilities. The Committee is unanimous in its support of service users having access to improved employment opportunities, better conditions, appropriate wages, dignity and respect. However, the Committee has also pointed out that funding limitations, poor management practices and lack of strict accountability procedures, have been among the causal factors of the unsatisfactory state of a number of workshops and of the failure to meet stated objectives. A number of parties have contributed to this situation, and must take responsibility for doing so. The Committee makes this point, not to contribute to the often bitter controversy about workshops, about the funding disparities between old and new services, about the expense of new services and the exclusion of many people from access to them, but to determine the reasons for poor performance.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In so doing, the Committee has considered the possible role of improved workshops in providing employment options, and is of the opinion that such workshops may have a role in providing training and employment opportunities in the future, particularly for people with severe disabilities and those people whose work patterns are variable and/or those whose skills may not increase or will decrease. This suggests that existing facilities could continue to have a role in providing employment options, although clearly adequate funding, staffing, training and expert managerial advice would be essential.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In reaching this conclusion, the Committee wishes to emphasise that it has recommended similar monitoring and evaluation processes for all service types currently offered by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, and that while it believes the problems of the workshops prior to transition have been demonstrated, the potential or real problem of new service types must also be clearly identified and solved if access is to be improved across the board.

         Since the Committee began its inquiry, a number of changes have occurred in service provision, in the development of evaluation, in the workshop transition process, and transition time-frame, and many of these changes are supported by the Committee's findings. In particular, the Committee believes that the extension of the transition period and the establishment of the National Technical Assistance Unit have been major achievements, not least in that they are a recognition of the effect of past neglect, and of the capacity of services to provide real, meaningful options to people with disabilities. It is this, in conjunction with more thorough assessment of new services, and more effective labour-market training and work experience programs, which will provide a good foundation for the continued development of acceptable employment options.

         The Committee has also considered related issues, such as skills-based wages, job-sharing, the costs associated with disability, the need for increased and appropriate support (such as transport, personal care, affordable aids and equipment and special leave). It has made a number of recommendations in these areas because of the importance which it places on increasing access to employment for people with disabilities.

As Disabled Peoples' International told us, 'Disability has too long been viewed as a problem of the individual and not the relationship for that individual and his/her environment.' Employment is, for most people, an important part of that environment.

        I have just tabled the Committee's report entitled `ASIO and the Archives Act', which is the first report to be presented to the Parliament by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. The report addresses the question referred to the Committee of how the activities of ASIO are affected by the operation of the Archives Act 1983.

         The Archives Act first came into operation in 1983 and provides a right of public access to records of the Commonwealth that are more than 30 years old: the 30-year rule. This is subject to the right of the government to withhold records on defence and security and a number of other grounds. Decisions to withhold material are appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The government can reinforce its claim for exemption by applying a `Conclusive Certificate' to the record.

         The 30-year rule applies and has applied to ASIO and the other intelligence agencies of the Commonwealth from the proclamation of the Archives Act in 1983. ASIO is exempted from the general requirement of the Archives Act relating to the transfer of records to the Archives and retains full control over its records, only releasing material through the archives in response to specific requests.

         ASIO and the other agencies in the intelligence communities have consistently opposed the application of the 30-year rule to their records. They were supported in this position by the Royal Commissioner, Mr Justice Hope, in 1985, who recommended in his Report into Australia's Intelligence Security Agencies (RCAISA) that ASIO's operational files be excluded from the cover of the Archives Act and released only at the discretion of the Director-General of Security.

         The Government did not accept the RCASIA recommendation and in tabling the RCASIA report in May 1985, the then Prime Minister, the Hon. R J L Hawke, AC, MP, stated the view of the Government that the provisions of the Archives Act were already adequate to protect the legitimate concerns of the intelligence community, which should continue to be subject to the 30-year rule.

         There has continued to be a difference of opinion between the intelligence community and the government on this matter of release of records. In each of its annual reports since 1984 ASIO has continued to seek a review of the decision that it should be bound by the 30 year rule. It was in these circumstances that the Committee was asked to undertake the present review which has been effectively under way since May 1990.

         ASIO submitted that the 30-year rule was too short and that its records and those of the other Intelligence Agencies should be embargoed for 50 years. It submitted that a decision to withhold a record from release on security grounds should not be reviewable on appeal to the AAT.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While the Committee shares the concern of ASIO about certain classes of records, it does not accept the argument that the entire ASIO archive should be closed for 50 years. The Committee's general finding is that ASIO records should continue to be subject to the access provisions of the Archives Act and the open access period in respect of ASIO records should continue to be 30 years from the creation of the record.

         The first of ASIO's specific concerns relates to intelligence information supplied by Australia's defence and intelligence partners. The Committee was told and accepts that these allies supply or exchange intelligence information which is of crucial importance to Australia's defence and security and that they might terminate or reduce the level and quality of their cooperation unless completely satisfied with the level of protection provided in Australia. The Committee was told that Australia's comparatively liberal document access was a cause of concern to allies and could result in a reduction or down-grading of cooperation.

         To ensure the continued flow of high quality intelligence material the Committee recommends that it should be embargoed as long as it remains under embargo in the nation supplying it (Recommendation 1). It reinforces Recommendation 1 by proposing that once the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) has certified the foreign derived provenance of a record there should be no further appeal to the AAT from a decision not to release it (Recommendation 2).

         Another specific area of concern is the need to protect agents sources, targets and methods of operation of the Organization. It is difficult to see how an intelligence agency can function if it were not able to give guaranteed anonymity to its operatives. The Committee recommends that the identity of sources, agents and operatives should be guaranteed in guidelines for a period of 30 years from the persons death.

         However, the Committee did not accept an argument of ASIO that it should be able to claim an exemption on behalf of individuals mentioned in ASIO records, on broad grounds of privacy, unrelated to security. The Committee was satisfied that privacy rights of individuals were adequately protected under the general provisions of the Archives Act as administered by Australian Archives.

         Nor did the Committee accept the submission of ASIO that the right of appeal to the AAT from a refusal to release ASIO records should be abolished. ASIO had proposed that an appeal to the IGIS should be substituted.

         The Committee makes three Recommendations regarding the appeal process. The Archives Act provides a two-tiered system of review. A person refused access can, first, apply for an internal reconsideration. This is currently determined by the Director-General of Archives on the advice of ASIO. If still dissatisfied the applicant can appeal to the AAT.

         The Committee recommends that the Director-General of Security, not the Director-General of Archives, should determine applications for internal review which involve national security records. We have concluded that there should be a further right of appeal from the Director-General of Security through the IGIS to the Attorney-General. An appeal to the AAT should lie from the decision of the Attorney-General.

         For their part the clients of the Archives wishing to access ASIO records have expressed deep frustration both as to the failure of ASIO to comply with requests for access within the statutory period of 90 days and to a perceived failure of the Organization to be cooperative in its dealing with its client group.

         This evidence was strongly in favour of ASIO remaining subject to the 30-year rule and highly critical of the manner in which ASIO has responded to its legal obligation to provide access to its records. ASIO has been compared unfavourably with other Commonwealth agencies with whom these scholars deal for access to defence and security records. A problem here is that there is no identifiable person at ASIO with whom scholars can meet to negotiate complicated requests for information. Other Commonwealth agencies such as the departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade employ a designated official qualified to negotiate for the department and assist clients to formulate their requests.

         ASIO does not provide scholars with finding aids and indices as these departments do, with the result that scholars are forced to trawl by making omnibus requests in the hope of turning up the information that they want.

         ASIO releases records only after they have undergone a painstaking and labour intensive scrutiny by "clearers" who are Senior Intelligence Officers on a routine posting. The records released as a result of this process frequently disappoint the expectations of the clients who complain that they have been culled to such an extent that the only material released is documents already in the public domain.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Committee has, however, been satisfied that the process of clearing is justified on grounds of national security. The AAT in its decisions has endorsed the internal processes applied by ASIO and decisions made by ASIO to withhold material on national security grounds. It is unlikely, therefore that, as result of this report applicants will receive more material than they are getting now.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Despite these constraints the Committee believes that there is room for improvement in the way ASIO handles access requests. First, the Government must appropriate sufficient resources to enable ASIO to discharge its statutory obligations. There is a need for a change in ethos on the part of ASIO to a more cooperative approach. We recommend that an archival unit within ASIO be established to consult and negotiate with researchers, particularly those with large requests. Less complicated requests should be fast-tracked. The unit needed to be accessible to the public and this means that it needs to be headed by a person who can be known to the public.

         This will require a change to the ASIO Act which currently requires the anonymity of all ASIO personnel other than the Director-General of Security.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The unit should also develop indices and finding aids that can be made available to the public without infringing national security and can also devote some resources to preparing records, in advance, for release as they fall into the open access period.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Finally, Mr President, there have been expressions of concern that individuals have no right of access to records of ASIO to ensure that information about them on ASIO files is accurate. In certain cases, the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act provide such rights in relation to the current records, but not to ASIO as that legislation does not apply to the intelligence agencies. Such agencies routinely refuse to confirm or deny whether they have individuals under surveillance or hold records on them.

         The Committee acknowledges that this is the only possible stance for an intelligence agency to adopt. However, in Recommendation 14 we suggest a means whereby a person may bring information to the attention of the IGIS  which he would then be required to bring to the attention of any intelligence agency to whom it might be relevant.

         Mr President, the Committee believes the adoption of these proposals will ensure that the security interests of the Commonwealth continue to receive proper protection, at the same time ensuring that important national records are preserved for posterity, while providing at the same time as wide a right of public access to those records commensurate with the requirements of national security.

         I am writing in response to your Committee's interim report on telephone services, dated 12 December 1991.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government shares the concern of the Committee that there should be appropriate standards for the content of messages on the 0055 and 0051 networks provided by the Australian and overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) and that there should be appropriate enforcement of those standards.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I enclose for your information a copy of AOTC's response dated 23 March 1992 to the recommendations of your Committee's report. While there are some differences in regard to details, there appears to be broad agreement by AOTC to the thrust of the Committee's report, namely that there should be strict enforcement of appropriate standards.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In his letter to AOTC (then Telecom) dated 17 September 1991, the then Minister, Mr Beazley, expressed his support for the initiatives taken by the industry and the Government's preferred approach continues to be that there should be self-regulation by the industry on this matter.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         At the same time, the government reiterates its position that "adult" services not be available on the open access 0055 service but either be withdrawn or, if appropriate, migrated to the closed user access 0051 service.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC has advised me that, since the time of the tabling of the Committee's report, the industry has acted to modify or withdraw messages which do not meet content standards. In addition, some service providers have connected messages to the 0051 service. I have also been advised that the number of complaints about unsuitable 0055 messages has declined from 138 in January 1992 to 13 in February 1992, which may reflect the fact that arrangements put in place by the industry are now taking affect.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Nevertheless, the Government will continue to monitor the industry closely and if there is evidence that the system of self-regulation is not working, the Government will take appropriate action to ensure that legitimate community concerns are addressed. I also enclose for your information a copy of a letter which I have written to the Chairman of AOTC on this matter.

         AOTC'S RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED IN THE INTERIM REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY STANDARDS RELEVANT TO THE SUPPLY OF SERVICES UTILISING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC appreciates the work of the Committee to this stage and is generally supportive of the recommendations contained in the Interim Report relating to 0055 services.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Before providing specific responses to the Recommendations in the Report, we would like to take the opportunity to comment on the following matters raised in the Committee's Report and the Chairperson's tabling statement in Parliament:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .At paragraph 4.14 of the report, the Committee "commends the Minister for his intervention and condemns Telecom for its obvious lack of concern for principles of accountability to Parliament".
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         Although the Minister's letter to Telecom of 17 September 1991 regarding "adult" services was not a formal direction, Telecom took positive steps to implement the Minister's wishes. Until we are in a position to implement the Committee's recommendations concerning new standards, AOTC has had no alternative but to follow the procedures developed in the new Codes of Practice.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         Telecom's interpretation of the Minister's letter was that "adult" messages are those which did not conform to the new code of Practice and these should be modified, withdrawn or migrated to the 0051 service.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         AOTC, therefore, does not understand the Committee's conclusion that Telecom's actions showed a "lack of concern for principles of accountability to Parliament".
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .In the tabling statement, the Chairperson states that "the Committee has rejected Telecom's approach to the problem (control of message content) essentially because it is clearly not working".
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         The Codes of Practice formulated by the Telephone Information Service Standards Committee (TISSC) were introduced on 1 October 1991. AOTC's view is that any new mechanism for control of message content and advertising needs time to indicate positive results. It is of note that action taken by Telecom since October as well as action initiated by Service Providers has resulted in a large reduction in the number of advertisements for adult services in the media. Also, 1075 public complaints (independent of Telecom actions) have been handled by the Telephone Information Services Arbitrator to the end of January 1992.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         .A further point in the tabling statement is critical of Telecom "for its failure to fully respond to the Committee's operations and for having proceeded with certain areas of policy measures, which clearly fall within the Committee's terms of reference, while the Committee's inquiry has still been in progress".
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         AOTC is disappointed at this criticism as Telecom's intentions in regard to the Codes of Practice for 0055 and 0051 were made clear in our original submission and in subsequent discussions, for example, Hansard pages 61 and 62.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         In addition, at the last hearing on 7 November 1991, Telecom put the view, and understood that the Chairperson agreed with it, that our actions had not been pre-emptive. This was on the basis that revised contracts incorporating the new Codes of Practice had not been signed. However, Service Providers have formally agreed to abide by the Codes of Practice.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC's comments on the recommendations are set out below. We reserve the right to reconsider our views, however, in the light of the Committee's final report and of any further debate on these matters by the Senate as a whole.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 1: That Telecom adopt as the code of conduct for its message standard for the 0055 open access service the following:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          (a)The Service Provider will not provide knowingly or negligently on any 0055 number allocated to it, information which in any way may be interpreted as indecent, obscene, offensive or sexually titillating or denoting sexual suggestion or sexual fantasy; and
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          (b)The Service Provider will not provide knowingly or negligently on any 0055 number allocated to it, messages whether described as medical or otherwise which contain material that a reasonable parent would not wish his or her child to hear without parental guidance.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC can accept in principle this recommendation which contains the wording from the Message Standards section of the previous 0055 Operational Requirements. However, there is a concern that the sweeping nature of the provision, and, in particular, the words "in any way" in part (a) would set a standard of such a low threshold that any person's judgement would be determinative. It will be recalled that it was this broad sweep which in many instances made this requirement unrealistic for Telecom to enforce when it was part of the earlier standards. AOTC suggests that any words "in any way" should be deleted.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC's experience has been that there is a strong community demand for medical messages. On our reading, the Committee's recommendation leaves it open for suitably authorised and appropriately structured medical messages to continue to be available on the 0055 service. However a message that would otherwise be acceptable under part (a) may fail under the "reasonable parent" test in part (b) of the recommendation.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC suggests that the Committee should give further consideration to the genuine community need for such messages on the one hand and the concern of parents relating to access by children on the other.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Whilst not specifically covered in this recommendation, it is noted from the tabling statement in Parliament on 12 December 1991 that the Committee proposes adoption of advertising and other standards from Telecom's previous Operational Requirements.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If the Committee's view is that advertising and other standards should parallel the message content standards, an explicit reference should be included in the recommendation to avoid any confusion.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 2: That Telecom ensure that all services currently provided on 0055 which are in breach of the message standard as listed in Recommendation 1 are either migrated immediately to the 0051 closed user access service or are withdrawn outright.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC agrees in principle with this recommendation. Obviously if a message does not comply with the standards in Recommendation No. 1 once they are incorporated into contracts with Service Providers, it will not continue to be connected to 0055.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There are three matters requiring attention in implementation of this recommendation:

         Recommendation 3: That Telecom adopt as the code of conduct for its message standard for the 0051 closed user access service the following:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         The Service Provider will not provide knowingly or negligently on any 0051 number allocated to it, information which in any way may be interpreted as equivalent to the R or X film/video classification.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC accepts this recommendation in principle and, consistent with our response to Recommendation No. 1(a), suggests that the words "in any way" be deleted.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The recommendation would therefore read ". . . . . . . . . information which may be interpreted as equivalent. . . . . . . . . ".
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The linking of audio and visual classifications could cause difficulties in interpretation but no doubt the work could be undertaken on a good faith basis by a qualified agency.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 4: That Telecom discontinue its contractual agreements with Service Providers and offer new contractual agreements which observe the recommended code of conduct.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC agrees to this recommendation and will endeavour to have new contracts in place at an early date. To this end, Telecom has been discussing with the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) the proposed role for the OFLC and new standards for message content. The OFLC is preparing draft standards, based on the Committee's recommendations and discussions, to replace the relevant parts of the current Codes of Practice.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC has also been discussing the question of new contracts with Service Providers, the Telephone Information Services Standards Committee (TISSC) and the Telephone Information Service Arbitrator (TISA). In particular the contracts will need to cover consumer protection issues which are not within the province of the OFLC.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It might be noted that Service Providers have not agreed to adopt the Committee's recommended standards and have challenged AOTC's legal right to vary the contracts.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 5: That Telecom enter into a contract with the Office of Film and Literature Classification for it to act as the monitoring and enforcement body for the code of conduct.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This recommendation is acceptable in principle to AOTC and the OFLC has been contacted (see response to Recommendation No. 4). The cost of the new arrangements will be a factor in the contract negotiations with the OFLC.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC's view is that there will still be significant roles for TISSC and TISA in areas other than message content and advertising standards, for example, consumer protection issues (see also response to Recommendation No. 4).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recommendation 6: That Telecom undertake to introduce an immediate program of random monitoring to ensure contractual compliance of message content on both 0055 and 0051 with the code of conduct.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC agrees in principle with this recommendation and will make continuing arrangements for random monitoring of 0055 services. This must be co-ordinated with the similar OFLC activities requested by the Committee.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC agrees that there need to be appropriate sanctions for breaches of standards. We also agree that discontinuation of a message may well be appropriate in certain circumstances. However, AOTC cannot agree with the recommendation as worded, for the following reasons:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          (a)Cancellation of a Service Provider's total contract for a subsequent breach is considered to be too general a prescription and could be construed as unfair and unreasonable because of the automatic application proposed.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          (b)Most Service Providers are involved in a wide range of messages. Cancellation of the entire contract for two offending messages would be a harsh penalty. Cancellation of a contract would penalise users of other messages provided by the same Service Provider.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          (c)Breaches of the code of conduct can range from relatively harmless to very serious and the proposed penalty in the recommendation does not adequately reflect the range of breaches. This is another aspect of the unfairness and unreasonableness of the recommendation.

         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Taking the above into account, AOTC would prefer the recommendation to be framed to provide that contracts with Service Providers should require immediate discontinuation of a message when it is determined to be in breach of the standards in Recommendation No. 1. There should be a range of penalties for various types of breaches as is currently described in the Codes of Practice and, in addition, there should be provision for contract cancellation for flagrant, significant or continuing breaches of the message content standards.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         AOTC agrees in principle with this recommendation but, as noted by the Committee in paragraph 4.77 of its Interim Report, implementation is not practicable in the short term.

         Major development work would be necessary to effect changes to current billing arrangements. The need to exempt 0055 calls which record a vote in polls or enter miscellaneous competitions adds to the complexity of the problem.

         —I wish to speak briefly about a matter of considerable importance to the Senate because on one view it could constitute an abuse of the process of Senate committee hearings. It concerns statements made by the Australian Workers Union that it has only recently become aware of commercial links between certain farming organisations and certain insurance companies.

         In March this year, in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the Australian Workers Union claimed that until recently it had been unaware of commercial links between employer associations and insurance companies. Its concerns particularly relate to the circumstances in which the pastoral award provides for two insurance companies to be the sponsors of superannuation funds, the fact that those insurance companies conduct a wide range of insurance business and that commissions paid by those companies to agents and others are the subject of commercial links with certain farming organisations. It is not suggested by anyone, as I understand it, that there are any commissions payable on the sale of superannuation business. Nor is it suggested by the AWU that there is anything improper in these arrangements.

         The AWU has said to the Senate Committee that it was simply not aware of these commercial links. In a letter dated 19 March, the Secretary of the union, Michael Forshaw, wrote to the Managing Director of the Australian Eagle Insurance Company Ltd, complaining in very strong terms about some comments in a letter in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        . . . was never revealed to the Industrial Relations Commission at the time the Pastoral Industry Superannuation Award was first made. It was certainly never made known to the AWU even though we are a party to the Industrial Award which provides for superannuation contributions to be paid into the fund managed by your company. Rather this information only came to our knowledge some time after the Award was made. In my view, this was relevant and material information that should have been disclosed at the time.

        and subsequently were the subject of discussion on the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Country Hour
        </emphasis>
        on Radio National. As one would imagine, that program achieves quite wide currency in the farming community. Therefore, Radio National became a vehicle for the retailing of these concerns. Indeed, the presenter commenced the program by pointing out that the union, in giving evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, had said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the National Farmers Federation and some state farmer organisations failed to reveal commercial links with insurance funds handling superannuation payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Nick Sherry, the Chairman of the Select Committee, was also interviewed on the program. I say in passing that Senator Sherry is doing an excellent job as Chairman of that Committee, but unfortunately he, too, appears to have been misled on the basis of this information. It had been argued that the commercial relationship should have been disclosed and he expressed some concerns about this. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The allegation made to us was that there is a commercial relationship . . . and that should have been disclosed at the time the superannuation fund was set up. . . I think it's an important issue that superannuation funds, if it is claimed that they're independent, are in fact totally independent and there is no commercial relationship.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of independence relates purely to the question of the status of the trustees of the funds and that matter has been made clear from the outset.

         The National Farmers Federation has engaged in heated disputation with the AWU about whether there should be worker representatives on the boards of trustees. The NFF's position is that it is much more appropriate to have people with commercial expertise, but as a fall back position they would contemplate employer and employee representatives on the board. But it does not believe that it is appropriate to have union representatives on the board because the level of unionisation in the pastoral industry is very low. I will come in a moment to the consequences of even having superannuation provisions apply in the pastoral industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fact is that on the basis of those sorts of allegations, clearly an attempt is being made by the Australian Workers Union to suggest that somehow these commercial links have only recently surfaced and that that is a matter of great concern. It is significant that at present Commissioner Merriman has reserved his decision on a review he has conducted about superannuation arrangements in the pastoral industry. That decision is expected to be handed down shortly.

         and on Radio National. The facts reveal that this is simply not the case. I wish to take the Senate to the transcript of evidence relating to the original application when the matter was before the Industrial Relations Commission and the provisions of the pastoral award were being determined.

         Far from these commercial links not having been made known to the Commission, I would point out that Mr Costello, who appeared for the employer respondents, indicated at the outset that he proposed to call evidence in relation to the Australian farm superannuation fund, a fund sponsored inter alia by the Victorian Farmers Federation in conjunction with Australian Eagle. Evidence was given by a Mr Towers, a principal witness. When asked what was the Victorian farmers insurance agency, Mr Towers's evidence was that it was:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a linkup between Australian Eagle and the Victorian Farmers Federation which provides general insurance assistance to Victorian farmers. So it is a network throughout the State'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most importantly, he was asked what source of money the agency derived to pay its people. The answer was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        They would be on the commission they had received for the policies they had sold'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, Mr Towers was making it perfectly plain that commissions were payable on general insurance and that that was a matter that was on the table from the outset. It is therefore extraordinary not only that the AWU should pretend that somehow it was never aware of these commercial links, but also that it should seek to raise the matter at this time. I think one is entitled to draw the conclusion that this is a fairly grubby attempt to try to influence the Industrial Relations Commission at the eleventh hour, after all the evidence is in but while the umpire is still presumably making up his mind.

         We know that the Government and the ACTU have no respect at all for the notion of an independent IRC. We have only to look at the howls of outrage which followed the 1991 national wage case when the Commission had the temerity to suggest that award superannuation was simply not working. Since that time the Commission has been subjected to unprecedented and outrageous bully boy tactics by the likes of Cabinet Ministers Cook and Kelty—a campaign of abuse, intimidation and vilification that would make Mike Tyson blush and which was clearly designed to influence the IRC or, failing that, to cut it off at the knees. That is why Mr Kelty is so determined that it should not even retain the nexus of pay with Federal Court judges.

         The fact remains that these allegations by the AWU are simply not true. I think the real explanation is this: Mr Forshaw, who was the General Secretary at the time and who was obviously aware of the commercial links, simply did not do his homework. In other words, he did not research the matter. He could easily have looked at the annual reports of the Victorian Farmers Federation and other State organisations, discovered the true nature and extent of those commercial links, the amounts of moneys that were being paid by way of commission, and then, if necessary, have made a further submission to the IRC or, indeed, have amplified concerns expressed at the time. But he did not do any of that. In other words, he was too lazy. He simply proceeded on the basis of the evidence and then discovered matters later on of which he was clearly capable of having knowledge earlier. Then to disguise his own incompetence and ineptitude he has resorted to this sort of blustering tactic, presumably to persuade his own membership that this is a matter of current concern when in fact, if it was ever a matter of concern, it was a matter that should have been known to him and should have been raised at the time.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think in the circumstances it is incumbent on Mr Forshaw to make a full and frank explanation, which I would have thought would involve an apology for attempting to mislead the Senate Committee, and certainly to withdraw any inference that this is designed to influence the Commission in its deliberations. I would be very interested to hear Mr Forshaw's explanation for his going over the top in the way that he did. I can understand that because he did not do his homework he might not have been aware of the full nature and extent of these commercial arrangements, but the fact remains that they were fully disclosed at the time. He could have known more about them if he had chosen to inquire further, but he simply did not. That is in no way a sufficient justification for taking up the time of the Senate Committee in the way that he has and attempting to mislead the Senate Committee and others by suggesting that he was not aware of these commercial links.

It would be a travesty of justice both to the families of all those who have died in custody either under the consideration of the Royal Commission or outside it and to all the hours of bureaucratic effort put into addressing it if it were to be marginalised by the low priority so far allocated to it in this Senate.

I request that any honourable senator who has not actually read one of the 99 individual case studies of the deaths reported by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody should choose one from within their own State. This will allow the full and serious impact of this Royal Commission to be considered prior to the discussion of the ministerial statement at the next Senate sitting. I am increasingly realising the pressure of time under which all parliamentarians work and if it is not possible to read one case study, I urge senators at least to read the report I tabled on 31 March 1992. It is entitled

Fifty per cent of its production is exported to Asia, America and Europe and almost all the remainder is purchased in Australia by overseas tourists. The company started in 1985 and now employs 55 people in the Blainey area. It is just one of a number of companies in the wool chain.

It seems to me disappointing that the Australian media, which fills its back pages with lots of stories about how an Austrian might have won some downhill event, and a Norwegian another and a Swede another, cannot find space to provide any sort of encouragement for disabled Australian sportsmen performing in world competition in the Winter Olympics.

Even if the media does not care about Australian disabled sport, I am certain the Senate as a whole does.

         —I want to make a few remarks about what I think is a very sad day for Australia when we see the Government taking action to ban the right to trade in products that are legal. For me, the right to trade in products that are legal includes the right to advertise, the right to sponsor and the right to promote that legal product. I refer to the Government's decision to ban sponsorship of sporting events and, indeed, cultural events and any other events concerning the tobacco industry and smoking.

         I say right at the outset that I gave up smoking about 16 years ago and I did it for reasons that made sense to me. However, I will defend the right of anyone who wishes to smoke to do so and I will defend the right of the companies to promote their products through the ordinary outlets that are available, be they be billboards, sponsorship, television, or radio. With the so-called death of socialism, we find in our community a small but growing band of people who want to impose their values on everybody else—the regulators; the people who want to tell you what is good for you and what is not good for you, what you may have what you may not have, when you may have it and when you may not have it. They may think they have had a win today with the banning of the sponsorship of tobacco products. What will be next, the alcohol industry? Then they will move on to the confectionery industry and the manufacturers of armchairs. Perhaps they will move on to the day-to-day right that we have to choose between a wool product and a synthetic product. The world is full of people who want to tell us how we ought to spend our dollars, how we ought to make judgments.

         It is most important that we determine that we have civil liberties in our country, and that we have the right to deal with products that are legal. Why do those people who want to see tobacco products banned not have the courage to come out and fight that issue?  A survey of the newspapers the other day showed that 70 per cent of ordinary Australian citizens believe that companies ought to have the right to sponsor sporting events, cultural events or any other activity that they wish to sponsor. Seventy per cent of Australian opinion is just to be knocked out by the people who are determined to regulate the way in which everybody lives.

         There has been a concerted campaign to make tobacco and alcohol somehow synonymous with the illegal and illicit drugs that kill or ruin the lives of young people. There has been a concerted campaign to try to say that tobacco and alcohol are just as bad as heroin or cocaine or marijuana or amphetamines. Well, it is wrong. Our society has made a judgment. We have adjudged that alcohol and tobacco are legal products within our community and that the others are not. We have adjudged that we can find ways of dealing with those products in our society which allow a legal product to be dealt with in the way I have earlier described in terms of advertising and sales. But here we have the thin edge of the wedge, which is a threat to every other manufacturer, seller, retailer of products which some group will determine are really not in the best interests of citizens.

         In a democracy I believe that individuals are entitled to make up their own minds. I do not wear the argument that some people are better at making up other people's minds for them. I do not want a judgment about whose IQ is high enough to make a judgment about his or her own life. My colleague Senator Baume was just talking about disabled sportsmen who have made a judgment for themselves that they will not be disbarred from taking part in any aspect of life they choose. Ordinarily, one might say that because of their impairment they are unable to participate in competitive sport. Well, they have decided for themselves that their own will will entitle them to do it, and more courage to them.

         —I wish to draw attention to an answer that was given to me in Question Time by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. In doing so I want to highlight a tactic that is being adopted by a number of Government Ministers—and Senator Lewis highlighted this today—who begin answers to questions by saying or inferring that one has the question wrong.

         This tactic will get the Government into all sorts of trouble because we will come back—in particular, I will come back—and point out where the Government is wrong. Senator Cook, in his comments today, was wrong, not only in the substance of what he said—he has misled the Senate, as I contended in my question today—but also in his assertion that I have got it wrong. I want to explain why he is wrong. He cast aspersions on the accuracy of my question. My question yesterday was very carefully worded. The words were ` to force contractors to operate within the award system'. I underline that word `force'. I turn to the press release the Minister put out yesterday. I intend to explain why I assert that the word `force' is correct. I will quote two paragraphs of that press release which relate to this matter and to the Minister's emphatic answer,` No' to my question yesterday. His press release states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have regard to relevant customs and practice in a dispute over independent contractors and ensure that their use is not harsh or unfair.
       </para>
       <para>
        He says `dispute'. This will affect every contractor in this country, because all anybody has to do where contractors are operating is to bring on a dispute. That can be brought on in a number of ways: by withdrawing labour and going on strike, or by lodging an application with the Industrial Relations Commission stating that there is a particular problem. That could be done to any contractor in any situation in any workplace in Australia. The Minister then goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Commission can also determine whether the total remuneration of contractors will be less than that of employees and whether there is any intention to avoid obligations under awards.
       </para>
       <para>
        For Senator Cook yesterday, and also again today, to state that this would not have an impact on all contractors is truly false. It is false for the very reason I gave regarding the last paragraph I quoted, in that a dispute can be brought on. These contractors have made their own arrangements with their employees, whether they be part of a contract team, or whether the contractor is contracted out to an owner or employer to carry out certain tasks in a certain area, which for example could be the building industry. The cottage building industry has expressed the most concern.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is blatantly wrong and totally false to suggest that the implications of this legislation as presented in this press release will not affect contractors in the building industry or, for that matter, contractors in any other industry. Once a dispute is brought before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission pressure will be put on those contractors to comply in terms of the various existing awards.

         The next thing I want to refer to regarding the answer that was given to me today is the use of term, `sham contractors'. The use of the term, `sham contractors' is aimed absolutely and blatantly at none other than Troubleshooters—except that the Minister has not said Troubleshooters. It is aimed at the concept that Troubleshooters have introduced in recent years into the Australian contract system. I particularly want to refer to the last part of Senator Cook's answer to me today, where he said:

         But in other areas, customs and practices may well be different. On a multi-storey construction site in the middle of the central business district of a capital city, custom and practice would be award coverage, and, should people wish then to try and break that down by introducing sham contracts, the Commission would have regard to that award area of award coverage and award against the so-called independent contractors.

         I want to point out Troubleshooters' contract arrangements. The first area in which it worked—and worked very successfully, I might add—was in the building construction industry. This proposed legislation is targeted directly at it, and it is targeted against this legal background: the BWIU took action in the Federal Court before Justice Woodward in early 1989. The case that it put to Justice Woodward was that the activities of Troubleshooters should be ruled out by the Federal Court. In fact, Justice Woodward, when he had heard all the evidence and information, upheld the position of Troubleshooters. In summing up, in his judgment he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Individuals or groups have the right to choose whether they wish to work as a contractor or contractors, combined, or for a contractor.
       </para>
       <para>
        The union then appealed the decision to the Full Bench of the Federal Court. The Federal Court upheld the decision of Justice Woodward. The BWIU then sought leave to appeal to the High Court in regard to the decisions of both Justice Woodward of the Federal Court and the Full Bench of the Federal Court. The High Court looked at the evidence in the case and rejected the application to appeal to the High Court.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It has been upheld by both the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the land, that Troubleshooters, the contractors referred to in this press release—and I will refer to further evidence of that in a moment or two—is operating an activity which is within the law of this country. They have upheld not only the operations of Troubleshooters, but also the rights of individuals—something that Senator Bishop was talking about a moment ago—to determine whether they want to work as a contractor, whether they want to work as a group in forming a contract arrangement, or whether they want to work for a contractor.

         I would like to fill in some of the background to this decision that has been made by the Minister in giving notice of his intention to introduce this legislation which will, in effect, as I said, force contractors in this country to have no other option but to be pressured, regarding the arrangements they make, into taking another aspect into account in terms of award coverage. Contractors should have the right to determine how they want to take on a particular task, the period of time involved and the conditions under which that particular task will be carried out. I want to highlight first a letter from the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia to Mr Bill Kelty, Secretary of the ACTU. It is signed by Tom McDonald, National Secretary. I will read the first four paragraphs of this letter:

         It also highlights the direct move by the BWIU to the Secretary of the ACTU to override, by whatever means available, the decision of Justice Woodward, as I said, which was upheld by, first, the Full Bench of the Federal Court and, second, the High Court—that fundamental decision or principle that individuals have the right to choose.

         I turn to the next piece of information. On 14 February 1992 we had another letter—I have it here—from the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia to its membership. I am not going to read the whole letter, only a paragraph of it. It says—and note the date, 14 February 1992; yesterday was 1 April 1992:

        This highlights the fact that the BWIU was informed at least before 14 February 1992 of the position, yet yesterday, in answer to a question of mine in this chamber, the Minister could not tell us what the Government's intentions were. He answered emphatically, `No', yet four hours later he could put out a press release highlighting the situation. That proves quite conclusively that the Minister has more regard for his position, which in the past has been with the BWIU, than he has for this Senate chamber.

         I would like to make some general comments on workplace reform. The Minister referred today to those people in the cottage industries. He implied that what he called `genuine contractors'—he did not use these words but that is what he meant—would not have their arrangements in terms of housing construction, which have served this nation well for a long time, put in jeopardy. That is not correct. The legislation will increase disputation regarding the building of homes and units, et cetera, and will create unnecessary disruption on those sites.

         But it goes further than that. What the legislation is also saying is that Australian industrial relations have to stand still. He says in his answer that if it has been the practice in the past—and I refer to construction sites—we are going to have to stay with the old practices of the past; we cannot progress into the twenty-first century. As we move into the twenty-first century  we could well see—and I believe that we will—totally different arrangements to those that have prevailed in the past on building sites and on any other manufacturing sites in this country. It is irresponsible of the Minister to stop progress in terms of modernising our contracting practice and keeping pace with the best international practice.

         Senator Cook is determined to wipe out what has been a very successful innovation in terms of contracting that has been introduced by troubleshooters in the construction industry and other industries in this country. I would warn—notify all contractors that if this legislation goes through in the context in which it has been put out in the press release by the Minister they will all be affected because they will become part of the dispute process in this country. Once that happens, they will be subject to scrutiny by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.

         While in Jordan I had the good fortune to be invited to participate in the University of Sydney's archaeological mission to Pella, about which I want to say a few  words. Pella is a large site in the northern Jordan located some three kilometres east of the Jordan River, opposite Bet She'an in Israel. It is perhaps one of the most important sites in Jordan. In fact, it has been recognised as one of the most important sites in the entire Levantine region. Indeed, Sydney University is very privileged to have a long association with the work in that place.

         The site contains habitation remains from the chalcolithic period, roughly 4500 BC, to modern Islamic remains. The nearby region is rewriting the prehistory of humankind, with Aechulien stone tools dating to circa 250,000 BC located in the rock strata. These stone tools were located by the Sydney University team at its last season and in previous years, and I had the privilege of personally examining those implements.

         Sydney University has been working at the site for nearly 15 years examining not only the main tell but the neighbouring region. Under the auspices of Professor Basil Hennessy, successive teams have progressively uncovered a broad range of remains spanning all the periods that I have outlined. Following a brief hiatus caused by the Gulf war, the team of which I was a member returned once again to excavate the main tell under the auspices of Dr Stephen Bourke.

         Work concentrated in the main area where several existing trenches were reopened to gain a further understanding of the underlying strata. By the season's end important early Bronze Age housing had been unearthed, along with the remains of an early Bronze Age fortress dating to roughly 3000 BC. Further work was conducted on the so-called late Bronze Age governor's residence dating to 1300 BC, or the late eighteenth, early nineteenth dynasty in Egypt, at the time of Rameses the Great. A beautiful clay astarte figurine—complete—was one of the most important finds of this period that was found at the recent excavations.

         I spent a total of three weeks in the field, excavating a small two by two metre sondage that had been uncovered in an area in which a large amount of remains from the early Iron Age period had already been uncovered. My goal was to dig as quickly as I could to excavate down to the bedrock at the base of the habitation remains. After three weeks I had excavated a three metre deep trench and had in fact achieved my research goal of reaching the bedrock and in doing so had uncovered quite substantial layers of human habitation floor remains and a dump fill which had been placed upon those floors by people in ancient times.

In fact, in 1990, 4.8 per cent of our total exports went to countries in that region. Half of those exports were wheat but many more were other primary products. Manufactured goods and minerals processing products are becoming an increasing part of Australian exports to that region. In addition, we have significant and expanding markets for barley and other processed exports. To this extent it is my hope and the hope of the Democrats that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Australian businesses will seek to expand the opportunities that exist for Australian primary products in the Middle East.

         —I wish to raise a matter of concern regarding the conduct of one of the Government's key business regulatory agencies. For some 18 months the Trade Practices Commission has pursued, at massive cost to both itself and thus the Commonwealth and the Australian taxpayer, and at a similar massive cost to a respected trade association, the Motor Trades Association of Australia (MTAA), a course of action which has led to charges being laid against the Service Station Association of New South Wales, its honorary president and its executive director. The Service Station Association of New South Wales is a member of the MTAA. I do not want to canvass the substance of the issues involved; they will be decided in a case commencing in the Federal Court on 15 June. Considering the limited amount of time available, I seek leave to have my copious notes incorporated in

        As background, however, the alleged breaches of the Trade Practices Act relate to a campaign endorsed by the Board of Directors of the Motor Trades Association of Australia known as `Prosper from Petrol'. The aim of this education campaign, elements of which were also adopted by a number of other member bodies of MTAA was to educate service station operators in how to avoid selling petrol at a loss and thus to earn a decent return of their labour and capital investment. At the time it was launched, many thousands of service station operators were in serious financial difficulty and were running their businesses at a loss, as indeed they still are.

        Details of this campaign were put before the TPC by the MTAA who, in fact, asked the TPC for its advice. At no time did the TPC  advise that any part of the campaign was unacceptable.

        The Commission has investigated similar allegations against individuals in the past but unlike its previous investigations, in this instance the Commission wheeled out the intimidatory and draconian powers available to it under Section 155 of the Trade Practices Act. Service station operators were required to present themselves for an examination by counsel for, and officials of, the TPC in circumstances where, on occasion, this interrogation continued over several days. Those who had to appear were discouraged from having legal representation and initially were denied access to transcripts of their interviews.

        I am also concerned that the TPC in pursuing its case decided to begin legal action against a trade association and its members without first raising its concerns with that association. This is despite a cordial and accessible relationship between the TPC and the MTAA, whose executive director has served as a member of the TPC's national consultative committee since 1989.

        The MTAA has cooperated with government bodies including the TPC and the Prices Surveillance Authority to address structural problems confronting the petroleum industry. Immediately prior to the commencement of the TPC's investigations MTAA had committed substantial resources to assist the TPC in its review of the industry.

        The Trade Practices Act specifically sets out that the TPC has the power and, it might be argued, a duty to enter a process of discussion and negotiation. Such a conciliatory approach may have alerted the Association to the TPC's concerns and allowed for amicable resolution.

I am very concerned that a new senator comes into the Senate and makes the most outrageous claims that I have heard for quite some time. Senator Chamarette asserted that Western Australia senators or members or State members of parliament—I am not too sure exactly who, because she seemed to get the terminology all garbled; she specifically referred to Opposition members—had gone up to Ashburton in the Pilbara, where there is a by-election this Saturday, to try to con Aboriginal members of the community. `Con' may not have been the exact word that she used—I was in my office when I heard her make the statement—but denying them their rights was certainly the implication of what she was trying to say.

         —I think the Senate should be grateful to Senator Knowles for making it aware of the statements that Senator Chamarette has made because I find those statements that she has been reported to have made quite offensive. Usually, when people become members of the Senate, they wait for a few weeks until they understand the system before they become critical. But the new senator appears to have put her foot right in her proverbial mouth. She may come into this Senate believing that she is the only one concerned about Aboriginal welfare, but she is going to find that this Senate gives bipartisan support for the welfare of our indigenous community. So if she comes in here and accuses the Government and the Opposition of not being interested or not being prepared to debate the very important issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody, she is being absolutely ignorant and showing no respect for her colleagues on all sides of the Parliament.

         That is not the prime reason that I rose today. I am concerned about the Government's decision to ban tobacco advertising. I am concerned for a number of reasons. What does one ban next?  If one bans a legal product—it is legal to sell it, it is legal to produce it, it is legal to use it—then there are a lot of other ramifications. What is next—alcohol, guns, or anything about which people may hold a different view? I think it is a very dangerous precedent to set. It is not, in my opinion, in the best interests of the overall community.

         I understand the arguments for the banning; I understand them only too well. I have chosen not to smoke, and my family has done likewise. But to construe that we should ban tobacco advertising because of health reasons is something that does not sit very well with me. If the Senate wished to debate whether tobacco should be banned because it is a health risk, I think that would be a more direct way to go. If we were to ban tobacco as a product, then the Senate could argue the merits of that. But what we are trying to do is to have it both ways—to have a product that is legal and one which we are trying to choke by underhand methods.

The region of Queensland that relies totally on the tobacco growing industry is an area around Mareeba, and 350-odd tobacco growers came to Canberra only a couple of weeks ago to see the Government, and were here this week to see the Opposition.

         I want to make this point very strongly: there are moves to get rid of that tobacco industry by taking the mix of 57 per cent from the industry and by a number of other ways that are going to weaken the industry, including the removal of advertising. I say to the Senate that if these tobacco growers lose their industry and the industry does close down in north Queensland, where about 60 per cent of the tobacco is grown, that is not going to solve the health problem in Australia, because that product that is grown in Australia will be replaced by imports.

         It may be argued that, because of subsidies and a number of other market distortions, tobacco will come into Australia at a much cheaper rate, which would encourage more people to smoke. But I am concerned, as I have said before, that it is the thin edge of the wedge, as I think one other senator mentioned. Neither the Government's decision nor the Opposition's response has gone to the party room. When it does, I will be arguing very strongly to vote against any reduction or any removal of tobacco advertising in Australia. It is up to everyone to make a decision on whether they want to smoke cigarettes or not. People should have the liberty to make the choice. To take people's choice away from them and to interfere with the right of companies to advertise a legal product is not in the best interests of Australia.

         —I thank those senators who have contributed to the adjournment debate. I simply want to put on the record my appreciation of the services of two members of my parliamentary office staff who are leaving after many years of devoted service, Mr Daryl Smeaton and Miss Sally Anderson. Mr Daryl Smeaton has been my senior adviser for almost the whole term of my being a Minister in this Labor Government. I pay tribute to his perseverance and commitment in relation to many issues. I am quite sure that, for example, the restructuring of the Australian Federal Police and the agreement of the Premiers to a uniform approach to sensible gun regulation, to the possession of guns in this community, would not have occurred but for that persistence and commitment on his part—quite apart, of course, from those many instances of personal loyalty and unfailing good humour which helped to keep an office together.

         The last two elements apply equally to my personal secretary, Miss Sally Anderson. She has done a tremendous job in organising my itinerary, my diary, and in liaising with other officers. I believe that her tremendous, happy personality has enabled my office to weather many storms of an unpredictable Minister reacting perhaps under stress and flaring up occasionally. To both members of my staff I pay a tribute and wish them the best in their future endeavours.

         The reason for this is that the television production facilities of the building are such that it is only possible to televise simultaneously four events.

         The production task this afternoon is essentially the same as the live production of four television programs simultaneously. This production requires a very significant range of facilities starting with cameras through to the control rooms, video tape recording and editing, caption generation and staff for all those points in the production chain.

The facilities physically do not exist in the building for more than four live telecasts.

        While no line item was identified in the 1991-92 Budget in respect of Australia's obligations under the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children, the Government provided additional funding under a number of existing programs including additional funding of $400,000 for UNICEF. Other international health programs focused on children and maternal health will also receive a $300,000 increase in funding in 1991-92. Funding of further proposals relating to our obligations under the Declaration will be considered in the 1992-93 Budget following completion of the National Plan of Action which will set out Australia's response to the Declaration.

These occupied bed day projections are based on RPPS arrangements and differ from occupied bed day projections published as "Inpatient demand projections for Department of Veterans' Affairs eligible treatment populations 1988-2005" by R Van Konkelenberg of the Australian Institute of Health. The Van Konkelenberg projections assumed continuation of the RGHs and current policies directing veterans to the RGHs.

        The RPPS will offer entitled veterans and war widows improved health care options. It will give greater choice of hospital and specialists with integration of the RGHs. Presently the choice of hospital in metropolitan areas is the RGH and in all cities other than Sydney choice of specialists is similarly restricted.

        Following integration, it is estimated that there will be an increase in demand from entitled veterans and war widows who are currently treated as public (Medicare) patients or as privately insured patients. This is because current arrangements deny them the opportunity to be treated locally. Nationally, this Medicare shift is expected to be in the order of 5-6% and has been apportioned to public and private hospitals. Medicare shift will vary considerably between States but only broad estimates can be made at this stage. It is expected to be significant in NSW but negligible in Tasmania.

        The above estimates assume that current public/ private sector usage patterns will broadly be maintained. The public sector includes RGH beds. In the absence of experience, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent of shift from the public to private sector beds. In areas in which there are significantly under-utilised private sector beds and/ or difficulties in accessing private beds in public hospitals, there is substantial potential for drift.

        It is assumed that there will be a 5-6% Medicare shift as indicated above. Under the Commonwealth/ State Medicare agreements there would be no opportunity for the Commonwealth to make offsetting savings for accommodation and medical services costs previously applying to veterans as public patients. Offsetting savings on accommodation costs for veterans previously treated as private patients would flow mainly to the health funds and there would be minimal Commonwealth offsets on medical services previously claimed under Medicare (at 75% of the MBS).

        It is considered that DVA will be able to arrange specialist care in hospitals at a fee for service payment of 100% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule. If a system were to be introduced where providers were permitted to bill veterans for the difference between the MBS and the AMA recommended rates, assuming 50% of specialists chose to bill at the AMA rates, the Commonwealth would be faced with additional costs of $40m at current usage levels. Were entitled veterans and war widows to meet this extra cost, each person who sees specialists would on average pay an additional $205 per annum.

An increase in the earnings tax will directly reduce the after-tax earnings of superannuation funds and is likely to reduce the incentive, particularly for those people on a marginal tax rate of 20 per cent, for accumulating superannuation savings.

        (7) The SGL is not expected to impact on Government revenues in its first year of operation, because superannuation taxation revenue is collected with a lag of one year. The SGL will reduce revenues in later years due to the lower average tax rate applying to remuneration paid as superannuation contributions. However, the effect of the SGL on Government savings cannot be isolated from the broader setting of fiscal policy.

        (8) The SGL is a retirement incomes policy initiative designed to encourage employers to comply with their obligation to provide superannuation support to their employees. It cannot be characterised as a payroll tax because it applies only where an employer has not provided adequate superannuation cover in respect of his or her employees and because an equivalent amount to the revenue raised, less administrative expenses, is redistributed in the form of superannuation contributions to the affected employees.
