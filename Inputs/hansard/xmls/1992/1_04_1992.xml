          Over and above that, there is also the concern on this side of the chamber that senators have vital interests in more than one area of issue. With too many Estimates committees meeting at once, it makes it impossible for senators to make their contributions during the Estimates committee phase. The end result of that will be that that they will see no alternative but to consider the Estimates in the Committee of the Whole—which runs counter to the scheme of the Estimates committees, which is to try to limit the debate in committee in the chamber—and have a fulsome and useful exchange then.

        I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that this allows half an hour for debate on this matter, with five minutes per speaker. The Democrats are convinced that there should be no further reductions in tariffs whatsoever while this country suffers from its very high rate of unemployment—a rate of unemployment which is increasing; a rate of unemployment which, if one looks at figures in recent days, indicates that the numbers of long term unemployed, those people who are absolutely desperate, is increasing at a remarkably rapid rate.

         If one were to accept for the moment the argument put by both the Government and the Opposition that tariff reduction will improve the economy in the longer term, then there may be some validity in tariff reduction, provided that there are other jobs available for those people who are displaced by the reduction in tariffs and the closure of the large number of businesses that are collapsing all around the country since this tariff reduction has been in place. But opportunities for alternative employment are not there. It is totally unconscionable that both the Government and the Opposition should continue to proceed with tariff reductions at this time.

         There has been a lot of debate recently as to whether there are differences between the Government and the Opposition in relation to tariff reductions. The Government, particularly in the person of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), has been desperately attempting to show that there are differences between the Government and the Opposition in this area. But I note that most of the commentators who have looked very carefully at the statements made by both sides have observed that there is no difference at all in policy, that Mr Keating is merely attempting to create an impression that there is a difference. Dr Hewson is well aware of this.

        that is, the policy of the Government and the policy of the Opposition. We want to put it fairly and squarely on the record that, at this time with a million people unemployed, with a growing number of unemployed, with a very high unemployment rate among the young, and with people who are becoming permanently unemployable as a consequence of the tariff reduction policies and the consequent closure of businesses, it is absolutely unconscionable to blindly pursue this economic rationalist reduction in tariffs which exacerbates the situation. It may be reasonable to do it at a time when there is high and growing employment, but not at this time. We call on both the Government and the Opposition to reverse their positon on tariff reductions. We call on the Government to halt tariff reductions until there is a substantial turnaround in employment opportunities.

There is a need to give the Australian economy the chance to expand internationally and so enable growth and jobs to be created. We cannot have it both ways.

         Australia should be concentrating on increasing domestic efficiency. If we can be domestically efficient in our production, then we can be competitive. That is what the whole coalition policy is all about. It is about getting the cost of business down and cutting the cost of government in particular. It is about getting the taxation burden off businesses. That is why we are advocating cutting $20 billion a year off business taxation. This will enable business to be efficient again, to expand and to employ Australians.

         However, if we go back to the dark ages of Democrat policy and argue that the barriers should go up and if in some way we isolate ourselves from the international community and international competition, the result in this country will be an ever-lowering standard of living—which is the legacy we have inherited from 10 years of Labor—and a lack of opportunity for business to expand. We already have the tragedy of nearly one million unemployed. What do the Democrats want to do? Do they want to quarantine or lock in the one million unemployed?

The Government will not be supporting the suspension of Standing Orders in relation to this matter, principally because we regard it as a motion based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which investment decisions are taken in this country and, therefore, the way jobs are created in response to those investment decisions. If the Government adopted this proposal and changed the law today, and if there were a view that changing those laws would create more jobs, not one job would be created this year.

         The progressive industries in Australia, the industries that the Democrats are seeking to protect in this instance, have been asking for some degree of understanding of the climate within which they will have to invest—the medium term climate in which their industry will need to operate. They do not want some sort of quick fix today saying, `We won't do anything until some future notice and then we might start again'. That would mean that when they invest today they would not know what the investment climate is going to be in six, 12 or 18 months time. It is exactly the wrong position to take. It would stop anybody investing because there would be that worst of all situations—uncertainty. It is a guarantee of failure, whereas, the position that the Government set down on 12 March last year—contrary to some of the breathless responses to more recent comments—remains in place and no-one is proposing to change what we set down on 12 March last year.

         The case for tariffs, going back to the 1950s, was for some sort of protection of infant industries. I remember that thesis. There might have been some justification for that in the 1950s. I have a bit of doubt about that even, but let us assume there was. If a protection of infant industries argument applied in the 1950s, the infant industries we have in Australia today do not want that protection, and they want the overlay of excessive protection that arose from the 1950s taken away from the industries which are their suppliers.

         In the contributions thus far on the question of whether this debate should take place on this motion for suspension of Standing Orders, the Democrats' position has been, as usual, grossly misrepresented. It is not the Democrats' intention that we should go backwards on the issue of tariff policy in this country; it is not our intention that we should re-erect around our industries and across the board the brick wall that was erected in the days of `Black Jack' McEwen. Although let it be said that, at its time, much of what happened in the post-Second World War era was appropriate. We acknowledge that what is needed is a targeted policy and one which, at the moment, needs to be changed because of the drastic and tragic levels of unemployment in this country.

         I will remind the Senate of that situation. We have only to look at the very recent past to see the tragic nature of the problem, a problem which really cannot be overstated. Between January 1990 and January 1992, unemployment almost doubled from 550,400 to 960,000—that is almost one million people. Then, of course, there are the dependants in the families of those people who suffer under the burden of unemployment. We are facing the fact that unemployment will rise above that figure and, indeed, is above that figure in hidden unemployment—a point which the Opposition continues to pursue—because many people such as young people, women and even family breadwinners, have given up looking for jobs.

         Senator McMullan, in his contribution, talked about what industry is saying it wants—it wants to be able to set goals, it wants to be able to plan ahead. In the TCF industries that is exactly what has happened and yet factories continue to close down. Last year 18 factories closed down in the electorate of Wills, 600 jobs were lost and a further 2,000 jobs are at risk. The TCF Council has made its views very clear about what it wants and, indeed, has exhorted people in the electorate of Wills to vote for the Australian Democrats to really send a message to this place about tariff policy.

We are already seeing that in the polls. It is quite clear that the targeted, socially conscious position that the Australian Democrats are taking on tariffs is not going back into the past, it is future orientated and it is people orientated. The people of Wills are demonstrating that and they will vote for the Democrat and Independent wedge on 11 April.

Here is a scheme that has been put forward by the Opposition which has a considerable amount of material that has to be considered. But there seems an inability on the part of the Opposition to change in any way the ideology which it has adopted in the Fightback package.

         Senator Coulter no doubt put forward the motion to suspend Standing Orders, as has been said, to give people an opportunity in half an hour to say something about matters which may affect the Wills by-election. But leaving that aside, it symbolises that too much debate goes on in this chamber which centres on ideology. People are ignoring the facts and are coming up with platitudes. In effect, that is just as bad as getting up and asking that a motion be taken as formal, when that motion deals with a matter that clearly cannot and should not go through without any debate and without any chance of amendment.

        DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        revise provisions concerning conscription and conscientious objection;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para font-size="-=2">
        repeal obsolete retirement benefits provisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In this speech I will concentrate on the revision of the conscription and conscientious objection provisions. The other matters are straightforward and are sufficiently covered by the explanatory memorandum.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The only legislation currently in force which provides for conscription and conscientious objection is contained in Part IV of the Defence Act, which limits compulsory military service to a time of war. In this context, it is important to note that "time of war" has a defined and limited meaning: a period of actual or apprehended enemy invasion of, or attack on, Australia. I would like to assure the Senate that the current amendments do not alter this fundamental threshold. The Government's view continues to be that conscription could be justified where Australia is directly threatened but not otherwise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments now proposed stem from the Government's decision, announced in the Senate by Senator Evans on 5 December 1986, to accept recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The essential changes would add recognition of conscientious objection to particular conflicts, as distinct from war in general, and require prior parliamentary approval of conscription.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I doubt that anyone would argue these days against the requirement for prior parliamentary approval of conscription. The desirability of providing for conscientious objection to particular conflicts might not be quite so self evident. However, the Government was persuaded by the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that, in some cases, an individual's sense of personal integrity could be violated by compulsion to participate in a particular military conflict but not in other conflicts.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        An important element of the new provisions is definition of a person's conscientious belief as one that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong, whether or not based on religious considerations;
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        is likely to be of a long standing nature.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This definition would give clear guidance to tribunals considering claims of conscientious belief but is sufficiently broad to ensure coverage of any genuine case. Although Australian legislation has recognised conscientious objection to compulsory military service for more than 80 years, the nature of the conscientious belief required has been determined largely by judicial decisions on claims. In this most significant area, the Government believes that the Parliament by legislation should set out the key characteristics of conscientious belief to ensure that there is clear and consistent guidance for future decisions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another important innovation is provision for establishment of special conscientious objection tribunals. (Of course, such tribunals would only be established in the most unlikely event of conscription to meet a threat to Australia.)
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The old model, of traditional adversarial proceedings before a magistrate, has been abandoned as inappropriate. New tribunals would be established for the specific purpose of determining claims of conscientious beliefs. They would be composed of a presiding member, who had at least 7 years experience as a legal practitioner, and 2 other members, who were capable of ascertaining facts other than by adversarial procedures.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The legislation specifically requires conscientious objection tribunals to adopt quick, fair, just and economical procedures. They are also required to act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, and are not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence. Although the tribunals are clearly expected to operate as informally as possible, they are given sufficient formal powers (such as the capacity to summon witnesses) to exercise their functions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Conscientious objection tribunals would normally take oral evidence in public but would have a discretion to take evidence in private or to take written evidence. A person claiming exemption from service because of a conscientious belief would bear the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals would be to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Further appeal to the Federal Court would be allowed on a question of law or, with the leave of the Court, on any other ground.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the review of the current legislation, the opportunity has been taken to remove discriminatory provisions, e.g. where obligations depend on whether a person is a "male person", a "British subject" or an "Aboriginal native". These amendments are quite clearly well overdue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am particularly pleased that this Bill proposes the repeal of the National Service Act 1951. It is, of course, true that this Act has for all practical purposes been defunct since 1972. The Whitlam Government disbanded the national service scheme in December 1972 and the National Service Termination Act 1973 removed any legal obligation to register for or render national service.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The National Service Act was not repealed at that time because some national servicemen continued voluntarily in the Army. The Act has remained on the statute books, even though defunct. Repeal of the Act will remove this last vestige of an unhappy and divisive episode in our history. Despite the repeal, any entitlements that may have accrued to individuals through rendering national service have been explicitly preserved, where necessary.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This outline has necessarily been condensed. However, I trust that it has indicated the substantial improvements that would be in place if ever there was a requirement to introduce conscription and to hear claims for exemption based on conscientious belief. The Government's aim has been to preserve the capacity to introduce conscription for the protection of Australia, but to ensure that those claiming exemption would receive a rapid and fair hearing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

        CORPORATION LEGISLATION (EVIDENCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The purpose of this Bill is to remove certain immunities available to witnesses under the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) Law and the Corporations Law. The need for the legislation arises from difficulties encountered by the Australian Securities Commission in investigating complex corporate frauds, to which I shall refer shortly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        At the outset, however, it is necessary to understand the background against which the issues addressed in this Bill arise.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It has been an established rule of the common law, since the 17th century, that a person can not be compelled to incriminate himself, and may refuse to answer any question, or produce any document or thing, which may put him at risk of conviction. This rule arose out of the principle, fundamental to our system of justice, that the Crown must prove the guilt of accused persons, rather than allow the executive to require suspects to convict themselves out of their own mouths.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In various circumstances, however, legislatures have recognised that the intended purpose of a statute may only be achieved by either limiting or abrogating this privilege against self-incrimination. The superseded co-operative scheme companies legislation, which preceded the current national scheme legislation, was such a case. Under that scheme the National Companies and Securities Commission could conduct examinations in which the common law privilege against self-incrimination was excluded by legislation. In return, the legislation provided an immunity, known as the "use immunity", which prevented answers which tended to be self-incriminatory from later being used in evidence against a person in criminal proceedings or proceedings for the imposition of a penalty.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1983, the then Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, in the decision Sorby v The Commonwealth (1983) 152 CLR 281, criticised a narrow application of such use immunities, stating that evidence obtained through, or derived from, the evidence protected by the use immunity, should also be inadmissible in proceedings against the person—the so-called "derivative use immunity".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This suggestion was taken up by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, when in its 1984 Report on the National Crime Authority Bill 1983 it advocated that where the privilege against self-incrimination was abolished by Parliament, the prosecution should be unable to use in evidence either the actual incriminating words and documents produced under compulsion, or any evidence discovered as a result of those words and documents. This "use/derivative use immunity" is now applied by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In reporting on the Australian Securities Commission Bill, however, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation stated, at paragraph 4.60, its belief that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        subclause 68(3) [drafted in compliance with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's policy of "use/derivative use immunity"] will not unnecessarily or unacceptably act to abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination if it were amended to apply only to statements made by a person and not to any information, document or any other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Though suggesting that removal of the derivative use immunity would be appropriate, the Committee did not include a recommendation to that effect in its Report. Subsection 68(3) of the ASC Law therefore provides a use/derivative use immunity in respect of information obtained by the ASC in investigations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the agencies responsible respectively for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud, have been experiencing serious problems in bringing effective prosecutions as the "use immunity" prevents the admission of evidence of the fact that a particular person produced a particular document, and the "derivative use immunity" protects evidence gained as a result of answers to questions.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The problems being experienced may be understood from a hypothetical example—to protect shareholders and creditors of a corporation under investigation, the ASC may consider that its assets should be frozen and its dealings restrained. To do this, evidence may need to be obtained under compulsion from a key person. However, as any incriminating information gained, together with any evidence derived from that information, would attract immunity, that person could not subsequently be prosecuted. To avoid this, the ASC may try to obtain the evidence without questioning major suspects. While it does so, assets may be concealed or dissipated, disadvantaging creditors and shareholders. Thus, pursuit of remedies for the protection of shareholders and creditors may prevent successful criminal prosecutions, while major suspects, whose evidence could uncover other serious offences calling for wider inquiries, tend to be questioned narrowly, if at all, because the derivative use immunity provisions would allow them to escape conviction and punishment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is also possible for persons to exploit, quite consciously, the immunity provisions, by claiming that answers may tend to be self-incriminating, then making a full confession, thereby ensuring that no evidence will be admissible against them in criminal proceedings.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Another problem arising from the application of the provisions is that complex cases involve the admission into evidence of hundreds, even thousands, of documents, all or many of which may be challenged by the defence on the grounds of derivative use immunity. This has the potential to make cases extremely lengthy and costly.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, because the fact that a person has produced a document is not admissible against the person, the link between the person's original possession of the document and its introduction into evidence against the person is broken. This may mean that the person escapes conviction because an essential link in the chain of evidence is missing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In developing the new corporations and securities legislation the aim was to balance the conflicting interests of efficient business, shareholders and creditors, civil liberties and effective law enforcement, so as to achieve a workable result.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The law as it stands at present fails to take adequate account of the difficulties faced by the ASC and the DPP, the bodies responsible for effectively investigating and prosecuting corporate crime. The practical position is that the ASC can not use its powers to investigate certain suspected criminal activity. The problems of proof created by the derivative use immunity and the immunity for the fact of a person signing a record or producing a document are affecting its role in corporate law enforcement.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The issue was recently re-examined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which in its report tabled on 15 November 1991, recommended the removal of the derivative use immunity from the national scheme, together with the use immunity with regard to the fact that a person has produced a document. It also recommended that corporations be expressly excluded from claiming the privilege against self-incrimination. These recommendations followed the recognition that the availability of full use/derivative use immunity is threatening to defeat the purpose of significant portions of the corporations legislation.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill adopts those recommendations by removing the derivative use immunity from subsection 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, and from subsection 597(12) of the Corporations Law contained in section 82 of the Corporations Act 1989. It removes the immunity in respect of the fact that a person had produced a document from subsection 68(3) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, and confines the availability of the remaining use immunity to natural persons.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under proposed section 1316A of the Corporations Law, a body corporate will not be entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, nor claim that it may make itself liable to a penalty, in any Corporations Law criminal proceedings. Nor may it claim privilege or acquire any immunity under proposed subsections 68(3) or 597(12) and (12A).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The removal of the right to claim the privilege against self-incrimination from bodies corporate in the legislation is to overcome the uncertainty resulting from the decision of the High Court of Australia in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1983) 152 CLR 328 where it was assumed, but not decided, that the common law privilege against selfincrimination applied to corporations. In that case Murphy J (at p. 346) expressed the view that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        the privilege is personal, so that one required to produce documents cannot resist production on the ground that this would tend to incriminate another. The history and reasons for the privilege do not justify its extension to artificial persons such as corporations or political entities. . .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government endorses this view, and that of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which said at paragraph 4.5 of it's report, that:

       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        "Companies are artificial legal entities occupying a privileged position in that all companies are protected by limited liability and public companies may seek investment from the public. . . .

        The Bill does not, however, adopt a further recommendation of the Committee, that there be a five year sunset clause on these amendments. The reason for not following that recommendation is that serious problems could arise in the prosecution of matters which may have been under investigation for some time. Investigators in complex cases would be hampered by the uncertainty of not knowing which rule of evidence would apply at the time of trial, and prosecutions not completed when the immunities revive would be jeopardised by the inadmissibility of crucial evidence. This would involve not only considerable expense in wasted resources over a long period of time, but would also significantly detract from the Government's public commitment to more effective law enforcement in the corporate area.

        I refer to the importation of poultry meat, the question of quarantine and so on. Prior to 1990, the Australian Poultry Industries Association and the Australian Chicken Meat Federation had been involved in discussions with AQIS and its predecessors concerning the importation of poultry products into Australia. There had been discussions concerning importations from the United States and New Zealand, and, in every case, it was the quarantine aspects that dominated.

        Australia is well-known throughout the world for its very generous quarantine assessments. The industry started to become nervous as to what might happen in this case. In due course, in April 1991, the risk assessment discussion paper was distributed with a response requested by 14 July.

        Should there be an outbreak of newcastle disease, the costs would be absolutely enormous and the destruction in the industry would be very high.

The effect on wildlife is also something that has not really been checked and would be impossible to determine. If the disease could not be quickly eradicated, massive costs associated with mortality and loss of production due to the clinical disease, with purchasing and applying of vaccines and loss of trade, would be incurred on an ongoing basis.

        —In rising to speak on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), I wish to begin by making some comments concerning the amendments to the Meat Inspection Act. While these amendments streamline certain procedures, one must take the opportunity of emphasising the point that our current meat inspection arrangements are badly in need of overhaul. It is absolutely imperative, given that there is a 100 per cent recovery of costs in terms of the meat industry, that many of the inefficiencies in the meat inspection service be addressed. In addition, a significant number of meat inspectors are still in the employ of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, and the industry is picking up the costs of those surplus meat inspectors.

        The time has come for a major overhaul of the whole meat inspection or quarantine inspection services. While the industry has the 100 per cent recovery cost in terms of those inspectors and the service that is provided, it is entitled to a much greater say in terms of future directions. The time has come for the modernisation of the inspection service to get the inspectors themselves—and I am not arguing about the necessity of inspection for the export or domestic consumption of our meat products—tied to the various meatworks and become an integral part of the abattoirs operation. It is only by progressing down that path that we will maximise the productivity of meat inspectors and lower the costs involved. Currently the costs per man in the industry are as much as $93,000 per year, which is a very high cost for a service that is over-manned.

        I also wish to take this opportunity whilst debating the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill—particularly in view of the current debate concerning tariffs—to try to put a balanced view on the position as it impacts on the industry. I wish to do this against the background of a number of aspects and state why it is important that we continue to have a reduction in tariffs across the board in rural and other industries. Together with those reductions in tariffs, it is imperative that the cost imposts on agricultural industries—the various primary industries—whether it be the sugar, beef, wool, wheat or the poultry industry that Senator Archer referred to—be reduced.

        When talking about tariffs, it must be noted that the cost in Australia of the current tariff regime is about $8,000 per farm per year. This enormous tax has to be paid up front in terms of the protection provided to a number of industries in Australia. It was with much dismay last week that I read and heard of the backflip by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on his previous position on tariffs. Some three or four years ago—or maybe a little longer when I was on the executive of the National Farmers Federation—I heard the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, actually say that his policy position, in terms of having an efficient economy in Australia and taking us towards becoming internationally competitive, was that in time, and in the not too far distant future, we must phase out tariffs totally in Australia.

        The Prime Minister also mentioned at that time the need to get the input costs to industry down. During that time, which would have been about 1984-85, he was advocating the introduction of a consumption tax. That is another one of his big backflips. If we look at what has occurred in recent days in terms of further amendments to the wholesale sales tax and a report that was presented to Senator Button yesterday, we realise that there are at least some advisers within the Government who recognise the importance of moving our tax base, lowering income tax rates and introducing a consumption tax. I wanted to put that on the public record because I was there when Mr Keating, as Treasurer, made that statement. It was more than a statement; it was a commitment. But that commitment has gone down the drain.

        Let us look at tariffs in a little more detail and the impact of that $8,000 and compare the difference between the situation in the Australian farm sector and the situation in the US and the EC where there are very high levels of protection for the farm sector. In the EC the attrition rate—those being phased out of agriculture in the EC, despite its high levels of protection—has been running at about 16 per cent per year for a number of years. In the United States of America—the so-called bastion of free enterprise—which provides very high levels of protection for the farm sector through the farm Bill, through EEP and through other programs, the attrition rate is about 14 per cent.

        Australia, where protection for the farm sector is much lower, has an attrition rate of about 6 per cent. In our larger industries—in saying our larger industries, I am not decrying the smaller industries—such as wheat, wool and beef, which have negligible levels of protection or assistance, losses are even less than that.

        Tariffs, in terms of the farming industry, and also in terms of the individual in the street, are in effect a consumer tax. I have already highlighted the fact that there is a cost of some $8,000 per farm. The current tariff protection for the car industry costs consumers about $4,000 per car. If we look a little further down the track we find that, across the board, tariffs costs the average household about $16 a week. When people debate tariff policy, they must realise that protection for one person or for one industry is just a transfer across the board to another industry or individual of a consumer tax.

        What is required in terms of our position on agriculture today? We have to be realistic about the situation in Europe and the United States vis-a-vis the GATT round and a number of other activities. In terms of the world tariff debate, very shortly—I think on 1 May—Japan will reduce its tariffs on beef by some 10 per cent, which will significantly benefit the Australian industry. It will allow some additional increase into the Japanese market but, more importantly, it will allow, over time, Australian producers to receive a higher price for their product, which will be flow across the board. It is totally irresponsible, after having won that debate with the Japanese and moving into other areas, for those in the Australian community to start talking up tariffs and presenting them as a panacea to many of our problems.

        As I said before, it is a transfer from one consumer to the other or from one industry to the other. While we might protect a few jobs in one particular industry, this will be done at the cost—I emphasise this point—of jobs in another industry. An analysis of the whole tariff situation shows that tariffs have produced very few jobs in Australia; in fact, they have not protected the jobs of those people who work in protected industries. I refer to the much quoted textiles, clothing and footwear industry. In 1990, when levels of protection were very high, the industry shed some 17,000 jobs. The current debate is being fuelled by the Prime Minister's back flip on tariffs as a result of the Wills by-election, and the attempt by the Democrats today to debate in this place the issue. Somebody else in another electorate will have to pay for any increased tariffs in Wills. Any gain in jobs in Wills will, on a pro rata basis, be made at the expense of jobs in some other electorate.

        To remain competitive in agriculture—and this applies across the board—we need to get our costs and our input taxes down. As outlined in the Fightback program, the wholesale sales tax impact needs to be taken off the backs of those people who are producing. Not only the direct cost of the wholesale sales tax but also the indirect costs of this tax flow through the system. Another tax that we intend to remove is payroll tax. We will take away the liability from the States in terms of raising money through payroll tax.

        The flow-on impact of these taxes on the road transport industry is in the order of $53,000 per rig per year. That cost has to be picked up down the track and, in the final analysis, it is passed on to the producer. The effect of these taxes flows through to the various service industries which repair and supply second-hand or new machinery. Once again, this cost is picked up finally by the consumer.

        Farmers across Australia have to pick up on average $8,000 per year in flow-on consumer taxes as a result of tariffs. This is in addition to the flow-on costs of wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, fuel excise and all the other indirect taxes that sit in the system. The Opposition proposes in the Fightback package that these taxes should be taken out of the system. Industry costs—whether they be in agriculture, manufacturing or mining—have to be lowered so that the industries can have a cost structure that will enable them to be world competitive. It is worth noting that our competitors, particularly the EEC and the United States which have high levels of protection, do not have to pay those costs. So not only do they have a very high level of protection, which is a transfer from the taxpayer to the farm sector in those coutnries, but also they do not have the burden that we have of a high level of input costs.

        We must get the cost burden down so that our industries can compete. The answer does not lie in going down the tariff route. The tariff route means a transfer from one industry or one individual to another. In the long term that will exacerbate the problem and probably lead Australia into a position where our industries will suffer the same level of attrition as industries in the EC and United States.

        Part of the answer lies in the modernisation of our meat industry. Meat inspection costs in other countries are in the order of 40 or 50 per cent less than they are in Australia. One could talk about this for a significant length of time—I do not intend to do so—but I will say that in dealing with meat inspection costs one must also recognise that that is not the only area where cost structure and cost problems have to be addressed. Despite the Harrison report and all we have heard in this chamber about industrial reform in our meat industry, our killing costs are between three to two to one and a half times that of other countries, depending on whom we compare ourselves with in terms of the world situation.

        I emphasise the importance of the removal of input taxes on Australian farmers, as outlined in the Fightback package. I want to emphasise the point that the introduction of tariff regimes, particularly when one is trying to relate them to industries pertinent to the upcoming by-election, is just a straight transfer from one industry or one individual to another in terms of consumer tax. However, the biggest flaw in all this is that it means that somebody is trying to pick winners. There is no evidence to suggest that when it comes to being world competitive, one can actually decide that a particular industry should be protected and that another should not. What inevitably happens is that the protected industries get into a cocoon and become inefficient and too cosy with the position they are in.

        As previous speakers have said, the Opposition is supporting these Bills. I finalise my comments by saying that, while the changes to this Bill are desirable and welcome, as is usual with Bills relating to agriculture, not enough emphasis in the current debate is placed on the importance of getting our costs down in the farming sector. We should be making our meat inspection service and our meat slaughter systems, or abattoirs, competitive and effective by removing input taxes, which are an enormous burden on the Australian farming sector. I also emphasise the importance of not turning the clock back on tariffs and having the $8,000 per farm increase again when it should be decreasing at a very rapid rate.

        I have listened with interest to some of the comments that have been passed, particularly about meat inspection charges, because I do believe that this is a matter of concern certainly to the abattoirs in my home State of Tasmania. I have been somewhat consoled to have been assured by officials that a stringent scrutiny is being undertaken within the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service of those meat inspection charges. This is being done to try to more clearly identify those charges which can be properly attributable to the service provided to an abattoir, as opposed to the loading of various administrative overheads and even general community service obligation type matters. This is, I think, very welcome indeed. The consolation would be even greater if the assurance I received on the question of the allocation of inspectors and their employment was also looked at.

The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 proposes to amend the Migration Act 1958 to make changes to the merits review system, distinguish the power to detain a person under the Act, increase certain penalty provisions in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy, allow consistent application of pecuniary penalties under the Crimes Act 1914, and provide that the obligation to endorse a visa or entry permit will be satisfied by an endorsement being recorded in a notified database.

         It is sensible to tidy up the references to powers of arrest so that they are changed to read, `detain in custody', and so that no confusion remains over the restrictions of arrest as set out in the Crimes Act 1914.

         However, I feel it should go on record at this point that we on this side of the chamber remain totally frustrated by the Government's inability to look at the big picture of immigration problems and act accordingly. Instead, it deals with a steady stream of bandaid legislation and a multitude of regulations which appear to change hourly—never mind daily. That creates confusion for not only the legislators but also the departmental staff located throughout this country and overseas who attempt to abide by the Act and the regulations. The constant change that we have seen over recent times leads only to confusion, uncertainty and frustration at officer level; that, in turn, has an impact on individuals seeking advice from departmental officers as to the Act, the regulations, its implementation and its effect on individuals.

I trust and hope that the Government will recognise that that is a problem and act in a more decisive way to overcome those problems that are clearly in this Act.

         I first want to note that there has been too much change, too much reworking of regulations, in the past three years since I was a member of the parliamentary committee set up to review migration regulations. There has been enormous complication and variation because of the changes that have been introduced. The Government got a lot of things wrong and it has been too slow in making the repairs necessary to make the Act work.

         The reason why we refer to regulations in this area so much is that for the new Act to work, it requires a huge volume of subsidiary legislation which is in the form of regulations; that is, not provisions which are directly debated in the Parliament but provisions which are formulated and published by the Government with advice from the Parliament's Joint Committee on Migration Regulations, subject to a possible disallowance by Parliament. So the regulations under the Migration Act are now enormously complicated and enormously detailed, and, as I say, in these recent years we have been enormously taxing upon the thousands of public servants who are required to administer the Act and the regulations through the volume of changes that have been necessary because the Government did not get it right in the beginning.

         There are two matters in Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 that I want to refer to. One is the new section 121A. I welcome the amendment. It makes clearer the situation which will be followed when a case is being reviewed; that is, where an applicant has been denied immigration and is then appealing for a review of the original decision. The regulations to be taken into account when an appeal is being considered are to be those which are the more beneficial to the applicant, whether they be those in effect at the time of the first decision on the case or those applying when the appeal is under consideration. That appears to be just. It certainly is to the advantage of the applicant. So this clarification by that amendment is one that I welcome.

         I refer, as Senator Olsen did, to the updating of the penalty provisions in the Act. It happens that penalties in Acts can go unreviewed for a period and, after a while, can become out of date. It is therefore desirable that this Bill addresses the matter of penalties in the Migration Act and seeks to bring them into line with the general approach of the Commonwealth to penalties in criminal law as set out in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act. The increase in the level of financial penalties emphasises the seriousness with which the Parliament views breaches of the Migration Act.

I think anyone who wanted to bother himself would find that in a dozen speeches on immigration here in the Senate in recent years the integrity of the immigration program is something that I have referred to on every occasion. I believe that the Australian public does not have confidence in the present Government's administration of immigration. It does not have confidence that we do have an immigration program that has integrity. It seems to be not fair to all comers from wherever they may apply. It seems to me to be one of the essential goals that we all should press towards—whether from the Australian Democrats, from the present Government or from the future government. We should so back up the legislation, the decisions of this chamber and the other in the Parliament, and so enact, fairly in every part of the world, the immigration regulations, that people applying to come to live in Australia could be assured that they are being dealt with in exactly the same way, whether their applications came from one country or another, and so that the whole system of immigration decisions had a ring of integrity about it.

         But the two major elements undermining the soundness of our immigration program are squarely at the feet of the present Labor Government here in Canberra. One is the result of the present recession. It appears that when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was Treasurer, he regarded Australia as needing a recession. He certainly has been the one most responsible for the recession that we have: one million unemployed; a $160 billion national debt; a huge current account problem; a country that is going broke; and suffering in every State and every city and  area of Australia. In the context of this recession, the Government has not adjusted the immigration program to take account of the recession that it has placed upon Australians.

         For all of my 14 years in the Senate I have  advocated high immigration—but always a responsibly high amount. I have seen immigration since the Second World War as one of the factors that has led to the economic development of this country. I say `responsibly high' because the figure must be a number which Australia is able to integrate successfully. If we had so great a number of immigrants that we were not capable as an economy and as a social community of ensuring that they made a transition into fully productive and prosperous families within Australia, then the number would be too high. I, as someone who wants a high immigration program in normal times, am calling for a lower immigration figure because it is irresponsible to add to the dole queues and to add to the misery of victims of a recession, those who have newly arrived in this country.

         I draw attention to two other elements of the ACTU's recommendations. The first is to emphasise English language requirements in the intake of those successful applicants for immigration to Australia. It was fashionable about five to 10 years ago amongst the members of the present Government to downgrade the test of English language requirements because they were supposing that this was an indirect way of discriminating against those whose mother tongue was not English but some other language—as if it was some small shadow of the old and now totally discarded White Australia policy.

         The Labor Party performed a disservice when its ranks took up that fashion five to 10 years ago. We all need to look squarely at the practical elements of those applicants who are coming to Australia and to note, very honestly, that it is a requirement for success in this country to be fluent in English. Priority ought to be given to those applicants who have English language as a skill that equips them to be more successful when they come to this country.

We give them the bridge to gain English language abilities when they are here. But, in the program itself, we need to give greater weight to English language as a requirement for successful application. I note as well that it is skills—marketable, employable skills—that go beyond English language as the requirement that ought to gain priority for applicants when they are applying to immigrate to Australia.

Again, we need to go right back to the Fitzgerald report, to a whole range of signals in the last five years, to get the balance more weighted in favour of skilled migration to this country to the benefit of all Australians.

I am equally emphatic that, when overseas students come to study in Australia, they do so on the basis that they will gain skills and return to use those skills in their own country.

         In the case of China, we have had tens of thousands of students who have come, studied in Australia, gained professional skills as well as English language reinforcements and gone back to serve in China—except for those who, by this present Labor Government, have been given an easy road, a short cut. I believe it was an unsound decision that they should be able to remain in Australia despite the undertaking they gave that they would return to China, and despite Australia's alleged commitment to an overseas student program which would return students to their own countries.

         The bad news of this month is this: we all knew about a first group, that is, some 21,000 Chinese students who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989. Many of us were critical, but we understood the emotions that had swayed the hearts of those in the Government to give a blanket extension of visas to those 21,000 students for four years, in order to work out whether or not they were to gain refugee status in this country or whether they would, in some other way, become permanent residents of Australia.

That leaves a balance of 28,262 who are overstaying.

         The Democrats adopted in 1977, and have been working out in considerably more detail, what it means for Australia to move towards an ecologically sustainable pattern of development for future generations who live in this country, from wherever they may come. The options in terms of the environment and availability of resources will be no less than the options which are available to the present generation. That is, after all, what sustainability means; it is what inter-generational equity, on which sustainability is based, ultimately means.

         Both the Government and the Opposition have paid lip-service to the idea of sustainability, but have failed totally to recognise that the size of the population which is acting on the environment is one major component of that impact; and that, before one has an immigration program at all, one needs to develop a population policy. That is something that this country has totally failed to do. We have had an immigration program now since 1947; we have never, as a nation, developed a population policy.

         In terms of sustainability, I think it is manifest to everybody that the pattern of exploitation in Australia is not sustainable in the long run. We are degrading the ability of our land to produce food; we have increasing soil erosion; we have increasing salinisation; and we are decreasing the ability of this country's water supply to continue to meet the needs of even the present population. We have seen our water supplies become increasingly polluted. We have seen in the last year the spread of blue-green algae into the Murray-Darling system on which Adelaide ultimately depends for its backup water supply. We have seen, in the case of Perth, the gradual rundown of the aquifers underlying that city and on which its water supply depends, and we have seen progressive pollution of those aquifers. We have seen increasing salinisation of those aquifers as they become both polluted and depressed, because Perth, after all, is built on a very sandy coastal plain.

         All those things indicate that if the present population of this country continues to make the demands on the environment which it currently does, the environment will not be sustainable. In other words, we are, by that measure of sustainability, already an over-populated country. That is why we need desperately to develop a population policy. We need to try to work out at what level of resource use—at what level of impact in terms of demand for resources and the pollution consequent upon the exploitation and the disposal of those resources—we can maintain an industrial civilisation in this country over the long term.

         I make an appeal to the Government to develop, as a matter of urgency, a population policy. It must look quite seriously at the changes in the demography of the Australian population. It must look at what is happening to the age structure of the Australian population; what is happening to that age structure if we have substantial increases in immigration rates for some years and then, for whatever reason, we substantially cut those rates.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What happens in that event is that we have a cohort of people who move through the population all ageing at the same time and we produce the very problems that many people have argued we need to avoid in terms of an excessive number of ageing people in the community not supported by a sufficient number of young people. It is, as it were, a reverse of the situation we had after the Second World War when we had a baby boom. Suddenly we found that we had to build a lot of schools, which a few years later were empty. We had made a large investment in resources which were then being under-utilised. When those baby-boomers themselves produced children, we had another mini baby boom, and we had a damped recurrence of the same thing. We needed to build more facilities for child education which a few years down the track were not required. In a similar way, if we have a cohort of people who all age together, not followed on by another cohort of people of roughly the same size, we will build a lot of facilities for aged people which then in a few years time we will not need.

         So the call which has come from some members of the Opposition for a complete cessation of immigration simply does not take into account those sorts of factors. If we are going to build a population policy, we must look at that policy over a very long period. It cannot be a short term policy. Because people live 70 to 80 years, a population policy has to look at what will happen over at least 100 years.

         To put a few figures to this, what will happen to Australia's population under various possible scenarios? It is often and quite incorrectly said that if we were to cut our immigration rate to zero now, our population would immediately start falling simply because the net reproduction rate of Australians is below one, below replacement. That conclusion is totally false and ignores the fact that the majority of the Australian population is younger than a population at stability. We have more young women still to enter their reproductive years than we have older women who are dying.

         So, without any immigration at all into this country, population would still increase by about three million people and then would go into slow decline, if the net reproduction rate remained at about 0.9, where it is now. But it would not get back to 17 million people until about 100 years from now. So the idea that the population would suddenly fall because we had no immigration is simply false and is not borne out by demographic analysis. Similarly, when the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, was asked what he thought an optimal population for Australia might be, he gave the figure of 25 million. That is a figure which many other people have used.

         The present rates of immigration would see us pass 25 million and wave goodbye to it around the year 2,030 with no hope of ever getting back to it. If we want to stabilise at about 25 million people, we need to cut quite seriously the present immigration rate. So I make the point that we need to develop a population policy for this country and, having done that, to look at what sort of immigration program in terms of numbers would fit with that population policy.

Migrants are not responsible for environmental damage.

         Where we would differ very markedly from both the Government and the Opposition is in meeting our humanitarian responsibilities. We believe that the immigration program should be based around refugees, and around family reunion. It should not be about skills, or a reconstructed business migration program—if that should get under way. Skills have been used as an argument for immigration to this country ever since 1947. It is an indictment of successive governments in this country that apparently we still need skilled people to come into this country. We should have a much better educational and training program in this country for Australians, so that we do not need to bring in people with skills from outside. It is about time we trained Australians more adequately, so that we do not feel a need to bring in people from other countries. In relation to business migration, certainly as it was constructed, I think enough has been said about the rorts and the damage which that program did.

The Democrats believe that Australia should bring in a much larger number of refugees, bearing in mind that they may well be people who later on could return to their own country, but in the meantime need succour. As far as the family reunion program is concerned, it is obvious that having brought people into this country, it is only fair that those people at least should be allowed to bring close family into Australia. I would argue that the program does need to be cut, but cut along lines which are based on long term sustainability.

         —Nor anywhere else, comrade, you will find. I thank honourable senators for their support for the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991. I note the comments that they have made about it, and the generally supportive remarks they have made. I thank them for that. As all honourable senators involved in the debate will be aware, there will be a minor Government-sponsored amendment in the committee stage to overcome what is, in effect, a drafting error, so the Bill will achieve the intended outcome rather than what would have been the outcome had it remained as originally drafted. So I will not take up the time of the Senate any more at this stage; I will deal with the amendment in such brief comments as need to be made in the committee stage. I thank honourable senators for their support.

         Implementing research levies for oats and cereal rye represents an extension of the Government's policy of encouraging increased contributions by primary industry for rural research which was established in 1985. The Government made a commitment to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production (GVP) of the relevant industry. This policy was reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement, "Research Innovation and Competitiveness".

         The greater proportion of the oats crop—an estimated 72 per cent in 1991/92—is used on the domestic market where oats have long been an important supplement to the successful operation of grazing enterprises involving sheep and cattle.

The purpose of the Coarse Grains Levy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1992 is to provide for the collection of levies on the barley, triticale, oats and cereal rye industries and to repeal the Barley Research Levy Act 1980 and the Triticale Levy Act 1988. With reference to the Coarse Grains Levy Bill 1992, coarse grains comprise feed wheat, triticale, sorghum, feed oats, feed maize and barley. Together, coarse grains constitute Australia's second most important crop after wheat. Barley, at $708m in 1989-90; oats, at $178m; and sorghum, at $136m, rank among Australia's top income earners.

Prior to the commencement of the principal Act, each primary industry levy and charge comprised two pieces of legislation, an Act imposing the levy and/or charge and an Act collecting the levy or charge.

         With regard to coarse grains and grain research, this legislation signifies further development in the coarse grains and grain industry generally, which can be seen in three stages. The first stage was when wheat, alone of the grains, had a research arrangement with the Government. Over a period, that was seen to be too narrow. The concentration was on wheat when there was a need for research to develop more appropriate strains of other coarse grain varieties to meet market opportunities and also as required for better farm management practices in the wheat-sheep zone of Australia.

In this second stage, yield, as well as suitable varieties for different climatic and soil situations, was the dominant factor. The third stage is where the yield is still important but market requirements are now having a higher priority than before.

         The Opposition parties will be supporting this legislation. We acknowledge the progress that is being made with coarse grain research and recognise that there is now a need for more special research to pick up these market opportunities. At a time when coarse grain growers of Australia are experiencing their lowest incomes on record—according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, it is $32,000 on a farm business basis—and the uncertainties and unfairness of a corrupt world grain trade, these farmers are really setting an example to the rest of Australia.

         In this particularly difficult economic time, these growers are prepared not only to meet the standard or the challenge set for them by government of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production but also to go beyond it. If other sectors of Australian business were prepared to make the same sacrifices for long term gains for the international competitiveness of their industry, Australia would be looking forward to a far better future.

         —The idea of the Coarse Grain Levy Bill is to bring together in one Bill certain different Acts and to impose a levy on oats. I welcome the measure because there is a wide variety of coarse grains. I have a certain amount of experience in coarse grains, so I had better declare my interest, since I generally forget to do that in these cases. It would be far more organised if we could bring the wheat industry under one roof. I can see that oats, barley, triticale and rye would come in.

         I believe that in the past the coarse grains have been rather neglected, but not so much on the levy side. We have had a levy on quite a few of them for research, but the money spent on research here, of course, varies with production and production, of course, varies with world markets. Coarse grains, unfortunately, react to what the wheat industry does. If the wheat prices keep up at a certain level, coarse grains go down. So the industry is not able to make any real long term contracts. I know that oats is in fair demand for malting overseas, as well as barley, but getting that reaction caused by the wheat price going up and down really does not let the coarse grains settle down.

         The most stable sort of market is within Australia itself and that is mostly with the stockfeeders. They are making stockfeed and manufacturing stockfeed for animals—racehorses and that sort of thing. Then, of course, that being a limited market, it gives a limited price. I know oats has been static at $100 a tonne for the last 10 years—as far as I can remember—and then for that it has to be delivered to the city as well.

         Another thing about oats is that no really new varieties of high production have been round for quite a time, especially for the low rainfall areas. With the sorts of levies that will be going through, matched by the government contribution, hopefully some new varieties of oats that will produce a reasonably high return in the low rainfalls, as well as the high rainfalls, will be developed.

         Production in high rainfalls is quite high, but where we have that sort of case we want more research to be done on producing grain without producing too much bulk in the straw. Bulk in the straw is very good for those who happen to be growing hay and selling hay as a product, but, unfortunately, with the sorts of varieties that are around there is too much bulk in the straw and by the time it is the right sort of weather to cut hay, it goes rank. So the industry needs an oats to be developed with not too much bulk, enough bulk to cut hay without getting too rank, and, of course, a return.

          Australia, have been at the forefront of research into coarse grains, but I believe that it is not repeated around the rest of Australia. By the same token, I would say that some States lead the research into the wheat industry, especially South Australia, where a reasonably high grade quality of wheat has been developed which also has a production. It does not do the economics of a farm much good by producing quality, and quality alone, if there is no production. The formula has to be worked out so that there is a certain amount of return and that is where I believe the South Australian Department of Agriculture and Roseworthy Agricultural College especially have done a good job.

         Getting back to the mechanics of the Bill, I think it is a move in the right direction. Going back some time ago, I can remember that there was no levy with oats, but there was a voluntary levy and this is obviously replacing that. It was almost compulsory in the fact that a box had to be marked and I suppose the oats industry got quite a bit of money through levies that they really got by default. Of course, that caused ups and downs in the amount of levy that came through and, coupled with an up and down production, no-one really knew where they were. This Bill, and the Government putting up a dollar for dollar, will make quite a difference to the stability of research which has got to be encouraged in all products, let alone the coarse grain industry.

         If time allows, I will go into a few of the other problems of the rural industry around Australia that exist at the present moment. I have said in this place for quite some time that the rural industry is reviving a certain amount because of the upsurge in wheat prices again, but there are a lot of other aspects that this Government has to look at. In the One Nation package, the Government said that it would in machinery legislation provide certain measures to help out the rural industry. We have not had the legislation, but I think it is too little and, in many cases, too late.

         There was a certain amount of money for RAS, that is, the rural adjustment scheme. It is called RAFCOR in Western Australia and it is very slow in putting any money out that it may have because it is set up with a bureaucratic sort of system. The money goes to RAFCOR, which then decides how to distribute it and applications are made. These applications are made by farmers needing carry-on finance or finance to build the farm up—or, indeed, there is a certain amount of finance available to help the ones that have no future get off the farm altogether.

         I presume that one can compare that to the pay-out on the Australian waterfront. The only thing is that this Government prefers to help its waterfront mates more than farmers, because its waterfront mates have had security of tenure in their jobs for many years, with guaranteed pay for a maximum of 35 weeks. They still get their pay, whether they work for five weeks or 35 weeks. In Senator Collins's buy-out package, there is an average of $94,000 available to buy out their jobs.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Further to that, even though the waterfront reform is going along quite smoothly, as Senator Collins tells us, the Western Australian State Government has bought into the argument by directing its port authorities to take on some of these excess waterfront workers as permanent employees—permanent employees but still with their same old conditions under that big package, which is a salary of about $50,000 to $60,000 per year, a maximum of 35 hours per week, with no minimum, five weeks holiday pay and all that sort of thing. These regional ports have been forced to take these people on.

         Getting back to the Bill again, that sort of arrangement keeps up the costs to get those coarse grains, as well as wheat, across the wharf. What is more, these extras that the port authorities have been told to take on are not needed. What is the use of watching a self-loading ship load or a self-unloading ship unload? It is totally pointless. In that case, if the Government of Western Australia, or indeed any other State government, had any interest for the wheat industry, the coarse grain industry or any other industry, it would not buy into the argument and go down the line of pushing wharfage up rather than down. The figures that I have for the waterfront of Sydney and Melbourne show that costs to put goods across the wharf have gone up 20 per cent in the last 12 months, whereas they should be going down with this waterfront reform.

         On the other side, very little has been done for our grain growers and coarse grain growers. I think that $80m was allocated as extra carry-on finance. I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) could instead have looked at the idea of putting that money through the other way by making it available as, say, a one-off GMP, a guaranteed minimum price, for grain. I know that GMP is a dirty word with the Government. The guaranteed minimum price for the wheat industry was taken off by this Government the last time it brought in a new wheat marketing Act.

         I no longer advocate a GMP, but I think a GMP, rather than putting more money into RAFCOR or RAS, would have been a lot more efficient because there would not be that backlog  that there is with RAFCOR dealing with farmers' needs. A one-off guarantee such as the one Premier Carmel Lawrence put on the wheat industry in Western Australia last year, and which incidentally got the crop planted, would enable the money to go back to the local bank managers, who know farmers and businessmen a lot closer to hand, and would be far more efficient. That is where the Government could have helped. The Government could have helped by implementing other measures to take the imposts off farmers, rather than what it has done.

It is too late to go back on tariffs; we have to keep going. The Government and the Opposition have the same sort of policy. We have to keep going.

As part of this ongoing simplification exercise, the Government is reviewing the administration of wholesale sales tax law, which is unquestionably the matter to which Senator Watson is referring. We believe that a simplified WST system is a much more efficient system than the GST, given that it only involves 75,000 active taxpayers rather than every business in the country, which would be affected if the Opposition ever had the chance to put GST in place.

         —On 12 March, Senator Kay Patterson, a Victorian senator, put out a press statement which said that one in two young Victorians is unemployed. This has to be rightfully seen as an outrageous and deceptive statement by Senator Patterson. The Government, of course, has always been concerned about the level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. That is why we introduced the One Nation package and have taken steps to stimulate the economy. What cannot be said of us is that we have ever tried to hide the fact. We have always been honest about the level of unemployment in this country and what needs to be done about it.

         The fact is that fewer than one in 10 Australian teenagers is unemployed and seeking full time work. The national percentage is in fact 9.4 per cent of the teenage population—that is not one in two, as Senator Patterson claimed. If we look at the Victorian figures, we find that the figure is a little higher, at 12.1 per cent—but it is not 50 per cent as Senator Patterson's press release has duplicitously alleged in trying to mislead the community.

         I refer to the 15- to 19-year-old category. Fewer 15- to 19-year-old people are unemployed in Australia now than were unemployed during the years of the Fraser-Howard recession of 1982-83. I remind the Senate that Dr Hewson was the senior economic adviser to the Fraser Government at that time. Taking the seasonally adjusted figures of 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full time work, in April 1983, during the recession of the Fraser-Howard-Hewson period, there were 157,000; and in February 1992, there were 124,700. There is in fact a reduction of 32,900 if we compare the number of youth unemployed now with the number of youth unemployed at the time of the last recession. Does Senator Patterson say that? Of course, she does not. She says that one in two is unemployed.

I was also asked a more general question about whether there is racism and sexism in the defence forces. The answer is, in part, yes, the same as there is in the rest of the community. However, our official attitude is always to counteract those particular tendencies, and I believe that the Australian defence forces have a good record in that regard.

       <para>
        I think that very evident point arose out of the deliberations of that royal commission. The royal commission found that Aboriginal people in custody do not die at a greater rate than non-Aboriginal people in custody. That was perhaps a surprising finding. But the royal commission did find this overwhelming difference: the rate at which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people come into custody is about 29 times that at which the non-Aboriginal population comes into custody. If non-Aboriginal people had been imprisoned at the same rate as Aboriginal people were during the period reviewed by the royal commission, then some 8,500 deaths in custody would have resulted. That gives some idea of the magnitude of the impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of their detention in police cells and prisons throughout this country.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is for that reason that we need to take urgent steps to reduce the numbers of those who are detained in such custody situations. Perhaps the real breakthrough in the Government's response in this regard is the funding of the establishment of a series of bail hostels around the country. These bail hostels will be of particular use for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are often denied bail because they do not have the appropriate fixed address or the means of meeting other conditions relating to bail.

         It is a fact that there is a greater likelihood of custodial sentences being imposed if young people are detained rather than granted bail. So it is very important that these bail hostels be established under the supervision of an Aboriginal person who acts as a house parent or supervisor of the bail hostel. As these hostels are established around the country, I believe that they will provide a very sensible diversion from the sorts of custody and detention which apparently lead to the rate of deaths that have been revealed by the royal commission.

         For this to succeed there will need to be the cooperation and the understanding of the police. That is also a very important part of the Government's response. Minister Tickner emphasised yesterday that governments are not singling out police for criticism. The truth is that the police, he said, like the rest of the community, have a range of attitudes and opinions. But they can, no doubt, do much more to improve their dealings with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         There are certainly programs in place within the Australian Federal Police who are encouraging such programs to be put in place in other police forces throughout Australia so that in the contact between police and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the understanding can be bettered. The diversion into non-custodial bail hostels can be a way of ensuring that we have a lesser representation of these people in custody and, one hopes therefore, a lesser incidence of the tragic deaths which led to the setting up of the commission.

         In other words, there will actually be no more money available within the public hospital system, but there will be an offset from the private patients, with their bed day charges, only just compensating for the decline in assistance from State governments for the public hospitals, which is forced on them by the cut in funding from the Federal Government to the States as proposed by the Opposition. So there is no way in which public hospitals will be better off or able to provide more services to cater for more patients within the public hospital system. It is completely misleading to suggest that public hospitals will be improving their capacity to serve more patients in the provision of hospital care.

         —My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I draw the Minister's attention to Australia Post's former system of reduced mailing rates for registered publications, which enabled small trade and leisure magazines to provide their readers with attractively priced subscription rates while still making a profit. Is the Minister aware that, with the introduction of Australia Post's print post price rises, the cost of mailing these publications to subscribers will become prohibitively high?  Is he also aware that these new charges will see mailing costs increase by up to 223 per cent above the level of only 18 months ago? I ask the Minister: with an inflation rate increase of just 1.5 per cent over the last year, how can Australia Post justify these new charges?  I further ask the Minister: in view of the highly depressed state of Australia's economy, which has, with the flood of publications from overseas, markedly lowered advertising revenues in such publications, what action will he take to ensure that this action will not prove to be the final nail in the coffin of many small Australian publishing businesses?

         —Last night this issue was raised at the Estimates Committee. Australia Post gave a number of specific answers, which I will get for Senator Bjelke-Petersen, but I think I can explain today the gist of what it said. The magazines to which the honourable senator refers have been loss-makers for Australia Post for a very long time. The losses amount to many millions of dollars; they are very considerable indeed. When we give Australia Post a charter that says, `You shall operate as a commercial organisation; you'll organise yourself on proper business lines', it is very difficult then to say to it, `But where you're making losses, you're not allowed to fix it'.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The truth is, of course, that the ordinary users of postal services have been subsidising the rates for these magazines for many years. Whether that cross-subsidy can be justified is, I think, the heart of the problem. As I understand last night's evidence, the average increases are around 30 to 35 per cent, and they were necessary to get this service up to the point, at least, of being commercially viable. I do not believe that the Government ought to sanction the kind of cross-subsidy that makes every person who uses the postal service across Australia subsidise the loss-making parts of the business. So I think really what Australia Post has done is live up to the charter. I do not really think we can ask it to do any more than that.

Does the Government support the call by the New South Wales Premier for the matter to be addressed at the Premiers Conference next month?

          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         , as I wish to do. The opening paragraph of that editorial echoed precisely what the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs said when he brought this statement down in the House of Representatives yesterday, and that is that the fundamental aim of any package that is designed to attempt to adequately respond to Aboriginal deaths in custody must be directed at keeping Aboriginal people out of gaol.

         The editorial went on to say that since the report was brought down, 25 Aboriginal people have died in custody. In fact, the precise figure is 28. It may be of some interest to honourable senators to know that in that same period, 150 non-Aboriginal people died in custody. The other pertinent thing about that statistic is that those figures are consistent across the age groups. For every one Aboriginal person in the 20- to 30-age range who has died in custody, about six non-Aboriginal people in the same age group have died in custody.

         The impact of that figure of course is that it precisely reflects, as Senator Tate alluded to in his answer, the early research of the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Commission which found, some three years ago when this process started, that that was the situation. Therefore, a fair test is whether the Government's response addresses that fundamental question of attempting to reduce the numbers of Aboriginal people in prison.

In terms of the response, it is fair to say that it was always expected, by every party concerned in this, that there would be a national response to what is a serious national problem; that is, a combined effort by Federal, State and Territory governments. Of course, many of the specific problems relating to the difficulties Aboriginal people are having emanate directly—I do not say this in a critical sense; I simply say it as a matter of fact—from areas that are fundamentally the responsibility of State governments. Therefore it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to look to the States to assist in providing an adequate response.

It is a substantial response; it is a package of $150m. In particular, I wish to applaud the direction of money into bail hostels as part of that package. That is a practical, sensible and productive response to what is a real problem on the ground in terms of trying to keep young Aboriginal offenders, in particular, out of gaol in the first instance. I am also very pleased to see that a very substantial sum of money out of that package will be directed towards alleviating substance abuse.

I believe that the system can only work properly with the right kind of smart card technology. That technology is in operation in a number of countries. It means that parents will be able to determine in the home themselves what they believe is suitable for their children to view. The whole pay TV operation will not work unless the card is in. It will be up to parents to determine whether or not kids can see programs. If the argument is to be that adults cannot watch on pay TV—something they will be paying about $40 a month for—the same film that they can see at the movie house or get for $4 or $5 at the video store, then I am afraid I have to disagree with Senator Newman.

Not one of them went near the Port Authority.

         When the Privacy Act was before the Senate we had an extensive debate on the way in which law enforcement could be conducted so that it was compatible with the privacy principles. This project has been looked at from that point of view. It has been found to be quite consistent with the provision made by the Senate so far as law enforcement activities are concerned. Indeed, the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, who has been mentioned by Senator Calvert, has been very much involved in the development of this proposal. He has been consulted on the development of all of the privacy and security procedures that will be involved in this project. I believe that that oversight—I think that was the term used by Senator Calvert—would be very appropriately continued. I emphasise that one is not talking about secret or confidential information; one is simply bringing together information which is already in the public domain.

       I do not hold Senator Evans personally responsible in any way, nor do I hold Senator Button directly responsible. However, in their representative capacities, they both have something to answer for because these questions—although they are not as egregiously out of date as some more recent ones to which Senator Button has finally provided answers—are very serious policy questions nonetheless, particularly the one in relation to the superannuation guarantee levy. I understand that the Bill became available this afternoon. That gives these questions an even greater significance than they might otherwise have had, particularly when one has regard to the fact that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation received from the Treasurer before the Treasurer before last, Mr Kerin, a letter dated 2 October in which he undertook to provide that Committee with a submission from the Treasury. That is more than six months ago. In other words, the Treasury is deliberately treating the Senate Committee with contempt. It is clearly doing its best to frustrate the sensible deliberation and consideration by that Committee of some fundamental issues. That is why these questions are on notice.

        These questions were put on notice on 27 February this year in view of the continuing failure on the part of the Treasury. I want to make it very clear to Senator Evans and those he represents that unless answers are received before Question Time tomorrow, I will be moving to censure the Government in no uncertain terms. It is abundantly clear to anyone who studies these questions that they go to the very heart of the debate about superannuation in this country. In many respects the Government is in the process of setting up a superannuation guarantee levy Bill to legitimise a compulsory scheme. It arises purely because of the comprehensive failure of the award-based system to deliver the goods. When all logic says that it ought to be put forward as a replacement for that failed system, it is simply to be superimposed on top of it, making matters comprehensively worse.

        These questions not only go to the essence of the SGL but they raise even more important matters in terms of the impact on employment and inflation of a proposal which is clearly going to result in employers in many instances having to find up to 12 per cent of wages by way of contributions over the next eight years. That is an impossible task unless it is done at the expense of profits and retained earnings, and consequently the ability to reinvest in plant and equipment, expand businesses and create jobs. On the other hand, it will be at the expense of wage increases. I have no doubt that it will be the latter and that the ACTU is comprehensively hoodwinking its own membership.

        What the members do not realise and what they ought to know by now is that they will be the ones who will pay for the privilege of disqualifying themselves from the age pension. In other words, over the next eight years the workers of Australia are going to be forced to go without wage increases, even keeping level with inflation, in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension. The burden of superannuation in this country is going to rest on the shoulders of those whom the Government claims to represent. This is not only a heartless policy but a very dishonest one. I hope that people—such as Senator Faulkner—who probably were not aware of this until now, will rush back to the ACTU and say that it is not on. Unless we know how it will be funded and what the employment and inflation consequences will be, those people are being hoodwinked.

        Unless one has income well in excess of $3,000, all of the contributions will be eaten up in administration and insurance charges. It is an absolute disgrace. The workers of Australia would not stand for it for a moment if they knew the facts, but they are not being told them. They are simply being told by this Government that it has managed to achieve a spread in coverage. The price of that spread in coverage is that contributing 3 or 5 per cent of a minimum $3,000 will leave workers behind. In theory, they could be owing money to the insurer. That is the price they are paying for this so-called spread in superannuation coverage.

        Workers have already been forced to go without 3 per cent in wage rises. The ACTU has constantly told us that the first round 3 per cent was at the workers' expense; it was not an impost on employers. There is absolutely no doubt, from reading Senator McMullan's article, that the balance of the 12 per cent is also going to be the workers' shout. So in other words, the workers of Australia are going to go without wage increases over the next decade in order that they can pick up the tab for superannuation in this country.

        That is why this set of questions is fundamentally important. We want to know the real savings impact, for example, of a compulsory system. I have no doubt that Senator Walsh is right in saying that there will simply be a savings switch as a result of the SGL. Individuals will reduce their discretionary savings to compensate for enforced savings through the SGL. Indeed, it is quite clear from the most recent Mintel survey that that is what is happening already. Employers are scaling down their level of voluntary, discretionary contributions and workers are doing the same. They are going to simply settle for a lowest common denominator approach. They will wash their hands of superannuation. They will leave it to the employer, who, of course, is screwing them at their own expense.

        The end result will be that the workers will simply get the bare minimum—not enough to really do them any good in retirement but sufficient to disqualify them, at least in part, from an age pension—and this Government will tell them that they have never had it so good. I think it is a travesty and a disgrace. One of the best ways of demonstrating this is to look at the answers that are provided. If the Government does not provide them before Question Time tomorrow, we will know that there is only one inference to be drawn and that is that all of those allegations are true, that the Government has no defence and that it is simply trying to hoodwink the public for a little longer. We are not prepared to cop that.

        —Yesterday Senator Collins made an incomplete answer to a question about the failure of an F28 aircraft to appear on the new Thomson radar at Cairns. That aircraft joined at least three other wide-bodied aircraft—Boeing 767s—in not showing on the radar screen, despite being often in the field of screening of at least three different Thomson radars. Senator Collins said:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . that on investigation it was discovered that the problem with the F28 was a faulty radar transponder on board the aircraft, and it had nothing whatever to do with the system itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       The point is that it really does not matter whether the transponder on the aircraft is working. The primary radar detects the aircraft and shows it on its screen and plots its track. The air traffic controller asks the pilot to set one of three or four frequencies on the transponder in squawk ident and that gives an indication on the blip, on the radar screen, as to what the particular aircraft is. But whether the frequency is incorrectly set, whether the transponder is working imperfectly, or whether in fact there is no transponder at all is irrelevant to the display of the presence of the aircraft, because that is a function of the primary radar, and it should appear on the screen.

        What happened on this occasion and on other occasions was that no indication of the presence of the aircraft appeared on the radar screens, according to the air traffic controllers. That is documented and beyond dispute. It is not correct to blame the failure on the transponder in the way that Senator Collins did. To that extent, he certainly misled the Senate in his answer yesterday. To castigate honourable senators such as Senator Macdonald, Senator O'Chee and me, who have all raised this matter which relates very much to public safety, is quite irresponsible.

       It happens today to be April Fools' Day, but the public will not be fooled by Senator Cook's selective and scurrilous reporting of my press release in the Senate today. It was a desperate attempt to create a smokescreen to try to cover up the tragic youth unemployment figures in Victoria, where 46 per cent of young people seeking full time work are currently unemployed. That is what I said in my press release, which reads:

       Yes, the heading did say, `One in two young Victorians unemployed', but many headlines on newspapers say, `10 per cent unemployed in Australia'. That does not mean 10 per cent of all babies, old people and people who are not seeking full time work. We all understand what it means; it means 10 per cent of those people seeking work. That is what that heading means—one in two young Victorians unemployed. But Senator Cook chooses to distort that. He does not have the gall to table or incorporate my press release, but uses Question Time to misrepresent what I actually said. I seek leave to incorporate my press release into

        The fact is that, concerning youth unemployment, the Minister has never complained, as indeed he should not, about headlines or anything else that say that the unemployment rate is 10 per cent, because that is the proportion of the labour force.

        The Minister might say, `Ah, but if you use a particular set of figures you will find that youth unemployment, as defined by you, was worse under the Fraser years than it is now'. If the Minister wants to have a look at the official statistics, he should look at the actual number of unemployed persons. In February 1992, for those aged 15 to 19, the figure was 209,300. In 1983, it was 209,200. As a matter of accuracy, just 100 more people were unemployed as at February 1992. These figures are not seasonally adjusted; these are the actual number of young people aged 15 to 19 out of work, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

        What is worse is that another Australian Bureau of Statistics survey showed that 150,000-odd people attending schools or tertiary institutions said that if jobs were available they wanted them, but that they were not actively seeking them because there were no jobs available. That was a survey last September by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If we add in those 150,000-odd who really want jobs but who are being paid to go back to school under Austudy, what sort of horrendous unemployment figure do we get? The Minister is taking the credit for having sent back to school, by paying them Austudy, those people who could not get jobs but who wanted jobs. He has managed a huge retention rate largely because the young people of Australia cannot get jobs and they may as well go back to school. The Minister is crowing about it. The Minister's deception, his misleading of the Parliament, and his use of young people in this way is a disgrace.

        —It seems that nastiness is a contagious disease on the Opposition benches—and no wonder because, when the question was raised with me in Question Time today, it hit a raw nerve in the Opposition. The facts are that this Government has always been uncomfortable with and concerned about the level of unemployment in this country. We are particularly concerned about the long term unemployed and the young unemployed in this country. We do not yield to the synthetic concern of the Opposition on this as being superior. This is genuine commitment and concern from this Government.

        But what the Government has always tried to do is tell the truth about this—and we have. We insist that this debate be conducted truthfully, honestly and fairly. That is the reason why, in my answer to the question, I concentrated on simply setting out the facts. If the facts offend and if the facts are uncomfortable, they are uncomfortable for the Government because the level of unemployment is palpably too high. But if the facts offend the Opposition, then it is clear to see why.

        We only have to turn to the Opposition's consumption tax package to see what the Opposition proposes to do about the level of youth unemployment or unemployment in general in this country. What it proposes to do is abolish the labour market support programs that we have in place to provide training, Jobsearch, subsidies to employers to take on young people, and things of that nature. The Opposition proposes to just wipe all those out—they will be gone, kiss them goodbye, ta-ta, we will not see them again. That is the Opposition's proposal; that is an indication of its concern and sympathy for the plight of young unemployed!

        The next part of the proposal in the consumption tax package is the abolition of the CES. The CES will get the chop—that will be finished; it will not be there any longer. The coalition would put the CES out to private contract. The abolition of the CES will mean that the Youth Access Centre and the Youth Bureau will go. If both of those were retained, it could be said at least fairly that there was some concern for the unemployed in terms of services to help them find employment. But no, under the consumption tax package they will get the chop too. This is from an Opposition that claims worry and concern. Its actions hardly match the rhetoric.

        Apparently the sin I have committed is that I fingered them by saying, `Let's look at the facts', which are these: compare the unemployment figures during the last year of the Fraser Government—a government in which Mr Howard was the Treasurer and Dr Hewson was the senior economic adviser to the Prime Minister—with the unemployment figures that I have for February this year, seasonally adjusted as the proper measure. There are now 32,900 people between the ages of 15 and 19 in work compared to then—and this out of a much larger labour force.

        That offends the Opposition because it goes essentially to this: sure, we have a recession and sure, we are coming out of it, and the electors of Wills and other electorates in Australia will judge the major parties on who can perform best to lower the level of unemployment for permanent careers—not artificial jobs—for young people. That is what they will judge us on. When we compare what the Opposition did with what we are doing in dealing with a very difficult recession—on that test—we succeed, the Opposition fails.

        Let me come back to this question of the youth labour force. This is a matter for vigorous debate. Although we have the somewhat over-blown rhetoric of my colleague Senator Baume—I will be nice to Senator Baume—there is a basis for genuine debate on this question. The Opposition proposes to pretend that the youth job market for young people between the ages of 15 and 19, as it is commonly measured, is the same labour market and has the same characteristics as the adult labour market.

        One of the outstanding characteristics of the adult labour market is that many adults tend to be married with children. Therefore, one or other of the partners is not working; they are out of the labour force. So we look at the participation rate and we calculate unemployment based on the participation rate. Between the ages of 15 and 19 it just so happens, according to my observations of human nature, that there are very few people out of the labour force based on the fact that they are married and supporting families. But the Opposition says, as Senator Patterson did in her press release, that the level of youth unemployment is one in two. I quote directly from the headline of her release that she has incorporated: `One in Two Young Victorians Unemployed'.

        government, Australia, because of the levels of retention—the number of kids in year 12 at high schools—was an international laughing stock. In the OECD comparison, we spent about the same amount of money on education as did Turkey. That has changed dramatically. We provide better education for young kids to go through to year 12.

        The life chances for young kids, including those who are unemployed, are enhanced greatly by better educational standards and better training. We have done that, but we get penalised in this debate because we are successful. We get penalised because we have succeeded in providing better educational standards. Those opposite do not recognise that in terms of the total population of young people.

        High school training is one thing, university opportunities is another and opportunities for technical training is a third.

So there are more places available in universities today than ever before. The program is to expand that.

        We have fundamentally changed the composition and nature of the labour market for young people by providing enhanced educational opportunity and ongoing training opportunity. On a rough order of indication—to simplify the complex terms that are traded across this chamber in debate, and indicate to people who listen to this place what the debate is about—that means that seven out of every 10 young people in the population of 15- to 19-year olds are in education and being trained and three of them are in the work force. Of the three in the work force, one is unemployed and two are employed. That simply and starkly illustrates in a shorthand way what we are debating.

        The Opposition will not account for the seven who are being trained and it will not account for the extra number that are being trained under us. It will not acknowledge that there are fewer people unemployed in this age bracket under us in this recession than there were under its recession when it was in government. It will not acknowledge that people in the labour market get placements for jobs quicker under us than they got under those opposite when they were in government, and quicker than they do in the mainstream adult labour market. It will not acknowledge any of those things. The Opposition wants to dramatise and take comfort, joy and pleasure out of the misery of unemployment by making it a trite political argument.

Senator Baume started it and made some references that he withdrew, but he went on in an unabashed way to make the same insinuations. Let me be gracious. I withdraw as well and I further withdraw—although I am not required to by the Standing Orders—any reference that any senator in this place takes comfort from the high level of unemployment.

        However, spokespersons for the Opposition have certainly delighted in unemployment, because they see it as a political weapon against the Government. Therefore, if unemployment figures are up, they are greeted with some joy on the Opposition's side because it has yet another stick to beat the Government with. That is part of the political process, and we cop that. However, in terms of trying to pretend that this is a serious debate, the Opposition cannot explode with disdain and anger and hurl accusations at me and then think that they will not be returned. I will defend myself in cases where the implications against me are unreasonable.

        I was saying that the Government has a commitment through the One Nation statement for public expenditure on infrastructure development to expand the economy, to stimulate growth and thereby increase employment. The Government has a substantial commitment to training and to give life opportunities to young people by ensuring that they have access to training that they do not now have, and did not have when the Opposition was in power. As well, the Government has a policy to provide labour market support programs for those who are unemployed and who, in the foreseeable future, will not be in work. These programs assist with training, job search and things of that nature. That is our position.

        The Opposition's position is to abolish many of those programs, substitute an artificial program for the labour market programs, make the young unemployed carry the cost and burden of reduced wages in order to try to find work, bid down wages in the workplace for fully employed people as well, rotate the available work between those in work and those out of work and not address the substantial inequities in education and training, or the question of how the economy is to be developed. The Opposition's proposal is simply a taxing proposal and does not address the real needs of the labour market.

        I conclude by saying that the issue in this debate is how real youth employment is measured. I agree that to some extent this is a marginal issue. The most important issue is how youth unemployment can be reduced, which is a policy issue. When one compares the Government's policy position with that of the Opposition, there is no doubt that we win hands down.

        North Queenslanders frequently complain—and with good reason—that they are residents of a forgotten land. . . forgotten by politicians and governments in Brisbane and Canberra who care not a jot for the contribution the North makes to the nation's wealth, other than to accept it with scant thanks or no thanks at all. However, we should recognise that sometimes we appear so ungracious that it is not surprising we are overlooked. A case in point is the visit being made to our area by 19 Liberal senators, who have split into teams to visit different parts of the North on a fact-finding and familiarisation tour. Surely this is something to be applauded and welcomed. We spend a great deal of time and effort whingeing about being ignored by the residents of Canberra's ivory towers—yet when they make an effort to come here and be informed they are greeted with cries of "junketing" and wasting taxpayers' money. This was the knee-jerk, political reaction of federal Tourism Minister Alan Griffiths, himself a recent visitor to the North at the taxpayers' expense.

        We hasten to say that the Minister's visit was welcome, too. The Bulletin was entirely in favour of his journey here and the new understanding of the North's problems that he took back with him to Canberra. Nothing but good can come from his visit. Similarly, we expect that nothing but good will come of the senators' northern tour. There is nothing like personal experience to give our legislators a feeling for distant areas and their particular problems. There is, too a lesson in this for all of us, including members of parliament. The findings of the Fitzgerald Commission and subsequent investigations by the Criminal Justice Commission into what can only be described as nit-picking examinations of the misuse of MP's travelling costs has created an atmosphere of fear—being sent to jail is not a minor punishment—sufficient to cause most federal and State MPs to think twice or three times before they use their passes for the very reason they were issued: to allow MPs to become familiar with the country they were elected to govern. For this very reason, the 19 Liberal senators should be welcome in the North. They have got off their backsides and come to have a look at us.

        I move this motion because Senator Richardson told the Senate that there will be no porn pay TV in Australia. That is absolutely untrue. He has misled the Senate and attempted to mislead the people of Australia. He has been proven wrong out of his own mouth, because he then said that his proposal would allow R-rated films to be shown on pay TV. That proposal means that not only will porn pay TV be beamed into Australian home environments, but also ultra-violent films which have a `prevailing tone of ruthlessness and savagery' will also be transmitted into the Australian home environment. I use those quotes deliberately because that is how the Film Board of Review referred to some of these films which are now classified as `R' and which the Minister says will be available to be beamed directly into Australian homes via pay TV.

        Senator Richardson's proposal will, as I have said, enable porn pay TV to be transmitted into the home environment in Australia. This proposal will be very much welcomed by Canberra's hard-core porn merchant who is gearing up for this very enterprise. Mr Lark has indicated that if he cannot get X-rated videos into homes he will get the R-rated equivalents. As the Joint Select Committee on Video Material said in its report, quite a number of R classified films and videos are identical in theme, representation, intent and title to their X counterparts, save only for `explicit' closely detailed depictions of genitalia. In other words, they are precisely the same porn movies taken with a different camera at a different angle. The theme is the same, the content is the same and the intent is the same.

        That clearly indicates that what the Minister said is false. His proposal will allow porn pay TV to show the types of degrading pornographic films that were described in the Joint Select Committee's report. His proposal will allow films, the dominant theme of which is that they objectify and commodify women, to be shown on pay TV. He obviously does not know this. He has not read the Joint Select Committee's report, which said:

       It goes on; I will not quote it further. I refer to chapter 13 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. I quote another aspect because Senator Richardson may be reminded at one stage of the message that he sent to a particular union that was concerned about this video material. Paragraph 13.49 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material says of these videos that we are talking about:

        Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purpose of satisfying male sexual desires. This is sometimes manifested by themes involving workplace sexual favours. Women are frequently depicted as eager for sexual experience of any kind and ever ready for any opportunity for sexual activity. This is frequently manifested in the group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activity, which are a feature of much of the material in this category.

       The Minister has clearly misled the chamber. It is the theme and the content, as much as the explicitness, which mediate the problematic attitudes in regular viewers. The Joint Select Committee heard evidence that this type of material, which he says ought to go into the homes of Australian subscribers, mediates in the minds of the habitual viewer a callous and manipulative orientation towards women and an attitude that women are highly promiscuous and available.

        Let us go to the question of violent films. The Minister says that R material ought to be beamed directly into our homes through pay TV. I quoted before a description of one of the R classified films that the Film Board of Review described as having `a pervading tone of ruthlessness and savagery'. The Film Board of Review describes another R film as being `an orgy of violence with a grisly procession of blows, kicks, stabbings, shootings and graphic bone breakings and having no mitigating qualities at all'.

        I believe that it was necessary for me to move this motion to take note of the Minister's answer because the record must be set right. Either the Minister is ignorant, or he is deviously attempting to hoodwink and deceive the public. I presume it is the former. My concern is that if it is not, this Minister will be responsible for a dirty three-card trick on the people of Australia. Not only will he and the Government have to answer for that; each individual senator and member of the Government will also have to answer it before the electorate.

        —I rise to support my colleague Senator Harradine in his concern about the misleading of the Senate this afternoon by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, in answer to my question on pay TV and the introduction of pornography on that medium. We can all argue until we are blue in the face exactly what pornography is. It is not my purpose to get into that now. What I am so concerned about is the insidious growth in this country of violent movies and other technology designed to—

        —Yes, under Senator Tate's Government, sadly. I am surprised that he could condone it. These violent movies and other materials that have come into this country treat women as sex objects and suitable for violent treatment. Perhaps the classifications of such material in this country need reassessment. I am very glad that as a result of pressure by the coalition parties the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies was set up to investigate the standards to be maintained on the new technologies. It has already reported on the 0055 numbers which Telecom introduced and which we deplored.

       It is our view that there should be restrictions on what can be shown on Pay TV in the interests of community standards and in particular the protection of children and that program standards which currently exist in relation to free-to-air broadcasters should also apply to Pay TV.

        I draw to the Senate's attention a speech that was made by the Victorian Prosecutor for the Queen, Mr Richard Read, in Tasmania in November last year. Mr Read started his speech about pornography and depicted violence by saying:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       These are issues which strike right at the heart of every family in Australia. However, I am pleased to say that the tide seems to be turning, as the media and certain politicians are now taking a much closer look at the obvious moral and ethical issues associated with the public display of both violent and pornographic material. It is imperative that responsible women's groups throughout Australia become vocal about these issues and take the lead in turning the tide.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is happening. Women's groups, from the Left of politics to the Right of politics, are speaking out about the impact of this burgeoning pornographic tide on women and children. The Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, in referring to an article which was published in the

       Current restrictions on the importation, production and screening of such pornography reflect community attitudes which are already quite liberal enough. Whatever is freely and legally available in video tape outlets will be obtained and used by children. It is naive and dishonest to argue otherwise.
      </para>
      <para>
       The same goes for the Minister's answer today. He seemed to think that using a PIN and a Smartcard was beyond the wit of the children of Australia—perhaps he does not know much about the children of Australia. The Archbishop said, and I think this is the crux of the matter:

       We live in a free society and we rightly treasure its benefits but we also share significant responsibilities for the well being of every citizen.

       That is why I am so concerned at this growth in pornography under the sponsorship of this Government.

I do not intend to go through all of them by any means. I will refer to two cases. The first case is as follows:

       At 2.00 a.m. on Thursday 21st March 1991 a young woman age 35 lay asleep in her home in Bundoora, a Melbourne suburb, with her 3 1/2 year old daughter beside her. Her other two children aged 8 and 6 years were also asleep in the home. She recalls waking up to find a strange man on top of her, wearing a mask.

       The rapist lived only a few streets away and had planned this attack for some time. When arrested at the hospital where he worked the police found a pornographic video amongst his personal belongings. When they searched his home the police found a large collection of X rated videos. He admitted watching two pornographic videos shortly before he left to commit this rape—"Innocent Seduction" and "What's Love Got to Do with It". He said there was no particular story line in these videos which related to what he did and no bondage, but he agreed with the police that these videos had "triggered" him. The police have shown me

He then had vaginal intercourse with her and this caused her great pain. This rapist proceeded to have intercourse with her in various positions, including anal intercourse.

My question to him at Question Time related to the rights of some people in this society to take priority over the rights of the vulnerable; namely, women and children. The Minister must not go unchallenged on this. All decent men and women in this country must strongly make their objections heard. This has to be stopped.

        We have the stupid, idiotic situation where, in the same news release this morning, the Government is reported to be so concerned about the youth of Australia being influenced by tobacco advertising on television and at sporting events that it will attempt to ban it. It is making some exceptions, of course. It cannot allow South Australia to do without tobacco industry sponsorship of its car race. However, the Government is supposedly so concerned about tobacco advertising and the scenes depicted by the tobacco industry on television that it will ban it. Yet when it comes to pornography and violence there is no government concern about influence there at all. That is illogical.

        —I have not promised you anything, Senator Evans. I never have and I never will. I can assure you that I will be talking for a lot longer than 10 minutes. Senator Tate knows very well that his Government defeated my Bill on violence and pornography. As the Minister, he took the Bill. As Minister, he sought a pair when the vote came. When one of my constituents wrote to him saying, `I am surprised that you voted against Senator Walters's Bill', he wrote back saying, `If you say that outside this Chamber, I will sue you. I did not vote against the Bill.' He did not say that he had snuck off for a pair. Senator Tate has now snuck off again and we have Senator Ray here, but as he would know, a pair indicates a vote—a pair taken out by a government indicates a vote. Senator Tate tried to bamboozle my constituent by pretending that he did not vote against my Bill. He voted against my Bill but he was not game to cross the floor; he sought a pair. But a pair indicates a vote against the Bill when it is a pair formed by the Government. We all know that in this place. Senator Tate is hypocritical in his lack of truth.

He should not tell me that the Government does not believe that sexual violence on television will influence viewers, particularly young viewers, because it will. The Government cannot have it both ways.

        Clearly, it is a question of whether what he said is true or whether it is untrue. As I indicated, the possibility is that he is ignorant of the particular classifications. Clearly, either he is ignorant of the matter or there has been an attempt to hoodwink the public over the issue of whether or not the`R' classification covers porn material. As I indicated—and I have just tried to get the figure—there are hundreds of `R' classified videos which are the equivalent of X-rated videos. These R-rated videos have the same title, the same theme, the same intent and the same content as the X-rated material, which includes hard-core pornography, except that the scenes are taken by another camera from a different angle, or milliseconds of tape are excised. The Joint Select Committee on Video Material was advised that it is the theme as much as the explicitness that mediates in the minds of habitual viewers a callous and manipulative orientation towards women.

        Involvement of the Khmer Rouge in the process does not reflect a judgment by the Australian or other governments that the Khmer Rouge can now be trusted.

         As much as anybody, we want to see peace for the Cambodian people. They have suffered enormously under the Khmer Rouge policy of genocide. I remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that during that horrible period more than a million Cambodians were killed; or in other terms, over a quarter of the total population. Since then they have continued to suffer during the civil war. Some 350,000 have been driven out of their homes and their country and now live in the camps along the Thai border. According to the UNHCR, at least another 150,000 can be fairly described as internal refugees who have been forced to leave their homes and are temporarily living elsewhere within Cambodia. These people have lived for too long in misery and in an environment of terror.

         In government and in opposition we have constantly looked for ways to support the Cambodian people. We have supported the UNBRO, the border relief organisation of the UN, and the work it has done on the border in the camps. We have helped in all possible ways to support the Cambodian people through support for the Red Cross, UNHCR and NGOs. We have also sought to try to find ways to help them find a peace. Obviously, our preferred solution was to support the two non-communist Khmer factions. That was because we believe that the Cambodians not only deserve peace, but also freedom.

         In more recent years we saw more potential as the Hun Sen regime at least somewhat liberalised and clearly offered a preferable alternative to the Khmer Rouge. It was offering at least some order and stability, notwithstanding its communist ideology. We looked at the possibility of its perhaps joining with the two non-communist Khmer factions in some peaceful solution. We always had difficulties with any settlement proposals that would again inflict the Khmer Rouge upon the Cambodian people. As the Senate would be aware, we advocated that the international community prosecute Pol Pot and the other leaders of that genocidal regime for genocide in the International Court of Justice. For some years we invited the Australian Government to take a leadership role in that project, which invitation was not taken up. We saw advantage in excluding the Khmer Rouge, giving it no international legitimacy at all.

         We recognise the difficulties inherent in our preferred solution, namely, the strength of the Khmer Rouge military within Cambodia, the determination of its principal backer, China, that it not be deserted and, when it came to the crunch on several occasions, the unwillingness of the Sihanouk faction to isolate the Khmer Rouge, thus end the resistance coalition and potentially become the target of a more powerful adversary. But the down side of the alternative, any quadripartite solution—a solution that incorporated the Khmer Rouge—was to embrace that horrible regime and to accept its good faith. It is not surprising that the Hun Sen Government in Phnom Penh would not accept that solution either.

         Thus over a period of some time, the international community sought to develop an option.

That alternative option, or the development of the quadripartite option, was to provide and enhance the United Nations role, which would give some support to the Khmer factions if they were in fact able to reach peace.

         Hun Sen was to have some security guarantee in the form of a large United Nations peacekeeping force. The Khmer Rouge was given a benefit under this scheme. It would have the guarantee of not sacrificing its military advantage in a peace. That would be given by the United Nations assuming principal functions or at least supervisory functions of the Cambodian Government, and would be given a place within the Supreme National Council to be established in the run-up to free and fair elections.

         So the Khmer Rouge was dealt with by the international community with Australia playing a lead role. I regret to say that we saw the unedifying spectacle of the former Khmer Rouge Interior Minister, who ran the torture chambers in the country, receiving international endorsement and a seat on the SNC. It is no wonder that we found that an unappealing prospect. We have seen develop a settlement proposal that, despite a United Nations presence, really requires the goodwill of the Khmer Rouge to succeed. On that basis it is no wonder that we have remained sceptical. Nevertheless we have acknowledged that it could work. The Khmer factions signed on the bottom line. The international community said it would support it. Obviously, despite our reservations, we said, in principle, that we would support it also because, as I said at the outset, the Cambodians deserve every chance at peace.

         Senator Evans often quotes me, saying that I did not believe the comprehensive settlement would work. That was a comment I made in Cambodia some 18 months or so ago when I was doing my bit to seek to persuade the Hun Sen Government in Phnom Penh to join with the two non-communist factions in free and fair elections that would thus exclude the Khmer Rouge. What I argued, of course, was that if Hun Sen was prepared to show that initiative, which regrettably in the end he was not, he would engage and attract enormous international support. But it did not go in that direction, as I said, because although he spoke of holding an election, he was not prepared at that time to hold a democratic election. What I said then still remains, to the extent that a comprehensive settlement is not just a signed document and evidence of international support.

         A comprehensive settlement is a peace and stability in which Cambodians can fairly determine their destiny. That has yet to be achieved. The issue, then, is whether the path that has been chosen, which Australia is supporting by sending military forces, will achieve that objective. Look at that for a moment. We see continued fighting on the ground, principally by the Khmer Rouge, fighting that has been described in recent weeks as the most intense in the past year.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We see a campaign of terror being conducted by the Khmer Rouge using its traditional methodology, in this instance, of firing artillery rounds indiscriminately into villages. We see the Khmer Rouge intimidating refugees on the border, refugees which the UN, with our support, is seeking to relocate back into Cambodia. We see a settlement that has not excluded Pol Pot and his deputies from continuing their power and control over the Khmer Rouge forces.

         When we say that, Senator Evans simply accuses us of carping. To work, the UN plan must be realistic. Apart from our concern that the Khmer Rouge is not participating and will not genuinely participate in the peace process, the timetable for repatriation of refugees is simply impossible.

         The wet comes in about two months and lasts until about October. Three hundred and fifty thousand refugees were to be resettled before the end of the year. This week the United Nations is moving the first 600 refugees. It is supposed to increase to 10,000 a week, which is obviously impossible. That impossibility is already being acknowledged by this somewhat quaint notion of moving the refugees from the camps in Thailand to new camps just across the border in Cambodia where they will be able to vote in the election that is planned as part of the process.

         Additionally, the process of cantonment and disarming in this environment is highly doubtful. We will be amazed if the Khmer Rouge, in practice, lays down 70 per cent of its arms and disbands 70 per cent of its forces. Even Senator Evans last night acknowledged that it has at least two to three years of arms hidden away. It has wealth from the gem mines,  and the region, as we know, is sadly already flooded with weapons. But even under the Paris Agreement it is still not a complete disarming. Although Senator Evans criticised us for arguing the other day that there should be an effort to increase the disarming to a full 100 per cent, subsequent to his statement the Security Council has included it within its resolution as the desired option—or, more than desired; something that should be aimed at. That is not surprising. Even under this scheme, if 30 per cent of the 200,000 regular forces still in Cambodia and the 250,000 irregular forces maintain their arms and their combat readiness, they create a most uncomfortable environment.

         Furthermore, we see little prospect of Hun Sen, particularly that he has now reached a more comfortable relationship with Prince Sihanouk, passing to the UN the supervisory functions of government; that is, the five key portfolios of foreign affairs, defence, communications, interior and one other, which is the plan that we are seeking to put into effect. It is interesting that not so many months ago, when Hun Sen was in this country, he said to us in response to questions that he had no intention of passing over those functions or giving up those functions.

         So in this environment is it a reality to see a free and fair election next May? We doubt that it is so. We are concerned also that, despite the rhetoric of the international community, there has been very little forthcoming. The process of establishing UNTAC has been incredibly slow. Australia and some others, notably France and Indonesia, have kept the process going by developing the notion of a phased deployment, hopefully locking in the international community. But from what we learnt last night, only $35m of the initial $200m has been committed. So $35m of the total estimated cost of $1.9 billion has been committed.

         Of the 40-odd countries that have made a commitment for an initial force, we understand from Senator Evans last night that it is a force of only 4,000. But the Indonesians have provided an infantry battalion of about 800, the Malaysians a similar number and, under this statement, Australia will be providing 500. Adding those together, Madam Acting Deputy President, you will realise that the others will not be providing many at all.

         That initial 4,000 is out of the projected force, the documented intended force, of some 15,000. Bearing in mind that this was to be an 18-month project due to end about the middle of next year, we do not see in these figures great determination on the part of the international community. Australia is clearly a driving force in this commitment. We commend the leadership aspect that Australia has been prepared to show, but the question is whether the process is realistic. We are still concerned about the lack of information that is put before us even in relation to the Australian force.

We should have been told, I would suggest, in this statement exactly what will be their functions and where they will be deployed. Presumably, they will be attached to the infantry—in the first instance to the Malaysian and Indonesian battalions—but we were not told that.

Is Senator Evans saying that this situation of skirmishing war lords who happen to be using heavy artillery and firing indiscriminately into villages and destroying bridges and roads, are conditions when it is not right to send the force?

         Regrettably, the statement does not tell the Australian people much at all about this major commitment. It is a major commitment not only in terms of the forces that we are sending and the leadership role that we are assuming but also in terms of the cost. We are told of $49m which will be required from the Defence vote and about $35m in Australian dollar terms which will be our compulsory contribution to UNTAC; $7.7m in disaster relief and the increased aid vote. So a very large sum of Australian taxpayers' dollars is being committed.

         I might say in passing that we certainly offer our support to the bilateral aid vote. I want to take this opportunity to commend the incredible work that the NGOs have done in Cambodia over the last 10 years or so when a bilateral program was not in place. I have had the opportunity to visit them and learn from them first-hand of their work. They clearly deserve our commendation and gratitude.

         This is an unusual occasion. We have several differences with the Government and the Opposition on matters of foreign policy—the Gulf War and self-determination for East Timor spring to mind—but this is not one of them. The Government's policy on Cambodia is one which we have come to fully support, notwithstanding some earlier reservations about the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in the peace process. It is clear to us that the peace process, while necessarily an imperfect creature of compromise, gives real hope that the protracted and unparalleled suffering of the Cambodian people can be brought to an end in the foreseeable future.

         By contrast, until today's support for this motion by the Opposition, which we congratulate it on, the Democrats have been disappointed by the stance taken by the Opposition. This is not to suggest that the concerns raised by Senator Hill are not valid, but rather that undue weight has been given to them. The unfortunate tone in which they have been raised created the strong impression that the Opposition had little enthusiasm for the United Nation's unprecedented efforts to achieve peace in Cambodia. There was a striking contrast between the Opposition's reluctant attitude towards this operation and its wholehearted enthusiasm for the Gulf war.

         The Democrats regard the UN's work in Cambodia as a very large step towards a just and peaceful new world order. However, it must be said that it is a step which has been taken many years later than it should have been. The lack of interest by the world in general to mediate a just peace in Indo-China from the 1950s until the 1980s has seen that region torn apart by the Vietnam war, the resultant destabilisation of Cambodia and the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, in 1975. Throughout the reign of that despicable tyrant, the UN and the world continued to take no action, although Vietnam was punished when, in 1979, it invaded Cambodia and ended the four years of terror which left one million people dead, perhaps more.

         It would be wrong to suggest that Vietnam's invasion was driven by an altruistic commitment to human rights; it most certainly was not. But the fact remains that it brought to a halt a campaign of genocide which matched any of the blackest periods in world history in its horror and brutality. It is to the eternal shame of the wider international community that we all failed to help the Cambodian people when their plight became clear. Finally, in 1992, we are seeing belated but, this time, concerted action.

         It is worth recalling that past members of the Australian Parliament readily supported the Vietnam war, during which the United States bombed Cambodia, precipitating instability and a power vacuum which was filled by Pol Pot. I expect all Australians to feel some sense of historical moral responsibility to help right the wrongs done to the Cambodian people. Indeed, it is profoundly ironic that not much more than a year ago most members of this Parliament were straining at the leash to send Australian troops to the Gulf war. Surely the Cambodian situation vitally engages Australia's interests at least as much as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Peace in Cambodia and an end to Vietnam's isolation hold the promise of democracy, improved human rights and economic development in a large part of our own region.

         As I have already said, while the Democrats regard UNTAC as having a good chance of succeeding, we are not blind to the dangers and the possibility of failure, and we never have been. This is due in no small measure to the realistic and rational assessments that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made of the merits and the prospects of the peace process. This was evidenced by the testimony of the then Deputy Secretary of that Department, Mr Michael Costello, to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in February last year. I quote Mr Costello's reply to two of my questions. His first answer was:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Anyone who puts his hand over his heart and says, `I trust Pol Pot' is probably not being all that wise.

         This is the biggest peacekeeping task that the United Nations has ever attempted. It is obvious in that context, given continuing uncertainties in a number of respects on the ground in Cambodia, that there should be a number of loose ends in the way in which the UNTAC operation has so far been described and in the way in which it will proceed. However, I do not think there are as many as have been suggested by the Opposition in this respect. But may I say quickly that the Government is perfectly happy to consult with the Opposition and to share with it the information as it becomes available.

It has taken some time for all that to occur to the point at which we could make meaningful decisions and have a meaningful discussion. But there is quite a bit that we can now say.

         As to the concerns that have been expressed, I will begin with the theme, repeated again today by Senator Hill, of the role of the Khmer Rouge in this settlement. I am as conscious as anyone in the world of the appalling record of the Khmer Rouge. I am certainly not a naive advocate of the view that it has now become converted to the democratic process intellectually, emotionally or in any other way. However, I have been of the view for quite a considerable time that no settlement would ever be possible of the appallingly protracted, disastrous situation in Cambodia unless it involved in some credible way all parties active on the ground in Cambodia, and did not seek to exclude one altogether from that process, whatever the obvious attractions in doing so.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The justification for that, as I have explained on innumerable occasions, is our belief that to crudely try to exclude the Khmer Rouge or anybody else from the process would not have made possible a commitment to that settlement process by the relevant external powers whose support, more than anything else, was keeping the conflict going. More specifically, it would not have been possible to include China in the settlement process without a role being found in the way that the settlement process now sets it out for all the parties on the ground; not a role in the actual executive administration of the country—that was impossible to accept—but a role as potential participants in the future of that country through the ballot box.

         The Khmer Rouge have not, in our judgment, necessarily changed their spots at all. We can make no judgment about that and certainly I have no optimism, as I have said, on that score. What we can make a judgment about is that they have been effectively denied a continuation of external arms support and they very clearly have been denied any kind of external political support. As was said by Mr Costello in the passage quoted by Senator Bourne, what the settlement has been all about is creating the structures, the institutions, and the processes to give us the best possible chance that that settlement would be enabled to be put into place, even with the at best very grudging cooperation of one of the key internal players.

         If we have been wrong in our assessment that the Khmer Rouge was capable of being contained in this way and that the settlement was only capable of being achieved by the kinds of approach I have described, then we have not been alone in that misjudgment. It has been an error also perpetrated, adopted and endorsed by all members of the Permanent Five of the Security Council, the Security Council itself, the UN General Assembly as a whole, and certainly all the key neighbouring Asian nations, from Vietnam and Thailand to the other ASEANs to Japan. Every one of those countries has come to accept over the course of the last few years that this kind of settlement strategy, the one on which we are now embarked, was the only game in town.

         No-one doubts, even in the context of that settlement and with all the institutional processes that are being put into place, that the Khmer Rouge will lack the capacity for mischief in the future. They will retain that capacity and, depending on the degree of success of the demobilisation exercise and the location and destruction of arms caches exercises, there may be some considerable residual capacity for mischief. But our judgment—again, I believe, a judgment shared by all the other countries that have participated in this process—is that that capacity for mischief is eminently containable and certainly, again, that there is no alternative but to go down the course that has been mapped out.

         Much has been made in recent days as a demonstration of that kind of mischief that the Khmer Rouge can perpetrate of the situation around Kompong Thom, where fighting has taken place of a kind which has given rise to quite a degree of concern. However, let me say this about that situation in Kompong Thom which has attracted so much media attention and political discussion. At most, the fighting involved was sporadic and low level in character. Much more importantly, despite the concern that has been expressed about its continuation, all the available evidence is that that situation has now been brought back under control; that the military situation there has stabilised. Lieutenant-General Sanderson made it reasonably clear that that was his expectation in an interview he did 24 or 48 hours ago that was widely reported here in Australia.

Those components in summary are as follows in the order in which they appear in this document. First, there is the human rights component, which involves both education and oversight and the establishment of a human rights office as part of the civilian administration in Phnom Penh. Secondly, there is the electoral component, which will involve this hugely complex function of registration of voters and the conduct of the election itself, once the demobilisation is complete and the repatriation and return of refugees is complete.

         The third—and of course most immediately relevant—is the military component, which has itself four main sub-components in terms of the particular roles that are to be played. The first is verification of the withdrawal of foreign forces. The second is supervision of the cease-fire and related measures, which in turn involves a number of separate operations—regroupment, cantonment of some 200,000 military personnel, disarming of some 450,000 personnel, including the militias as well as the military, and demobilisation of at least 70 per cent—to quote the settlement—of the military, but, of course, hopefully a full 100 per cent. Let me make clear, because Senator Hill made this point, that we certainly hope, and I know the military authorities on the ground in Phnom Penh certainly hope, that a greater degree of demobilisation than 70 per cent will in practice be able to be achieved, even if it was not able to be negotiated in the settlement text.

The precise content of that civilian administration role and how it will work out in practice in terms of looking over the shoulder of the different elements of the civilian administration in Phnom Penh is still in the process of being worked out. It is impossible to be precise about it at this stage, but the task itself has been defined in reasonably clear terms, at least so far as the general principles of it are concerned.

         The particular role to be played by the Australian forces was the subject of query by Senator Hill. Of course, it is outlined in general terms in the statement. There is not an enormous amount more I can add to what is in the statement except to say that on page 22 of the Secretary-General's report the role of the Signals Unit is described in these terms:

        A total of 582 (all ranks) would be deployed throughout the mission area.

        That is the context in which I was referring last night to the Australians being involved in a civilian role as well. I was also making the obvious point that in the absence of any telecommunications infrastructure it is essentially going to be a matter for the armed forces signallers to create an equivalent, at least in very outline shape, of a Telecom system for the country. It is a huge job, and it is in that context that the numbers we are talking about should be seen.

         It is not a matter of talking about 582 communicators in the context of just another 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 people deployed. Remember that we are talking about a military component under this operational plan of 15,900 in total involving many different operational roles, including an infantry element of some 10,200 with 12 battalions of roughly 850 people each. So it is in the context of an operation of this huge scale that this particular logistic support role has been identified and will be carried out by Australia.

         The deployment of the Australian troops will be a matter for the military commander on the ground, who happens, of course, to be an Australian—Lieutenant-General Sanderson—but wearing a United Nations hat, not an Australian one. It is not a matter of defining with the kind of precision that we needed to in the Gulf conflict, rules of engagement and the circumstances for the exercise of independent discretion and so on, because in the Gulf conflict the Australian component of the forces was acting as an independent agency, in effect, although in coordination, of course, with the other forces there concerned. Here it is a rather different operation where the Australians are fully integrated into a UN military exercise and are subject to UN command. Of course, it is always capable for the Australian Government to make the decision that it is unhappy about the way something is developing on the ground and to decide to withdraw the forces thus engaged. But essentially their deployment will be a matter for the UNTAC force commander.

         The context in which that deployment will occur has been unequivocally made clear by Lieutenant-General Sanderson as a peacekeeping role, not a peace enforcement role. I do not honestly think there is room for any further confusion about these particular kinds of identified roles. Peace enforcement does involve something analogous to the Gulf war situation where you are going into a manifestly hostile situation, separating forces at war, exercising military force. Peace keeping, as that concept is now well understood, involves not any of that but simply the monitoring, supervision and verification of agreements already reached.

         There is some ambiguity about the further expression  `peacemaking'. Peacemaking is usually used in the context of preventive diplomacy or the kind of diplomacy that was involved in actually crafting and bedding down the settlements agreements signed in Paris. But there is a looser sense in which we can talk about peacemaking as being an ongoing task and we can talk about the various UNTAC components having, in a sense, an ongoing peacemaking role to the extent that their presence on the ground will involve confidence building, will hopefully involve the resolution of local disagreements and difficulties, the renegotiation of cease-fire terms, things of this kind that we have seen already happening in Kompong Thom. In an extended sense, that does involve, I suppose, a degree of peacemaking. But the basic peacemaking has been done with the settlement agreements. What is necessary simply is to ensure that those agreements work themselves out.

But in the worst case scenario, it would involve, of course, the UN and the international community walking away completely from the situation on the ground.

We are in the early stages right now of seeing the acceptance of the invitation to supply components of UNTAC and the deployment of those components. There are Indonesian and, I understand, Malaysian battalions on the ground, as well as the existing UNAMIC contingent.

Certainly, it is everyone's hope and expectation that there will be many more troops than just 4,000 on the ground before the wet. However, it was important to get some people on the ground very quickly. By my calculations, approximately 20 countries are now involved, taking those functions I have just described into account, and no doubt there will be many more before the process is complete. That is just the military operation and unquestionably other countries will be involved in the electoral function and other aspects of civilian organisations, as well as the policing function which will be very important.

         A question was also raised about the commitment of other countries towards paying the costs of this operation which are very large. The sum of $1.9 billion is the estimate for the 18-month period and Australia's contribution as a proportion of that has been spelt out. It is the case that to my knowledge a substantial number of contributions have not yet actually been made even to the initial $200m advance amount that has been formally agreed. One would not expect contributions to be paid as yet for the larger UNTAC assessed costs, simply because that has not yet been the subject of a final formal decision. When it is, there is an obligation on countries to pay their assessed contribution within 30 days of that and we can expect to see a rapid influx of money.

         The Government has not sought to underestimate the risks associated with this exercise. Australian troops—as will everyone else on the ground in Cambodia in either civilian or military roles—will face risks from disease, mines and also from the possibility of cross-fire in the event that the military situation does deteriorate. In that environment it is crucial for everyone to acknowledge the legitimacy or the validity of the task upon which we are all embarked. It is absolutely crucial that everyone in Cambodia who is working for peace—including the very talented, skilled and devoted members of the Australian defence forces—feel that they have the support of the Australian community and Parliament. Today that support has been essentially forthcoming from members of the Opposition, the Democrats and, I expect, from Senator Harradine and I thank them all for that.

Senator Evans attempted to repair that somewhat at the end of his speech, but it was a pity that he set the tone of his response which was not at all justified by the support which the Opposition is giving to the extended motion moved by Senator Robert Ray. The Opposition clearly supports the affirmations of support in the Parliament for Australia's participation in the Cambodian peacekeeping operation, and the participation of the Australian Defence Force, in particular, which has a most important role.

It is undertaking this operation in one of the most notoriously difficult, dangerous and unstable places in the world and which has been so for at least two or more decades. It was not surprising that the Opposition—indeed anyone—would wish to be satisfied that the position had been reached where a proper peacekeeping operation, albeit one of great complexity and danger, could be undertaken.

That is the military role of UNTAC. I want to address myself to that in the remarks that I am making in this debate.

We are supporting the Government's decision to send an Australian contingent of 495 members of the Australian Defence Force to form what is called a force communications unit. Its role has now, thankfully, been spelt out in more detail by Senator Evans in the speech that he has just made. That role, as described, cannot be carried out by the Australian forces. It cannot be carried out by any of the United Nations military forces in Cambodia unless there are circumstances present in that country which enable that role to be performed. This is precisely because of the concerns about the nature of the conditions in Cambodia in recent months, or indeed in recent years, and what could be done in a peacekeeping role in the circumstances as they have been and as they may be up to the present.

I hope he feels better that Dr Hewson acknowledged it in his speech in another place this afternoon. If that is all he has been worried about, he has been given that acknowledgment.

We need to be assured, as does the Government, that the conditions are right in Cambodia. It is clear that the Government cannot say even today in the statement for which we waited about five months that the conditions are right and that the main Australian contingent, another 430 signallers, or communicators as they now seem to be known as, will be on their way to Cambodia.

It is certainly now looking promising that that process will be able to be brought into effect. Nevertheless, one must have grave concerns about the enormity of the task in the time frame that has been laid down here. It is an enormous task to demobilise these forces, establish UNTAC as virtually a government in Cambodia, establish the conditions and administration for an election, repatriate hundreds of thousands of Cambodians back to Cambodia from the border camps and so on, yet it is intended that all that will be achieved in time for an election to be held in May 1993.

         I have already indicated what the military role is. Senator Evans also spelt it out better in his speech today. He provided some answers to questions I would have been wanting to ask had he not done so. They are not really clearly spelt out in this statement. Let us look at the task that this United Nations peacekeeping force will have to perform during this period of 12 months or perhaps less. The force will have to disarm something like 450,000 Cambodian soldiers representing the various factions. They have to be brought into what is called a cantonment where they can be disarmed. As much of that as possible will have to be done during the wet season, which will create great difficulties, as will the fact that the country is infested with mines. The other role, as Senator Evans said today, is to seek out, seize and take away from the factions caches of arms, which are no doubt very extensive throughout the country. It is an enormous role. It is one which will test to the extreme the forces that will be available.

         Senator Evans admitted today that only about 4,000 members of the UNTAC military mission would be in place by the end of April; and maybe it will not be achieved as soon as that. The estimate of what is required is about 15,900 military personnel, together with 3,500 civilian police and another 3,000 or more civilian administrators. The number that is to be in place by the end of this month, as Senator Evans has told us today, is far short of 16,000—in fact, it is only a quarter of the size of the military component of UNTAC.

They will also have the wider role of providing communications for vital civilian administration. That will be most important from the point of view of establishing conditions whereby elections can be held in Cambodia and a stable administration can be put in place. The members of the Australian Defence Force will have a very important role. They will not all be serving with the military personnel that have been provided. Senator Evans has said that there will be up to 20 other countries—although there are still a lot of ifs and buts about where those numbers will come from and whether they will all be there in due time.

         Nevertheless, assuming that this all goes to plan, the members of the ADF in Cambodia will be exposed to a great many dangers. One matter of concern is that they may not be fully protected in some of the circumstances in which they will be serving. I do not think there is any doubt about that and it must be recognised. It is a matter which the Government should be addressing a little more seriously than it seems to be doing. The Government says that although it has not assessed any casualty rate, according to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in answer to a question  yesterday—which is a rather astonishing admission by the Minister—it is recognising a variety of dangerous situations in which the ADF will be operating. It is certainly up to the Government to ensure that the maximum protection in the circumstances will be given to those members of the Australian forces. Senator Evans has spelt that out in much more detail than was given in the Prime Minister's statement in relation to that particular concern of the Opposition. But for the reasons I have just mentioned, the Opposition still has continuing concerns about the safety of ADF members and about the hazardous nature of the role that they are asked to perform.

Realistically, we must face the fact that that may well be the case, despite all the hopes that we have and despite the optimism that Senator Evans has, perhaps more than most other people. We may well face that.

         As I understand from Senator Evans, that decision will be made by UNTAC. I suppose the most influential in that respect will be the military commander there, Lieutenant-General Sanderson. We are very fortunate, indeed, that we have a distinguished Australian soldier there commanding the force. It will give all of us and the soldiers more confidence that careful consideration will be given to their situation. Nevertheless, it is a responsibility which must be assumed and retained at all times by the Government.

         Even though there will not be any rules of engagement in the ordinary sense and the command structure maintained over the Australian contingent in Cambodia, as occurred in the Gulf War and similar operations, the Australian Government has the responsibility—it will always have the responsibility, and it should recognise that—to ensure that the Australian contingent in Cambodia is not being used beyond the role which everyone so clearly acknowledges is a peacekeeping role, and a peacekeeping role only. That is not a satisfactory situation, as Senator Evans outlined it, unless the Government continues to watch that very closely. There will be very difficult decisions to make as to whether or not the borderline has been stepped over as circumstances occur from time to time in Cambodia.

As I have said on a number of previous occasions in this place, effective foreign policy, effective defence policy and effective trade policy can really evolve only from a bipartisan basis. Having said that, could I also say that during the time of the public debate on our Cambodian involvement, the Cambodian initiative and the Cambodian peace process, Australian opinion overwhelmingly supported the endeavours of the Government. There is no doubt in my mind that the Australian people at large, and from the very beginning of the peace process, have endorsed the involvement of Australian officials and endorsed the initiatives taken by Senator Evans. In particular, the Australian electorate has endorsed the role to be taken by our armed forces in Cambodia in pursuit of peace.

         In looking at the Cambodian circumstance, it is important to begin by recognising that this was the worst civil war in Asia since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s. For a period of nearly two decades it was a particularly brutal, indeed gruesome, conflict. All civil wars are bloody; all civil wars are terribly divisive. The Cambodian civil war was absolutely murderous in its intensity and it proved to be catastrophic in its consequences, not only for that unhappy country but for the region at large. It involved border conflict with Thailand and later an outright war between the Khmer Rouge and the Republic of Vietnam.

         Every peacekeeping initiative in which the Australian armed forces have been involved has been extremely dangerous. There is no doubt about that. During the course of the review of our peacekeeping operations by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade we were personally and directly told by officers of the ADF who had served in peacekeeping missions just how dangerous the task had proved to be. That was especially true of the role of the ADF in the Iran-Iraq peacekeeping mission. In that situation some of our officers separated large contingents of Iraqi and Iranian military personnel who were armed with heavy weapons and separated by only a few metres of mine-strewn territory. At times some of our personnel showed quite astonishing courage in performing the task of keeping those forces separate and avoiding further eruption in a war that had lasted the best part of a decade.

However, to put it in perspective, compare and contrast it with the Yugoslav involvement where a United Nations protective force is about to be deployed in that strife-torn country. As Senator Jones asked the other day in a question to Senator Evans, there is every chance that the civil war in Yugoslavia will erupt again. That is an unfortunate truth that confronts us. Nonetheless, the United Nations has a role to play in that country, just as it has a role to play now in Cambodia.

Senator Hill and Senator Durack have detailed some of the matters we would have expected to have seen included in the statement, so I do not intend to repeat them this evening.

What will the arrangements be for changes in the military situation whereby our personnel may need to take action to defend themselves? Who will determine when the rules of engagement are to change? What will the involvement of the Australian Government be in such decisions? What likelihood of delay will there be? The reason for asking these questions is only too clear. Our experience in the Gulf war was that our naval commanders were waiting for commands back in Australia, waiting on the Department of Foreign Affairs, which had no understanding of the pressures of the situation, the time constraints, and the lives of all men on board who needed to be protected.

I have every confidence in General Sanderson, an extremely capable officer with a strong moral fibre.

         While Defence assessed the possible casualties in Namibia as likely to be between 2 and 3 per cent prior to deployment, one can only assume in the absence of such information from the Government that that assessment must be at least as great for Cambodia. The same problems exist of unmapped minefields and armed men still engaging in sporadic fire fights. The assessment in Namibia, fortunately, was over-pessimistic, and I trust that it will not be correct for Cambodia.

         I do not know what has been the longest war of the twentieth century, but I suspect the fighting that has been going on in Cambodia, in one form or another, since 1941 means that Cambodia has probably had the longest war of the twentieth century. It is in something like its fiftieth year of war. There was the fighting in World War II. There was the fighting against the French for Cambodian independence. Once that was achieved, there was the beginning of the insurgency by the Khmer Rouge during the late 1950s and the 1960s. Then there was the involvement of the Vietnamese and the Americans along the borders of Cambodia as a result of the Vietnam war. Then there was the direct American intervention in Cambodia.

         In 1970 there was the coup which led to a terrible civil war, which extended until 1975 when the Khmer Rouge triumphed. Then there was the terrible period of the Khmer Rouge in which there was not much fighting; it was just slaughter of their own people. There was the Vietnamese intervention in 1979 to get rid of the Pol Pot Government. Throughout the 1980s there was again civil war as the various factions—the Khmer Rouge, the Sihanouk faction, and the Son Sann faction—fought against the government installed in Phnom Penh by the Vietnamese.

         It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that Cambodia's has been the longest war of the twentieth century. The untold suffering through at least three generations of Cambodians has been appalling. But today we are talking about Australia's involvement as part of the UN peacekeeping force. At long last there may be more than just a small glimmer of light for the Cambodian people. The ordinary people, through this process, will have a free election next year and a government of their own free choice, and the fighting will stop.

For many years to come Australia's role in Cambodia will rank as one of our finest foreign affairs policy achievements. It will stand us in good stead throughout the countries of South East Asia that we were the honest broker, we were the ones without a vested interest and we were honestly there trying to get peace to this poor, unfortunate country which had suffered 50 years of fighting, much of it imposed on it by others.

         In recognition of Australia's role, we must pay tribute to other countries. It has been mentioned in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Senator Gareth Evans, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Hayden, should be given particular credit for the roles that they played in the 1980s, and I certainly endorse that.

         One should remember that, in the mid-1980s when Bill Hayden first started, he was condemned both within this country and elsewhere as being unrealistic in the proposals he put forward. He was followed by Senator Gareth Evans, who produced the red book, the comprehensive plan for the UN involvement in the peace settlement, which the UN P5 overwhelmingly adopted as its own plan. That means that Senator Gareth Evans has a very honoured place not only in the history of this country but also in the history of South East Asia. He certainly deserves the nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, but it is a nomination that I think he would welcome sharing with a number of other major players.

         Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister for Indonesia, should be given special credit for the role that he played in chairing the Jakarta meetings. Many of them ended in deadlock, but he kept going back and calling further meetings. His assistance in that process cannot be ignored. I also think the former Prime Minister of Thailand, General Chatichai Choonhavan, must be given considerable credit for leading a number of the South East Asian countries out of their sterile policy on Cambodia. When he invited Hun Sen, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, to Bangkok in 1989, that was the psychological breakthrough that was needed in relations between the ASEAN countries and Vietnam and Cambodia. The French, as co-chairmen of the peace conference in Paris, must also be given particular credit.

I first met Russell Stuart some two years ago after he had made several visits to Cambodia as part of initial inquiries about the situation in the country. Russell Stuart is a soldier of considerable initiative. He assessed the situation in the country and often made reports that disagreed with much of the propaganda put out by other countries about the true situation. He stuck to his guns and he has been proven right in his assessment of how a peacekeeping operation could work.

Jennifer did a sterling job under considerable difficulties. I first met her there in 1988.

         Recommendation 10 positively refers to the assistance of the families left behind; of liaison and welfare activities; and, again, of making sure that information is given to those families. I do not doubt that there is every best intention of doing this—indeed, the Australian defence services have a record of good practices in this matter—but I want to ensure that the concerns of the Parliament and the Australian people are directly and specifically addressed so that there are procedures in place for assistance to families.

         Recommendation 17 talks of the involvement of the Reserves and not just regular defence personnel—and I commend to the Australian Government that that there may be an appropriate involvement for the Reserves. Similarly, recommendation 14 refers to non-government organisations and the obvious benefit in coordinating the safety and the effectiveness of both our defence personnel and non-government organisations in the continuing work in Cambodia over the next 18 months.

         I come to the final part of my remarks. Having referred to the Senate committee's report, I wish to note that as a member of the Senate I have concerns, which I heard Senator Evans take on board. I mention these concerns again in summary to ensure that the Government remains accountable for them. I want to ensure that there is no complacency. The Government should be mindful of these concerns as we look forward to the success of the Australian personnel in this peacekeeping operation.

         Those five concerns are: firstly, the Khmer Rouge; secondly, the timing, extent and conditions of the Australian deployment; thirdly, the costs and other international contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping force; fourthly, the rate of return and the viable operation of refugees and displaced persons coming back to their homes—half a million Cambodians are involved; and, fifthly, the need in every step of the process for consultation by the Government with the Opposition in this Parliament.

         I will elaborate briefly on these five points. I am totally opposed to ever seeing the return of the Khmer Rouge as a dominant force in Cambodia or, God forbid, anywhere near government in that country again, given its despised record of genocide against the people of that country. I still believe that Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders of that period should be brought to justice for their crimes. I believe that the Khmer Rouge is the one group within Cambodia that has not fully lived up to its signed commitments to disarm—at least to the tune of 70 per cent—or to genuinely cease its military operations and actually put into effect a cease-fire.

         I believe that the Government must continue to maximise realism in regard to the Khmer Rouge and, to the extent of my reference to the precondition referred to in recommendation 6 of the Senate report, confine or urge the confining of the peacekeeping force to those areas where there is genuine active commitment to the preconditions for such a force.

         With regard to the second point—the timing, extent and conditions of the Australian deployment—I note the ambivalence in a number of the references in the Prime Minister's statement. For instance, he used the words, `if conditions are right in Cambodia'; he talked about `setbacks'; and he even spoke of contemplating that the whole peacekeeping force may `have to be withdrawn'. I note the ambivalence. I believe that each of these points needs to be spelt out to us. There needs to be clarity with regard to the day of commitment, the period of commitment and the conditions of the deployment. These are lacking in the Prime Minister's statement. They have been filled out a little more by Senator Evans; they need to be filled out progressively over the coming weeks and months.

         There has not been a sufficient demarcation or definition in the Government's statement with regard to the difference between peacemaking and peacekeeping. Senator Evans has addressed that more particularly. He has given some arguments as to why the rules of engagement ought not to be as fully spelt out as we have requested, but I am not yet convinced. I believe that we do need to know not only the rules of engagement but also the limits of authority of the Australian contingent commander.

         I do not need to expand on the third point—that is, that we need to know month by month what other countries are contributing to this peacekeeping operation and how that is all coming together in the peacekeeping force under the command of Lieutenant-General Sanderson. We need to know about the costs. Whilst we have heard that there is to be an approximate 40 per cent reimbursement to Australia of the costs outlaid—the military aspects of this peacekeeping operation are estimated to be about $50m and more than $50m will be outlaid over the next four years in terms of development assistance—it is still to be seen whether we will be given that compensation and whether the formula under which UN members have undertaken to contribute is followed.

A great deal of realism needs to be applied to that huge undertaking of bringing these refugees and displaced persons back to their homes. Of course, we all wish that homecoming success.

It is essential, I believe, to ensure that the Parliament and the public of Australia are confident that that consultation will be real and timely over the next 18 months.

I have pleasure in presenting this report on behalf of an all-party parliamentary delegation which visited the United Kingdom and Austria last year. Both nations are of significance to Australia and, although visits by members of parliament to the United Kingdom are by no means rare, this was the first official visit by an Australian delegation to Austria. I look forward to greeting an Austrian delegation which is due to visit Australia this year. That visit will occur as a result of an invitation which I extended on behalf of the Presiding Officers to Dr Henry Fisher, President of the National Council.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        record. Firstly, the success of the delegation's visit was due to a great extent to the Australian posts in London and Vienna. On behalf of the delegation, I place on record the members' deep appreciation for the assistance afforded by His Excellency Mr Richard Smith, Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and His Excellency, Mr John Wilson, Australia's Ambassador to Austria. It is my hope that the delegation's activities were, in turn, of assistance to both missions. The High Commissioner, the Ambassador and their staff gave invaluable assistance and advice and gave freely of their time to enable the delegation to accomplish its objectives.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        However, placing that sincere appreciation on record does not detract in any way from the assistance and hospitality of our hosts in both nations. They, too, made a significant contribution to the success of the delegation. The delegation's appreciation of its hosts is recorded in the report. I trust that when return delegations visit Australia, our Parliament will make a sound contribution to the success of their visits.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Secondly, on all possible occasions the Australian delegation outlined to its hosts how policies of subsidies on agricultural products in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe are extremely detrimental to the export of Australian agricultural produce and the Australian economy. The delegation's concerns were understood and, in the main, noted courteously. As outlined in the report, two Austrian MPs expressed an opinion about the need for Australia to establish markets in their region of the world. That need is well understood in Australia, but when agricultural policies lead to a subsidy war between Europe and the United States of America, Australia's search for additional markets is undermined. This matter is discussed in greater detail in the report. Despite the lack of success of our discussions in this area, the delegation is hopeful that its remarks added to the already strong diplomatic efforts of Australia's overseas representatives in relation to agricultural subsidies.

        During the course of the visit, members of the delegation were able to savour some of the cultural life of both the United Kingdom and Austria. I should remark that this aspect of the visit was important, because it adds to a further dimension of one's understanding of the countries visited. The cultural highlights in the United Kingdom, to name but a few, were Wimbledon, the Henley-on-Thames Regatta, a production of
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         King Henry IV, Part I

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The highlights in Austria included an Austrian heurigan or vineyard inn, many memorable buildings, monuments, parks and gardens in the city of Vienna, Innsbruck Old Town, the Pitztal Glacier and Ambras Castle. I expect that individual members will have special memories of certain cultural activities or visits which the delegation experienced. I have fond memories of all the highlights which I have mentioned, but I will never forget the dinner in the King's dining room in Edinburgh Castle. Perhaps I was so attracted to that particular evening's activities because of my part Scottish ancestry.

        Finally, I extend my sincere thanks to members of the delegation and to those persons who accompanied it. It is always an honour to lead an Australian parliamentary delegation, but this delegation scarcely needed leading. This was due to the helpful, cooperative, perceptive approach of all members: Mr Dobie, my deputy leader; Senator Beahan; Mr Braithwaite; Mr Les Scott; Senator Walters and Senator Zakharov. There was the same approach from the accompanying spouses: Mrs Beahan, Mrs Braithwaite, Dr Walters, my wife Dawn, together with Senator Zakharov's son and daughter. On a personal basis, this delegation's visit rated at least as pleasurable and productive as any overseas visit with which I have been associated. I commend the report to the Senate.

          —by leave—Honourable senators will recall that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991, which for convenience I will refer to as the political broadcasts Act, was passed by the Senate after considerable debate. That debate appropriately concentrated on the policy aspects of its provisions. However, the actual implementation of those provisions would not have been possible without regulations filling out the details of its general framework. These regulations were made under the parent Broadcasting Act 1942, which I will call the Act, as amended by the Political Broadcasts Act.

          As part of its mandate from the Senate, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances examined nine separate sets of regulations made under the Act to ensure that they complied with its principles of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties. The Committee found that the only principle which may have been breached was that which requires delegated legislation to be in accordance with its parent Act.

          The Committee considers that it is not certain that some, or all, of these regulations have a valid effect. However, this is a matter upon which opinions may differ and which may only be determined conclusively by a court. In such cases of uncertain validity, the Committee does not express an opinion one way or the other. This is a point which was made by Senator Patterson recently during the condolence motion for Senator Ian Wood. Nevertheless, in this case the Committee decided that it may be useful to set out the issues of legislative scrutiny raised by the regulations. The nine separate sets of regulations dealt with broadcasts in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. However, they conveniently fall into three groups of three.

          I will now deal with the first group of three sets of regulations. There are two possible problems with this legislation. First, two of the group of three, those dealing with elections in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, contained a regulation providing for their commencement on 1 January 1992. This may have created a difficulty because the first proclamation of Part 2 of the Political Broadcasts Act, which inserted Part IIID containing the amendments upon which the regulations were to operate, was not gazetted until 2 January 1992. The third of this group of three regulations, dealing with elections in New South Wales, was not affected in this way as they commenced on their date of gazettal, 3 January 1992, which was the date of the second proclamation of part 2 of the Political Broadcasts Act.

          The second problem with this first group of regulations is that all three sets of regulations in the group refer to section numbers which, in fact, do not exist in the amendments effected by the Political Broadcasts Act. Thus, they appear to have nothing upon which to operate.

          I now pass on to the second group, also of three sets of regulations, dealing with elections in the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and New South Wales. This second group was made on 3 January 1992, which was the date of the second proclamation of the Political Broadcasts Act, so there is not the same problem with commencement as exists for the first group. However, there are other difficulties.

          First, two of the three sets of regulations, dealing with the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, were made at a time when there was a motion pending in the Senate for disallowance of the equivalent regulations in the first group, which had been tabled in both Houses. In this context, section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides, in effect, that if a regulation is made while a regulation the same in substance—and I emphasise `the same in substance'—is subject to a disallowance motion, then the second regulation `has no effect'.

          It is a possible argument that some of the individual regulations in the two sets of affected regulations are the same in substance as those in the earlier group. Here, it is not necessary for the whole set to be the same in substance as the earlier set, but each regulation can be compared with an earlier one. In the second group there were differences in many of the regulations in that correct sections of the Act were included, compared with the incorrect references in the previous group. This could raise the question whether these later regulations were the same in substance as the earlier. This is a matter of legal and factual interpretation to be decided by the courts and, if the later regulations were held to be the same in substance, they would have no effect. On the other hand, if they were held not to be the same in substance, the second group of regulations would stand.

          The third set of regulations in the first group, dealing with New South Wales, had not been tabled at the time the second group was made. Thus, they were not subject to a disallowance motion and so the corresponding set in the second group was not caught by section 48B. However, a similar fate could be argued for the third set in the second group or some of them, relying on section 48A of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides that if regulations the same in substance are made during the tabling requirement period, they have no effect. It should be noted that if any of the regulations were held to be the same in substance, they would be void and not merely voidable, as is the case if regulations are made and not tabled within 15 sitting days.

          There is another problem with the set of regulations dealing with New South Wales in the second group. Cross-references in regulations 8 and 9 refer to regulation 5, when a reference to regulation 6 was probably intended. Indeed, if the cross-references to regulation 5 are correct, then the corresponding cross-references in the other five sets of regulations in the first and second group would appear to be wrong.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The next difficulty with the second group of regulations concerns a final provision repealing the equivalent set of regulations in the first group. It could be argued that even if the other individual regulations in the second group of regulations are of no effect because they are the same in substance as regulations in the first group, there are certainly no regulations in the first group the same in substance as these three repealing regulations. If this argument is correct, these three repealing regulations would stand and would be effective to repeal the first group.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the other hand, it could be argued that the repealing regulations were such an integral part of the whole set that, if the other regulations in the set fell as being the same in substance, these repealing regulations also fall. However, as noted earlier, neither section 48A nor section 48B refers to a set of regulations the same in substance, but refer to `no regulation the same in substance'. Incidentally, the explanatory statements for the second group of regulations offer no assistance, as they provide an outline of every provision in each set apart from the repealing provision, which is not mentioned.

          This question of repeal becomes important when the third group of regulations is considered, because they purport to amend the first group, which may or may not have been repealed by the repealing regulations in the second group. The third group of regulations was apparently made on the assumption that all the substantive provisions of the second group, including the repeal provisions, were invalid, and that the first group had therefore not been repealed.

          This third group amended the first group to do two principal things, as well as to make some minor changes. First, they amended the two sets of regulations dealing with Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory to repeal the individual provisions fixing their commencement date as 1 January 1992, with the aim of ensuring commencement after the second proclamation of part 2 of the Political Broadcasts Act. The explanatory statement advised that this amendment was intended to ensure that the amended sets of regulations came into effect, at the latest, on the gazettal of the third group on 10 January 1992.

          Whether this has been the effect will be for a court to decide and will be a test, among other things, of the interpretation of section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act, under which the first two sets in the first group were made. That section provides that regulations may be made under provisions of a parent Act which have not yet come into operation, although the regulations cannot come into operation before those provisions. Secondly, the third group amended the first group to remove the spurious section numbers and to insert the correct ones.

          In summary, there are arguments both for and against the validity of the regulations made under the Political Broadcasts Act amendments. In all of these arguments the meaning of the phrase `the same in substance' is crucial. So, too, is the effect of the three repealing regulations. The result is that there are at least two ways in which a court decision could result in there being no effective regulations in force. Firstly, in the actions already commenced, the High Court of Australia could make declarations that part IIID of the Act, inserted by the Political Broadcasts Act, was invalid.

          If that happened, then these regulations, all of which depend on provisions in that part, will not be effective. Alternatively, a court could hold that most of the regulations in the second groups were the same in substance as those in the first group and thus have no effect, but that the repealing provisions were not the same in substance and thus operate to repeal the first group. The third group would then be ineffectual as they merely purport to amend the first group.

          On the other hand, a court could hold that there were effective regulations in force. Under this argument the individual regulations, including the repealing regulations, in the second group, would be held to be the same in substance as the relevant earlier regulations and thus of no effect. The first group would thus be held not to have been repealed. In addition, any possible defects in the first group concerning the date of commencement and the wrong section numbers would have been corrected by the third group.

        The Deer herd has been growing at about 25 per cent per annum on average in recent years. It is estimated that there were about 155,000 deer on over 1,000 farms at the end of 1991. The main species are fallow deer and red deer which make up 50 per cent and 40 per cent of the herd respectively. The remaining 10 per cent are comprised of mainly tropical species. Velvet production offers producers an additional source of income from deer farming with most velvet being destined for medicinal use in Asia. There is also a small by-product industry producing leather.

Any future operative rates must fall within the legislated maximum rate.
