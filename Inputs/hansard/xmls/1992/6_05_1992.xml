        Debate on this motion is urgent because time has run out. The Government can be allowed to procrastinate no longer on this important issue.

It has been made obvious, and even suggested from government sources, that the time for action is now.

         When Exit Cave was nominated for World Heritage listing in 1988, it was done after agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments that quarrying could continue within the nominated World Heritage area only on the proviso that acceptable limits were set to the scale and development of the operation. Moreover, any loss that resulted from limits being subsequently placed on quarrying operations would oblige the Commonwealth to pay compensation. That is a very important point. The word `compensation' was first mentioned in what are described as the Cook-Groom heads of agreement, a document which was signed at that time and which recognised that future compensation may be a question that had to be addressed. At the time of listing, the quarry was known to be within the World Heritage area. There was agreement that compensation would be paid should limits have to be imposed on the quarry's operation.

         In November 1991, a study by Kevin Kiernan proved that the quarrying operation was having a detrimental effect on the cave system. That is when the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) should have intervened and said, `Enough is enough'. The Minister should have halted operations there and then when the quarrying operation was identified as having a detrimental effect on the World Heritage area.

         Instead, the Minister allowed blasting to continue in February this year to provide a sample of limestone for use by the operators, Benders, in tendering for a contract it had at that time with the zinc company, Pasminco Metals-EZ. The sample was intended to win a contract to continue to supply limestone after 30 June this year when the existing contract expires. That contract expires in less than a couple of months and that is why this matter needs to be discussed today. The time for fiddling about with this issue has long since passed.

         We have no tangible evidence that the Minister has taken any notice of the information which is at hand, available to her, and which, in fact, has been recognised by her. The Minister may well agree with the information that has been given. The Minister may well wish this area to be preserved and protected, but we have no tangible action. That is why we need to suspend the Standing Orders, to allow the Government to immediately act on this issue and to present to us the arguments as to why procrastination has continued. I do not see why we should have to wait for an initiative which should have been forthcoming some months ago, but which now is sadly lacking.

         The damage to the area has been well and truly identified, by the Federal and Tasmanian departments of Environment. According to a leaked Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning report, both that Department and the Federal Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories believe that even a new environment management plan would not protect the cave system. That report says that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service favours relocating the quarry and the Australian Heritage Commission believes the quarry is having a significant adverse effect on the cave system.

         There is no automatic protection under World Heritage for areas such as this. It does require some additional action by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly).

         Another relevant factor is that it is not as though Tasmania is short of limestone. There is no doubt that there are many other situations in which mining can be carried out for the necessary purposes of Pasminco, the zinc refinery at Risdon near Hobart where the limestone is used. There is more than enough limestone in Tasmania in areas well away from the World Heritage area. For those reasons, it becomes absolutely vital that this damaging quarrying operation, which has been going on for quite a long time, should be stopped.

         As I indicated a moment ago, the World Heritage declaration was made in 1989, but in 1991 the area around the quarry was turned into a national park. So in this particular case we have a mining operation going on which is damaging both a World Heritage area and a national park. We have an essentially industrial activity going on in a wilderness area which, as we have indicated, has been declared both World Heritage and national park. For those reasons it is absolutely urgent that the Minister make the necessary declarations so that this area is protected.

         The extraction of limestone from other areas in Tasmania would, of course, employ exactly the same number of people. There is no question—as I think Senator Panizza claimed the night before last when we were debating resource security—that the Democrats want to close mining down. That is simply untrue. In this particular case we want to ensure that when this mining of limestone occurs it occurs with the same amount of employment and generates the same amount of limestone but does not go on in a World Heritage area which, as I have indicated, is in a national park.

         It is for those reasons that we believe that this is a matter of urgency. The Minister, Ros Kelly, should act. She should make the necessary declaration. The mining operation should cease and should be shifted somewhere else. If compensation needs to be paid for the relocation of that mine, that compensation should also be paid. As Senator Bell has said, with the likely renewal of this mining contract on 30 June, it is important that the Minister takes the action now and does not delay any longer.

This legislation is an omnibus collection of five Bills. It is designed to bring the growing deer industry in this country in line with the major primary industries in Australia. It sets out to impose a levy on the slaughter of deer, a charge on the export of deer, a levy on the sale of deer velvet produced and sold in Australia or used in the production of other goods in Australia, and a charge on the export of deer velvet.

         The deer industry is one of a number of industries that have developed in Australia over recent years. One could suggest that the industry has moved past its first excited investor stage to a secondary settling in period of expansion and consolidation. I suggest that that is the reason why at this stage the industry appears to be in such turmoil within itself over this package of Bills.

         As honourable senators would be aware, the legislation passed the House of Representatives with very little fuss and with the support of the Opposition. However, by the time the legislation came to the Senate, some sections of the industry were concerned about what the Bills would mean for the industry and about the industry's capacity to meet the commitment. As a result, the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs held quite extensive hearings last Monday to provide the deer industry with an opportunity to voice its concerns.

         I am advised that deer numbers in Australia have grown at the rate of, on average, about 25 per cent per annum in recent years. At present there are about 155,000 deer, on about 1,000 farms, throughout Australia made up predominantly of fallow and red deer with a small number of tropical species. I say `about' in relation to the numbers of animals and producers because quantifying that is just one of the many difficulties that this industry has. That is a problem that became increasingly evident during the Committee's hearings. To say that the industry is in a state of flux is a misconception. I would almost suggest that the industry is in chaos and on a course of self-destruction if it does not bring itself together.

         Despite the industry's very short appearance at the Committee's hearings, we received some 40 submissions from growers and grower representatives. In addition, I could not count the number of calls I received on this matter, and I know other senators on the Committee also received many. They were from deer farmers both pro- and anti-levies. Obviously each one of them was concerned at what the Government and the Parliament were proposing to do for their industry. The fact that many did not know the implications of the levy—and many did not even know such legislation was intended—is a reflection as much on the industry as on its own representatives.

         Having been involved with the family law inquiry for some time, I know the wisdom of not buying into a domestic dispute. I do not know where the blame lies for the fragmentation within the industry. I do know that, notwithstanding, it was not the function or the purpose of the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee to act as a mediator. The Committee Chairman tried very hard to conciliate and arbitrate between the pro- and anti-levy groups. His efforts, I am sad to say, went unrewarded. In terms of both the pro- and anti-levy people and the pro- and anti-Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, I think it can be said that people acknowledged at the end of the hearings that there was no common ground.

I support both the principle and the practice of levies and that support includes the application of levies to this industry.

It is not the function nor the purpose of Parliament or any committee of Parliament to arbitrate on internal factional difficulties. It was not reasonable for this industry to expect the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee to sort out its affairs. It is up to the growers to get together and do that. It is their industry. They are the ones who should make sure that it goes the way they want it to go.

         Whether or not the Deer Farmers Federation, its administrators and its executive are working in the best interests of all deer farmers is debatable. The fact that they were unable to provide accurate figures to the Committee on membership and deer population and were unable to say what percentage of deer farmers the federation represented is of concern to me, and should be of considerable concern to the deer farmers.

         However, I commend the DFFA on the fact that it has now joined with the National Farmers Federation as a commodity group, which I think is a good move. To the deer farmers I say, `Your  industry is in a mess and it is up to you to sort out yourselves and your affiliations. We cannot do it for you. If you continue to work in opposite directions, you will all be the losers'. The deer industry looks to be an exciting one and has great potential. It would be a pity if the breeders failed to make it work.

         —This package of deer industry Bills has been brought about so that this industry can be in line with other agricultural industries. The Government, along with parts of the industry, has agreed to the imposition, on a shared basis between government and industry, of a research and development arrangement for this industry. The deer industry rates highly with other great Australian agricultural industries. It is expanding at a very rapid and exciting rate of approximately 25 per cent a year. There are currently about 1,000 full or part-time farmers in this industry, and 155,000 deer—a number that is expected to double within a few years.

         This is also an important export industry. The deer industry's application to the Government for inclusion in the research and development arrangements will make it more commercial, more able to target what the industry is after and to embark upon the necessary research required if it is to maintain a competitiveness against the industries of other countries, in particular New Zealand.

         There is already a voluntary agreement in place which the industry has instituted ahead of a statutory system and about $25,000 has been donated. When the deer industry joins the statutory arrangements in the near future it will join over 20 other agricultural industries on the same basis of a dollar for dollar up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. That will cost the Government an estimated $30,000 next financial year and $60,000 the following year.

         It is encouraging that the industry, from its first year, is evidently prepared to provide more than is necessary for the matching grants. The grower contributions will be $100,000.

         The decision of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia has been an important one. It has not been without criticism within the industry itself. Not everybody in the industry supports it. I believe that Senator Brownhill has made that point very clear. I suppose it would be unique actually if that were to be the case. Problems have emerged particularly with regard to full support of the industry.

         The detailed steps that have taken place ahead of this legislation indicate that there is a good relationship between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the industry and within the industry itself. There has been plenty of opportunity for the necessary discussion, communication, et cetera. In 1989, there was a deer industry workshop sponsored by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. On 22 March 1991, the annual meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia passed unanimously a motion to proceed with the statutory level requirement. The Tasmanian section of the industry was a member at that time and participated in that unanimous vote.

         In August 1991, at a national conference held in Albury attended by over 300 deer breeders, once again there was a unanimous vote for a voluntary levy until the statutory levy commenced. On 9 October 1991, the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia formally requested a statutory levy to begin from 1 July 1992. On 21 November 1991, the Deer Farmers Council of Tasmania advised the Minister of its withdrawal from the national organisation.

         Since then, there has been some conflict, a letter writing campaign and criticism. However, in recent days strong support for the proposal has emerged. For example, the Victorian Deer Farmers Association—I should mention Victoria has the largest number of deer breeders in Australia—at its meeting on 19 March passed a vote of 59 to two in favour of all levies. At an earlier time, in February 1991, at a special meeting of over 200 deer breeders there was also support for the proposal.

         On 20 March, Mr John Andrews, the President of the New South Wales Association, confirmed that the New South Wales industry supported the proposal and rejected comments by a junior vice-president of that association. The Australian Fallow Deer Society Inc. at the same time indicated that it had over 50 per cent of the national herd. It gave strong support in a letter of 19 March from its President, John Holder. On the same day, the Red Deer Society of Australia—the red deer is the second largest of three commercial deer varieties—also gave strong support. It made the point that on deer produce—on all the leviable products: venison, velvet and export livestock—it will be the largest contributor. Therefore, there is also demonstrated support. I believe that there has been stronger support for the proposal than has been the case with many other industries overall. Therefore, the proposal should be supported.

         I hope that the two problems I referred to earlier can be solved by negotiation and commonsense. The first of these problems concerns Tasmania, which comprises 8 per cent of the industry. Tasmania withdrew from the Association because it had been critical of the Deer Industry Development Group, which is a deer advisory body to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The point has been made by the Minister for Primary Industries in Tasmania, Mr Robin Gray, that the State feels it has adequate State development arrangements for the industry and there is a request to delay the Bill to allow time for more discussions.

         The industry does recognise that it has a challenge to bring the Tasmanians back into the fold. It was hoped that the Tasmanian deer farmers would be invited to the next annual general meeting of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia. The second problem mentioned in the correspondence and in the phone calls received concerned this potential problem of double charging or double levies, namely, a levy on the animal with regard to velvet and as a live export. I believe that this is a matter of misunderstanding and I ask the Minister to clarify the position about double levying. There should not be any duplication and I anticipate there is no need for such duplication. That would then remove one of the major criticisms apparent from some of the dissidents.

         The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has also made some interesting observations which I would like to now reflect on. Firstly, the Committee found that the inquiry into and reporting on these Bills was a difficult task as it received conflicting evidence on practically every major issue raised in evidence. Secondly, having considered the evidence presented to the inquiry, the Committee recognised that the Australian deer industry is an emerging industry which will benefit from the effective research and development programs in production, processing and marketing activities. Thirdly, the Committee considered that the five Bills referred to it by the Senate will encourage this approach.

         As was explained by Senator Brownhill, this legislation passed through the lower House with very little fuss and bother and very little extra attention. After that passage it reached this chamber with very little ceremony attached to it other than the statement that the levy was supported by the industry's representative body. Knowing as I did that the Tasmanian deer farmers may not necessarily be represented by that Federal body's claimed position, I took the trouble to contact a couple of known deer producers in Tasmania. My communication with them was greeted by surprise, because they had not known that this legislation would come before the chamber in such a time.

         It was not just a case of a couple of lonely deer breeders in the wilds of Tasmania not keeping up with what was going on in Canberra. As I soon became aware, after communication with other deer farmers throughout Australia, it was a case of a significant number of those who are involved in this fledgling industry being unaware of what was happening in their industry. In fact, on 17 March, I was sent in writing a communication under the heading of the New South Wales Deer Farmers Association. The final part of that communication reads:

        As Senator Tambling, in quoting from the Committee report, observed, the committee received conflicting evidence on practically every major question considered. The first of those questions was whether the members of the industry were aware of what was going on. The fact that they were not well informed is an indictment of the body which claimed to represent the deer industry.

         The result was that the deer farmers themselves were very rapidly informed—a process which perhaps should have taken place earlier because any body which asserts that it represents an industry certainly has a responsibility to effectively represent that industry. I consider that such a body must also have in place, at least, communication techniques, information gathering techniques, voting procedures and representation rules, administrative and financial records, plans for the future, processes of ratifying executive decisions, and the number of other procedures which throughout our democratic history have been established as appropriate for a body which purports to represent an industry.

         At the Committee's inquiry there was considerable doubt about the accuracy of the number of deer farmers in Australia, the deer numbers and even what proportion of deer farmers were members of the Deer Farmers Federation, one way or another.

In other words, to put it simply, the Deer Farmers Association is on notice: perform, communicate or else. That is a good thing. We can be pleased to have caused that to happen.

         This is another question which should be considered perhaps at another time. It is an important question, which goes to the heart of what has been taking place under this Government over the past years. It is admirable that this Government consults with industry representative bodies. But I think it is imperative that the Government also ensure that those bodies have the mandate of those whom they claim to represent and that that mandate has been acquired legitimately and in a manner which cannot be challenged. The mandate of this body was challenged. Having been challenged, the processes have been provoked to take place. That may be very good for the industry.

         The levies which were proposed were not opposed by a majority of the deer farmers of Australia. A very small number of those people who contacted me and of those people who I initiated contact with were opposed to levies per se. I do not think that they were able to justify that opposition in any way. The vast majority understood the purposes of levies and were quite happy to participate in discussions about what might be appropriate levies and how the receipt of those levies could be used.

         The discussion, misinformation and misunderstandings were related to how much the levy could and should be, and to what purposes the money raised by such levies could be used. As Senator Tambling pointed out, there needed to be clarification about such matters as to whether there would be double dipping or double charging applied to people who were paying a levy for the animals themselves and then the velvet produce, which only some deer farmers were concerned about. That clarification should have been achieved before this matter reached this chamber, not after. As I say, I think we have provoked the processes to take place so that it is possible in the future to clarify those things before rather than during.

         The other role of government is to ensure that what might at first appear to be the sensible thing and a reasonable path to follow does not act against the interests of the industry itself. I am reminded of the contrary point of view which is put against applying too high a levy in the initial sense. It is pretty obvious that our initial and most dangerous competitor in this industry is New Zealand, which has access to our markets under CER. Any levy which is applied in Australia should be applied with the knowledge of what levies apply in New Zealand. If we tax or levy our producers at a rate which is in excess of those in New Zealand, we are immediately placing them at a considerable disadvantage. All producers must be aware of that disadvantage.

         The Tasmanian industry was mentioned and it is a fact that its producers have unanimously, as a cohesive body, directed themselves towards meeting the New Zealand producers head on in terms of handling techniques, breeding techniques, production and marketing.

To be undermined by an industry wide levy placed at an inappropriate level is something which the Tasmanian producers, who have been at the forefront of this industry, do not deserve and it is most unfair.

We have been alerted through this process to those problems. I hope that the DFFA takes seriously my suggestion that that body is on notice to perform, communicate, consult and inform—or else.

The industry is so divided and there was so much divisiveness between the various parties in the evidence that was put before us. Like other speakers, I believe that we have to put the deer industry itself—not only the DFFA but also some of the other participants in the deer industry—on notice that it should not take for granted the fact that the Committee came down in favour of agreeing to the implementation of this levy and assume that it is there for ever and a day.

I will come to that particular aspect of the matter in a moment or two. The evidence was so conflicting that it really made a decision almost impossible.

         I found it incredible, as I am sure did other members of the Committee, that in terms of a levy of this nature and the amount involved, when the report was released and the heat was on, the phone did not stop ringing for three or four days with people seeking to put their views. I believe that the time to put information and evidence to a committee is prior to its hearings rather than afterwards. We did receive some useful information after the hearing. But one must say to the DFFA, the Tasmanian organisation or any other part of the industry involved in the processing or manufacturing of deer products that they need to make sure that they get the process right and put in submissions and information prior to the hearings. I put on notice that I will not be quite so tolerant to latecomers in the future.

         One of the things that tipped me in favour, though very marginally, towards supporting the Bills was the RIRDC report, which was given to us by the managing director, Mr Keith Hyde. I draw the Senate's attention to appendix 5 of the report. What concerned me greatly, and I questioned in depth the various proponents, was the apparent incestuous relationship that appeared to exist with respect to the presentation of the table spelling out how the funds were to be spent. In particular, I refer to the DFFA as the proponent of the levy on behalf of the industry. We found from the was presented to us that the DFFA could well be a major beneficiary of the levy.

If we go across the table, we see under the column for 1991-92 the figure of $46,850. For 1992-93, there is a figure of $10,000. The recipient of it is the DFFA and the Velvet Committee.

         I was most concerned about that table. It also lists items such as information systems for livestock and market, both domestic and international. For 1991-92 there is an amount of $10,000 and for 1992-93 it is $15,000. The recipient of this is the DFFA and Bob Coombs. As I am sure most honourable senators would know, Bob Coombs is the equivalent of the Executive Director to the DFFA.

         It was only after the hearing that I received a phone call from a Mr Peter McInnes, the Chairman of what is known as the DIDG Committee. This was when the industry was very disorganised. When he spoke to me, I raised the issue of whether the funds were truly going to research and development or whether they could well be siphoned off for the administrative purposes of running the DFFA and possibly even making a contribution to the salaries of some of the people employed there. Mr McInnes sent a paper to the Secretary of the Committee, Mr Neil Bessell, the last paragraph of which I will now read. It will now be on the public record for people to observe. It says:

At the very least, as my colleague Senator Panizza has suggested, from time to time there should be a referendum as to whether the industry wishes to continue with these types of levies. That in itself would increase enormously the communications back to the individual contributors.

         If these Bills have done nothing other than crystallise our minds on the compulsory raising of funds, they have been a good thing. I close my remarks by saying once again that the deer industry should not take it for granted that this legislation—now that we have agreed to it at the committee level, and it will pass through this Parliament—is there for ever and a day. The industry should take on notice that it is important that it gets its auditing and accounting processes in place. Those processes justify to the industry and this Parliament that the funds are being spent for the purposes for which they were intended.

         The Committee held a public hearing on Monday, 27 April 1992, inviting witnesses from the industry, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation to give evidence on proposals to collect levies and charges for research and development in the deer industry. There was a voluntary levy in the previous 12 months which, in accordance with evidence given, will raise about $60,000 as compared with $100,000 under a statutory levy. I suggest that is a fairly good effort by the deer farmers; it shows a fairly large degree of support for the industry from deer farmers as distinct from members of the Deer Farmers Federation of Australia.

         At the Committee hearing I raised the question of the use of that money in a positive and useful way. I am always concerned when organisations begin a new process or activity that a large amount of the money which is raised goes to executive salaries and no real work is done. I was informed by RIRDC that an amount of about $15,000 would go in administration costs from a total amount of $300,000. I think that is a reasonable amount.

I am sure I speak on behalf of the other members of the Committee when I say that we were all concerned about the divisiveness and the disunity within this emerging industry. At the public hearing I proposed—and the Committee agreed—that all the witnesses be brought together at the table so the Committee could explore whether there was any common ground on which it could base a recommendation on these Bills to the Senate. Unfortunately, this process of conciliation was not taken up by all participants. My offer to assist by chairing a meeting of the parties continues to stand.

         Where there is any concern or question in relation to the way in which the money is spent and its accountability, it would seem to me that that is an issue that has to be kept quite separate from the issue as to whether the levy should be raised.

         I rise to put the view of Western Australian deer farmers, as they have asked me to do. There is obviously a lot of conflict, as Senator Burns has pointed out. To date there has been voluntary funding for R&amp;D, which Senator Burns said amounted to $60,000, and this proposed mandatory research and development will raise about $100,000. I question whether it is worth the powder and shot anyway as obviously most of the difference of $40,000 will be used up in the collection process. But the Government has decided through this legislation to put R&amp;D on a mandatory basis and to move away from voluntary contributions.

         I move to the position in Western Australia as it has been put to me. The call for a compulsory levy came from a very small part of the industry in terms of numbers of stock run. I believe that the call has come too early, as the industry is still in its infancy and is still very small. There are only about 145,000 deer in Australia, and I believe we should have stayed with the voluntary arrangements for now. The voluntary arrangements and any other arrangements that have been in force should have been the way to go until the industry got a lot bigger.

         The Deer Farmers Federation of Australia, the DFFA, claims that it represents the majority of deer farmers. Well, operators in Western Australia dispute that assertion; it is similar to what is said in a lot of other agricultural commodity industries. They claim to represent the industry and they come here and ask for mandatory levies to fund research and development without going out to their members or the growers to ask them whether they want this to happen. Senator Crane mentioned this, and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in the other place often refers to this matter. If one wants a compulsory levy one should have a referendum among the growers, and not just consult an association that may have an axe to grind on the matter.

         I return to the position in Western Australia. The traditional farmers there claim that the call for a compulsory levy came from hobby farmers, and I believe that. I have seen a few deer being run on small hobby farms near Perth because it is the `in' thing to do. In time it may well grow into a big industry. The people who have spoken to me claim that only eight deer farmers in WA use their farms as a main source of income—in other words, 75 per cent of income. Of those eight farmers, only four agree with this proposal. Half the people in Western Australia who receive their main income from deer farming are against it. Therefore, it can hardly be said that the DFFA is representative of people's views. This really means that the hobby farmers, with their own peculiar sort of views—and I emphasise that they are not traditional farmers—are imposing their will not only on the rest of Western Australia but on the rest of Australia.

         What worries me is that there is no plan of action as to the way in which this money is going to be spent. When a compulsory levy is sought one presumes that a detailed plan will be presented including preliminary accounts of what is to be done with it. Senator Crane touched on this—most of the money could be going to the DFFA itself. At this stage it is probably only an accusation, but on behalf of the Western Australian deer farmers I would certainly like to know a bit more about that.

         As I said before, there are only about 145,000 deer in Australia at the moment. Of that number, one-third is breeding stock, one-third is for velvet and approximately one-third is for slaughter. This is a slaughter levy Bill, but when one works out how many grams of meat would be available throughout Australia, the amount is very small. If we are looking for exports through the R&amp;D program, where are we going to get them from? The 145,000 head that we have is hardly enough for use in Australia without looking for exports. Perhaps the deer industry will be a big industry in times to come but it is really in its infancy now.

         As I said before, this compulsory levy is way ahead of its time. Most of the deer farming in Australia at present is hobby farming, and I think it should remain that way. High prices have been paid for stock in Australia, mainly in the stud market. As with racehorses, cattle and merino sheep, the biggest money is made from stud for a while then, when the numbers build up, prices go down.

         The industry in Tasmania is only small but it has been very well organised and has been a very happy, tight little group. The membership is between 70 and 80—it was 72 as at 30 June 1991 when there were about 13,278 head of deer behind wire. It is well organised, soundly based and is already running a very sound operation. It has run its own levy system for some time and serviced its members very well. It has concentrated on developing the industry around filling particular niches. That is where it has had its disagreements with the Australian body and that is why it left and is no longer affiliated. The Australian body was going in a completely different direction—a direction that did not suit the Tasmania industry in any way.

         Having had these discussions, I have tried to come to conclusions about what is to be done. Clearly, there are advantages in having a national industry but not just for the sake of having a national industry. I started to look at the membership of these groups and I found that there are three categories of deer farmers, the same as there are in most other livestock operations. There is the investor group—the people who have the money and decide that deer is the thing to be in, and then go out and make a big investment. There are the hobbyists, the people who have a handful of deer—probably 10, 20, 30 or something—and they, too, believe that they will have a nice little backyard hobby. Thirdly, there are the genuine farmers who are in it as an ordinary business, as another livestock operation.

         It is the first two groups that have created the pressure here, as it usually is in these types of organisations.

One of the three great lies is: `I am from the Government and I am here to help you'. It is very much the case, I believe, with these types of organisations. The Government can help only if the industry is in good order and condition.

         In this case, not one person involved in the deer industry in Australia could say that the industry overall is in good order and condition. It is clearly not. There is, I think, a relatively low proportion of growers involved in the association. One of the States pulling out altogether demonstrates that the organisation is not as sound as it should be. I plead with the Minister not to race in to get this legislation enacted until we have these problems ironed out. That may be 12 or 18 months or two years away.

         A levy of $100,000 for 155,000 head of deer represents about 10 per cent of the value of the venison meat that is sold. It is necessary with a small, high-priced, high-value article to make sure that the niche marketing works properly. This is where the Tasmanian industry has done so well. It has worked on a niche market idea.

        The deer industry in Tasmania is in the critical stage of development and will not receive any benefit from the early years of levy payments unless funds are made available to the State to develop its own marketing strategy: a strategy which is being pursued with vigour and is supported by the Tasmanian Development Authority and the Department of Primary Industry, Fisheries and Energy.

        The Deer Farmers' Council of Tasmania does not support the direction the National body is taking because the bulk of the funds will be used to develop a generic National marketing scheme with emphasis on red deer. This will benefit importers of venison from New Zealand. It will not support the fallow deer industry, and hence, the industry in Tasmania.

        I would like that to be taken into account. It is important and I wish to see the deer industry prosper. I want the people who have put so much effort and energy into it to date to be able to make a further contribution towards it. However, my plea again is that it be taken very gently.

         —in reply—There are a number of points that should be responded to and I intend to do so rather quickly. The initial and basic point was that there could, in fact, be double charging involved in the operation of the framework of the legislation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) clarified last week that this would not be the case and that, if velvet has been levied under the Deer Velvet Levy Bill, then that velvet cannot be levied under the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill. Section 6(2) of the Deer Velvet Export Charge Bill specifically prevents this and that point should be placed on the record.

         The other point concerns whether the industry will be disadvantaged as opposed to the New Zealand industry. I am informed that that will not be so. Australia will not be disadvantaged by the levy levels as proposed.

         I would like to give some information on the third point which was made by Senator Panizza. His question basically was, why go to a compulsory levy when it would only collect $100,000 in 1992-93 as opposed to one that collects $60,000 in 1991-92? I am told that there are advantages in having a compulsory levy, not only in terms of the $100,000 that is involved, but also in that the compulsory levy arrangements, in one way or another, will provide $250,000 to $300,000 per annum for research and development in the industry. This is money which otherwise would not have flowed through.

         This is a result of the impact of two aspects. Firstly, the RIRDC will provide assistance to the industry of some $170,000 in 1992-93 for research and development. The other aspect is that compulsory levy arrangements will attract matching Commonwealth contributions of up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. Those are the three major points which needed to be responded to and I have done so quickly.

          —Before I call the first Department, in preparation for what was expected would be the commencement of the Committee of the Whole debate on the additional Appropriations last night, a statement was circulated in relation to the conduct of the Committee's deliberations into the Additional Estimates. That statement outlined a possible manner of dealing with Estimates committee reports and reservations to those reports. The statement has been referred to the President, requesting that it be considered by the Procedure Committee during the Budget session. It has no standing for the current Estimates committee proceedings, but does indicate what I see as some of the problems with proceedings of this nature.

The Committee feels strongly that consistency of approach in this matter would be desirable for the benefit of all senators and officials, and urges the Procedure Committee to address this matter.

If I quote to you, Mr Chairman, for instance, from the DITAC PPS notes I can turn to the back quite readily and say, `Appendix 1, Running Costs, details of variation not specifically allocated to programs'. That is what I understand by the term `non-portfolio specific issues'.

         Estimates Committee A considered the issue of costs in some detail. As Mr Templeton advised the Committee, the Department is currently negotiating revised printing costs for 1992-93 with the Australian Government Publishing Service. However, cost is not the only factor that the Department must take into account in considering its printing and distribution requirements. The other principal factor is the capacity of any alternative printer to produce the volume of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansards

         for Monday, 4 May. The Senate rose at 3.40 a.m. on Tuesday morning. The last camera-ready pages of the daily were supplied by DPRS to AGPS at 5.45 a.m. and the printed Senate

         —When Mr President is reviewing the costs of the printing, would he also take into consideration the development since the New South Wales Government Printing Office was effectively closed. In that case I believe there have been gross inefficiencies and a great increase in unacceptable errors. Also, commercial printers have been unable to deliver on time because of the nature of government work and the difficulty that the cheapest price in the printing industry does not necessarily guarantee the service that the Parliament requires because of the tight delivery timetables.

         Could Mr President make sure that he checks on the difficulties that have existed—for example, the problem with exam papers having errors and being behind time; having to be sent to South Australia, yet still having problems; and the escalating costs of the publications. I have some examples here, but I think it is sufficient to say that they are available. Any consideration should include a comprehensive analysis of what has happened in New South Wales where there has been a dramatic move to the private sector.

On one occasion the regulation concerning the granting of certificates to exempt particular documents being subject to FOI applications was disallowed by this chamber because there was a wish not to accept the report of the relevant committee. That report recommended that the period for which documents are held as confidential should be no greater than two years, whereas the regulations suggested placing an embargo for five years. The Government indicated that it accepts now that the present situation, where documents can be hidden away in perpetuity, is totally unacceptable and we expect to see a remake of the regulations in that area.

I was on a Senate committee which looked at the whole question.

         So Parliament has already endorsed the general principle that the minutes of Cabinet meetings ought not to be put on the public record for the very obvious reason that, if one wants to have the highest level of frankness between Ministers leading to the development of policy, those documents ought not to be released in a way which might jeopardise future frank discussions between Ministers.

         There is also the question of the availability of these documents to an appropriate committee. As I understand it, they were made available to the Public Accounts Committee, once again on the basis of confidentiality under the section of this Parliament's statute which regulates the way in which such material can be made available to that sort of committee. As I understand it, it was on the basis of that section applying that Dr Hewson agreed, as the current leader of the political party in office at the time of the Cabinet meeting under discussion, to give his concurrence to the material being made available.

         The situation is that the Cabinet office has acted, as far as is possible, in line with ordinary principles relating to the release of Cabinet documents.

As I understand it, the release to the Committee was made with the concurrence of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on that basis.

         In relation to the Cabinet material then tendered, I believe that Senator Bishop is correct in saying that whilst it was in the possession of the court it was public material. In other words, if the

          Australian

         had had a reporter in there, it could have been reported the next day. But the Cabinet material was subsequently returned by the court to the Cabinet office. I believe that that is the situation at the moment. In other words, they have resumed their status—I suppose that is the way to put it—as documents in the possession of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. I believe that therefore the normal rules apply rather than would apply were they still in the possession of the court, where I agree they had become public documents during that period.

         I should point out, for the sake of completeness, that on 5 June 1989, at a time before any Cabinet documents had been tendered in the proceedings, the Magistrate made an order allowing all parties to the proceedings to have access to the documents.

         The view the DPP took at the time was that the order admitting the documents into evidence overrode the condition attached to the earlier order and that, accordingly, the condition did not apply to the documents once they became exhibits.

       </para>
       <para>
        We may well do so. I wish to make the point that, contrary to what Senator Tate told us a few moments ago, the DPP took the view that, at the time the documents were tendered to become exhibits, the admitting of those documents eroded the condition attached to the earlier order and, accordingly, they became part of the public record.

         That is not what Senator Tate told us. He said that there simply was nobody there—that they were not quick enough, that they were incompetent, or something of that nature. That is simply not the case. The Director of Public Prosecutions has told us in this letter that he deliberately formed the view that that condition had been eroded and did not apply.

         He then alludes to what is quite clearly a heavying exercise by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet—that in fact the condition did continue to apply; that despite the fact that something is on the public record, it is somehow confidential and cannot be mentioned. What absolute nonsense. We are talking about the public interest here and the bureaucratic argument that the Department is continuing with is not in the public interest.

         As these documents have already been placed on the public record, and have become public, it is surely a nonsense to try to pretend that they somehow become private and confidential and can be hidden away and swept under the carpet. It is essential that these documents form part of the report that the Committee makes when it finally reports to the Senate, as it is required to do. Everybody needs to be properly informed as to the way the whole matter was conducted. I would ask the Minister to ensure that a serious reconsideration be given to this matter. Bureaucratic attitudes should not be considered and public interest should be the dominant force.

         Secondly, there is a longstanding practice observed by the leaders of all political parties in relation to Cabinet documents that they give their concurrence, subject to strict conditions, to the release of those public documents when asked to do so. As I understand it, in this case the general condition agreed to by Dr Hewson, for example, in allowing the release of the documents to the parliamentary Committee was the basis of confidentiality enshrined in the statutes relating to that Committee's operations. Thirdly, we would need to take into account the general policy evident behind the formulation by this Parliament of the Freedom of Information Act. We must be careful to keep in mind that general policy in relation to any particular matter.

         In other words, the honourable senator asked for this to be looked at in the light of public policy considerations. To be fair to officers, I think it has to be looked at in a very wide context. It certainly ought to be looked at in the context of this Parliament's own statutes which deal with the release of such information. I undertake to give serious consideration to those policy issues in the light of this specific instance and not wait for some general reconsideration of FOI principles. But clearly it would have to be taken in the context of this Parliament's express wish in relation to FOI principles.

         —My remarks relating to the freedom of information question are simply a reminder to the Government. I would be grateful if the Minister could convey the message to his colleague, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). Perhaps this will make him hurry up and re-make the regulations to effect the recommendation in the report regarding the highly unsatisfactory situation where certificates which preclude the release of information in perpetuity can be issued.

         I am anxious to see the committee's recommendation of a two-year limit followed. This is the desirable limit—certainly not five years as the original regulation provided. I also want to see some mechanism whereby someone who is a third party can also have the right to have a decision reviewed. That is quite aside from the question that I am addressing with regard to the specific documents that were tendered to the court and which became part of the public record.

         I think the matter that the Minister raised as a side issue of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) giving his concurrence, almost comes in the category of a red herring. I would be almost prepared to lay money on it that nobody told the Leader of the Opposition at the time that these documents had in fact been made part of the public record and tendered in court. I would be most interested to see any evidence to the contrary.

         On the second point, I think it is the most extraordinary argument that I have heard for a long time that documents that have become part of the public record can suddenly be reconverted into being private, confidential and protected by statutes from which they have already been exempted. I would have thought that the decision made by the court was the precedent that ought to be followed. I do, however, accept the Minister's undertaking to examine the need for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to reconsider its bureaucratic action in continuing to argue that the documents made available to us have been made available on a confidential-only basis. Presumably, the Minister is arguing that if the documents can be obtained from somewhere else, there is no problem. But we want it to be done correctly.

         On Saturday 9 November 1991, which was the second day of the World Women's Congress for a Healthy Planet, some of the things that were considered were, for example, raised by Ms Ellen Johnson from Equator Advisory Services, Liberia, who spoke about interdependence or dependency, trade, debt and aid relations between nations and regions. Rosalie Bertrell of the International Institute of Concern for Public Health, Canada, talked about ethical considerations of nuclear power and weapons and other threats to public health and the environment. I am not saying that these are not important issues, but what is the particular significance of this to women as opposed to all people?

         —I will hazard an answer. I imagine, as Senator O'Chee would know, that matters of reproductive concern can be related to particular environmental conditions and hazards. For example, exposure to lead and the controversy that surrounds it would not be of concern to a male in his prime of life, but would be of concern to a pregnant woman. In other words, given a particular environmental context, there are health related matters of particular concern to women.

         In relation to the particular matters that Senator O'Chee has put forward, I do not know about the scope of the papers that were presented under those titles. But it is also quite clear, for example in relation to trade and debt, that if a country under IMF direction is required to cut down on certain public expenditures as a way of rehabilitating itself in the world trading community—and as we know that is quite often a condition of IMF intervention and assistance—that might also affect services, whether they be related to health or whether they be literacy programs for women or education. All these matters might affect women. It may also be that more specifically related environmental improvement programs which would otherwise be undertaken by the governments might not be undertaken. I guess that would be a consequence which would impact on women, sometimes in the specific ways that I have described. That is just a broad answer.

         I just want to pick up something that the Minister said in relation to pregnancy. Goodness gracious me, I think men might be just as easily susceptible to various environmental factors relating to reproduction, which could equally be the subject of a conference, but they are not. I would have thought that there would have been a view. I certainly heard a view expressed by one of the Minister's colleagues from New South Wales in a panel discussion at which I was present today. He said that pregnancy and having children was a matter of joint responsibility and concern to the man and woman. On the basis of what Senator Tate's parliamentary colleague said, clearly there does not seem to be terribly much substance in Senator Tate's answer that it might have something to do with reproduction.

There are obviously many hundreds of papers delivered at these conferences, each of which might have a title which would be a good subject for a press release. It might be more helpful if I ask the officer concerned to meet with Senator O'Chee and perhaps provide copies of any particular papers that were delivered that are of particular interest to Senator O'Chee. It is nevertheless evident that women may have an interest and general concern in environmental degradation. By that I did not want to imply that women are the only ones interested, for example, in the health of the next generation because they are mothers. That would be trivialising the point I am trying to make. Nevertheless, there may be instances where environmental degradation is more of a health concern and relates more specifically to women than it does to men.

There used to be a bias in expecting that. But it is now a well-known fact that it is often the male's problem. Senator O'Chee's point is very strong: these matters are of relevance and importance to all people. This artificial segregation of matters—the establishment of an expensive bureaucracy, lots of overseas trips, seminars, lunches and other such junkets—really is a waste of money.

Sustaining lower inflation is something we are entitled to speak about—we have done it. When the Opposition was in government, it was not able to do that, and it will not be able to do it again. The Opposition's Fightback package is a recipe for increased inflation at a time when we are trying to introduce some discipline and rigour into the wages system in this country.

         The lowering of interest rates reflects importantly the progress that has been made in reducing inflation and inflationary expectations in Australia. Progress on inflation means that lower interest rates are sustainable. CPI inflation is now down to 1.7 per cent, which is below the latest average annual inflation rate of 2.5 per cent for our OECD trading partners. The underlying rate, excluding volatile and seasonal factors, is now down to about 3 per cent. This is the lowest underlying rate since the index was first calculated in 1971.

         The reason interest rates are back down to the levels of the 1970s is that inflation is now back to well below the levels of the 1970s, and this Government intends to keep them there. When I talk about the levels of the 1970s, I am excluding the last period of Liberal Party government when the inflation rates were in double digit figures, unemployment rates were in double digit figures and interest rates were further above that.

         The Government's CPI forecast for 1992-93 is now 2 1/2 per cent compared with a figure of 3 1/2 per cent published in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement in February. I think the only threat to that is the introduction of an industrial relations policy of the kind which Opposition senators seem to be advocating now—the so-called big bang industry policy which, I assure the Opposition, will produce big bang wages policies and be a threat to inflation and, of course, to interest rates.

         The measures announced in the One Nation statement, together with the cumulative effects of the successive easing of monetary policy, are helping to drive the recovery and to secure it. The Government expects today's reduction in cash rates to be passed on promptly by the banking system. I must say as Industry Minister that I am particularly concerned that these reductions be passed on to small and medium sized business borrowers, many of whom are still paying relatively high overdraft rates. Banks and their business customers should seek to use cheaper financing through bills in order to take full advantage of the lower interest rate structure.

         The Government also expects the reduced cash rates to be reflected in reduced rates for existing home mortgages as well as for people who obtain new mortgages. Hopefully, they will be reflected in credit card interest rates, which have not fallen in line with the reductions in other interest rates since 1990. Lower rates for housing and credit cards do not just benefit the consumers. The resultant increase in disposable income has a generally good effect in the economy in increasing demand and contributing to the recovery of the business sector.

         The police received a letter with the jar of baby food warning that five babies will die as retribution for the acquittal of Los Angeles police involved in the Rodney King case—unbelievable! At this time, there is no evidence that items removed from supermarket shelves in the course of this recall have been contaminated. Consumers in Western Australia have been advised not to use any baby food products in glass jars purchased since Thursday, 30 April, and either to return the products to the point of sale or to dispose of them.

         The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, of course, is liaising with the National Food Authority and Heinz officials to determine that appropriate action is being taken by the company to protect consumers from the potentially serious hazards—and, of course, as I say, Heinz has cooperated in the withdrawal of those product lines from Western Australia. The National Food Authority, having responsibility for food safety, is coordinating that particular recall.

Was the AOTC corporate plan presented to and discussed by the Caucus committee on transport and communications earlier this week? Will the Minister comment on claims that the implementation of the business and industry plan of AOTC will lead to the loss of 20,000 jobs over the next five years, 5,000 of those jobs to be axed almost immediately? I further ask the Minister whether, despite the undertakings given by his predecessor, Mr Beazley, that AOTC's manufacturing division would be expanded, AOTC plans to sell its manufacturing division at the cost of some 12,000 jobs. What happened to the promises made by Mr Beazley on behalf of the Government that more Australian product would be used in the expansion of telecommunications? I also ask whether it is AOTC's intention to cut staff in connection services despite recent price increases to consumers, which are disguised as price restructuring and for which the justification used is labour costs?

I think Mr Blount explained to the Caucus that AOTC will be most sensitive in rural areas. In many country towns, there are small depots with one to 10 people who are particularly important to those rural communities. That is where AOTC will be most sensitive. The first priority will be to try to redeploy within the organisation. Even if people are not doing the same task, they will still have a job within the organisation. After that, there will undoubtedly be some redundancies. We will try hardest in rural communities to maintain staff numbers because the viability of many towns is dependent upon, in many cases, AOTC's presence.

         A lot of people write about industrial relations. Industrial relations is a distinct discipline. It ought to be treated within the parameters of that discipline. I am not saying that economists, lawyers and social scientists should not have something to say about industrial relations, but it is important to remember that ultra-dry economists dealing with industrial relations have fundamental problems. Ultra-dry economists have a fundamental problem in dealing with industrial relations because they do not understand human behaviour and human aspirations. They are unable to answer the subjective question that is central to industrial relations: what is fair? They have economic theory. In their case, if real life does not imitate theory, real life is out of step and theory is right, people should change to conform with theory. That is the first error that Dr Wood committed in his article.

         The other errors Dr Wood committed are that he supports the New Zealand industrial relations model; he is prejudiced about trade unions; and he has a lopsided view of the facts in the APPM dispute. Even though he criticises APPM for letting down the Right of the political spectrum in Australia for being too fascist in its behaviour, that is because in real life even APPM does not conform with his theory.

         There are two other key parts to what Dr Wood has said. Firstly, he supports the Liberal industrial relations policy to bypass trade unions and scrap the Industrial Relations Commission. Secondly, he condemns the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom, for not conforming to theory. In the first part, Dr Wood asks this rhetorical question that John Howard has constantly asked: what is wrong with an employer dealing directly with an employee? He asks what can possibly be wrong with that. Anyone who watches the top rating ABC television program
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Investigators

         But if we want to ask whether there can be fair dealing, let us consider power shares and the balance of negotiating shares in this situation. On one side is the right to hire, fire, promote, demote, transfer direct and control access in part to training and all the resources to conduct negotiation. On the other side is someone who needs a job, who may have some skill to market and who has limited resources to bargain. That is why people join trade unions. The industrial relations system exists in order to referee the behaviour of both sides to get an outcome which is good and fair. That applies to unions if they monster small employers as well as applying to employers who might monster small workers.

         I now turn to the Ray Groom question. Ray Groom has apparently committed the sin of saying that he recognises there is a role for trade unions; that APPM should come to the table, sit down and talk to them to settle the dispute; that the ACTU President, Mr Martin Ferguson, is a man of principle; that the H.R. Nicholls Society should butt out of the issue in Tasmania; and that politicians driven by ideology do not succeed in politics. They are apparently the mistakes of Ray Groom. That is why Dr Wood has turned his guns on Mr Groom.

         Dr Wood has criticised Mr Groom for not being intellectually gifted because he does not understand the Wood theory of economics. He thinks that Mr Groom should back the dry economic theorists in Dr Hewson and Mr Howard so that life can imitate theory. Even though Mr Groom is the elected Premier of Tasmania trying to manage a situation of great complexity and difficulty there, Dr Wood thinks that he should line up behind the ultra-dry conservative industrial relations policies of the Opposition.

         I conclude this answer by saying that just this week Dr Hewson, no doubt ably abetted and supported by Mr Howard, delivered a body blow to Tasmania in causing the rejection of the resource security Bill in this chamber. Dr Wood is asking that Ray Groom do to industrial relations what the Opposition has done here to resource security: destroy the industrial relations system. It is about time that the theorists got off their theoretical wavelength and joined real life, and it is about time Dr Hewson and Mr Howard actually came out and endorsed the Liberal Premier of Tasmania and his industrial relations policies and enabled him to resolve the issues that exist within that State. I hope they come out and say, `We support Ray Groom'.

Gee, I'll get into trouble for doing this'. I thought, `This will be terrible. I will be in all sorts of strife'.

It is the case that Burmese authorities are still adhering to a cease-fire against the Karen forces near the Thai-Burma border. The assessment we make is one of taking only very cautious encouragement from these announcements. The crucial thing will be whether there is within the next few weeks some serious move towards actually establishing the working conference based on the elected members at the recent election in order to see whether there is some discernible process towards putting in train a democratic reformation.

We still have very much within our sights the possibility of some kinds of economic sanctions if international response can be mobilised to that effect.

I have been extremely active on this issue, including in China as recently as three weeks or so ago, making a very strong pitch to both Premier Li Peng and, more particularly, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen about the role and responsibilities of China in relation to Burma, describing the country in the process as one run by an ugly regime in a situation that was manifestly at that stage getting uglier with each passing week, and with the situation being created where it appeared that China was the country's only remaining international friend as well as being a substantial supplier of arms that were being used by the Burmese regime against its own people. Whether it is in any way coincidental that a week or so after that we see the course of events that are happening in Burma, I do not know. I cannot judge that.

         But the kind of representation that I was making to clearly what is one of the key influential countries so far as Burma is concerned is the kind of representation that is being made and has been made in recent months by a number of other countries that share our concern. Sometimes pressure is best applied not so much through the more public vehicles that might attract more obvious notoriety but through back room diplomacy and representations of that kind. We are not in any way reducing the pressure. We are not in any way applauding what has happened. So far as we know, there are still nearly 2,000 political prisoners in custody and an absolutely appalling track record. It will take a lot more to change the reputation of that regime.

This means that superannuants earning an identical income to age pensioners are much worse off because they have to pay income tax and also do not qualify for any pensioner fringe benefits. I ask the Minister: firstly, does the Government stand by that taxation commitment; and secondly, given that the Government is hoping to introduce compulsory superannuation for all members of the work force, will the Government ensure that all retirees pay the same amount of taxation irrespective of the source of their income?

         We are still trying to put together a detailed picture of what happened over the last couple of days in Kompong Thom. Obviously there was a significant breach of the cease-fire by the Khmer Rouge. But current indications are that the number of troops involved in the fighting was smaller than first reported. The Secretary-General's representative, Mr Akashi, said in New York last evening Australian time that the fighting was not on a major scale. Lieutenant-Colonel Ayling, the commander of the Australian force communications unit, said on ABC radio in a direct interview just a couple of hours ago that nothing had happened which will endanger the forward momentum of the peace process—and that does seem to reflect the general view that is prevailing now in Phnom Penh, although the incident is being taken seriously.

         Kompong Thom has always been one of the most volatile areas in Cambodia. A further outbreak of military action, although we had all hoped otherwise, was not totally unexpected. That is especially so in the context of the deadline that is getting very close for the announcement, as Lieutenant-Colonel Ayling said, of the phase two aspect of the peace process—that is to say, the introduction of a verified cease-fire as compared with the presently unverified one—and the commencement of the process of cantonment and disarmament.

         There is no doubt that the Khmer Rouge have again been misbehaving in Kompong Thom and that they deserve censure on this occasion as previously. But there are a couple of further points to be made. The first is that discussions are taking place right now, as I understand it, with senior Khmer Rouge leadership in Phnom Penh in an attempt to find a lasting solution to the problem in Kompong Thom province. The problems relating to that are a mixture, going among other things to problems with the chain of leadership authority in the NADK, the Khmer Rouge army; problems with the apparent inability of the commanders or the military liaison people on the spot to make detailed decisions of a prompt and effective kind; and also problems associated with the degree of indiscipline by the local Khmer Rouge commanders. Again, the Supreme National Council at its meeting scheduled for tomorrow will, I am told, be considering the situation in Kompong Thom as a major agenda item.

         The other point to be made is that the deployment of the whole UN peacekeeping operation is still only in its very early stages and that the dynamics of the imposition of UN authority, the confidence building that goes with that, and the respect for the settlement process that will, we believe, go with that, will not really be able to be fully established until we are further down the deployment track.

         As I have stressed on many occasions on behalf of the Government, it is vitally important that the deployment of all the UN personnel, that is the nearly 16,000 troops plus the 5,000 or 6,000 other civilian personnel that will eventually be required, needs to be completed as soon as possible; in particular, the deployment needed to implement the process of cantonment and demobilisation of the 200,000 or so troops that are involved in that process—not half a million, the figure that was used again on ABC radio this morning. We therefore welcome the announcement made yesterday our time by Mr Akashi that UN troops originally intended to be transported by sea will now be airlifted to Cambodia and that, by this means, the UN intends to increase the current number of 4,000 troops in Cambodia to a total of 11,450 by 2 June.

         It is in this context of an accelerated deployment, and also in the context of the inability of the UN to quickly get access to the logistics expertise it needs to accomplish that deployment, that Australia positively responded to the urgent request that we received from the UN a few days ago to provide an interim movement control unit to assist in that deployment process, the subject of the announcement by Senator Ray in Parliament yesterday. I repeat Senator Ray's advice, that the 30 personnel concerned will be required by the UN for a period of just four months; it is not a permanent deployment. It is a deployment in order to accelerate the process of implementing troops on the ground.

        PRESS BRIEFING BY SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR CAMBODIA

        At a press briefing at Headquarters this afternoon, Yasushi Akashi, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Cambodia, provided correspondents with an update on recent events regarding implementation of the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr Akashi said he had travelled to Phnom Penh on 15 March, when deployment of UNTAC had begun, and had been accompanied by almost all senior officials, as well as the Force Commander, Lieutenant-General John M. Sanderson of Australia. Since then, a solid United Nations presence had been established in all domains.

        The first progress report on the Authority, which was not due until 1 June, would be sent by the Secretary-General to the Security Council in the next day or two, he continued. The report was being sent to the Council in advance of its due date in light of substantial developments, such as the Secretary-General's visit to Cambodia, from 18 to 20 April.

         The UNTAC was not a peace-keeping operation in the narrow sense of the term; it was a multidimensional and complex operation involving peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-building, Mr Akashi said. The Authority would comprise a civil administration component, in which it had oversight and control functions over the four factions; human rights oversight responsibilities, in view of tragic past events in Cambodia; a component charge with the maintenance of law and order, in view of such factors as insecurity and banditry; and a component charged with the repatriation of refugees.

         Mr Akashi went on to say that he had been present, along with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, when the repatriation of refugees from the Thai border commenced on 30 March. Subsequently, repatriation had been suspended for the Cambodian New Year and later resumed. It would be an "uphill task" to complete the return of some 370,000 refugees by the target date of the end of December, but that target had not been changed. He said the Secretary-General had, while in Cambodia, issued an international appeal for the rehabilitation of that country, whose physical infrastructure had been almost completely destroyed over the past two decades. The aggregate amount of rehabilitation assistance required for Cambodia was $593 million, including $160 million for the refugee component.

         The UNTAC was not only the largest United Nations peace-keeping operation in history, it was also uniquely multidimensional, he continued. The Authority was responsible for organising democratic and fair elections, which were scheduled to take place in April or early May of next year. Despite certain delays in the deployment of both military and civilian elements, Mr Akashi said he was confident that elections would be held in the anticipated time-frame.

         It would be necessary to accelerate the deployment of various troops as well as civilians in order to adhere to the target of beginning phase II of the cease-fire—the "verified cease-fire"—by 1 June, he continued. Many troops which were originally intended to be transported by sea would be airlifted in order to meet that deadline. In June, the rainy season would begin and would considerably hinder UNTAC's movements. For that reason, deployment of the Authority's major elements should take place by the end of May, in order to verify the cease-fire and start the cantonment and demobilisation of up to 70 per cent of troops of the four factions, numbering some 200,000. The Secretary-General's original proposal for 52 cantonment sites had been revised to 55.

         There had been intermittent fighting in the north-central province of Kompong Thom, where troops of the four factions were mingled, he went on. The Authority had largely succeeded in restoring the cease-fire and disengaging the factional troops from each other through deployment of two companies of an Indonesian battalion to Kompong Thom. Mr Akashi said he had received a telephone report this morning that fighting had resumed in that province, adding that he did not think fighting was on a "major scale".

         The United Nations presence had had a reassuring impact on the population as a whole, he said. The UNTAC had established a good working relationship with the Supreme National Council (SNC) and its head, Prince Sihanouk, who had been responsible, dynamic and helpful. Following close consultations with Prince Sihanouk, it was decided that the Authority would largely propose the agenda of meetings of SNC. A recent proposal had been draft electoral laws, which were currently being discussed.

         The Authority had also proposed a new mechanism to investigate human rights violations and take corrective action if necessary, as authorised by the Paris Accords of 23 October 1991. A hotline had been established connecting the Special Representative, the Force Commander and representatives of the four factions. Another proposal, which had been accepted, was the establishment of subsidiary bodies of SNC, called technical advisory committees, to address the details of issues such as rehabilitation assistance and refugee repatriation.

That development had been welcome, but the Authority would not be satisfied until it had unconditional access at all times to all areas.

Other units were on their way. Approximately 200 civilian police had been deployed. The civilian police target was 3,600. The Authority sought full deployment of 15,600 troops by June.

         To a question on contributions, Mr Akashi said Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said she had received pledges of $60 million for the repatriation effort. Towards the end of June, there would be a conference in Tokyo on Cambodian recovery, which would be co-chaired by the Japanese Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, and William H. Draper III, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Mr Akashi said he and Prince Sihanouk would attend the opening session of the meeting, which would be held at the ministerial level. Organisers were "pretty confident" that the conference would identify adequate financial support for Cambodian rehabilitation needs. Much work remained to be done. The Asian Development Bank last week took an important positive decision in Hong Kong with regard to aiding Cambodia, he added.

         Mr Akashi said he hoped that, in a week or two, it would be possible to publish the report of the recent mission on the economic and financial situation in Cambodia, which would contain recommendations on how to cope with over-expenditure and lack of revenues in the Government. That had been an inter-agency mission, involving UNDP, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Such coordination was of the utmost importance.

         The views of several Member States had been taken into account and had resulted in the reduction of the number of computers required for the elections process, he said. The Authority sought to be as economical as possible, but in order to be credible, a minimum presence was required. Hardly any physical infrastructure existed in Cambodia, the roads were in bad shape, bridges had been destroyed and airports were badly damaged. The Authority's engineering units were repairing and sometimes constructing the country's infrastructure. The budget, which might have seemed large, was not, in view of those needs. The per capita income of Cambodians was estimated to be $100 per year, which was half that of Viet Nam and less than one tenth that of Thailand.

         In response to another question, Mr Akashi said the visit to China by SNC representatives had not impeded work. He had been in touch with Prince Sihanouk by fax at the time. China had been very helpful in inviting SNC members to Beijing, and had dealt with the four factions in an even-handed manner, demonstrating its will for the implementation of the Paris Accords. The trip had not been a waste of time; press criticisms of it had been too harsh.

        The reason for moving this urgency motion in the Senate today is that the most efficient and productive method of getting work done in Australia is under threat. That method is the current contract system. It is under threat because a company known as Troubleshooters, which had initiative or what is commonly known as get-up-and-go, established a contract system that would improve the output of the work force in this country, and the efficiency and productivity of many industries; put more profit into business; and, most importantly, increase the take-home pay of individuals.

Their position is already protected in law through the Trade Practices Act. Secondly, it is protected by the individuals themselves who do not have to enter into a contract. The proposals have wide reaching ramifications for industry. They will lead to lower productivity and huge increases in cost, and will be damaging to the Australian economy.

         The current contract system has stood the test of time in almost every industry one can mention, the most notable being the housing or cottage industry, agriculture, mining, transport and, of course, a myriad of others. The current system allows individuals to actually assess a task by using their initiative and wit and then get on with doing the job as quickly and as efficiently as possible. It allows them to maximise their skills and increase their capacity to increase their own income. It has served Australia well and will continue to do so providing that the Government, the unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission keep out of the way. If the system is changed, as the Minister advocates, it will increase disputation, remove flexibility and interfere with the rights of individuals to freely determine how they are going to operate.

         The Minister consistently runs the line that change is necessary because of sham contractors. The fact is that we now have a sham Minister who is an apologist for certain elements in the trade union movement in this country, in particular the Building Workers Industrial Union. The evidence shows quite clearly that the instructions to change the current contract system have come about as a result of the Troubleshooters case which was heard before Justice Woodward of the Federal Court, then the full bench of the Federal Court and, finally, the High Court of Australia.

         Following the High Court decision on 7 June 1991, just 11 months ago, the Minister—or, should I say, the apologist for the trade union movement—described the law as an ass. Not only does he not accept the decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when they do not suit him, but he is now moving to undermine the decisions of the Federal Court and the High Court of this country because their decisions do not suit his union masters and their hidden agenda, which is to increase union membership and union domination at the expense of a proven system of efficiency and productivity.

         To prove this point I quote from a letter of 4 May 1990 by Tom McDonald, the National Secretary of the Builders Workers Industrial Union. In that letter, amongst other things, Mr McDonald stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Past experience shows that where workers work as self-employed subcontractors, it is impossible to effectively unionise or organise those workers. That is why the New Right is pushing the self-employed subcontract arrangements.

        Mr McDonald further stated:

       <para>
        I quote from a letter from Mr Vince Raffa, Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the BWIU, which was sent to every member of the union. The letter stated two things. It stated firstly that, because of the union's loss in courts and subsequent damages paid to Troubleshooters, each and every member was to be levied to pay. Secondly, and more importantly, Mr Raffa stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to pass legislation making Troubleshooters Available type arrangements illegal by changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act.

        It is interesting to note that at least the Victorian Branch of the BWIU knew about this some two months before it was announced publicly.

       <para>
        This is the true agenda of what the proposed legislation is about and the attempts to destroy the current contracting system. Almost every industry has rejected the decision to bring contractors under the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Are their opinions to be ignored?

         The Minister has released a paper entitled,`Legislation Concerning the Independent Contractors'.

I quote legal advice from Gallons Crowley and Chamberlain. Terry Chamberlain stated:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The proposed changes are very broad in scope, much broader in fact than Senator Cook has stated publicly. They are in no way limited to sham sub-contractors or to agreements that are harsh or unfair. Certainly they would cover the housing industry, despite the Senator's assurance.

        I quote further from the same document. Under the heading `Union Membership' it states:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        An independent contractor is by definition an independent businessman and entitled to employ others in the conduct of his business. Properly he should be represented by an employer association such as the HIA but lodgement of union membership for such a contractor is weak, although the motive is clear, that is, to extend union domain. However, in terms of representation, such a move would establish the subcontractor as a schizophrenic represented by and yet a potential supplicant to an adversary of union and union demands.

        This decision of the Government to interfere with the very efficient and productive system that operates in this country has far reaching ramifications. It is best summarised by Mr Geoff Wedgwood, Housing Industry Association economist, who said:

         This is a fundamental test not only of the Minister to put Australia's efficiency and productivity first—and I might add, the Government's—but also of the Democrats to determine whether they wish to see building costs, housing costs, mining costs and farming costs go up; in fact, the full spectrum of all costs going up in this country and our being left less competitive—and, I might add, with disputation going up. It will have ramifications for every household because it will put enormous pressure on inflation and, of course, on almost every product and service they require.

         —I was quite interested in Senator Crane's proposal that he wants unions and governments to get out of the way. He wants to put that proposal into effect to give free rein to shonky subcontractors to deny workers justice and a real future in an important industry in this country. Press releases issued by the Master Builders Association on 1 April included figures that were totally incorrect. Neither that organisation nor the Housing Industry Association contacted the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) about the Government's proposals and consequently they have got things dead wrong.

         The fact is that no genuine contractor or employer using contactors will be affected by this proposal. Housing costs will not soar, as is claimed by those organisations. We are not touching the present arrangements in the industry relating to genuine subcontractors. The legislation is aimed solely at sham contractors; people who call themselves contractors and work as employees for lower pay or without basic rights such as annual leave, sick leave, superannuation and occupational health and safety considerations. We propose that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have regard to relevant customs and practices in a dispute over independent contractors and ensure that their use is not harsh or unfair.

         The proposed subcontracting legislation is not an attack on the existing contracting system in any industry. There is no agenda from the trade union movement or the Labor Government to attack the legitimate contracting system already operating, as it has for some years. The proposed legislation is designed to eliminate specific, obnoxious defects in the contract system in many industries, particularly clothing where tax rorts and the abuse of outworkers is notorious. These defects are exploited unscrupulously by bad operators who threaten the position of legitimate and honest business. The urgency motion can be read only as an attempt to promote and expand these obnoxious defects in their current form.

         We have heard the comment that there are situations that already provide for this. I will give some examples—some case histories. A worker was employed by company W from November 1991 through to and including 11 March 1992. He was told that his status during this period of employment was that of a legitimate subcontractor and he was paid $20 per hour. A prescribed payments system of taxation was applied. Upon lodging the complaint, he indicated that at no time did he want to work under this system. The company had told him that unless he worked by this method there was no employment for him.

         That is conscription; employers forcing people to work under these sorts of conditions. The union approached the company in April 1992 and reached the following agreement: that all BUS and BERT contributions for his period of employment would be paid; the company would also pay the award provisions that the member did not receive—$1,000 in travelling time and fares, $1,500 pro rata annual leave, $640 for statutory holidays and rostered days off, a total of $6,000 in four months. That is what the worker was denied.

         In another case person B was employed from 22 March 1988 to mid-1992—a longer period. He was paid and taxed under the prescribed payments system. During his period of employment he received no annual leave, no award allowances, no BUS or BERT—BERT being the Building Employees Retirement Trust—contributions and no other entitlements as per the award. The union approached the company in April 1992. A discussion with regard to taxation took place on site between a union official and person B. This is important—this is these honest contractors. Person B informed the official that during the four years that he had been employed by this company, and taxation had been deducted under the PPS, the employer had not forwarded any of these payments to the Australian Taxation Office. So much for these wonderfully honest and thoughtful people to whom Senator Crane referred. They are trying to introduce and maintain a system which exploits workers.

         The union immediately stopped all work on the project and sat down to negotiations with the company. At the end of the negotiations, the following agreement was reached: the company would pay all outstanding taxation contributions which should have been paid—a sum of $46,500 which it had nobbled the Taxation Office for to that stage. In addition, it signed a statutory declaration saying that it accepted all liabilities for any fines and penalties placed upon person B. That indemnified person B against any prosecution by the Australian Taxation Office for the company's wrongdoing.

         In addition, the company would pay the member a sum of $15,000 for those award entitlements he did not receive during his period of employment. The hourly rate received by this person over the employment period fluctuated between $14 per hour and $20 per hour. They are just two examples and there are others. For instance, in Queensland there is an agreement called the resilient floor layers agreement. It covers rates of pay for carpet layers and resilient floor layers. Person C was working under award rates of pay during his period of employment with two companies. This person was employed for some time by both companies and towards the end of the employment was elevated to the status of supervisor.

         In short, the person was never paid in accordance with the agreement. He was also forced to provide his own accommodation and transportation when sent into country areas. He did not receive BUS or BERT contributions or any other entitlements that would have applied under the award. The union placed bans and limitations to get the employer to the negotiating table. So much for these agreements and the subcontractors who will do wonderfully well out of them. Employers have to be forced to comply with payments through industrial disputes that nobody wants. The final result was that the sum of $15,000 was agreed between the parties to be paid to the worker after some deductions had been made.

         An important point for the Australian Democrats to consider is that the genuine subcontractors who will benefit from the provisions of this legislation are small business people.

That road leads to huge delays and massive costs. It is no answer. There is no effective redress under the Commonwealth jurisdiction.

         The important relationship in the industry is between the client and the main contractor, between the contractor and the subcontractors and between employer and employees. This is a long term relationship and it promises to be more productive than has been the case in the past. It is about the production process—productivity improvements, total quality management and training—so that we can equate with the clever country. I have been in the trade union movement a long time and I do not know of any subcontractors—subcontractors of the type that Senator Crane seeks to defend—who have ever trained anybody in the industry; if they did, it was probably for a couple of days to do a particular job so that they could make a larger profit.

         A simple way of looking at issues such as this is to use a question and answer process. We may ask the question: will the legislation change the nature of the contracting system? The answer is no, because those working as genuine independent contractors or subcontractors will still get paid on results, for example, per item, per metre, et cetera, as against an employee who is paid on a time basis. This means that the incentive for productivity will not change.

         —Senator Macdonald interjected to say that not all contractors were sham contractors. I respond to that by agreeing with him and suggesting that not all contractors are lilywhite. I agree with any of the some 400 letters that I have received on this subject. I read to the Senate part of the second paragraph of one such letter, although any number of builders and subcontractors have written to tell me the same:

        The existing sub-contracting tradition in the building industry is not in any way a "sham", but represents a very important, efficient and productive sector of the industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree with that, as would Senator Macdonald, with the addition of two words at the front so that it reads, `Most of the existing subcontracting tradition in the building industry is not in any way a sham'. The trouble with the original motion proposed by Senator Crane is that it is an absolute. It has in it the definite article `the' meaning the subcontracting industry in total is a wonderful thing. I can assure him—and I can assure the Senate—that it certainly is not. In making that assurance I will say that the housing industry is characterised by a most efficient and effective system which has grown up in a tradition of `That's the way to do it'. It has become most effective.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Some of the reasons for the growth of that tradition are related to the geography of the industry. The very fact that the sites of operation are by definition temporary and located away from each other has meant that individual methods—in other words, independent methods—have grown up to suit the site and location of the enterprise and the individual needs of the owner. Because of that, we have had the development over many decades of what is now in most cases—that is what I am emphasising, `most cases'—a very efficient and productive aspect of Australian industry.

         However, not all housing industry participants are lilywhite and not all of those engaged in subcontracting are pure in their business practices. Through the very diversity that I am speaking about—through its geography—the housing industry obviously provides opportunities for unprincipled operators to exploit those who work as contractors. That is as much a result of the size of the industry as well. I must say that the overwhelming majority of traditional operators in the housing industry are efficient in their endeavours and honourable in their commercial and industrial undertakings.

         may be able to correct us. The position I had reached was to add some degree of personal experience in this industry, having been directly involved in a number of building projects over a number of years as an employee, owner builder and, coincidentally, right at this very moment, an owner who has engaged a builder who in turn engages subcontractors. All of those subcontractors are thoroughly and efficiently supervised by my wife. She probably knows more about the practicality and the reality of this business than some of the others who might purport to contribute to this debate. Things are going very well indeed.

         I also speak in this debate as a recipient—one who has been on the receiving end—of what I now know was an unfair contract. It was an employment contract under which, some years ago, I was able to derive the princely sum of $2 an hour to service and maintain a fleet of cars for a hire car firm. Senator Kemp may be surprised to learn that the rate at that time was a very attractive rate, although that was some 20 years ago. Even though it seemed attractive, it did not include sick leave or leave of any description, overtime or any other award benefits.

          At the time, I was too ignorant to realise what I was setting aside. I did learn very quickly what it was that I had set aside when a car axle fell on my leg. It was simple: I did not get any more money; I did not work any more.

         After that incident I learned that the contract was harsh and unfair and it had taken advantage of my ignorance. I did not know, therefore, I did not have any real choice. The word `choice' has already been used in this debate. Senator Crane has suggested, and he would suggest now, that I may have had recourse to the Trade Practices Act. In my ignorance, I remained exploited. No organisations, no body in particular, made it their business to safeguard my interests. I suggest that there remain many other examples of the situation which I suffered at that time. I do not think that in the 20 years since that experience that we have been able to resolve that particular situation.

         I have an example here—and this is well documented—of a situation which occurred in 1985. TNT, the transport company, sold a truck to a person and kept the registration in the name of TNT. The company, TNT, decided on the amount of the monthly repayments, made arbitrary deductions from the person's earnings and gave him less and less subcontract work. The truck had been sold on the basis that subcontract work would be made available exclusively to the new truck owner. Once that person was unable to keep up the repayments, guess what? TNT repossessed the vehicle. The contract, of course, was labelled, and found to be, unfair.

If he thinks the contract of sale in this case was divorced from the actual work situation that the person found himself in then, regardless of Senator Crane's wisdom, the fact is that the negotiations and the contract remained unfair and harsh. Somebody was taken advantage of without having recourse to being defended or represented by somebody who knew the situation. The example I gave of myself was one that grew out of my own ignorance. When one is on one's own there is very little opportunity to do anything about one's ignorance.

I was very much taken by Senator Burns's moving and passionate speech in which he talked about harsh and unfair treatment of workers and genuine contractors or employers not being affected by the proposal of the Government. He said that the legislation is aimed solely at sham contractors. That sounded familiar to me. In fact, it sounded rather like a press release that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) put out on, of all days, April Fools' Day, 1 April 1992.

If there is a dispute about the contract terms—and it talks about the erection of a frame for a house or the laying of bricks for a house—instead of that dispute between a contractor and a subcontractor going to a court, it will go to the Industrial Relations Commission. Notwithstanding that the dispute may be about whether the frame was erected in the right place or the bricks were laid in the right fashion, instead of going to a court of law for the dispute to be determined because it is a contract, it will be sent to the Industrial Relations Commission.

They do not have the courage to say that or to come before the Senate and say, `We will stand by Senator Cook and sink or swim with him'. They want to appear as if they are interested in getting something, but will still go over and stand with Senator Cook, anyway. That is why we feel that the amendment moved by the Democrats is wholly unsatisfactory.

         Let us get down to the real crux of this debate or the real unconscionability of what this Government wants to do. For example, a person who is an independent contractor is probably a member of the Housing Industry Association. But if the Government has its way, that person will be forced to be a union member. Quite simply, if a person is a subcontractor, eventually they will be required to become a union member. But it will turn that person into a paranoid schizophrenic, because on one side they will be a member of the HIA and on the other side a member of the Building Workers Industrial Union. Which hat will they put on? It will certainly not be a hard hat because they will be too busy shuffling between the HIA hat and the union hat. They will not even know where to find the hard hat, because the Government is being hard on all the people in this country who want to go out and determine their terms of employment for themselves.

         What is so wrong with people having freedom of choice as to how and when they work? What is so offensive to individual liberty about that? Nothing at all, but it offends the sensibilities of Minister Cook and his cronies on the other side of the chamber, who are dreadfully afraid of what it would do to their mates in the union movement. The bottom line is that most Australian workers are heartily sick and tired of the men in suits in the Industrial Relations Commission determining for them how, where and when they will work. If real economic reform is to be achieved in this economy and in making this nation more productive, the only way to do so is by putting the decision making power in the hands of the employers and employees.

         The problem is that the Government is so dreadfully afraid of workers being able to determine for themselves how they are going to work. It is so dreadfully afraid that the people who were once kept as minions of the union movement will suddenly have some say or choice in their lives that it has brought in this heinous legislation to take away the rights of those people. I say to Senator Giles, Senator Burns and some of their socialist friends on the other side of the chamber—the revolution is coming, comrades!

I ask the Government senators sitting opposite: what is wrong with the Federal Court? What is wrong with the High Court? What is wrong with the highest court in the land determining the rights of employers and employees? Instead of having the High Court of Australia, the highest judicial body in this country, Senator Cook and the Government would give us the Clayton's court, the Industrial Relations Commission—and a poor parody of the High Court that is indeed. The Government does not want to have judicial determination. It wants to have determination by the Industrial Relations Commission.

I do have some regrets in relation to Senator Crane and the fact that he has produced for us this afternoon such a pathetic matter for an urgency motion. Such an otherwise moderate and charming person seems to have somewhat of an obsession with industrial relations and, particularly, our Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). I do not want to sound offensive, but I do say that if Senator Crane were somebody close to me I would be suggesting that he seek treatment. We have an excellent Minister with enormous commitment to fairness and equity. This is not surprising as a result of his own industrial experience over very many years.

         Those of us who have dealt with good and bad employers and have a considerable amount of experience in the field know that legislation of the nature that is being proposed is absolutely necessary. There are many examples of workers who are not employees in the strict legal sense but who are in an extremely vulnerable position with minimal bargaining power. We should not have to explain to those opposite who those workers are and in which industries they work, but they do tend to be people without formal skills and with very little bargaining power: the young, women who have returned to the work force perhaps or those who are in industries that are under stress at the moment. Those opposite must, if they are to be fair, admit that there are many cases where unscrupulous employers have sought to avoid award decisions. Those of us who worked in the industrial system dealt with them every day of our lives.

         The Government's policies are aimed at ensuring that such workers are protected from unfair practices. That protection would come in through the award system, not via the Trade Practices Act or any other piece of legislation which, to the vast majority of workers, are totally arcane. Even to a person of the education, sophistication and skills of Senator Bell, I would suggest that the last protection he would have thought of achieving would be through Acts which are not directly in the minds of the majority of people associated with industrial issues.

Of course, the Opposition raises, as one would expect, the bogie of this legislation compulsorily requiring all workers to become unionised. That is absolutely not so. If those opposite read the material with which they have been provided, they will find that allowing independent contractors to join a federally registered union is not novel. Some independent contractors may do so now. In addition, a union will not be able to seek among independent contractors a wider class of members than it may seek amongst employees under existing law.

If that is what Senator Crane is saying, there will be a change. If, as we believe, and as Senator Burns has already said, the large majority of subcontracting within the housing industry is genuine—

         The first case concerns the clothing industry and involves the creation of a limited partnership between 22 former employees and a particular trust company. The agreement appeared to be a sham—sorry, spurious—with the evidence casting a real doubt about whether the relationship of master and servant had been destroyed. The agreement, which was not registered under State law, provided that management decisions relating to the control of persons manufacturing garments were not exercised by the so-called ex-employees, the workers.

         Each of the ex-employees was paid a weekly amount equivalent to the wage mentioned in the award, which was said to be drawings on anticipated profits—a spurious approach. The provisions for expulsion from the partnership were similar to the right to terminate employment. So in every respect these people were working under conditions similar to those that would be in their awards, but they were forced into accepting all the other disadvantages that come with not being designated as employees. The decision in this case was that all partners and associate corporate entities were ordered to carry out all terms and conditions of the award—unlike the situation that poor Senator Bell was subjected to, with a lack of sick leave, annual leave and all the rest of it.

This is just one example out of probably hundreds of thousands of workers. She said, `Because the items were quite complex and the prices low I had to work reasonably hard to make up reasonable wages'. At 50c a nightdress, one can just imagine. She was required to have a business name. In the Industrial Commission she was awarded underpayments of $12,852.

They bought the franchise and were paid a monthly fee of $3,360.50. In other words, they worked for nearly six months without being paid. Their work was subject to continuous detailed supervision by the man who sold them the franchise agreement. On that count alone they certainly were not genuine entrepreneurs.

An excavation company was a subcontractor on seven sites around Sydney using a pool of workers on an on-call basis. Workers were subjected to exploitation including a very low wage rate, no workers' compensation, no superannuation, no redundancy coverage and no issue of tax receipts. The company often employed workers with no previous on-site experience, thus increasing occupational health and safety risks. We would say that it was a complete disaster in industrial and occupational safety terms. The Building Workers Industrial Union was asked to intervene on behalf of the workers. A total of $70,000 was recovered on behalf of members of the BWIU.

So I say, as Senator Giles leaves the chamber, we know exactly what her Government's policies produce. We do not have to speculate about the future. Labor policies produce falling living standards and high and growing levels of unemployment. They are policies which have led to the devastation of industry around this country and have prevented major project after major project getting off the ground.

         I found Senator Bell's remarks particularly interesting. Senator Bell comes from a party which was essentially established to assist small business. The historical origins of the Australian Democrats draw very heavily on small business and the small business orientation created by their founder, former Senator Don Chipp, and they were continually endorsed until recent times by previous leaders of the Australian Democrats and previous spokespersons for the industrial relations area.

         One of the major thrusts of the policies of the Australian Democrats up to about 1987—in recent years it has become extremely equivocal—was to encourage workers in their rights to reach individual agreements with their employers. It is not surprising that the massive protest meeting held in the Collingwood Town Hall this week to protest against this Bill that Senator Cook is proposing—who do honourable senators think was chairing the meeting?—was chaired by former Senator Don Chipp. If he has tuned in today and reads very carefully the Democrats' amendment to attempt to restrict the particular ambit of this urgency motion, I think that he, like many people out there in the community, will be sorry that, when put to the test, the Australian Democrats of today have again supported big unions. Senator Kernot will be tested in the next week or so on this particular issue. We will see the way that Senator Kernot comes down on compulsory superannuation.

         This is the troubling question: why is it in this country that we have to have an all-powerful trade union movement—one that, I think, in the eyes of many workers and those in the community, seems to be more interested in trying to run this country than in trying to protect the real interests and living standards of the ordinary Australian worker? This Bill is part of this particular thrust to try to entrench all powerful unionism in this country while other countries are moving away from these types of arrangements. That is precisely what it is doing.

         We see this in so many areas: the Government's attack on the AIRC; the compulsory superannuation levy; the Government's Bill to force amalgamations of trade unions against the wishes of many workers; and the Government's current attack on independent contractors. What does this pattern mean?  It means essentially that this Government is moving as fast and as hard as it can to try to entrench the power and privilege of the ACTU movement in this country. I believe that, after nine years of hard Labor, of falling living standards, of mounting unemployment, that particular approach to running this country has dramatically failed.

When the Troubleshooters case first emerged in the courts—remember that Troubleshooters have been around for quite a long period of time; this touches on what Senator Giles was saying as to whether independent contractors, as Senator Giles would have us believe, cut the living standards and the conditions of Australian workers—this is what an independent arbitrator, Mr Justice Woodward, said in the judgment on that case.

        I am satisfied from the evidence—particularly that of the men themselves—that workers who seek jobs through Troubleshooters, do so because it suits them to work in this way, rather than to obtain continuing employment with a builder.

        We have had allegations from Labor Party senators—I hope that Senator Cooney will not follow this line—that the independent contractor approach, the approach of free men and women to contract with their employers, automatically leads to a cut in wages, salaries and award conditions. On all the evidence, it does not. I am delighted that Senator Cook has at last come into the chamber. In many cases those who are working on the basis of an independent contract find that they are able to enjoy higher wages and salaries compared with those who are working under award conditions.

         I suggest that this is the real background to Senator Cook's proposal. The background is that the independent contractors are showing that this country, the free men and women in it, can well survive without the Bill Keltys of this world and the ACTU constantly poking their noses into their arrangements. That is why Bill Kelty and the ACTU are worried about this. It poses a major threat to trade unionism in this country, particularly unionism of the nature that has been developed in the last 10 years under Bill Kelty, the ACTU and this Labor Government.

I can assure Senator Cook that if he wants to pick a fight with small business in this country, he has chosen the wrong ground. The men and women of this country will not stand for the proposal which Senator Cook has brought before this chamber.

         I suppose we come down to a difference of philosophy in this argument. It seems to me extraordinary that it is said—I am sure that Senator Cook would not agree with this; but it seems that the Opposition does—that where one side to an arrangement unilaterally adjusts the wages, that is consistent with the sorts of propositions that are being advanced that there should be exchanges on footings of equality between two parties, both of whom want that agreement.

         How can Senator Parer possibly say that they have sat down and agreed upon wages when one party simply fixes the wage and says, `Take it or leave it'? That is the proposition Senator Parer is putting forward. Senator Parer has supported the proposition in the Troubleshooters case, as has Senator Crane. They are very eminent senators on the other side who  no doubt represent the position of the coalition on this matter. What is meant in the coalition's policy by agreement between workers and employers is where one side states what it will get and the other side takes it. That proposition appears from the very case that has led to the debate on this issue. The judges continue:

        noted as well that the written contract between the Troubleshooters and its workers set out above did not include the whole of the terms of engagement because it contained no reference to the wet weather allowance, the six hours minimum pay or overtime provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear from that, certainly as far as the written agreements were concerned, that there was no attempt to set out in writing what was happening so that the worker could ascertain what was happening. Another part of the judgment, which has been put forward as gospel in this area, states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        However, the agreement that Troubleshooters are not to receive annual leave or sick leave or any payment referable to those entitlements and that no deduction of income tax is to be made from their remuneration signifies a mutual intention that they are not to be regarded as employees.

         The interesting thing is that this agreement has been put as the way forward.

         When you look at that case, it takes on a different aspect to that which has been thrown on to it so far by those opposite. The other thing that ought to be said about that case is that it turned upon whether the people involved were either employees or subcontractors. The High Court would not have a full hearing on it because it said there were not points that required a decision on that issue. As Senator Crane would know, because he follows this closely, those subcontractors were doing exactly the same work as those who were employees.

         Contract labour can lead to some terrible difficulties. People take on an improper attitude which leads, as Senator Crane would know, to some very bad problems, as has arisen at the Camperdown abattoirs. Unfortunately, in that case a person was employed through a firm of solicitors, Kroger and Kroger, on behalf of FamiCorp to provoke workers into a course of conduct that might have led to action similar to that at Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets.

         I will begin with the last speaker, Senator Cooney. If he has done nothing else in his contribution—and he has done a lot more than that—he has confirmed what I said initially, which is that this proposed legislation in terms of the attack on our current contract system is really about the Troubleshooters case. Senator Cooney confirmed that quite clearly and highlighted a number of aspects with regard to that. For that I thank him. It is quite different from the position that has been put to us by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in the material that has been released, where he has consistently said that it is about sham contracts.

         Regardless of what those opposite say about Troubleshooters, its activity has been confirmed as being legal in the true sense of the word through Justice Woodward and then through the full bench of the Federal Court. The appeal that went to the High Court was disallowed because there was not sufficient evidence or reason for it to continue. In its analysis of the case the High Court confirmed what Justice Woodward and the full bench of the Federal Court had said.

         I want to deal with a number of aspects of the debate here today. The first relates to Senator Bell's amendment. It is rather sad that Senator Bell should put forward such an amendment because it is designed entirely to neuter or destroy the motion. In fact, I would question whether it really is an amendment. It borders very closely on being the opposite of the motion. Madam Acting Deputy President, perhaps you could rule on that at some future time, because I believe the amendment does not reflect the intent of the motion. As I understand it, amendments are not supposed to alter the meaning of a motion. This one certainly does.

         I return to some of my original comments on what this matter is about. If this proposed legislation were designed to catch sham contractors without having any impact on anyone else and did not affect the full spectrum of contracting that is operating in Australia, which has stood the test of time, then one could consider it very seriously. But that is not the situation. Senator Cooney has drawn that out quite clearly. It is also drawn out in the proposed amendments released by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) concerning independent contractors. It has been drawn out not by me but by legal opinion, some of which I quoted in my opening comments.

         I will reiterate some of the points I made earlier. The proposed changes are very broad in scope, much broader than Senator Cook has stated publicly. They are in no way limited to sham subcontractors or to agreements that are harsh or unfair. Certainly they would cover the housing industry. The letter I have from Gallens Crowley &amp; Chamberlain states:
        </tab>

        Disputes about Independent Contractors
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the proposal, the definition of industrial dispute is to be amended to encompass disputes extending beyond the limits of any one state about the use or proposed use of independent contractors instead of employees to perform work.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Further it says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under this definition, the jurisdiction of the AIRC is virtually limitless with regard to independent contractors. There is no quarantine for any particular industry or any particular subject of dispute.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For example, a union might lodge a log of claims disputing an employer's use of independent contractors. This would constitute an industrial dispute.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister knows full well, probably better than most in this place, how one goes about bringing on a dispute; he knows how it has been done in the past. Of course, under the proposals that have been publicly put out, it will be easy to bring on a dispute. Furthermore, that action in itself will virtually destroy the contracting system as we know it. Once again I emphasise that this is not my opinion, but that of Mr Terry Chamberlain of Gallens Crowley &amp; Chamberlain.

         We reach the crux of this matter when we question why we need changes to legislation. There needs to be a purpose if the legislation is to be changed.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The existing Act regulates the relationship between employers and employees.

        A person is therefore an employee or an independent contractor as a matter of fact regardless of how he is described.

         Senator Cooney put clearly to the Senate the position in regard to the Troubleshooters case. The other point that needs to be made is that the legislation is about extending union membership and union control. It is about picking up the flagging union membership which has quietly decreased over recent years. That also is a matter of fact. It is not a figment of my imagination or a matter of emotion, as one or two of the speakers have suggested.

         I wish to sum up my remarks by saying that the contract system has served this country extremely well. It has been an integral part of the Australian scene for the past 200 years. It has been a very important part of the development of this nation. It has been a very important part of the housing and cottage industry. It is probably the most important part of the transport industry.

         We have been informed that the labour component in building a house amounts to 25 per cent or thereabouts. What has been forgotten in the debate is the oncosts in the housing industry, such as the transport costs involved in getting material on site. Then there are the contract arrangements which exist in many parts of our timber industry for processing the timber, and a whole host of other matters. They have to be added into the total impact of building a house or whatever it might be. It is not just a case of breaking down individual aspects of what is being done.

         If this amendment is passed, it will be a sad day for this nation—sad for its productivity, growth, opportunity and freedom of choice in terms of what people wish to do with their time and how they earn their money. It will also be a sad day for businesses because it will reduce their profit and their ability to employ. And it will be a sad day for those people involved in the contracting industry, because the net result will be that they have less disposable income in their pockets. For that reason, I urge Senator Bell to think very carefully about his amendment and to withdraw it. I do not believe that it is a correct amendment because Australia will be worse off if we have the type of interference that is proposed in our current contract system.

         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         This report on the administration of fringe benefits tax by the Australian Taxation Office is yet another in a series of Auditor-General's reports concerning the Australian Taxation Office which have been presented to the Senate. Each one of them has been very critical of the way in which the Australian Taxation Office has been conducting its own affairs. Yesterday, when I spoke on the Auditor-General's report into consultants, I made the point that the Taxation Office seeks to apply the most stringent standards to individual taxpayers; yet, as we are starting to see with the successive tabling of these reports, the Australian Taxation Office has failed to keep its own house in order. I also said yesterday that these were most timely reports as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is presently conducting an investigation into the Australian Taxation Office.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          When one looks at this particular report, which is an efficiency audit—and very lengthy, with a lot of material in it—one sees that it is a report that will, I believe, be commented on again and again. As all honourable senators would realise, when reports are tabled in this fashion we only have an hour and a half's notice to look at them. It is regrettable with a detailed report such as this one that we could not have a more lengthy opportunity to go through its 61 recommendations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One thing that concerns me is that the recommendations seem absolutely sensible in the way they are phrased, yet many of the responses from the Taxation Office appear to be in the nature of `We know better'. For example, recommendation No. 50 reads as follows:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the ATO consider establishing two specialist FBT audit teams in each branch office in order to achieve a high standard of performance in the conduct of FBT audits and to provide the coverage necessary to ensure compliance under self assessment.
        </para>
        <para>
         The response is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This recommendation is not accepted.
        </para>
        <para>
         As I flick through the report, I find other instances where the response is that the recommendation not be accepted. I find that rather a concern. There is no reason given in the response. It seems to be simply saying, `We know better'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the other hand, there are recommendations, such as those concerning penalties and refunds, to which the response is more detailed. For example, recommendation No. 33 reads as follows:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the ATO:

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">

         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         (c)give consideration to modifying the FBT system to provide, as a regular statistic, the accumulated values on a branch office basis of potential or recommended penalty prints generated by the system and the accumulated value of penalties actually imposed.
        </para>
        <para>
         The response is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the ATO undertakes to re-issue the revised policy and the FBT penalty guidelines to all FBT processing sections and to reiterate the importance of consistency in the application of penalties throughout all branch offices. Consideration will also be given to modifying the FBT system to report potential penalties as compared to penalties actually imposed.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General again seems to be pointing out the need for a system within the Taxation Office whereby provision is made to ensure that penalties are administered in a fair and equal manner across the various branch offices. Indeed, in the Estimates hearings, when we were dealing with such things as prosecutions and the manner in which penalties are applied for other tax infringements, we found that there is no centralised database which would enable the Taxation Office to have an even standard so taxpayers would feel that they are getting fair treatment from it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I do not think that anybody would be surprised to know that the Taxation Office is the least popular of all the government agencies and that it is making a real effort to soften its image by talking about its taxpayers as clients, being a friendlier organisation and generally trying to soften the edges. But at the end of the day the Taxation Office has the power to administer very harsh penalties, and what is worrying is that we are seeing more and more evidence that the manner in which taxpayers are treated is not necessarily equal.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Again, I would highlight the distinction between the way in which the Tax Office has treated parliamentarians from the different sides of politics. Mr Keating, the Labor Party man, the now Prime Minister but then Treasurer, failed to lodge his tax return. What happened? He simply got a nice note saying, `Please put it in', whereas other taxpayers, ordinary Australians without any connections, have been prosecuted and penalised. That is the only Labor Party example we have on the record.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          On the other hand, we have the case of Mr Smiles who has an apportionment dispute with the Tax Office. He employed someone who had two functions: one was private and one was cost incurred for the production of assessable income. There is a dispute with the Tax Office as to the manner in which that is apportioned. The normal way that that is treated is by discussions and settlement and, if there is to be a prosecution, it is brought under the Tax Administration Act.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I have asked the Tax Office to find me any other example at all of a prosecution for apportionment that has been brought under the Crimes Act, which is the decision that has been taken with regard to Mr Smiles. To say it is extraordinary that the Tax Office has chosen to prosecute Mr Smiles under the Crimes Act is to make the understatement of the year. The reason appears to be quite political, in that if he is prosecuted under the Crimes Act, his seat in the Parliament is placed in jeopardy and that could give an advantage to the Labor Party. If he were prosecuted under the Tax Administration Act, as is the perfectly normal practice, there would be no such jeopardy at all; he would be treated like any other taxpayer.

          It is most important that we know how things are gone through, in other words, the process. A fashionable argument that did the rounds for a while—it came out of the public sector—said that we should not be concerned with process, we should only be concerned with outcomes. I said on that occasion that I believed that that was an impossible situation and it must be rejected. The fact of the matter is, if the process is corrupt then so is the outcome.

          We have to ensure, and with the help of the Auditor-General perhaps we can start to find some answers, that we find a way in which the Minister is responsible for the efficiency, inefficiency, corruption or otherwise that goes on in his or her department. Quite clearly, during the period that many of these and other reports that we have seen cover, the current Prime Minister—the unelected Prime Minister—was the Treasurer of the day. He must be held responsible for what happened in that Tax Office during the period that he was the Treasurer.

           I know we went through a series of something like five Treasurers in a quick period of time, nonetheless, under the Westminster system we must hold the Ministers accountable for what is occurring in their departments. Simply to say that they were uninformed or did not bother to inform themselves will not do, because under our system of government accountability of the executive arm of government to the Parliament is essential.

          —by leave—The report of the Automotive Industry Authority on the state of the automotive industry in 1991 is one of a series of documents that we have tabled on an annual basis. They are published by the Automotive Industry Authority year by year under its charter of reporting on the developments that have occurred in the automotive industry in the previous 12 months under the so-called Button plan.

          In the report tabled today there is both good news and bad news for the Australian automotive industry. Among the good news is the indication that exports of Australian produced motor vehicles and components have increased over the past 12 months. More importantly, exports now consist in the main of completely built-up motor vehicles, engines and a wider range of components to markets in the United States, Europe and Japan, whereas earlier, the exports consisted mainly of completely knocked down vehicle packs to New Zealand and engines to Europe. It is pleasing to see the way in which the automotive industry is meeting the challenge to increase its penetration of export markets with both a wider range and volume of products.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          One of the pieces of bad news is that in 1991—and, indeed, since 1989—the prices of locally manufactured motor vehicles have, on average, risen faster than comparable imported vehicles. This still indicates that greater efficiencies are required in the production of motor vehicles in Australia so that their prices can become more competitive with those imported vehicles. The report says that the task for the industry in the years ahead is to avoid price increases above those of imported cars, while matching their specification levels, and that if the industry cannot achieve these objectives, it will continue to lose market share.

          A challenge is laid down for the industry that it needs to become more cost competitive while further developing and maintaining the improvement which has been evident in the quality of cars produced in Australia. The quality of Australian produced motor vehicles is the next issue raised in this report. Again, this is an element of good news in the report, because the research undertaken by the Automotive Industry Authority indicates that the quality gap between locally manufactured cars and comparable imports has narrowed significantly. Credit should be given to the industry for achieving that over the past 12 months.

          Among the bad news is evidence that indicates that labour productivity in the vehicle assembly sector of the industry remains about half that of United States producers and only one-third of that of Japanese producers—the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is in the chamber listening to my remarks—and obviously that area needs continuing attention so that labour productivity is improved.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is the responsibility not only of workers but also of management in the automotive industry to develop working systems within the industry which will allow a significant improvement in labour productivity. Among those requirements is not only the way in which managers manage their labour force within the industry but also the need for greatly increased investment in the industry to introduce high technology production of automotive components and vehicles within Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In the Australian context, it will only be possible for the Australian industry to reach the required levels of productivity if we embark on the high technology road of motor vehicle production. Therefore, increased investment in that area is absolutely essential. What is advocated in this report is what is termed the lean approach to motor vehicle manufacturing and the goal of lean production. That is spelt out in some detail in this report.

         Since the hearing conducted by the Estimates Committee into this matter on 27 March, I have had a response to one of the questions I asked which was taken on notice at the time. That question concerned whether the letter that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote recently to the Premiers and Chief Ministers confirming the Government's view that the national income tax sharing scheme proposed by the States to the Commonwealth in early December last year—whether the view expressed by the former Prime Minister that it was a matter that the Commonwealth could not agree to—could be made public. I have since had a response to that question on notice to the effect that it could not be made public because it was a matter of normal communication between the Commonwealth and the States.

         I have to express considerable regret at receiving that answer. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, can comment further on it. It is a matter of very considerable importance. The whole question of Commonwealth-State relations seems to be in utter turmoil at the moment. There is a Premiers Conference next week and I am not sure if anyone outside the inner club—or even the inner club itself—knows what will be on the agenda for that conference. My particular concern is that there are very conflicting reports as to whether the issue of Commonwealth-State financial relations will be pursued at all during next week's conference.

         —There are some things which have come out through the press that the conference will deal with. It seems to be common knowledge that the question of the TAFE funding arrangements will be discussed. The point I am trying to make is that the Premiers have said publicly—individually and collectively—that unless there is appropriate consideration of the financial relationship and imbalance that exists between the Commonwealth and the States, all the other areas of micro-economic reform which are said to underpin the whole of the Government's One Nation statement will be impossible, from their point of view, to achieve.

         I think what we are talking about now is a matter of very great significance. It certainly ought to be of great significance to the Government because the Government is on notice from the Premiers—including Labor Premiers in particular—and State Ministers that unless the Commonwealth discusses in a meaningful way the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, it may as well take its bat home so far as the micro-economic reform proposals that it has trumpeted about in the One Nation statement are concerned.

If Senator McMullan does not wish to comment on that, obviously I cannot force him to do so, but I think it is a matter of very significant importance, and one which I would have thought the Government would wish to provide some comment to the Senate on.

I want to put on the record that, since the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was a backbencher in October, put his oar in on Commonwealth-State relations in the form of his infamous speech to the National Press Club on that subject, it is quite obvious that the whole process of cooperation and constructive consideration of the most fundamental issues of Commonwealth-State relations has fallen in an almighty heap.

         The process which appeared to be going along happily and constructively in the area of cooperative federalism and a proper dialogue between the Commonwealth and the States, has quite obviously fallen into total disrepair.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We had the extraordinary statement in the Estimates Committee hearings in March that the Commonwealth-State secretariat within the Prime Minister's own Department had not had any meetings at all to consider Commonwealth-State relations with the States since the aborted Special Premiers Conference that was due to be held in early December. It appears that there has been precious little consultation or discussion with the States since then.

         From what Senator McMullan has said, there has been one meeting of officials since then. We had a second one today to deal with the preparations for a conference that the States, at least, believe is of vital importance to the future of the Commonwealth-State relationship debate; a conference that I would think is indisputably important for the future of the federal Government's One Nation proposals, because the essence of the Government's economic approach is said to be micro-economic reform.

         Minuscule as those proposals are, they will be absolutely non-existent without the cooperation of the States. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, through his actions over recent months but stemming back to last October, has set back the cause of meaningful reform of Commonwealth-State relations and, in particular, the reform of the financial relationship, which is the sine qua non, if I may use a Latin term, for any proper, serious reform of Commonwealth-State relations. That has gone right on to the back burner. Indeed, it has more than gone on to the back burner. The Prime Minister and his Government have quite arrogantly ruled out of court any of the major proposals that the Premiers and the Chief Ministers put to the Commonwealth late last year.

I put on the record again that I am absolutely amazed that the Government seems to be in such a state of disarray only five days—three working days—before such a major Premiers Conference.

That is currently not the case and is not perceived to be the case in future. Therefore, it is unlikely that some guideline would be presented that would narrow the methodologies in use to one or even to a predetermined small number. I think an intelligent approach to such inquiries is to choose methodologies that suit the problem with which one is confronted. My advice is that that is what the Resource Assessment Commission intends to continue to do. On the face of it, it seems like what one would expect it to continue to do.

         —Mr Chairman, the problem with the answer that the Parliamentary Secretary has given is very simple. At the Estimates hearing it was patently obvious that we had different methodologies between an interim report on the south east forests and the draft and final reports of the forest and timber inquiry. It was made very clear, and I thought it was acknowledged by the officers of the Resource Assessment Commission who dealt with the questions I put to them—I note that one of them at least is here this evening—that it could lead to very misleading perceptions being drawn of the reports which the Resource Assessment Commission was making.

         The question I put is: notwithstanding the fact that the Resource Assessment Commission may wish to experiment with different methodologies from time to time, has the Resource Assessment Commission given any consideration in the intervening period to some consistency as between one report and another so that we can achieve a comparison of the different methodologies? If we use one methodology alone—for example, shadow prices of timber logs—then the great danger is that we cannot compare that particular interim report with another interim report or with a more extensive report. It makes the work of the Resource Assessment Commission somewhat wasted because, unless we can draw these comparisons between one report and another, we really do not know what the reports are saying.

I just take this opportunity to stress—and I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to answer this—that we will be taking a very close look at the operations of the Resource Assessment Commission, particularly with a view to methodology, when we come around to the Budget estimates.

         —In view of what I have said to Senator O'Chee already, if we erred on any matter it was on the side of conservatism. In trying to arrive at an appropriate figure, the problem was to identify a single value to cover vehicles expected to compete over a wide price and model range, dependent on age and the cost to importers of getting vehicles to a condition where they could be sold in Australia. It was also necessary to take account of the fact that the penalty duty may have to remain in effect for a number of years, so we set the rate in regard to that.

         In arriving at the actual figure, the Department reviewed the range of retail used-car prices for comparable vehicles between 1983 and 1991. It used Mazdas, for example, which are available in a very wide range of models priced between $6,250 for some 1983 models to $21,000 for some 1991 models. The penalty duty of $12,000 is, in our view, inherently conservative, given that the importer's costs could be between $5,000 and $7,000 per vehicle, resulting in a minimum retail price of $17,000 to $19,000.

         As I said earlier, it is essential to view the $12,000 in the more general context rather than in relation to the Taiyo situation alone. A number of other companies indicated their interest in this matter. The basic policy consideration is that the Industry Commission, having determined a regime of appropriate protection for the automotive industry after a full inquiry, set a tariff which would phase down to 15 per cent in the year 2000. That was done taking into account a number of factors. It puts considerable pressure on the industry.

I do not think there is any magic in the methodology. I just hope that we have not been too conservative.

         —I would like to follow up on that. The answer of the Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has amazed me. He said that we want to keep second-hand cars out of Australia—full stop. I thought that a certain amount of competition was the essence of trade in Australia. Some time ago we had an influx of cars and engines. Australian importers started to bring cars in wholesale and they sold very well. The motor traders realised this problem and I suppose advised the Government. We had the non-tariff barrier of the ADRs. Of course, if we put ADRs against imported Japanese cars, the Japanese cars would have a big advantage because they drive on the same side of the road as us, as opposed to German cars or Italian cars. The Government, with pressure from the motor trade and manufacturers, went with the ADR. The Government expected the importers to go away—and most of them did. The odd company did not go away but came back to meet the ADRs, and they are back again.

         That is why the Government came in with the $12,000. Senator Button has explained that the Government had no particular rationale for the $12,000. He then amazed me by saying that that figure might be too conservative. Is the Minister going to keep out second-hand cars—full stop? After all, the price of second-hand cars in Australia compared with the rest of the Western world is ridiculously high. The Minister cited a figure from Mazda of, I think, $6,000 to $21,000. I presume he went right across the Mazda range or perhaps he was just talking about the Mazda 626.

         The Government has said it will use the ADR to keep second-hand cars out, that it was worried about safety and that sort of thing, which the company went to a lot of bother to meet. In fact, the company went to so much bother that the Government had a conscience and volunteered to let it bring in so many cars in the next 12 months or so to make up for the money it had spent. Having done all this, the Government admits that the ADR was not enough. The Government is now admitting that it just wants to keep cars out instead of using the ADR.

         I cannot understand the Government picking out the car industry and saying, `We will keep them out—full stop'. The Government has to tell every other industry that they have no hope of getting any help, they have to put up with the playing field of the rest of the world, yet when it comes to the car industry the Government lets it play in a privileged position. Can we expect these sorts of special tariffs to spread across to other industries?

         —No, it is not putting anybody in a privileged position. The Government is concerned only with large volumes of second-hand cars; small volumes of second-hand cars are allowed into this country. Japan operates an industry policy—at times it is called an environmental policy—which means that it is unprofitable or it costs a person to keep a car certainly after five years and probably after four. That creates an enormous pressure in the Japanese second-hand car market. Because the cars are right-hand drive, there are three places where that problem can be solved: New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom. That is to say, these cars can be bought cheaply in Japan, taken to any one of those countries and, depending upon the market, a significant profit can be made.

         New Zealand let those cars in. The cars entered New Zealand in very large quantities. There was a reduction of 20,000 in sales of new cars in New Zealand. I think the population of New Zealand is about 2.5 million. It is a very small market, so that is a big reduction. If that were multiplied and followed in Australia, there would be a big reduction in the production of new cars. New Zealand is now conducting an inquiry into the matter. I think it is much better to deal with the problem before it develops too greatly, as I believe it will.

         The United Kingdom has a way of dealing with it. It is much less profitable to sell in the United Kingdom because of transport costs and distance. We have inquired of the Ministry of Transport in the United Kingdom with respect to second-hand car imports. The Ministry approves a prototype vehicle of a particular model. The cost of that prototype approval is $111,000 and it takes a month to get approval. There is then a built-in time delay for testing the imported vehicles if they enter the country in any volume. One hundred vehicles are allowed to be tested a month. A maximum of 1,200 vehicles would be tested in the United Kingdom in a year.

         Individual inspections of each motor car cost the importer $3,000 as an inspection fee and usually, but quite arbitrarily, entail the replacement of some parts, thereby further increasing the importer's costs.

         In 1988 in this country, when we received widespread representations from Western Australia—Senator Panizza's State—about the importation of Japanese cars, it was decided that that problem would be fixed by alterations to the design rules. That worked for a little while, but it no longer works. Rather than go through these tortuous routes which other countries have followed, we felt that it was better to be quite up-front about it and say what we were doing and why. In so far as that may involve special treatment for the automotive industry, as Senator Panizza alleges, it is only true to this extent: the special treatment for the automotive industry was determined by the Industries Assistance Commission when this was not a problem. Now that it is a problem we think that, as a government, it is appropriate for us to abide by the `special treatment', if one wants to use that expression, which the Industries Assistance Commission recommended in respect of the automotive industry and which we accepted—and we are not having it undermined by that. If Senator Panizza wants to go out and say, `We are the only country in the world which imports second-hand cars from Japan in mass volumes'—if he would be proud of that boast—I want him to know that I would not.

I thought he might have had an ad valorem situation rather than the fixed figure, because if there is a tariff reduction on new cars, there is a $12,000 fixed limit. In other words, the $12,000 will be a far bigger component in the relationship when the other comes down. Apart from that, we will debate this another time when the legislation comes forward.

         —That is a very interesting question, but I want Senator Panizza to understand that it is purely academic. We wanted a GATT legal solution to this problem. We could have done all sorts of fancy things such as the British do. But we wanted a GATT legal solution, and this is it. Let me be absolutely clear. The purpose of the policy is to stop these imports. It does not matter whether we have an ad valorem tariff or whatever; the policy purpose is absolutely clear.

         —I have one more question on that point. The Minister said that he wants to stop the importation of these cars, full stop. Is he still happy to see the importers paying that $12,000 on those cars coming into Australia? I do not know exactly the average age of cars in Australia at present, but I think it is over five years. So, if these cars are five years old, the average age of cars in Australia is being improved upon. It is the same in New Zealand. I believe that the average car age in New Zealand is about 12 or 13 years, unless it has come down. Considering the fact that bringing in these later model cars can help safety, is the Minister looking to stop them completely, even if the importers meet his demand of $12,000?

         —Firstly, the average age of cars in Australia is considerably more than the five years that Senator Panizza mentioned. The answer to the question is essentially yes. The Government's strategy in the longer term is to produce better and cheaper new cars in Australia; that is the best result one can obtain for anybody. That is the purpose of the automotive industry policy. If we start flooding the market with second-hand cars, one of the immediate effects on the second-hand car market is probably to lower the price of second-hand cars but certainly to lower the price of the trade-in values which people can obtain trading in old cars for new cars. That is one of the problems which would occur if this was allowed to happen in an uncontrolled way. That is why we are doing it.

In the automotive sector, the tariff structure is applicable to newly produced goods. It was based on an IAC inquiry into the relative costs of production of newly produced goods around the world. We put in place a tariff regime for the protection—I do not hesitate to use that word—of the car industry so there was a moderate, steady phase-down of tariffs in that industry. That is now in place. The intention was to reduce tariffs to increase the pressure on the car industry to reduce prices and produce better quality cars.

Secondly, in the town that I live in in the Burdekin, there is a very efficient, very forward-looking rice industry which operates without any government assistance. It is an industry which, of its own accord, is actively and very positively seeking markets in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically in Japan. As I understand it, there is a complete embargo by the Japanese Government on the importation of any foreign rice into Japan. I know that the Australian Government is supporting the rice industry by trying to get that embargo lifted so that Australian rice can go into Japan. I wonder whether what the Minister is doing in relation to the used cars might be used by the Japanese Government as an excuse for resisting change in its policies on embargo of our rice.

         The second point about the Japanese automotive industry is that it is well represented here in Australia and the one thing it does not want is floods of second-hand imports into Australia. That has been made quite clear, both in Japan and in Australia. I think the Japanese Government would be sensitive to anything the industry said about the matter. After all, the Japanese policy of making it very unprofitable to keep a car after four or five years is an industry policy in Japan, in part to support its industry, which is the best in the world.

         The debate on rice is a different matter. I have taken part in the debate with Ministers in Japan. It is an enormous cultural and political problem for them. I do not in any way defend the embargo. The common agricultural policy in France now is defended not so much on the basis of being a rational economic policy, but as a cultural policy.

         We have a problem with that in Australia. We do not have such a policy. No government in Australia has had such a policy. It may be regarded as a non-economic policy, but it is a social policy as articulated by the French. In Japan, it is also a social and cultural policy. Whether a little progress can be made in the Uruguay Round with Japan on the matter of rice, I do not know.

The New Zealand experience has been extraordinary. I forget the figure, but I think 90,000 cars came in the moment this policy was relaxed in New Zealand.

         From the information I have collected on the import of cars to Australia, not only do we have a 10-pound hammer cracking a peanut but we also have a huge jackhammer attacking that peanut. The figures I have show that, from 1986 to 1990, some 28,000 used cars were imported to Australia. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that 28,000 second-hand cars were imported to Australia in the last five years. The solution is aimed at one company in Western Australia.

         —It is primarily aimed at one company, or a conglomerate of five companies. Their target imports for the coming year and the next financial year are 1,500 cars in each particular year to fill a niche in the market. However, the other side of the equation that needs explaining is that those cars range from 1985 to 1987 models up to a retail price of about $23,000 with the tariff. I am talking about the Mazda 626. The new price for the latest model of that car in Australia fully imported is $28,000. There seems to be an enormous hammer cracking a peanut.

         This movement raises the next question—the logic of putting a tariff on an imported second-hand car. Does the extension of that policy, bearing in mind the Minister's comments—I do not disagree that we want cheap manufactured cars in this country, at the same time keeping quality—mean that new motor cars that are imported will have a different tariff regime applied to them in the future? The tariff on motor cars coming into this country is about 35 per cent, and they attract sales tax at about 15 cent. This, in effect, means that the cars that were proposed to be imported  will have an effective tariff on them of very close to 50 per cent.

         In terms of the direction that tariffs are taking in this country, it is the wrong signal and it is the wrong direction in which to go. I would add that in regard to selecting them in the manner in which they have been selected, there are currently many products, particularly agricultural products, coming into Australia and being sold on the Australian market which have enormous subsidies in their production. The Minister would be well aware of this.

In respect of dumping of agricultural products—Senator Boswell normally pursues me about this but he is not here tonight—the Anti-Dumping Authority has made a number of decisions recently in relation to tomatoes and a few other vegetables, which I cannot remember at the moment, which have had dumping duties imposed on them.

The point I am trying to make is that it would be a costly exercise to provide new parts for some of the second-hand models which are now coming into Australia.

         —Firstly, I apologise to the Minister because I have been in other places and he may already have dealt with my questions. I think the Minister will agree that the Taiyo company appears to have tried to do the right thing all the way along the line. It made inquiries as to what would be the terms under which it could import vehicles. It has now fulfilled all those terms and if this legislation passes through Parliament that company will have lost very substantially.

         I wonder whether the Government has given any consideration to compensating this company for the losses it would have suffered as a result of being chopped off, in effect, after it apparently had endeavoured to comply with all the Government's requirements. I am not talking about future profits and losses. I am talking about the substantial financial losses that I am sure it would be able to establish as a result of complying with the standards imposed upon it. I ask whether the Government has given any consideration to where this might end up if the Bill is passed.

From time to time there are changes in government policy—whether it be tax policy or tariff policy, to take two examples—and certain parties are aggrieved by those changes. When we made changes to the tariff regime in March of 1991 some companies might have been aggrieved by those changes. In this particular case—and as I recall, it was a Cabinet decision—we thought that we should discuss this matter with Taiyo and the costs it had incurred.

I recognise and acknowledge that as a result some people may be aggrieved by a reduction of tariff. But in this particular case there is a retrospective element in that they went a long way down the track before the Government made a decision that they would in effect be stopped. I appreciate that New Zealand has gone a long way further down the track so that at this stage the damage in terms of past expenses may not be as high as it might have been had the Government delayed making this decision.

         I would have thought that this company operating in Australia, bringing these vehicles into Australia in competition with the used motor vehicles, would have done something to correct that particular problem involving the price and the age of used motor vehicles. After all, as Taiyo points out in some of its correspondence, people in Australia who wish to purchase a new car are not going to purchase a motor vehicle which is at least four years old and which is the old model just because of the price. In effect, the company would have made very substantial inroads into the used car market rather than into the new car market.

         Thirdly, what has been introduced into the used car market is a factor which would contribute to lowering the price of used cars. What that does is lower the price of trade-in values on new cars. One cannot separate the used car market from the new car market and say that these are the world's used car buyers—perhaps in John Hewson or Ian McLachlan's terms, the workers—and over there are the people who buy new cars. One cannot say they are two distinct groups because they are not. The two markets are very much related to each other. So I think those factors have to be taken into account.

The Government has a policy for the automotive industry and we are not going to have it undermined by second-hand car imports. That is what this policy is all about—nothing else. That is what it was about in 1988 when the squeals came from Western Australia about importation of second-hand Japanese cars. What did the Government do at that time? It changed the design rules to try to keep them out. It did not work, so now we have to get something that does work. That is what this is all about.

Senator Panizza is putting a sort of tax lawyer question to me and asking whether there is some device whereby Taiyo can get around this provision. If there is such a device, we will fix it. That is the intention. We can have all this fascinating debate about this issue, but when one reaches the point that I have reached, where one has to make a decision about what one does, in my view there is no other option than to do what we have done.

         —This was a matter of some discussion in the newspapers at the time, but the essential concept was to try to establish an industry development fund in Australia to which there would be a number of institutional contributors. This fund would be managed by a board composed of representatives of the institutional contributors and its purpose would be to invest in Australian industry. That is a thumbnail sketch and only a simple version of what the proposal was.

         The reason for the proposal was that there is a clearly identifiable gap in the capital markets in Australia and has been for some time. Certainly since the 1987 stock market crash there has been a very clear market and intellectual failure in terms of genuine entrepreneurial skill to satisfy the capital requirements of a number of very many good companies in this country, the expansion of which is limited by lack of capital. That was the essential notion.

         There are all sorts of ramifications when establishing a fund like that, such as the tax treatment of the investments, the board structure, the relationships with the banks and all these sorts of things. Mr Batchelor is very highly qualified in this area and those were the issues he dealt with in the concept paper. A number of other documents were presented by Mr Batchelor dealing with particular legal and accounting issues, but that was what the concept paper was about.

With the greatest of respect, the honourable senator may be an old style socialist and in favour of the Government investing taxpayers' money in businesses; I am not.

These home loans were made to 67 officers of EFIC who are domiciled in Sydney at an average value of $100,000 each, with a total in the vicinity of $6.7m.

What is less well known to the general public is that the successor to the unit, which participated in the famous charge at Beersheba in World War I, is still in existence and is now headquartered in the City of Fitzroy in Victoria. Beersheba is located in what was then called Palestine, which formed part of the Turkish Empire. The town is south-east of Gaza and the battle was fought on 30 and 31 October 1917. This was probably the last major victorious cavalry charge in war.

         Last Sunday this famous unit, the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse, was granted the Freedom of the City of Fitzroy and, as they say, marched with swords drawn, bayonets fixed, bands playing, drums beating and flags flying. I understand that the tradition of granting freedom of the city dates from Roman times. Legions were allowed into the city of Rome only on special occasions—typically after a great victory had been won. There were some 250 men and women on parade last Sunday. The senior army officers General Glenny and Brigadier McManus attended the parade and the salute was taken by the distinguished and popular Mayor of Fitzroy, Angela Ireland.

         The regiment traces its roots back to the Crimean War in the 1850s, when it was raised as part of a volunteer movement, although the exact date is unknown. By 1863, the title `Prince of Wales's' was bestowed on the successor of the first unit to honour the marriage of the heir apparent. The origins of today's 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse stem from three separate organisations: the 17th Prince of Wales's Light Horse, the 19th Yarrowee Light Horse and the 4th ex-Corangamite Light Horse. The three regiments were amalgamated on 1 April 1948. Last Sunday also marked the linking of the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse and the 8/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles.

         The 4th Light Horse was the only Australian unit to see service in all three fronts of World War I, namely, France, Gallipoli and Palestine. As a result of this service, it was presented with no less than 24 battle honours. Although the unit has primarily existed as a volunteer or Reservist unit, it did raise a Regular Army squadron in the early 1960s in order to send a troop to Vietnam to support Australian operations in that theatre in 1965-66. As a result of that tour of duty, the regiment earned the `US Meritorious Unit' commendation, becoming the only reserve unit in Australia to do so.

         The role of the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse today is quite different from the unit's role in the original light horse days. The once crucial role of horses made way for Grant and Centurion tanks, the Ferret Scout Cars and, today, M113A1 armoured reconnaissance vehicles. Another important change since the unit's early days is the appointment of women within the unit. Lieutenant Andrea Heath is the unit's transport officer and there are some 45 other women in the unit.

         In peacetime, the unit has centred largely on the community, and has often been called upon in emergency situations. The bravery which has won the unit recognition during wartime in the past was prevalent again during the devastating Ash Wednesday bushfires which swept through Victoria and, more recently, the unit was involved in relief work during the Gippsland floods.

I was shown over the regimental museum by Captain Peter Bavington and Lieutenant Steven Blacker. The pride of the regimental museum is the Kyneton District Mounted Rifle Colours which had been made by the ladies of the Kyneton district for the unit in the 1870s.

The blue-green algae problem we can now expect to see in our waterways is perhaps the most visible manifestation of the consequences of that lifestyle. The problem is widespread with an increasing number of incidents being reported.

From considerable previous experience with fish kills, the fish appeared to be dying from a chemical. We took the first fish sample at 3.01pm and wrapped it in foil.

         The final point I referred to last night was the responsibility of the directors of the Civil Aviation Authority. I pointed out that they were showing little evidence that they appreciated the legal position that they are in. I mentioned that they have responsibilities and obligations under law. The company law of Australia applies as much to them, as directors of a government business enterprise, as it does to someone operating as a director of a public company. I drew their attention to the charges currently being laid against the directors of Compass. I suggested that there was a similarity in the two situations. I pointed out that their liability could in fact be greater financially because if the contract price of around $200m blows out and the service is delayed and not up to the standard required, they could be held responsible for that.

         Of course, the other element is the accident rate. What we have is a contract being awarded to a company with a proven history of losing aircraft on its detection systems for its air traffic control. That is not an academic point. There are failures in the software program of the preferred tenderer—Thomson-CSF. There is a history of a failure to detect and record the presence of aircraft on the installations it has made overseas. There is abundant evidence of it in our own country: aircraft have been lost in Melbourne airspace; aircraft are still being lost in Cairns airspace. I emphasise that this is not an academic point.

         I wonder whether this doctrine of affordable safety is not part of the current doctrine of the Civil Aviation Authority. My mind goes back to the time when Sir Donald Anderson was the head of the Department of Civil Aviation. He was arguably one of the greatest directors of aviation in this country. His slogan was, `Safety is no accident'. He must be turning in his grave at the thought of affordable safety. The Civil Aviation Authority has never explained what `affordable safety' is. Does it mean the loss of one major aircraft a decade or a year? Does it look at its statistics and say, `We have a perfect safety record in Australia. People travelling on buses do not enjoy that. Other countries do not have the same safety record as we do; we must be wasting money on safety'? If we are to believe that sort of thing, which is the doctrine of the Civil Aviation Authority, perhaps it is possible to select a company such as Thomson, with a proven history of being unable to detect aircraft in airspace. But even if the Civil Aviation Authority does that, it has to consider its liability. I would hate to think of what would happen if two airliners collided because one or both of them did not appear on a radar screen of an air traffic control unit at a busy airfield.

         The Hughes TAAATS software solution is based on a rehost of the highly successful Korean Air Traffic System. The KATC includes Flight Data Processing and Radar Data Processing Function. The system has not lost a single minute of operational service since it became operational in 1986. It should be noted that the capabilities of the KATC match or exceed those of the majority of ATC systems in operation today, including those systems produced by Thomson.

         A few important points flow from that. We know that the capital of South Korea, Seoul, is very close to the demilitarised zone. Those of us who have been to the demilitarised zone know that it is one of the most tense points in the world. The need for the South Koreans to have a fail-safe air traffic control system, which not only looks after civil traffic but doubles as a military airspace surveillance scheme, is absolutely vital. One of the characteristics of the Hughes software programs is that it can accommodate both functions.

         This is also very important for Australia. We do not have the money to have two separate systems—a national airspace surveillance system for the RAAF or the Australian Defence Force and one for air traffic control. The characteristics of the two differ to the extent that in civil applications aircraft identify themselves by the use of transponders and communication with ground stations; whereas in military operations people try to operate covertly, they do not advertise their presence. Nevertheless, while the detection of the traffic is different, the handling of data has degrees of similarity. It is an advantage to Australia to have a contractor who provides a system which, with minimal or no extra cost, will accommodate both functions.

         The TAAATS software represents less than 3% of the total contract price. Eighty-eight per cent of the TAAATS functionality has previously been delivered in Jovial software language. Approximately 60% of the software functionality has been redone in Ada for other systems. All of the software will be completed in Ada nine months after contract go ahead, and 15 months before the TAAATS need dates. The conversion of ATC software has been underway for one and a half years. This is clearly an area of low risk; otherwise, Hughes would have scheduled more time and resources to accomplish this task. In fact, the CAA based their assessment of Hughes risk on those software tasks that amount to only approximately 1% of the contract price. We have demonstrated experience and recognized credibility to believe in our proposed schedule and cost estimates.

        The submission goes on to refer to the colour raster display. That is one of the points of contention. A huge amount of information is required to be presented. The old technology, the cursive display system with a light pencil, has been replaced by a technique known as a colour raster display. Not only is that in full colour, but it allows a great deal more detail to be put on the screens in front of the controllers.

         Very high technology is involved. I am advised that there is only one manufacturer of those screens—Sony in Japan. Not only is the acquisition of the screen crucial, but the development of the software program to generate the symbology is highly critical. We are not talking about something that someone does with a lead pencil on the back of a used envelope on a Saturday afternoon in between watching the racing results; this is something that involves tens of millions of dollars and years of work to generate a system that actually works.

         The CAA, in its claim that Hughes was a higher risk, accepted the assertion from Thomson that it would be able to supply a colour raster display. Since the colour raster display is the interface between the human beings in the air traffic control situation and the data that they are operating with, it is quite important. Thomson claims that it will provide a colour raster screen—although it has never done so anywhere in the world previously. Thomson has only worked up prototype schemes, but no-one has bought them. I do not know what Thomson is providing to the Swiss air traffic control at present, but I understand that the Swiss Government—with the small Thomson contract it has—is very dissatisfied with the display screens that it has.

        The CAA has underestimated another area of high risk in the Thomson proposal. Namely, Thomson is introducing a colour raster scan workstation. All their deliveries to date have utilized either a monochromatic stroker workstation, which is dated technology, or a prototype raster scan workstation. High performance raster scan workstation development for ATC Systems requires significant investment both in hardware and software. Thomson is believed to be at least 2 years and millions of dollars behind Hughes in producing a production quality 20" raster scan workstation. Hughes began raster scan workstation development in the early 80s. Approximately $100M has been invested by Hughes and its customers in development of this technology. Hughes has over seven-hundred and fifty (750) 20" raster scan workstations on order, some of which have already been delivered. During the RADREP competition—

        Of particular concern should be the development of a specialized graphic engine, as commercially available graphic engines will not meet the demanding requirements of an ATC system. Secondly, there is a significant amount of unique software associated with the Man Machine Interface. Hughes has accomplished this software work for our workstations for the Icelandic and Taiwanese Air Defense Programs, as well as the Canadian ATC system. Thomson has significant workstation development remaining which must be considered a higher risk.

        Thomson is saying, `If you want a colour raster screen, Australia, we will give it to you'. My mind goes back to the negotiations. I am glad that Senator Tate is here because he slept through many a speech of mine on the new tactical fighter in 1978 and 1979 when, once more, strangely enough, we were talking about radars and side lobe propagation and other things that confused Senator Tate no end.

         It was interesting at the time of the new tactical fighter debate that the RAAF team—we are talking somewhere around 1979-80—was looking at a number of aircraft to replace the Mirage III that the RAAF had operated for some years. One of the aircraft on the short list at that time was the Mirage 2000, which was a new aeroplane designed by Dassault. They looked at this aeroplane in France and it had in it a very basic Thomson-CSF fire control radar. They said, `The RAAF specification is to be able to have a look-down capability in our radar amongst a lot of other capabilities in the air to air mode'. Thomson said, `If you want a look-down radar, we will give you a look-down radar', as if there was nothing to it.

         The point at issue is that the ability to look down with a radar in an aeroplane and identify a moving target at low level—maybe 30,000 or 40,000 feet below—is highly complex. No-one could do it but the Americans—in fact, no-one could do it but Hughes. There are all these returns. It is difficult enough at sea with the wave formation sending a random pattern back. Over land there is much worse. It is extraordinarily difficult to pick up a low flying aircraft. It is highly sophisticated software which enables a signal processor to identify a low flying aeroplane in this circumstance.

         Thomson had no way on earth of developing that technology in 1979 or 1980, but it was quite prepared to tell the RAAF team that it could do it within a certain cost and, relatively speaking, within a very short time. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In fact, until one American worker in this field sold out the technology to the Soviets, it was exclusively the property of the United States. The tragedy was that, quite apart from the fact that the fellow who sold it out was a traitor, he was also a fool. He sold this technology, which would be worth probably hundreds of millions of dollars in today's prices, for something like $30,000 or some absurd pittance. Once that happened, the technology moved around the world and other people developed it.

         Unless it is felt that this is a small point, at the time of the Falklands war it will be remembered that the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm were shooting down a high proportion of the Argentinean aircraft that were flying in in daylight to attack the Falklands to support the Argentineans on the ground through that campaign. The Argentinean air force flew in C130s at night to resupply. It did that by doing a low level insertion. The British Sea Harriers were then equipped with Ferranti Blue Fox radars which had no effective look-down capability. The system was very limited over water and there was none at all over land, so they could not detect the C130s.

         So the promise that Thomson can just simply come up with a colour raster display because it is required in the contract without spending a great deal of time and money has to be taken with some degree of suspicion. I have only touched on a couple of points about that tonight. It is nowhere near the end of the document that I was quoting from.

         The Thomson design for TAAATS requires rehosting of their Belgian air traffic control software written in Ada from Data General computers to Digital Equipment Corporation computers. Thomson has not delivered a single airspace management system of the size of TAAATS that uses DEC computers. Consequently, Thomson must rehost all its software on a computer that is new to its software and systems engineers. In contrast, Hughes has implemented a number of its systems, such as United Kingdom Air Defence System, Forward Area Air Defence Command and Control, a classified command and control system, and the Intelligent Interface Processor for Germany on the DEC computers proposed for TAAATS.

        I can report on the assessment of participation in training activities. All participants in training activities require supervisor endorsement and verification of the need for the training. The value and benefit of the training is then assessed through a range of formal evaluation processes which are dependent on the type of length of the training program. Such processes include reaction sheets, post course interviews, action plans, supervisor interviews and learning contracts. Informal processes may also be conducted by each participant's own work area.
