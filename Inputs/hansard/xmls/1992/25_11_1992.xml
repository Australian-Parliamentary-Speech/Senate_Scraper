        The Explanatory Statement advised that the fees were last increased in 1990 and then stated that the increase "reflects the movements in the Consumer Price Index for the period under review (January 1990 to December 1991)". However, one increase was from $8 to $15, an increase of 87.5%; two are from $12 to $18, an increase of 50%; and one from $30 to $40, an increase of 33.3%. In fact, these increases do not appear to reflect the CPI increase during the period.

        Form NH20 appears to require employers to provide the Department with the names, awards and many personal details of service of individual staff in relation to their annual leave, sick leave and long service leave. It is assumed that this information is needed for reconciliation of reimbursement. However, the Committee has asked for further advice on the provisions which authorise the collection of such information, who has access to it, what safeguards exist for its protection, whether its collection accords with the Privacy Principles and whether it was necessary for such detailed information to be collected for the purposes of the Act.

        These Determinations provide for conditions of employment of locally engaged Commonwealth employees in Malta, Czechoslovakia and Ireland. Provisions of each Determination appear to incorporate aspects of the law of those countries as in force or existing from time to time. Also, one Explanatory Statement advises of a provision "which authorises payment to LES of salary increases decreed by the Maltese Government".
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The parent Public Service Act 1922 provides for only limited incorporation in Determinations of instruments as in force at a particular time or as amended. The Committee has asked for an assurance that this apparent incorporation in Commonwealth legislation of future unknown foreign laws is authorised by that Act.

The proposal that the evidence be taken in camera at the first hearing of this very important Senate select committee is a matter that does concern us. This is a very important inquiry. It is very unusual to start an official hearing on the basis of taking in camera evidence.

          There are very few precedents, as I understand it, for select committees or standing committees of the Senate to commence an inquiry—certainly one of this importance—by taking in camera evidence as distinct from a private briefing. This is an official hearing. There will be a
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          The purpose of holding it in camera is certainly not clear to Opposition members of the Committee—nor, indeed, to the Opposition as a whole. I think it sets a very bad precedent. It smacks of starting off the inquiry in a cloak and dagger fashion. It means that the general public and other senators will not be able to know, until the report of the Committee is completed, the nature of this very important hearing.

I did discuss this with Senator Coulter. I understand he is not agreeable to that. Given the procedures of the Senate, there is little more I can do but make this public protest about the way in which the Committee is commencing its inquiries. I hope it is not a precedent for the conduct of the rest of the hearings of this very important Committee.

          —by leave—I assure Senator Short and other members of the Opposition that this is not a precedent. It is in the form of a briefing by Treasury officers. It is the first part of their submission, as I understand it, and the Treasury officers will be coming back for the public part of the inquiry later on. This is for the information of those members of the Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council who may not be fully across the functioning of the Loan Council. I understand that it was Senator Bishop who made the initial suggestion that this be an in camera hearing. I simply repeat the assurance that this does not set a precedent.

          —by leave—As a Victorian, I take a very great interest in what has happened. The Chairman of the Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council, Senator Coulter, has said that the hearing will be in camera to enable members of the Committee to understand the workings of the Loan Council. I point out that some other people in this chamber might also like the opportunity to learn about the workings of the Loan Council. When the hearing is held in camera, it means they are not allowed to do that. I find that unacceptable. I think Senator Coulter should think about that. It excludes other people from learning about it. Many senators attend committee meetings when they are not actually members of the committee. It is very useful for them to be able to do that. By having an in camera hearing, those people are precluded from doing that.

       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to prohibit the import and export of radioactive waste into and out of Australia and to further restrict the trade of radioactive materials.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill was developed in response to the passing of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Amendment Act earlier this year. That Act accorded a greater commercial role for ANSTO and granted ANSTO the functions of conditioning, managing and storing radioactive waste on site, with immunity provided from certain State and Territory laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I will explain later on, the present situation concerning ANSTO and the powers bestowed upon it under the Amendment Act gives rise to a completely unacceptable situation. If the Australian public were aware of the powers held by ANSTO and the direction in which both the Government and ANSTO are heading, they would be very alarmed indeed, and for good reason.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Amendment Act was, in part, a response by the Government to orders made by Justice Cripps in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court in regard to the presence of radioactive waste at the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories in Sutherland Shire. The Act overrides an order made by Justice Cripps that ANSTO be restrained from bringing on to the Lucas Heights facility radioactive waste for the purpose of storing the waste on site contrary to the provisions of the planning laws of New South Wales. This means that the Federal Government has unilaterally assumed total control over ANSTO's activities and thereby flouted the recently negotiated Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, effectively rendering it null and void.
       </para>
       <para>
        ANSTO has now effectively been granted legislative protection in dealing with radioactive wastes. The only concession the Government was prepared to make to the Sutherland Shire community and environment groups was a guarantee in legislation that the premises on which the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories are situated will not become a national nuclear waste repository.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although this was an important win for the residents of Sutherland Shire, the fact remains that ANSTO now has a mandate to engage in commercial ventures dealing with radioactive waste without any reference to State planning and environmental controls. These ventures could include the involvement by ANSTO in the international trade in radioactive waste. This is an extremely worrying development and set beside other nuclear related developments, clearly demonstrates that Australia is becoming increasingly involved in the international nuclear community, without any mandate from the Australian people. Further, it is the express wish of the Government's own party membership to oppose the importation of radioactive waste into this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is no secret that a number of politicians within and outside Australia believe that the deserts of our country would make an ideal dumping ground for nuclear waste. Investigations into the suitability of geological formations within Australia, for radioactive waste disposal, have already taken place. Ostensibly such investigations have taken place in order to understand radioactive waste repositories overseas. It would be naive of us to believe that these activities have been undertaken purely for overseas application. One of the two participants in the study, the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation of Japan (PNC) is actively looking for offshore sites for radioactive waste dumps. So far they have concluded agreements with the former USSR and China for radioactive waste disposal investigations.
       </para>
       <para>
        A moratorium on the dumping of low level radioactive waste at sea will be discussed at the London Dumping Convention in October this year. Some countries wish to convert the moratorium into a permanent ban, but this is being resisted by, amongst others, Japan, the UK and France. If a permanent ban were to be imposed, added pressure from land scarce countries would be placed on land abundant countries such as Australia to enter into seemingly lucrative deals to accept radioactive waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worrying that there is an increasing perception overseas that Australia would make an ideal dumping ground for the radioactive waste of other countries—a view also held by some supporters of the nuclear industry within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been suggestions that redundant uranium mine sites could be backfilled with radioactive waste. It has been mooted that the open-cut Ranger uranium mine could be used for this purpose. Only recently the Chamber of Mines and Energy in the Northern Territory called for an international radioactive waste dump to be sited in the Territory. The line being pushed is that Australia would earn more money from its involvement in the nuclear industry if it not only sold uranium, but offered a complete waste management service also.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister insists that such an idea would never come to pass, and he has frequently sought refuge in his Party's policy on this matter. That he has singularly failed to put his own Party policy on radioactive waste—one of the few worthwhile environmental polices that the Party has—into legislation is worrying. He deliberately chose not to prohibit the import and export of radioactive waste, when amending the ANSTO Amendment Act afforded him the opportunity to do so. As I will explain shortly, within the Government itself there is a contradictory approach to radioactive waste, and a conflict most definitely arises from the Government's actions and its own Party policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present the only constraints relating to the imports of radioactive wastes on the Government is the ALP Party policy. However, the Government has previously chosen to openly ignore its own Party's policy by approving uranium exports to France. ALP policy therefore counts for very little with the upper echelon decision makers of the Party.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been claimed that under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations Act, the importation of `radioactive substances' is prohibited. This is not strictly true. This particular piece of legislation does allow for certain materials to be imported if accompanied by the written permission of the Minister or an `authorised officer'. An `authorised officer' is defined as any officer or employee—of ANSTO—appointed in writing by the relevant Minister, in this case the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. This is a cosy relationship indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        ANSTO is now permitted to condition, manage and store radioactive waste and radioactive materials arising from the activities of `other persons' who are specified in the regulations. If the Government were to designate a foreign company dealing in nuclear power as a `person' under the regulations, an ANSTO employee could authorise the importation of the waste and ANSTO would be able to condition, manage and store the waste at the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories.
       </para>
       <para>
        A corresponding matter to which the ANSTO Amendment Act relates is the proposed establishment of a national nuclear waste repository. The repository is to provide long term storage for low and intermediate level radioactive waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth has been attempting to identify a permanent site for the repository for a considerable period of time. These efforts have been clearly described in a paper by the Science, Technology and Environment Group of the Parliamentary Research Service. In 1980 a Commonwealth-State Consultative Committee was set up, partly in response to a 1975 recommendation by the National Health and Medical Research Council that a central `repository' for longer-lived radioactive wastes be established.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1985 the Committee recommended that a national program of site identification for shallow ground burial of radioactive waste be commenced. A list of potential sites was to be prepared within 12 months. However, very little progress was made, apart from the publication of a list of radioactive wastes stored throughout the country and a failed feasibility study carried out by the Northern Territory Government in 1988-89.
       </para>
       <para>
        By February 1992, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory had all refused to allow a national radioactive waste repository within their boundaries. Western Australia has established Australia's only state radioactive disposal site at Mt Walton, 130 kms north west of Coolgardie. It is not, however, intended for use as a national disposal site.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth clearly faces an impasse on this issue. However, as the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Ross Free, stated in his second reading speech on the ANSTO Amendment Bill, the judgment of the NSW Land and Environment Court has `focused attention more sharply on the need for a permanent repository for Australia's radioactive wastes'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council resolved at a meeting on 7 February this year to request the Commonwealth to commission a body to identify options for sites for the processing of a permanent disposal facility for low-level radioactive wastes. The Commonwealth has established a working group comprising Department of Primary Industries and Energy and ANSTO officials.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, is actively seeking the cooperation of State and Territory Governments to identify a site. In a media release dated 1 June 1992, Mr Crean stated that cooperation from the States has been disappointing. He then threatened that `the Commonwealth will have to identify, and may need to acquire, a site if co-operation is not forthcoming'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts has recommended that the Commonwealth take `urgent action' to select a site for and construct a safe and secure radioactive waste repository. Finally, the Working Party of the Radiation Health Committee of the NHMRC has recently issued a draft Code of Practice for the Near-Surface Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Australia. The paper, which updates a 1990 draft Code, recommends shallow land burial for low and intermediate waste in an arid area.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is of some concern to note here that the specified permissible levels for certain radionuclides set out in the 1990 draft have been raised in the 1992 draft. For example, the limit for radium has been raised by 50 times while the limit for tritium has been removed altogether. A third category of waste, seemingly designed to accommodate mineral sands tailings generated primarily by private companies, has also been included in the 1992 draft. In addition, against international practice, the NHMRC, in its second draft, has failed to define low and intermediate level waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Australian Democrats are yet to develop a detailed policy on the long term disposal of radioactive waste, we nevertheless have grave concerns about the shallow land burial disposal method being considered by the NHMRC. Both Greenpeace and the Friends of the Earth object to such a disposal method. In the United States, shallow land burial sites have come under fire from local communities concerned about waste contamination. Two of the six shallow burial sites for commercial low level radioactive waste in the US have leaked and another three have been closed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the United Kingdom, NIREX (the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive responsible for making proposals to the Government for the safe storage of low and intermediate level waste) has decided to dispose of low level waste in the same repositories as intermediate level waste. Canada, France and Sweden are also adopting alternative technologies to shallow land burial, by moving toward a highly engineered and deeper land burial of radioactive waste. Greenpeace advocate above-ground dry-storage, partly to avoid the `out of sight, out of mind' mentality, but also as an interim measure pending the development of safer and more secure forms of radioactive waste management. Such a policy would also encourage waste minimisation or avoidance by industry. Above-ground, dry stores already exist and are in use for spent nuclear fuel, the most radioactive material known. Low and intermediate waste should also be kept in similar facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although Australia's store of radioactive waste is relatively small when compared to some countries, we nevertheless do have a major national problem. The main focus of this problem—the 1,500 spent fuel rods stored at Lucas Heights, is for the most part, not discussed within Parliament, scientific circles or the public arena. It is time this issue was properly addressed within the context of a national radioactive waste management strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        ANSTO imports approximately 50 fuel rods a year to operate the HIFAR reactor. If ANSTO continues to operate until the year 2000, there will be about 2,000 fuel rods on site by the turn of the century. The continued accumulation of spent nuclear fuel is dependent on whether or not the spent fuel is sent overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Safety Review Committee's Special Report presented to the Minister for Science and Technology last year, entitled Management of Radioactive Waste at Lucas Heights Research Laboratories, the spent nuclear fuel rods from the HIFAR reactor are not classified as waste because the Government hopes to recover the highly enriched uranium from them by sending them to the US for reprocessing.
       </para>
       <para>
        ANSTO claims that it will receive a credit—of new fuel rods—for the HIFAR reactor in lieu of the highly enriched uranium that the US will obtain as a result of the reprocessing of the spent fuel.
       </para>
       <para>
        For some years now, the Government has been hoping to send the spent fuel overseas. On 17 December 1985 the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, issued a press statement which said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The Government has decided that 450 spent reactor fuel elements will be transported from the [then] Australian Atomic Energy Commission's Research Establishment at Lucas Heights to the United States for reprocessing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Evans went on to say that the transportation and reprocessing of the spent fuel will occur during 1986-87. Needless to say this did not occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats adamantly oppose the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and thereby the export of spent fuel rods for reprocessing. Reprocessing separates unused uranium and plutonium from spent fuel and results in highly enriched uranium, plutonium and high level liquid radioactive waste. It is a dangerous, expensive, and unnecessary process. According to ANSTO, it is also more expensive to send spent fuel overseas than to seek to store it here in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        One problem for the Australian Government is that there is increasing community opposition in the US to the policy of accepting radioactive waste from other countries. The Sierra Club, for example, has instigated litigation in the District Court of Columbia over the importation of foreign research reactor spent fuel.
       </para>
       <para>
        The US Department of Energy is currently revising its policy on reprocessing `foreign' research reactor spent fuel and any arrangements to import waste from other countries is on hold. If the policy were to change, Australia may not be able to export the rods to the US or alternatively may be obliged to reimport the high level liquid waste from reprocessing, atom-for-atom. Again there is no facility in Australia for the permanent storage or disposal of such waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's plan to export spent nuclear fuel to the United States is, again, in conflict with its own Party policy which states that the ALP should `promote the necessary level of research and development of promising technology for the handling and disposal of high level nuclear waste, in view of the absence of such safe disposal methods' (ALP Conference Book 1991).
       </para>
       <para>
        The spent fuel at Lucas Heights is the only form of high level radioactive waste that is within Australia. It can hardly be said that plans to transport the fuel through Sydney, then on a long ocean voyage, and through American communities at sites already dangerously contaminated is a sensible waste policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        For every cubic metre of spent fuel sent into a reprocessing plant 160 more cubic metres of waste, in bulk terms, is created. Reprocessing creates low, intermediate and high level liquid wastes and leads to the release of radioactive gas and water. As there is no safe disposal option for radioactive wastes within the US, how can we possibly contemplate sending spent nuclear fuel there as the present Government policy dictates we do?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth noting that not all spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed. In a number of countries spent fuel is treated as a primary waste and treated and managed accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are only two US facilities which reprocess research reactor spent fuel. They are the Savannah River facility in South Carolina and the Idaho Falls facility. In a letter to Greenpeace dated 22 April 1991, Mr John Rolland, the Director of External Affairs at ANSTO stated that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The facility to which ANSTO's spent fuel would go to has not been decided.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that the International Atomic Energy Authority does not have full inspection rights to the Savannah River and Idaho facilities. In addition, I also understand that it may be the intention of the US Department of Energy to use the highly enriched uranium from Australian spent fuel in a military reactor. The Democrats are implacably opposed to the use of any spent fuel from Australia in an American or for that matter any other country's military reactor.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also hopes that the waste from the reprocessing will be retained in the US. To date, US policy on reprocessing has allowed waste from imported and reprocessed and spent fuel to remain in the country.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1963 the then Australian Atomic Energy Commission exported 150 spent fuel rods to the Dounreay reprocessing facility in Northern Scotland. At the time the UK allowed the waste generated by reprocessing to remain in the country. Since the 1970s the UK has insisted that waste be returned to the exporting country. This explains why the Government is keen to export the spent fuel to the US. It is feasible that the UK Government could pass retrospective legislation which would require the waste generated by reprocessing of spent fuel to be returned to the country of origin. After all, the immunity of ANSTO from State and Territory laws included in the ANSTO Amendment Act was applied retrospectively. This would mean that Australia would have to take back the high level liquid waste generated from the reprocessing of the spent fuel sent to Dounreay in 1963.
       </para>
       <para>
        One must wonder whether a purpose of the ANSTO Amendment Act is to allow for the importation of radioactive waste generated from the overseas reprocessing of spent fuel rods. This proposition carries quite some weight when one considers that during the debate on the Amendment Act, I put forward an amendment to the effect that ANSTO should not be permitted to import or export radioactive waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government rejected the amendment. Senator Button explained that the Government did not agree with the amendment because:

        that would mean that ANSTO would no longer be able to receive spent source material for recycling.

       <para>
        In response to Senator Button's answer, my colleague Senator Coulter asked whether this meant that ANSTO might import fuel radioactive waste that is spent for reprocessing. In reply, Senator Button said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        . . . this Bill is very wide in its ramifications and there may be circumstances where fuel rods have been sent overseas for reprocessing and, as I understand it, we may have to take back small quantities of waste to ANSTO from those rods. There is a possibility, not a likelihood, that that could be required of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, the ramifications of the Bill, as Senator Button said, are very wide—wide enough to allow the export of spent fuel for reprocessing and the import of high level liquid radioactive waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is of concern as it ties in too closely with the wishes of the Synroc Study Group. The Study Group consists of ANSTO, the Australian National University, ERA (who are the owners of the Ranger uranium mine and Jabiluka uranium deposit—both in the Northern Territory), the Western Mining Corporation (who own a 51 per cent interest in the Roxby Downs uranium mine in South Australia), CRA (the owners of the Kintyre uranium deposit in Western Australia) and BHP, who have business links with CRA.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Study Group is exploring opportunities for the commercial radioactive waste disposal sector in Australia. A pre-feasibility study undertaken by the Group has indicated significant commercial opportunities for Synroc.
       </para>
       <para>
        Synroc, which is short for synthetic rock, can be used to immobilise the high level liquid radioactive waste which results from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. The Study Group also hopes to expand this technology into other radioactive waste applications.
       </para>
       <para>
        The September 1991 Progress Report of the Synroc Study Group listed five options for the commercial development of Synroc in Australia. Two of these involve importing radioactive waste into Australia either for encapsulation and then dumping in Australia, or for re-export for disposal overseas following treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the short term the Synroc Study Group is seeking to import small quantities of high level nuclear waste to further their research into applications for Synroc. The ANSTO Amendment Act represents one way in which legislation is being changed to increase the potential for Australia's involvement in the international waste trade, particularly in relation to the Study Group's activities. What is there to prevent the Synroc Study Group from importing high level liquid waste if, as I have explained, an ANSTO employee could be responsible for authorising the importation of such waste? So much for an impartial assessment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments contained in the ANSTO Amendment Act only serve to further the cosy relationship between those with a vested interest in furthering the aims of the Synroc Study Group. There is not legislation to prohibit the Study Group form embarking on a venture to import radioactive waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further issue of major national significance is the eventual decommissioning of the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights. The Government is clearly bereft of any policy to deal with its inevitable shut down. The Director of External Affairs at ANSTO said in a letter to Greenpeace dated 10 April 1991:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
        The decommissioning of HIFAR has to date only been considered in general terms. No detailed assessments have been undertaken and there are no proposals to decommission either of the two reactors operated by ANSTO.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decommissioning of HIFAR will result in wastes that will have to be dealt with. Some of the wastes will be medium and high level radioactive waste. Such waste will remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, the Government faces some very important decisions in the next few years in relation to the nuclear industry and the waste generated by its activities. The legacy of its decisions will be felt for some tens of thousands of years to come. That is a fact that is almost impossible for us to comprehend, but one which is nevertheless the incontrovertible truth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian community is little informed about these issues, a fact which reflects badly on the Government. Decisions are made about Australia's future role in the industry with no attempt to engage the public. In fact, by passing the ANSTO Amendment Act, the Government and the Opposition which supported it, showed that are both intent on minimising public input and, at the same time, maximising protection for the nuclear industry in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his presentation to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the Minister for Science and Technology, Ross Free, dismissed concerns that ANSTO would be seeking commercial return for operating a nuclear waste storage facility.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats have become very sceptical of these types of reassurances coming from the Labour Party, the Party which has failed to deliver on the vast majority of its green promises given at the last election. I note that on the same day that the draft report of the Independent Panel on Intractable Waste was released by Mrs Kelly, recommending that no further toxic waste should be exported from Australia, she granted a six month licence to allow 1,000 tonnes of PCBs and pesticides to be exported to France.
       </para>
       <para>
        This example hardly gives us any sort of comfort. If the Environment Minister is happy to enter into a toxic waste trade, it is not hard to believe that the Science and Technology Minister would be happy to enter into a radioactive waste trade agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many people would be horrified if they realised the ramifications of the ANSTO Amendment Act and the intentions of the Government to export spent fuel for reprocessing and to import high level radioactive waste. It is not in the realms of fantasy to envisage Australia becoming a dumping ground for radioactive waste from other countries. Countries such as Japan and Indonesia are embarking on an accelerated program of nuclear power production. Will Australia, with its vast outback, be pressured to accept their waste? Will people within the nuclear industry and the Government promote Australia as an ideal dumping ground for waste, in return for the supposedly vast sums of money this could bring to the country?
       </para>
       <para>
        These deep concerns have lead me to table this Bill which seeks to ensure that Australia does not go down the nuclear waste road. It bans outright the export and import of radioactive waste. As I mentioned earlier, the Independent Panel on Intractable Waste has recommended that Australia cease to export intractable waste as it is an entirely unethical activity. Similarly, if Australia is to operate a nuclear research reactor, the merits of which I do not wish to debate here and now, then we must take responsibility for the waste produced and not dump it elsewhere. Conversely, we should not accept anyone else's waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend this Bill to the Senate.

        I had hoped that I would not need to present this matter as a motion to be debated, but that it would be taken as formal. My reason for presenting it is the urgent concern that is presented by Mr Gusmao's arrest in East Timor, the failure of the Indonesian Government to allow access to him, the failure of the Indonesian Government to answer the questions that are being asked in the international community regarding his whereabouts, his health and his access to legal counsel and the refusal by the Indonesian Government to allow representatives of the International Red Cross or members of his family to visit him.

I have received—as I am sure have other honourable senators—requests from many people who are concerned about the situation in East Timor, amongst them the Ambassador of Portugal. I have also received information through the Asia Watch information service that calls on us to support any efforts to press the Indonesian Government to allow immediate access by lawyers, international humanitarian agencies and the media to Xanana Gusmao in support of the independence movement and the human rights of that situation.

There are genuine concerns for their well-being and that of the resistance leader. I call upon members of the Senate to support this motion. I believe that it is one way of making it known that pressure is being placed by the Parliament on the Australian Government and on our Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, to take seriously the situation in Indonesia and to call for some redress to be offered for Mr Gusmao.

         —I will briefly speak to the motion to suspend Standing Orders. Just to make it clear, that is what we are talking about at the moment—a motion to suspend the Standing Orders. In my view there is no doubt about the significance of the issue about which we are talking. I accept the genuineness of the concerns of, I suspect, every senator. Certainly everybody I have spoken to—and this includes a wide range of Australians of all different political viewpoints with different views about the situation in East Timor—is concerned at the very least about the civil rights of Mr Gusmao and, beyond that, about possibly wider issues concerning East Timor. It is an issue that warrants being taken seriously. But that does not establish that we should suspend Standing Orders now to debate and, if supported, carry this motion.

         Former Foreign Minister Bill Hayden said in a different context that, in foreign affairs, words are bullets. We have to tread very carefully in this matter. We can take the issue with equal seriousness without all agreeing about a particular motion. The normal processes by which consultation takes place with the Foreign Minister and others whereby we get an agreed resolution should continue to operate here before we have special motions of this type. It is a very important issue, and I do not criticise anybody for raising it. But I do not think today we should be suspending Standing Orders to deal with this issue, notwithstanding its importance. We have a lot of other important issues to deal with. We all have the genuine concern that Senator Chamarette has about this matter, but the suspension of Standing Orders today is not the appropriate procedure for dealing with it.

Yesterday I moved a similar motion of concern about the situation in East Timor and, in particular, about the fate of Xanana Gusmao. However, I support Senator Chamarette's motion for the suspension of Standing Orders for the debate and passage of her motion because I believe it addresses the concern for diplomatic niceties and requirements that Senator McMullan referred to.

Senator Chamarette's very carefully worded motion should not require the suspension of Standing Orders because it should have been supported around the chamber. It is the sort of motion that a government that was really concerned about the fate of this political prisoner and about human rights for East Timorese generally under the Indonesian regime should welcome. Coming from one of the Houses of this Parliament, it should be seen as giving strength to the arm of a government negotiating on the issue of human rights for the East Timorese people.

         I support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. I believe that all parties and all senators in this chamber who have expressed concern about this issue should find it simple and useful to support Senator Chamarette's motion. If the motion had been declared formal in the normal way, the suspension of Standing Orders would not have been necessary.

         I suppose that I am calling into some question the commitment of this Government in this area. The recent exclusion of a visit to East Timor by an Australian parliamentary delegation in Indonesia is a example of the sorts of hurdles that have yet to be overcome. Now that this arrest has taken place we may have some of the answer as to why that delegation was not permitted into East Timor some weeks ago.

         There is a need for this chamber to push issues relating to East Timor in the context of our relationship with Indonesia. After all, this week has not only seen the capture of Xanana Gusmao; it has also seen the first explorations for oil in the Timor Gap. This chamber was party—I might say that at the time this went ahead without my vote and without the vote of any of the Australian Democrats or of then Senator Vallentine—to the passage of the treaty which has allowed this country and Indonesia to divide up oil which rightfully belongs to the people of East Timor.

         —Very briefly, the coalition will be opposing Senator Chamarette's motion to suspend Standing Orders. We are satisfied to date with the actions that have been taken by the Australian Government after this arrest. It has sought assurances from the Indonesian Government at high levels. We have been told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) that those assurances have been given. It is obviously a matter that the Parliament would want to monitor, certainly in view of an unfortunate record, I think, in relation to human rights in East Timor over a long time.

         Nevertheless, the assurances that have been given and some actions that were taken by the Indonesian Government after the killings in East Timor give cautious reason for hope. Therefore it seems to me that debate on the issue at the moment is premature. I would not want that to be misinterpreted because, as with all parliamentarians here, I am concerned that this particular man be dealt according to proper process and fairly. But I would not want to prejudge that he will not be, particularly in the circumstances of the assurances that have been given by the Indonesian Government.

         There is some suggestion that there may be an opportunity for consultation as to the detail of a motion that the Senate might consider some time in the not too distant future, and I would certainly be pleased to be party to such consultation. I actually have some difficulty with part of the drafting of the motion that would be debated today if Standing Orders were to be suspended. For obvious reasons, I think it is probably better that such issues of differences of language be dealt with out of the chamber rather than through the form of amendments here today. So, if such consultation is initiated by Senator Chamarette or others, I would be pleased to be a party to it and see whether a set of words could be agreed. But suspension at the moment to debate this issue in full is premature in view of the fact that I think the Australian Government has made the right representations and so far, at least, has received the right assurances.

I think it did something intelligent when it set half an hour for debate with five-minute speeches on the suspension of Standing Orders and allowed senators to range from the question of suspension to the substantive issue.

         I was interested to hear Senator McMullan quote the Governor-General's observation about words being bullets in foreign affairs. If words be bullets, well then let us fire some back at the Indonesians because, by God, they have fired enough at the East Timorese people. I think it is about time we stood up and took more note of things like civil liberties and the rights of the East Timorese people rather than the economic relationships that we might have with the Indonesians. Senator Powell noted a moment ago our overweening concern with the possible discovery of oil in the Timor Gap. Senator Powell pointed out that she, the then Senator Vallentine and the Democrats voted against the treaty.

         Ever since our foundation the Democrats have taken the view that the East Timorese have a right to their own territory and that we should have stood up much more solidly for the rights of the East Timorese against the Indonesian people. There is nothing whatsoever in the history of the East Timorese people or, indeed, in the history of the people of West Irian or West New Guinea which gives the Indonesian people a natural right to occupy those territories. I am ashamed that Australia has taken the attitude that it has ever since 1975. If we had taken a more forthright attitude then, I believe that we may not be in the difficulty we are in now.

         There is no doubt that Mr Gusmao is an extremely brave man. As Senator Powell has pointed out, his family have been living in Australia; they have been separated from him over a long period. He is a man who is fighting for the independence and the rights of the men and women of his country. There is nothing, particularly in the recent history of the Indonesian treatment of the East Timorese, to give us any confidence whatsoever that he will get fair treatment. We therefore, as a separate and sovereign nation with some relationships with Indonesia, have a responsibility to put very very strong pressure on the Indonesian  people  to  ensure  that  Mr Gusmao's rights and safety are protected.

         One need only reflect, of course, on the recent remarks of the new governor of East Timor that—and I think I am quoting him more or less correctly—more people should have been shot in Dili just over a year ago.

Indeed, it would have been a very useful bullet for this Government and this Parliament to fire back at the Indonesian people.

         —I will be very brief. As the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) and, before him, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator McMullan) have said, there is grave concern about the fate of Gusmao. This view is also held by people who would quibble about one aspect of this notice of motion. Nevertheless, this concern needs to be expressed not only by the Government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) but also by the representatives of the people—that is to say, this Parliament. I was very encouraged to hear what both the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition said and the indication by both of them that ultimately there needs to be an expression about this issue.

         This is an urgent issue. At the present moment we do not know the fate of Gusmao and we should be asking for representatives of the International Red Cross and his family to visit. Our relationship with Indonesia is broad enough, strong enough and mature enough for it to understand a resolution by this chamber calling upon it to adhere to international standards of human rights and its own code of criminal procedure in this case, as well as in cases of persons who have been arrested in connection with Mr Gusmao's arrest. That is what Senator Chamarette has been saying. I believe that our relationship with the Indonesian Government is mature enough for it to accept that indication. It is a matter of urgency.

         As has been indicated, this has been a fruitful exercise thus far. It is important that Senator Chamarette understand that, if the matter then comes back to us in a day or so, we can then get a unanimous resolution about the issue. It is obvious that at the moment we will not get a unanimous decision, even if the motion for suspension is adopted. I would like there to be a unanimous decision. That is not to say that we are likely always to achieve that; but on issues of human rights, over the years this chamber has stood up for individual human rights. That has been one of our major roles. Our roles have been to stand up for the rights of the States and for individual human rights. Most of us stand up for the rights of the States, either in this chamber or in party meetings, committees and so on. We should stand shoulder to shoulder for our States in this chamber more often. In this chamber we can exercise that function very firmly and stand shoulder to shoulder in support of human rights, not only within Australia but also elsewhere. That is another important function, and it is in the exercise of that function that we are likely to shine.

       This is a most important matter, Mr President. As you are aware, the Democrats and the Labor Party conspired on 17 November to force the guillotine on the considerations by the Senate of the Appropriations legislation. In so doing, almost $1 billion of expenditure was not subjected to the appropriate appraisal, scrutiny and checking by this Senate. In particular, the appropriations of the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy were not considered in the Appropriations debate.

        It is very important to ask why the Australian Democrats in particular would have taken such an important decision and created such an important precedent. By forcing the guillotine and denying the Committee of the Whole the proper consideration, a number of very important issues were not addressed by way of debate, as they ought to have been from the reservations that had previously been considered. If one looks at the proposed running sheet for both the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, some very important issues were to have received the consideration of the Committee of the Whole. Under Industrial Relations, there were payments to members of the building industry working group, industrial relations activities in schools, the activities of the Australian Trade Union Training Authority, the activities of the Construction Industry Development Authority, particularly its business plan, and the remuneration structures and conditions of the Australian Public Service. Obviously, the Australian Democrats did not want to turn their attention to any of those very important issues.

The Australian Democrats made a decision not to consider such important industry issues as petroleum, particularly the application of the diesel fuel rebate scheme.

        Firstly, that statement fails to take into account that we had the full, normal Estimates committee process for both departments; they were both dealt with in the Estimates Committee process. This is the second version. The second thing is that the failure to deal with these matters is in some way considered to be the responsibility of the Government and the Democrats, who allowed 200 hours for the consideration of Estimates.

        There has never been an Estimates process that gave more time to the Senate to consider appropriations than this. There has not been a more generous allocation. It is simply that those opposite blew it. This is a resolution designed to satisfy the internal tensions in the Opposition, which knows that its members wasted the time. They blew it pursuing red herrings, going off at tangents and chasing irrelevant issues when they should have been concentrating on issues they now think are vitally important. They had the chance and they blew it. I hope the Senate does not give them a second chance.

        We all know the motives of the Opposition in recent weeks. They are to ensure that the Government gets as little of its legislation through as possible and to frustrate the processes of government. When the count was made last week, it was found that we had had something like 19 1/2 hours only on all the other legislation before this Parliament—roughly, a ratio of 10:1 on appropriations and all other legislation put together. The Opposition has been very effective in frustrating the proper processes of this Senate. However, we certainly will not be party to frustrating the proper scrutiny of the $800m to which Senator Tambling referred. So while we object to his invective or his castigation of the Democrats—we find it totally without foundation—we will indeed be supporting this motion.

        I want to tell it like it is. It was obvious after the first six months—probably even earlier than that—following the last election, or by the end of 1990, that we were in the 1993 election campaign in this chamber, and in the community. If the election spending figures, when they come out after the next election, are to be accurate figures that really tell what was spent in running the Federal election for 1993, they should include at least half the costs of this Senate since the last election. Since about December 1990, an election campaign has been conducted in this place. The Opposition has got away with it because the discipline in this chamber and internally within the parties has not been strict, and discipline has not been imposed by the numbers which would be available through the Government and the Democrats.

I have not checked completely, but my memory is that the passing of Supply has not been achieved by the Parliament and the Government before 11 November in any of the years that I have been here since 1986.

But irresistible temptations seem to strike both sides of the chamber. Even within a 20-minute speech one can find a great deal of repetition.

        Ultimately, we say that it does not make a great deal of sense to simply focus on one aspect when, although we have not done research on this in recent times, one would find that relatively very few speeches exceed the 20-minute limit; there are occasional ones. But there are a number of other reasons why we can say that time gets taken up in a whole range of other areas that have nothing to do with the second reading debates. In other words, one has only to look at the amount of time that was spent on the Appropriations, the committee stage of various Bills and a whole range of other agenda items to realise that cutting back to 20 minutes the occasional speech which might have gone beyond 20 minutes will make virtually no difference.

        It is probably much more important that we focus on self-discipline. One cannot actually impose limits short of a draconian measure. We were not really forced to that point in terms of Question Time, but it was a very salutary lesson in how one can concentrate the mind if one tries to achieve a particular result. But if the result we seek to achieve here is that the time of the Senate is not taken up endlessly in verbose discussions, one has to focus on a lot more than the occasional speech on the second reading.

        Therefore, it is important that we look at a range of other areas.

The most recent episode which is fresh in the minds of us all is when we found ourselves sitting until 6.30 a.m. and I subsequently found myself on a 7.30 a.m. flight ready to do a full day's work in Melbourne and have discussions with a whole range of people.

If we examine ourselves and the way in which matters have proceeded in recent weeks, we would conclude that the reason for those sorts of extraordinary sittings has very little to do with the fact that the occasional second reading contribution has gone beyond the 20-minute limit.

        I conclude by saying that we understand what the Manager of Government Business is trying to achieve, but simply focusing on one narrow aspect is not likely to make any significant difference in the scheme of things. I would be interested to know whether he has done any research to determine how many speeches have exceeded 20 minutes in the last few months. I suspect that whilst there might be a handful, we could probably point to a difference of an hour or two at most. When we look at why we have been sitting extraordinary hours and why we are likely to in the future, we see that it has nothing to do with second reading debates. We would therefore oppose this motion and hope that there will be much more wide-ranging discussion about trying to pursue the business of the Senate in a more rational way than sometimes is the case.

With four weeks remaining—one of those four weeks being an additional week that we agreed to during the last sitting week—the Government has some 76 packages of legislation still to be debated. We still have not even seen some of those pieces of legislation. This morning we read in the press of the Government's latest position in relation to tobacco advertising. We have not seen that Bill; it has not been through our processes.

        Obviously in the run-up to the election the Government has decided that it is time it got some runs on the board in relation to certain matters. All of a sudden the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has woken up to the unsatisfactory level of violence on television being shown at certain times of the night when children are watching. He suddenly develops this passionate interest for that subject. We now find that the Government needs to take away the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, which is supposed to be debated and concluded today, in order that it might draft further amendments. The Government should just support Senator Walters's amendment and the problem will be solved.

        The Government program is a shambles. The Government has not managed it properly. There is too much work to be properly scrutinised within the time that is available. Rather than facing up to that deficiency, Senator McMullan has come in here today and said, `We can solve it by limiting the time of speeches', without any research being done or evidence put before the chamber as to whether the length of speeches has contributed to delay.

        I support what Senator Alston said. There are not many speeches in this place now that go beyond 20 minutes. But there are occasions—Senator McMullan would know this in relation to complex taxation law or other matters of great detail; there is a corporations law package coming up—when it might be necessary for a speech to be given for the full 30 minutes. It should be given for that period if necessary in order that the Senate properly fulfil its function.

        The prescription in our Standing Orders is not that speeches will be 30 minutes; rather that they will be a maximum of 30 minutes. That has within it the flexibility that is necessary in order that the process of scrutiny might be properly carried out. To attempt to restrict honourable senators to a shorter period does nothing to enhance the scrutiny function of this chamber and the case for it simply has not been made out by the Government. For that reason, we will oppose the motion.

        —One of the most interesting things about being in the Senate chamber and as an observer of human behaviour is to watch the chameleon-like face of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) who, throughout the whole of his speech, could hardly avoid taking the smile from his physiognomy. Considerable discussion went on as a prelude to this. I understood that Senator Hill personally was in agreement with the idea of a limitation of time. I do not think Senator McMullan in any sense has claimed that this will be a complete solution to the problem of filibustering, time-wasting and repetitious points either in the second reading debate or in the committee stage. However, it is a move in that direction.

        If it is the case that a large majority of second reading speeches can be compressed into the 20-minute time interval, that is an appropriate time limit to set. We will at least then save some time. Even if we get to bed 10 minutes earlier in the evening when we are going into the early hours of morning, that is something. Senator Herron was very right when he expressed concern about the very late sittings.

        The discussion which went on earlier with Senator Hill did go further. In fact, the suggestion was made that the Opposition might have only two speakers at the second reading stage, the Government two speakers, the Democrats one and the Independents one. That was something that was being considered. Clearly, the Opposition was not prepared to do that. That was put forward in recognition of the fact that it is at the second reading stage when the broad attitude to legislation is clearly enunciated. It is in the committee stage that the substantial debates occur and changes to legislation are made by way of amendment.

        It is quite appropriate to limit the amount of time in the second reading stage to 20 minutes. Several speakers from each side can fully enunciate and elaborate the attitudes of their party to a piece of legislation, bearing in mind that when they want to actually implement that general attitude by way of specific amendments they have adequate time in the committee stage. For that reason, we will support the Government's motion.

At the same time I wish to put on the record the fact that I do not believe my contributions are time-wasting or repetitious. When confronted by complex tax legislation which frequently involves hundreds of pages of new legislation and explanatory memoranda, this Senate has a duty to examine very closely what is before it. It often involves raising large amounts of revenue and putting individuals to a lot of additional administrative expense in the paraphernalia that is required under the new legislation, which can impact on taxpayers' rights and change the competitive position of various corporations within the Australian sector.

        A major development has been the referral of Bills to committees outside this chamber, where we have the opportunity of bringing in outsiders and debating some of these issues, again, somewhat under a guillotine, because time is restricted. At the same time, I think there is a responsibility on the Government not to lump groups of Bills together. For example, today the Government has introduced four Bills—Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6—to be debated at the second reading stage. These Bills involve car parking, Medicare amendment, child support and superannuation. This means that, under this restriction, there is virtually only five minutes for such legislation.

        There are lots of anomalies; there are lots of problems with certain features of this legislation. It is important that it be put on the public record at the second reading stage so that those people who are interested in coming before the Committee to discuss the Bills—which in this case would be on Friday, 11 December—have the opportunity of reading the debates to see whether their interest might be affected. Unless we can tease out a few of these issues, we are not doing our job in this chamber. Whether this motion is supported or not, I will give an undertaking to try to abide by the 20-minute rule which will apply between now and the close of business because I think this is important. At the same time, I think it is incumbent on the Government not to use the cognate principle excessively by grouping Bills together and then limiting the debate on that sum total.

If the Democrats  had  any  concern  at  all  for  the institutions of democracy, they would get on to their mates in the Labor Party and tell them to do something about this atrociously managed program that comes before us at this time every year. If Senator Coulter were concerned about these things that he talks about, why did he not get the Government—the Labor Party—to do something about the atrocious program earlier in the session? He could have encouraged the Government to bring some of these Bills on instead of leaving it until now and then joining with the Government in curtailing the free speech and the right of all members of parliament to discuss things fully.

It is a pity that the Democrats and Government Ministers did not listen a bit more to Senator Watson, because they then might understand what some of this legislation is all about. It is very obvious from the number of times that legislation has to be amended that not even the Government Ministers who are dealing with these things understand what they are about. By curtailing the likes of Senator Watson and others from fully pointing out to senators what those Bills are about, we simply lead ourselves into this situation again.

         Senator Walters said on public radio this morning in Sydney that the Government had a secret agenda, or accused the Government of having a secret agenda, in trying to get more violence on television. That was a proposition that was put to me that I had to respond to. I rejected that assertion. As I said last night in response to questions from Senator Harradine, the Government has no intention of allowing any programs to be broadcast on television under these new classifications that are currently not allowed.

If we did have a secret agenda, we would be supporting Senator Walters's amendment and not opposing it because it is just extraordinarily bad drafting, and I will explain why.

        I understand what Senator Walters is trying to do, but the amendment fundamentally not only defeats the purpose but goes 180 degrees in the wrong direction. Exactly the same wording is used in respect of sexual behaviour in clause (b) and in clause (c) with respect to bad language. The amendment specifically states that the physical and psychological violence, the sexual behaviour and the offensive language only apply for classification when all of these things are `appropriate to the storyline'.

         The amendment is completely silent about what happens when the sex is gratuitous, the violence is gratuitous and the language is gratuitous and does not relate to the storyline at all. I understand the Democrats have had their own independent advice on this which fundamentally confirms the comprehensive advice I have on it. Frankly, I do not think that the television channels would be crazy enough to take the opportunity offered to them under this amendment, but they technically can.

         Under this amendment, a program that contains loads of offensive language, loads of gratuitous sex and loads of gratuitous violence does not fall within the definition drafted by Senator Walters for AO and, therefore, is not something about which a standard could be made by the ABA under the amendment. There is a separate piece of law which prohibits X material being broadcast. But, under Senator Walters's extraordinary amendment, if a program contained gratuitous sex, gratuitous violence and gratuitous language which did not relate to the storyline but was not strong enough to classify as X, it could be broadcast instead of

         I am not suggesting that anything as bizarre as that would occur. But I am saying that the amendment is technically badly flawed and does not provide any sensible guidance to the ABA to set standards. The fundamental flaw in each one of the sections of the amendment I have referred to on language, sexual activity and violence is that it is totally silent on the question of where all this occurs and is not related to the storyline and program context and can therefore not be given a classification.

But the amendment fundamentally not only does not achieve this but also provides an opportunity, at least technically, for material to be put to air with no classification. I am sure that is not what the Committee intends to do. As I said, I do not think that any television broadcaster would be crazy enough to do such a thing, but I do think that the Committee has an obligation to support better law than this.

However, at the moment we want to wait and see what happens with the new draft—we understand it is being drafted right now—and we will have a look at it before it comes before the chamber.

The fact of the matter is that Senator Walters's amendment spells out certain circumstances in which matters can be regarded as falling within the classification of AO but if one goes beyond that point clearly they are either on one side or the other of that dividing line.

         I do not think the Minister in his wildest dreams would be suggesting that, if one had a program which contained physical and psychological violence which was not appropriate to the storyline, where the violence was unduly bloody or horrific and where it was not presented as desirable, somehow it should be PG or even the lowest level. Quite clearly, it would fall on the other side of the line.

         Similarly, with depictions of intimate sexual behaviour or nudity, we impose a number of limitations that would allow that to be classified as AO and therefore broadcast within a certain time band but subject only to those limitations. On an unlimited basis, it clearly could not be open season. All we would then be considering is the fact that it would not be allowed to be broadcast at all.

         We are agnostic at this stage about a revised classification system, because quite clearly in the Government's haste to try to stitch up some sort of eleventh hour compromise we have not yet had the opportunity to see the various definitions of the categories. That is one of the major concerns of Senator Walters. If we assume good faith, if we assume that AO as it currently exists on television is simply subdivided into M and MA, one can understand the logic of the softer levels of violence being classified as M and therefore being allowed to be broadcast earlier than those that are classified MA. But if the Government does not act in good faith and then redefines MA to include matters that currently cannot be shown at all on free to air television, one would then have a fundamentally different situation.

         Clearly, no-one ought to be in the business of giving the Government a blank cheque. Clearly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been ducking and weaving on this issue for some days now. Our amendment is simply in line with his original starting point. It is designed to ensure that we do not allow the level of gratuitous violence that is currently able to be shown at 8.30 in the evening to continue to be shown. All sides now accept that there has to be a better way.

         In those circumstances we are simply putting forward a formula that would enable certain matters to be deferred until 9.30 p.m. and others to be out of court altogether. Ultimately, the reclassification system is one we will look at carefully. To the extent that it does pick up those concerns, and particularly Senator Walters's concern—that nothing is able to come in via the back door which is not able to be shown on television at all at the moment—then we may have the makings of a better approach to the game.

         Certainly, at the present time, I think one could say that the system is a shambles. The Government has allowed this to continue for years. Clearly, the Prime Minister, in raising this matter, was seeking cynically to milk community concern on the issue as a desperate diversion from the state of the economy. Having done that, and having run into some opposition in various quarters, he is now scrambling for a compromise. We do not know the details of that. Senator Walters quite rightly expresses concern that, until we have seen the whites of their eyes and the precise classifications, it is impossible to make ultimate judgments.

         , which shows that 72 per cent want violent adults only television material to be screened after 9.30 p.m. That is what I think is at issue here. That is why we are proposing this amendment. It is not designed to take effect immediately. We recognise that the networks do have inventories that accumulate and that should not be rendered redundant overnight. We therefore propose a starting date of 1 March to allow a sufficient opportunity for a rearrangement of scheduling of programs. But, otherwise, we are attempting to tackle the issue in a specific way which contrasts very much with the Government's absolute failure to tackle the issue at all.

         as recently as the other day. I do not know how that would be classified as being proper in the circumstances. The film-makers claim that it is making a statement. I would have thought that the true explanation is that it is making a quid. The community does not need that sort of depiction of what goes on in the western suburbs of Melbourne. That depiction does not seem to bear much relationship to real life.

Certainly, the scenery in the film, I am told, is excellent. But the beach massacre scene was clearly and utterly gratuitous; quite inconsistent with the facts of what was supposed to have happened in the circumstances, yet we had the film-makers justifying it on the basis that it was based on truth.

         I think very loose depictions of that sort get up the nostrils of most members of the community. All we are left with is film-makers  who take the opportunity to trot out some pretty savage sorts of violent scenes and then justify them on these specious bases. That is why we believe that it is long past the time when the Government can simply sit on its hands and ignore community concerns in this area. That is why we have moved to put in place a regime that would toughen up the system, but with an adequate delay so that it does not pose immediate transitional problems, and that does address the issue in a way that the Government is only now starting to deal with.

         —The Minister is interjecting, `It is not'. The ABT has told the Committee that those are its present classifications; and I can read them to the Minister. But, on the same page, it also states what is not suitable for television. So Senator Collins's comment that the commercial television stations could then move to more violent and more explicit visions on television is totally incorrect because the present classifications say that those are not suitable for television.

         All I did was to use the present classifications that are in this book I have before me which contains the classification criteria presently being used. On that same page, as I say, there is the classification that is not suitable for television. So the industry could not move to stronger stuff. The industry has already got its classification criteria that prohibit it from doing so. The Minister's statement about that is also totally incorrect.

         There is great confusion. I have never said that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has done this deliberately. Senator Collins must agree that last night I said that I believed he had been led up the garden path. He did not understand, nor does the majority of the community and nor does the majority, by far, of members in this place. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal put out a report in September this year, which states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is also a certain amount of confusion surrounding the AO television and M cinema-video classifications caused by the fact that the AO classification designated as being for 18 years plus is, in fact, more restrictive than for all but the mildest of M classified films which are designated for 15 years plus.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is pointed out that there is great confusion between AO and M. It acknowledges that AO is more restrictive—it is far more restrictive—than the majority of M. The report states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . more restrictive than for all but the mildest of M classified films . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The report then goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We propose that, for the purposes of television broadcasts of M classified material under self-regulation, broadcasters adopt a system—
       </para>
       <para>
        and this is where Mr Keating got it from; he did not dream up his division of M, as he pretended he did; this is where he got it from—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        which splits the M classification into two categories, with the milder material in the lower M range being equated to the current AO. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Because that is all it would be equated to—the current AO; and do not forget that he wants that shown at 8.30 p.m.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So we have got nowhere. The lower M range equates with the current AO classification, so AO material will still go on at 8.30 p.m. The material in the upper M range, which includes the stronger depictions of sex, violence and coarse language, will be restricted to being broadcast in the unmodified form only after 10.30 p.m. What Mr Keating has fallen for is that that material will go on at 9 p.m., not at 10.30 p.m.

         The reason for my putting this forward is that the so-called proposal—the Democrats have called it a draft, but it is not a draft—which the Government put forward late last night gives us nothing, explains nothing and does not answer the question I put to Senator Collins last night. He asked his advisers the answer and they all shook their heads because they did not know. The question was: what are they going to do? Are they going to reclassify G, PG, M and R? Or are they going to stick with the G and the PG and only reclassify M in total, dividing it into two? If they are going to reclassify M in total, they will have to reclassify R. R then has to pick up the extreme violence and extreme explicitness that is pushed out of M.

         The fundamental question that I want the Minister to answer today is whether G, PG, M and R as presently classified for video and films are to be totally reclassified and M divided into two. If we do not do so, we are back in a worse position than we are in at the moment because we are allowing AO, or the equivalent lower category of M, to be shown at 8.30 p.m.—not 9 p.m.—and the very violent stuff that presently cannot be shown on television to come on at 9 p.m, not 10.30 p.m., as the ABT has recommended. The Minister has to understand that, according to the last survey, 72 per cent of the population could not care a fig that the commercial television channels might lose some money. I heard the Minister say this morning that they would lose hundreds of millions of dollars. That is not what they say.

         —No doubt the Democrats, including Senator Bourne, will want to make their own points about this matter. Senator Bourne has already indicated that the Democrats will not support this amendment. I say with the greatest respect to Senator Walters—and I am not suggesting that she is personally at fault—that I have the ABT classifications here in front of me and that I do not understand why those definitions simply were not lifted and used. The problem in a nutshell is that the classifications in the ABT guidelines are cast in the positive mode, whereas the same classifications in terms of the language of the drafting in the amendment have been cast in the negative mode. That is the difficulty.

         The difficulty is simply with the drafting, and I am not suggesting that it is any more than that. The positive mode that is used in the ABT criteria has been turned on its head for some reason by the drafting and cast into a negative mode, which leaves silent the question of what happens to all these things when the violence, sex or language is not related to the storyline, whereas in the positive mode in which it is cast by the ABT guidelines that is not a problem.

         I repeat the substantive point, which was raised by Senator Harradine last night: I am not suggesting that this amendment in the real world is going to cause a problem. We have an obligation where we know the drafting could be better to draft it better. I hear what Senator Bourne said about being prepared to support a proposal like this if it is more appropriately drafted. I conclude by saying again categorically for the third time that, whatever the classifications are that are determined in the work that has already commenced, the Government will not permit anything to be screened at any hour on television currently which is currently not permitted to be screened at those hours.

         —Can we get it clear? The Minister commenced his second last contribution by saying that one of the reasons the Government is not supporting this amendment by Senator Walters is that the amendment will allow to be screened on television violent material which is gratuitous. That is what the Minister said. I would like to know where he is getting that advice. I am rather concerned about the advice that he is getting. Last night I believe I was able to indicate that the advice that is being given to him or to the Prime Minister has been faulty. I point out to the Minister, as he should know, that the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 enables the new ABA to determine questions of program standards prior to the development of codes of conduct by the industry. I have a document in my hand, dated 1 October 1992, by the new Australian Broadcasting Authority, which says that the provisions of subsection 21 (4) of the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 establish standards which have effect under Part 9 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.

         One of those standards is TPS standard 10, television program standard 10. TPS 10 says that material which is not suitable for television is that with explicit and gratuitous depictions, unduly bloody or horrific depictions; that is, in respect of physical, psychological and sexual violence. That material, under the decisions of the ABA, is prevented from being broadcast or televised. When I say that it is prevented from being televised, I realise that one or two stations might get away with it, but it is a breach of their licence.

         Perhaps I am misunderstanding what the Minister says, but I cannot understand how the Minister can get up here and say that, because of the amendment moved by Senator Walters, gratuitous violence will be allowed on television. I just cannot understand that because the new Australian Broadcasting Authority has determined that TPS 10, television program standard 10, which theoretically rules out this material, is to be observed by the commercial television stations. I would like a further explanation. If the Minister has been wrongly advised, I wish he would ask his advisers to give him the proper advice.

The substantive reason that the Government is opposing this amendment is that we disagree with it, and the fact that we are proposing an alternative which, in fact, we have provided for this morning in the change of the order of the business in removing a Bill from the package in order to have a substantive debate on the detail of what the Government is proposing, which will be done expeditiously.

I invite Senator Harradine to compare the positive way in which the current ABT guidelines are cast with the negative manner in which these amendments have been drafted.

The Chief Censor of Australia, Mr Dickie, is in my office as we speak. He arrived from Sydney early this morning and I have already had one discussion with him. Later today, we will also be meeting with Brian Johns, the Chairman of the ABA. We will come back into this Parliament with a completely detailed explanation as to what Senator Walters wants.

         But I have developed—and I do not mind saying it in here; Senator Harradine has some concerns apparently about some other individuals in this office—a very high regard indeed for the level of advice provided by Mr Dickie during my time as a backbencher on the classifications committee. I think he does a commendable job in this important and very difficult position. I want the best possible advice that he can give me. I am not going to be foolish enough to make off the top of the head statements on my own in here this morning about whether classifications are going to be this or that under this proposal, because I want the highest level of expert advice from people who do this for their daily bread and are experts in it before we debate the matter in the Parliament.

         I cannot be more explicit about that. I do not know how many more times I have to say it. The detail Senator Walters is seeking will be brought back into this Parliament as an amendment to the Bill that was removed from the package this morning. It is a matter for the conduct of this chamber to determine what is debated, but my desire would be to have this legislation back in here no later than next week. Senator Walters can then examine the detailed proposals the Government will be putting in respect of classifications after we have taken the expert advice that we are taking, and that process has already begun. I am not sure what else I can add to the debate.

         —I will be very brief. We all agree that there is widespread concern about the amount of violence and sexploit material on television. That has been expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and I give him credit for expressing that. He took the opportunity of addressing the Family Summit and made certain statements about this matter at that summit. It is clear from reading that address that he has gone further than the ABT was indicating. The ABT indicated that classification M should be split into two categories, one of M and the other MV—M Violent. As the Prime Minister said at the Family Summit, parents are also concerned about the level of sexploit and drug use material on certain television programs. He is proposing that the classification be split into M and MA. I am not sure what the `A' stands for, but I assume that MA is mature adults. In so saying, the Prime Minister also indicated that this provision would be mandatory, not just recommendatory.

         He also indicated to the Family Summit that penalties should be imposed for allowing persons under the age of 15 to view that sort of material. That assumes that he is talking about material for cinema, not material for television. Last night the Minister indicated to me that it is not the intention of the Government to allow material that is currently not allowed on television to be screened, either at 9 o'clock, 10.30 or whatever. I understand that, but from reading the recommendations that came forward as a result of the discussions between the Prime Minister and the industry last night, which were presented to the Parliament last night in an amendment by Senator Collins to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I am very concerned that those provisions are opening the way for worse material to be shown on television and for certain types of AO material to commence at 8.30 and the remainder at 9 p.m.

        That is inconsistent with what the Prime Minister told the Family Summit. As I indicated, he told the Family Summit that MA would not be voluntary or recommendatory but mandatory and that there should be penalties for people allowing children under the age of 15 to view such material. Unless we are going to put policemen in every home, I do not think he means that that is for television. I think what he means is cinemas allowing the material to be shown. I accept what was said by the Prime Minister. The proof will be in the pudding, of course, when the legislation comes back.

         Senator Walters has asked a valid question. If this material is going to be so re-categorised, how much of it will go into R and how much will stay in M? These are critical questions that need to be considered, and that must be addressed. We have been given different views by the Film Censorship Board and the ABT in respect of this matter. I am not reflecting at all on personalities or particular individuals, whether it be Mr Dickie or Mr Haines. I am saying that they have given different statements on different occasions in respect of this matter. I am asking the Government to be careful and run a very fine toothcomb over the legislation. I will not take up the time of the Committee now showing what they said on one occasion and what they said on another occasion about AO and M classifications. Clearly, the issue is who interprets it. The Film Censorship Board—the Office of Film and Literature Classification, as it is wont to call itself—has a different, broader and more liberal interpretation than the ABT had, and I assume that that is where the problem lies.

         These matters will be canvassed, but there is every reason for the Committee to support the motion moved by Senator Walters at this point in respect of AO programs not commencing before 9.30. That would be an indication to the House of Representatives of our great concern about the matter. After all, it is putting into legislative place the expressed views of the Prime Minister.

         —What Senator Harradine says is correct, and the Government will be looking very carefully at the difficulty. Consistent with what Senator Harradine has said, clauses 4 and 7 of the motion I moved last night specifically raised for that reason the probable requirement for the product to be modified for television. We do anticipate that there will have to be a change. What we are trying to do, and I think it is supportable, is to have a generally consistent classification. In other words, rather than have M, MA or whatever and then a completely separate description of AO, these classifications should be made broadly consistent. But we have anticipated the possibility that this will have to be further modified for television.

I agree with Senator Harradine's statements; there may have to be this advice, and we have already noted it in terms of where we are proceeding with this. In terms of getting a consistent view between the various agencies, the very purpose for which we are meeting with the heads of those agencies today is to get a consistent view.

        This first amendment relates to the obligations of, in the first instance, the ABA and, secondly, the Trade Practices Commission, and then at what ought to happen as a result. If one looks at the Bill, one finds that proposed section 93 allows the Minister to determine an allocation system for satellite licences allocated before 1 July 1997; in other words, the three licences the Bill deals with—A, B and C.

         Before the Minister can do that, the ABA must request the Trade Practices Commission to provide a report under this section. The Trade Practices Commission would consider whether there had been a contravention of proposed section 50, which is to deal with monopolies, and whether or not there had been an authorisation granted; in other words, whether in its judgment a party ought to be exempted from the requirements of section 50. If that request is then made and the Trade Practices Commission provides an adverse report, there does not seem to be anything that would then require the Minister to take that into account. In other words, it is something that happens; he can take it or reject it, but otherwise ignore it.

         It seems to us that that does not make a great deal of sense. If the Trade Practices Commission were of the view that there were no grounds for an exemption, that indeed there was evidence under part IV, which deals with mergers, monopolies and other forms of anti-competitive activity, particularly exclusive dealing, those views ought to be taken into account. Therefore it would not be proper for the Trade Practices Commission, having come to the view that a licensee for A or B, or the consortium that comprised the licensee, should be required to comply with the requirements of the Trade Practices Act, to be ignored. In the event that the TPC did not give a clean bill of health to the consortium arrangements—on the face of it the Government would not seem to be contemplating that it should, otherwise there would seem to be little point in requesting a report from the TPC—in the event of an adverse report being received, it would seem logical to have that taken fully into account.

         Our amendment would mean that licences should not be granted where the Trade Practices Commission had declined to give a clean bill of health to the composition of the consortium. In those circumstances, it seems only reasonable that the Minister should follow through on his first requirement. Otherwise, all he is doing is saying, `We will require a report, but if the report is adverse we will ignore it'. That does not seem to us to make any sense.

         I hope that the Government will see the logic of the argument. It is certainly not designed to frustrate the process. In no way would we anticipate that this could cause difficulties. If the Government were not minded to support this, presumably the Government would be saying that either it did not accept the bona fides of the TPC or that it ought to be up to it to override the recommendations. That does not seem to make a great deal of sense either.

         Our amendment is simply a logical extension of the requirement for the TPC to tender a report and for that report to be fully taken into account. If it says that there are not problems in terms of mergers and monopolies or anti-competitive activity, then clearly there is no impediment to the granting of the licence. If, on the other hand, it takes the view that there is a problem, it seems utterly incongruous nonetheless then to ignore it and grant the licence notwithstanding. One might as well not have had the view of the TPC in the first place. I will certainly be interested in the Minister's explanation of why the Government has stopped halfway in that sense.

         —The Government opposes the amendment simply because, in our view, it is unnecessary. The Broadcasting Services Act provides for a new and very innovative extension of the role of the Trade Practices Commission. However, in the Government's view the role of the TPC is rightly confined to that area because the legislation addresses competition policy concerns for satellite services by ruling out existing media players for the licences.

         The Government has taken, if you like, pre-emptive action in respect of the legislation. We have ruled out existing media players from licence A and provided for the ABC to hold licence C, thus confining existing media players and telcos to licence B. The TPC has a very wide role under the pay TV regime. The initial allocation of licences A, B and C do not fall under the Trade Practices Act as the allocation is an act of the Crown. As I have just said, we have already taken pre-emptive action in ensuring that there will be very wide competition for these licences. But at the same time we have introduced this innovative new section that provides for an advisory role for the TPC in any case.

         I might also say that we have provided an opportunity—and people should cast their eyes down the list of those who already hold licences—for people to broadcast with other technology in respect of pay TV.

But outside those allocations, all actions under the regime and activities by those involved in pay television, including by these licensees, fall within the ambit of the TPC.

         The Trade Practices Commission will be concerned about market dominance. In a situation where three satellite licences are being issued in a new industry, it would be very surprising indeed if the Trade Practices Commission judged that the allocation of a licence to any party would lead to market dominance when the other two licences have to be issued to independent players—the Government has legislated for that—and when further licences using other technologies can also be issued at any time. I advise the Committee that not only are a number of those MDS licences already issued, but also applications have already been received from a wide range of interests for the unallocated licences in MDS. So strong interest is certainly being exhibited.

         The allocation of those other licences not using a satellite and all satellite licences allocated after mid-1997 are made subject to Trade Practices Commission approval. The market dominance or significant lessening of competition test would apply from the outset in areas where there is no scarcity of the resource. All transfers of licences or acquisitions or mergers involving licence companies can come under the scrutiny of the TPC, and the market dominance test can be applied.

There are a whole range of licences, not just on the satellite but in other technology.

I can understand the Minister saying, `We are a sovereign Government and we can get advice if we want it at our discretion. If we want to do things, despite advice, that is a matter for us, so you can vote us out at the next election'. But why go to the trouble of requiring the TPC to consider whether there might have been contraventions, then have it reported to the Government that there are and nonetheless say, `Too bad, we'll ignore it'? It seems to me illogical that the Government would go halfway and then thumb its nose at a respected body. Either it does not bother consulting it at all, or if it does it ought to take its advice into account. There is no problem if its advice is, `No contravention; will you go ahead'. But the logic of the Government's position is that if very serious contraventions are reported—that composition of the licensee is fundamentally flawed and highly anti-competitive—it is still in a position to blithely ignore that report.

        Amendment No. 4 seeks to delete the special conditions relating to advertising. Proposed section 101 provides that there shall not be advertisements or sponsorship announcements prior to 1 July 1997. We simply take the view that it ought to be a matter of discretion. The experience in the United States, which is the best guide, is that only about 5 per cent of revenue comes from these sources. It is clearly a classic case of being sensitive to the market. If we have too much promotion, clearly the viewers will vote with their feet. They have a multitude of choices these days. In practice, the suppliers are very sensitive to the need not to have excessive advertising.

         In those circumstances, we do not see why there should be artificial constraints placed on the basis that there shall not be any advertisements prior to 1997. Presumably, they shall be allowed after that date. The Government would argue that we need some sort of start-up arrangements. It is a matter for those that we seek to protect to look after themselves. If they judge that they should not run advertising, they will not do it.

         The ban protects consumers. It will give current broadcasters a short period to structurally adjust to the new services without any major impact on their revenue. That is a sensitive matter because, as I said in the second reading debate last night, it is a matter of fact that the broadcasters, for whatever reason—I certainly would have no difficulty in saying that much of it has been through their own fault—are not in a robust state of health currently. We believe they do need time to structurally adjust without any major impact on their revenue base. We will encourage the new services to work at being different from commercial television.

         As the Opposition knows, and as Senator Alston has just quoted, overseas experience has shown that people will not pay to watch ads, and people interested in playing in this industry will not want to show ads in the early years when the subscriber numbers are low and they are building up their base. So they do not see this a being a major impost on them at all. This amendment is, therefore, in the Government's view, unnecessary, and is opposed by the Government.

We do not believe that advertisers and free to air channels at the moment are particularly sensitive to the wishes of their viewers. There is far too much advertising on free to air television as it stands, and we do not believe that allowing advertising on pay TV would, in any way, benefit consumers, who are already paying for the service just to get it without the ads. We see the period until 1 July 1997 as being quite short. We cannot see that pay TV will be up and running much before that. I would like to see that time extended and, if it comes to the point that pay TV is not even up and running before that, I would like to see this ban go on.

         —We will be opposing this amendment. As far as the Government is concerned, 10 per cent expenditure on Australian drama is more than enough in the early years of the development of this industry. Too high a levy on local content, in fact, sent Canada's pay TV broke in the 1980s. Ten per cent balances the commercial reality of pay television with the desire to foster new Australian production and inject what will be welcome new funds from pay TV, should it be successful, into Australian production.

         The Act also allows a review of Australian content in 1997 when we will know what the industry can afford. The viability of the service will be tenuous and no-one is avoiding the fact that this is a high risk new industry. It will be tenuous because of its high cost and low subscriber base in its early years. It has to be given a little time to sustain itself and we believe that 10 per cent is a realistic limit to set.

         —Not only is local content a very sensitive issue, but it is also a critical issue in terms of the survivability of those suppliers and others who come into the business. The last thing I think the Democrats want to do is impose unnecessary restrictions on those people's prospects for viability. I am more than content to set a minimum of 10 per cent, but then leave it to the viewers. In my experience, SBS provides a great range of quality that demonstrates that you do not have to have the local product to attract viewers. But if viewers have a different attitude, that will be very quickly reflected in their viewing patterns. Indeed, the pay television providers will respond accordingly.

         I do not see why we ought to be providing them with excess baggage at the very time when we are not even sure that they will be able to get off the ground. One of the concerns that one would have generally is that the Government's model is such that we may not even find licence A being viable. With all the uncertainties that lie ahead, the last thing we ought to be doing is erring on the side of weighing them down with unnecessary restrictions when it is ultimately the viewers who will be making the final judgment. Rather than providing endless monopoly protection, as the Democrats seem to be so keen on doing in other areas, I would have thought this was a classic case where Senator Bourne and I and the rest of Australia ought to be able to make up our minds and vote with our feet if necessary.

         —I will give an off-the-cuff answer to that off-the-cuff question. It seems that the largest areas of likely job loss which have been made public are in the banking sector—not under my jurisdiction—particularly two banks which have announced their intention to reduce their staff considerably. There will certainly be some volatility in the telecommunications area. I am unable to make any comment about that because, with the arrival of Optus and the generation of a whole lot of new activity in the telecommunications business, both from Telecom and Optus, it is very difficult to say what the employment situation there will be. It will probably mean a reshuffling of jobs rather than net job losses.

         There are various other sectors in which one may expect some job loss. The question of job losses in industries specifically covered by my portfolio will be very small.

The high growth export sectors—and there are high growth export sectors—obviously will be the ones which will benefit first. A recent survey by the business school at Monash University of some 400 firms shows an increase in profitability over the past year, an increase in sales, little increase in employment, but an anticipated increase in employment later this year.

         —I thank Senator Foreman for his question. Senator Foreman, of course, is a South Australian senator with a great interest in the automotive industry—an interest which most South Australian politicians on both sides of the House ought to have. Some years ago I made a prediction, somewhat courageously, that automotive exports out of Australia would reach $1.2 billion by 1992. The latest figures suggest that the automotive industry will comfortably reach that target. From January to August 1992, exports of automotive components and vehicles totalled $784m, which works out to about $1.2 billion on an annual basis.

         It is no secret that exports to the United States of the Ford Capri have fallen below expectations in 1992 because of the recession in the US economy, but exports of automotive components have made up for this. Component exports were worth $736m in 1991. From January to August 1992, they reached $519m. Some manufacturers say that recent movements in the exchange rate will help them, of course, to do even better than that.

         Last week I visited car industry companies in South Australia where the industry is making a significant contribution to growth in exports. I probably upset some Federal MPs by faxing them a list of questions on the car industry and its importance to South Australia. Many of them are worried about Dr Hewson's zero tariff proposal for the industry. But apart from the occasional break-out by Steele Hall, Dr Hewson and Ian McLachlan are sticking to their line, publicly at least.

         The question was directed to the South Australian industry particularly. Mitsubishi in Adelaide has begun exporting Magna wagons to the United States and also plans to export to Europe. The Government's export facilitation scheme underpins the Magna wagon export program—a scheme, by the way, which shadow Minister McLachlan endorsed by implication at the time it was announced in 1991. Export facilitation, of course, is linked to the level of tariffs. Zero tariffs mean zero export facilitation. Zero tariffs are an even bigger threat than that. The end result of the McLachlan car industry policy would be no exports, no industry and no jobs.

         The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority's performance indicators to the end of the September period record the continuing upward trend in stevedoring efficiency compared with 1989, when our reform program began. The stevedoring work force is now reduced by 57 per cent. Productivity measured by the number of containers handled per employee shift is now 127 per cent higher. Average crane rates in major ports are now over 20 containers per hour. More efficient terminals regularly achieve rates of 22 containers per hour and up to 30.5 containers per hour under optimum shipping and stowage conditions.

         Some commentators suggest that rates will not be sustained with higher cargo throughput from the economic upturn. In fact, WIRA's report finds that container throughput increased during this period and is now close to the peak levels of 1989-90, when serious stevedoring delays were experienced, with more than double the current work force. As I said, we are achieving world standard. In the Far Eastern trade, Australia outperforms major ports in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and the Philippines, with only Japan's Yokohama achieving better crane rates than our major ports. Our best rates of more than 30 containers per hour are on a par with US East Coast rates. These provide the target for our steadily improving performance levels. This has been done without any marked industrial disputation.

         The Prices Surveillance Authority report concludes that since 1985 the price of container services fell in real terms by 59 per cent. The Authority finds a marked break after 1990, when previously charges were static and costs were increasing. Since 1990, waterfront reform has reduced both costs and charges to pre-1985 levels. In the two years from 1990, when our reforms were being implemented, container charges declined by 15 per cent in actual terms. The Prices Surveillance Authority finds scope for further reductions as the one-off redundancy and training costs associated with the reform program are realised.

         These are significant changes. It behoves Australians to let everyone know about them. The fact that our ports are efficient means that we are in a better position to realise gains in international trade. Australia should assert that overseas because that is a significant achievement of micro-economic reform.

         —As I said in my answer to the question on notice to which Senator Chamarette refers, the Government does not know the route of the shipment. We do not expect the Japanese Government to depart from its clearly stated intention for security reasons not to tell any country what the route will be. I have, of course, seen media reports of statements from Greenpeace that the ship is rounding the Cape of Good Hope and speculation that it will proceed through the Tasman Sea. I have no independent confirmation of those reports and I certainly cannot confirm any such speculation about the route.

         As to the second question relating to stockpiling, as I have also previously made clear, the Government would not under any circumstances support the stockpiling of plutonium by Japan or any other non-nuclear weapons state. We will keep on making that point. We do accept Japan's clear statements that as a fundamental principle it will not possess any plutonium in excess of the amount required for its present and planned nuclear power program. The plutonium to be shipped from Europe will be used on an ongoing basis in Japan's nuclear fuel recycling program. We will certainly continue to monitor that situation.

         As to the third part of the question, relying on Japanese statements, we are not relying solely on Japanese reports. We have conducted our own intensive examination of all aspects of the shipments to ensure that any implications for Australia might be fully considered. We have certainly discussed the shipments with Japan. We have considered the information provided on the physical protection arrangements for the shipments. We have also discussed the shipments with the European Atomic Energy Community—Euratom—and the United States which has an agreement with Japan on physical protection and safety arrangements. Government agencies, including ANSTO, have carefully examined the arrangements. On the basis of all these exchanges and quite careful assessment of the information available, we have satisfied ourselves that the physical protection and safety arrangements for the shipments do meet or, indeed, exceed international standards for the transport of plutonium.

         As to the final question on the conclusions about stockpiling reached in the article to which the honourable senator has referred, there are two points I would make. The first one is to repeat the point I made earlier that we do accept Japan's clear statement that as a fundamental principle it will not possess plutonium in excess of the amount required for its power program. Secondly, our assessment is that there is sufficient flexibility in Japan's planned program for plutonium utilisation on both the supply and the demand sides to avoid the accumulation of a plutonium stockpile.

I will keep the Senate advised if there is any change to the position as I have described it, both in this answer and in the very detailed answer I gave to Senator Reynolds on notice the other day.

We are going through a 30-year period of low industrial disputation. It has been a declining trend since we came to government. It is a feature of Labor governments: we manage industrial relations better. The areas on the graph that show upward increases are, of course, in New South Wales and now in Victoria as a direct response to provocative actions taken by conservative governments. We certainly do know that this is all a foretaste of what would occur should those in the Opposition ever grace the treasury bench in this place and apply exactly the same industrial relations policy as that of the Kennett Government.

         The matter of industrial action in Victoria seems to me to be something which brings no joy at all. It brings Australia's record, to which I have just referred, into some question. But, in looking at what is the cause of industrial action and going to the heart of the matter, it has to be said that the Kennett Government in Victoria has to wear the responsibility fully and utterly. If it were to conduct itself as a humane Government working with people and not against them, trying to generate productivity—not picking on nurses, teachers, transport people and anyone who works weekend penalty shift rates and wanting to cut their salaries—and if it were to work cooperatively with people, not on the confrontationist model but on the cooperative model, in order to generate change, change would occur harmoniously. I think it is a matter of great regret that both the oafish and arrogant attitudes of the Victorian Government have provoked considerable industrial action in that State.

         But let me not conclude my answer with the Opposition appearing to have the moral high ground. This is the Party which wants to kick unemployed Australians off the dole after nine months. That is what it wants to do. That is a mark of its compassion. This is the Party which wants to remove the labour market support programs that, according to independent assessment, give Australians a better chance of finding work. Those in the Opposition have no compassion, no policy and no guts.

         We certainly share the concerns which have been expressed in recent times about the effect of the security situation in Somalia on the distribution of relief. I am aware of the proposals by the aid organisation, Care International, for a more active role for the UN in Somalia.

         The primary need is for some kind of political settlement or some approach which can involve not just the relief of the humanitarian situation but also peace-keeping and political negotiation at the same time. None of these things can be delivered in isolation. The task for the UN, which it still has not succeeded in so far, is to devote the kind of resources that will achieve this coordinated response and one that will produce a durable solution. I suppose one ray of hope in this respect is the UN-sponsored conference on the mechanisms of aid delivery that is now to take place in Addis Ababa on 3 and 4 December and is to be attended by the Somali factions. We will be represented at that conference. We hope very much that something positive emerges from it.

         As to the safety of Australians in Somalia, that will depend basically on the resolution of these larger questions, to which I have already referred. Our High Commission in Nairobi is in regular contact with Australian aid workers in the country, monitoring the situation as best it can to work out how to assist them. We have urged all Australian citizens who travel to Somalia to register with our High Commission so that we know where they are. We are also in close and continuing contact with the UN and all other agencies on the ground to respond to any particular situation which could put Australian workers specifically at risk.

Government purchasing amounts to a monumental $10 billion a year, and within that amount Administrative Services alone spends some $1 billion a year. We also have a pivotal role in purchasing policy and in common use contracts.

         We are keen to respond to the problem and to do so in a constructive, comprehensive and independent manner. With this in mind, I recently appointed Mr Elliott Johnston to the position of purchasing complaints commissioner. In that role he will have a number of functions to perform. He will have the role of reviewing public complaints against Department of Administrative Services decisions in an independent manner. He will have the responsibility for dealing with them promptly and he will also have an overall responsibility for ensuring probity in Commonwealth purchasing.

Why did Mrs Kelly and not the Territories portfolio Minister, Ms Fatin, announce the appointment of Mr Read, a former Western Australian State Labor MP, to a position with benefits of over $150,000 a year? Did Ms Fatin deliberately dissociate herself from the announcement because it could have been perceived as a pay-off to Mr Read, who was the Labor branch president responsible for her pre-selection in Brand, where they both live, and her failure to secure a reciprocal endorsement deal for her mate with the Labor Party in the Western Australian upper House?

A momentous task has been undertaken by the members of the Committee. Certainly it is quite evident that the energies that have been dedicated by senators here and members in the other place to its tabling yesterday have been commensurate with that task. I congratulate Senator McKiernan for his very evident capacity in shepherding the Committee to a virtually unanimous report on a whole host of recommendations. I also wish to say that Senator Brownhill, who first approached me with a view to getting this Committee off the ground, certainly deserves tribute as well.

         I have noticed the emphasis on counselling and mediation as ways to reduce not only litigation but also the bitterness associated with the dissolution of a marriage relationship. I understand—every senator would—that the sort of hurt and grievance that is experienced in relation to these matters cannot be remedied always by the Parliament or parliamentary committees. But evidently there has been a very comprehensive attempt here to ensure that a framework can be provided whereby some of the hurt can be healed and some of the grievances can be remedied.

         Reading some aspects of the report very briefly, I noted that there is an emphasis on the need to provide stability and security for children after the dissolution of a marriage. For that reason, I understand that the Committee has recommended against joint custody arrangements. I also notice that the question of access by non-custodial parents and the non-enforcement of court orders in relation to that has caused a lot of anger and frustration, as evidenced to the Committee and reported on by it. I believe that quite clearly the enforcement of those access orders needs to be tightened up by the court; that comes through very clearly from the report.

I can assure the members of the Committee that the Government welcomes the tabling of the report. We will immediately commence our consideration of the very many recommendations that are contained within it so that the sense of anguish and anger, and certainly the anxiety and sense of grievance, that is sometimes experienced by people, not only in relation to the divorce but also in relation to the operations of Family Court, is lessened as much as possible and not exacerbated by the operations of the court or the law. We will certainly try to ensure that in response to this report.

Senator O'Chee asked a number of related questions each of which was predicated on the assumption that such a meeting had taken place.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) this day, in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane on 24 November 1992 relating to terrorist groups infiltrating unions.

        I rise to take note of the answer of Senator Cook in order to clear up one point. Yesterday I made no claims about anything. I asked the Minister whether he had seen a copy of the police report which was mentioned in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         I asked a simple and straightforward question. I made no allegations against anyone. As the matter had been raised publicly in the Western Australian press, I thought that it should be brought to the attention of the Senate and the Australian people. For the Minister to say that I made claims that certain things happened is blatantly false and misleading of this Senate. I make that point in rising to speak on this matter.

         Whether the report is one or two days old or three years old is absolutely irrelevant. I believe that it is incumbent upon the Minister, in his position, to endeavour to get that report and have it investigated. If the claims made in that newspaper report yesterday are correct, they impinge on those who are innocent. For that reason, if for no other, it is the responsibility of the Minister to get a copy of it.

        The Minister has very clearly and unequivocally misled the Senate.

Indeed, after Mr Branigan had spoken to us, Senator Kernot phoned the Minister's office and said, `Is this going into legislation—Mr Branigan is unaware that this is going to happen?'. The Minister's office replied that yes, it was.

         I point out the obvious to the chamber and to Senator Walters: the arrangements that have been entered into by the networks, as reluctantly as they have been, relate to the essential elements of what has been proposed. There are three elements: firstly, a common system across all media—about time it happened—in so far as it is possible to do that, perhaps modified for television; secondly, splitting the M category into two more sensible categories; thirdly, changes to the broadcasting time of those arrangements.

         I should not have to point this out to Senator Walters, but the decision as to whether to enshrine these proposals in legislation is a matter for the Government, not for the executives of any television peak body, whether it is Mr Branigan, with the greatest respect, or anyone else. We are progressing these arrangements in consultation with the television industry, and as I said, we are progressing these arrangements as I speak. The decision as to whether we legislate will not be taken by executives of television industry bodies.

         That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to the economic impact of the greenhouse effect.

        My question today followed a question yesterday coming at the same matter from a different direction. The question today related to the world's largest reinsurance company, Munich Re, which has found that its pay-outs as a result of storm damage have increased by a factor of three- and five-fold in various areas over the last 20 years, something it attributes to an emerging greenhouse problem.

         The question yesterday related to the fact that 99 of 196 prize winning Nobel laureates had signed a declaration, along with 1,500 scientists, calling attention to the damage which was occurring to the global atmosphere, and saying that globally we needed to change our polluting habits very rapidly or we would face mass problems not only with human civilisation but with survival of life on earth.

        The answer to that question is no, it will not be reversed on the basis of a statement by a group of scientists.

The fact that scientists have made a statement about these issues will not, I think, change the Government's view.

        Today I put to the Minister the fact that this was now, according to the world's largest reinsurance company, costing money. The Government's defence of its position in relation to greenhouse all along has been that because Australia was a large producer of coal and fossil fuel and, indeed, was a very large polluter, it would cost Australia to do something about reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The point that I am attempting to establish here is that it is costing us a great deal and will cost us a great deal more if we do not do something about addressing greenhouse. For the Minister to naively weigh in the balance sheet the costs of not exporting, say, so much coal but, on the other hand, ignore the evident and increasing cost of damage as a consequence of greenhouse emissions—

I remind the Senate that we have had a major drought throughout eastern Australia for the last two years and scientists are not at all sure that the effects of the El Nino are not related to greenhouse. The effects on the Australian economy will be very large if we do not do something about addressing greenhouse. The point I want to establish is a very simple one. This Government has been stupid. It is not doing the correct sums on greenhouse. If it were doing the correct sums, it would be taking these matters very much into consideration.

        Honourable senators will recall that this question related to the Government's attitude to the strikes which are occurring in my home State of Victoria. Senator Durack's question, in summary, pointed out that the Prime Minister himself had conceded that unemployment may rise to over one million. He asked whether the Prime Minister or Senator Cook would be calling upon the ACTU to abandon its proposed union action to avoid further job losses. The Senate will recall that the ACTU has flagged that there will be a major union national day of protest, as it is called, on 30 November.

         It is very interesting that this is clearly becoming an issue of great embarrassment to the Keating Government. Senator Cook's answer in this chamber today shows the embarrassment that the Government feels. Of course, it cannot say that it supports the strike, although I believe that it does in all substantive matters, but it refuses to make any critical comments about the strike action which is occurring in Victoria, and certainly refuses to call on the ACTU to call it off.

         I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in every major strike which has occurred around this nation in recent years, the Government has been directly involved—some of us would think not helping to solve the strike but, at least in its own language, and perhaps in the minds of its own members, attempting to solve the disputes which have occurred. We are seeing in Victoria, and spreading to other States, the most damaging strikes that we have seen in this country for some years. Losses will occur to industry and business, and losses will occur in jobs as a result of this strike action.

         I would have thought that with unemployment at close to one million, any responsible Prime Minister would tell the ACTU—tell John Halfpenny—to call it off. I do not believe that is the case at all. I believe that what we are seeing is the political arm of the trade union movement—which is the Labor Party—faced with a reforming government in Victoria which is determined to ensure that trade unions operate under the same laws as other people and institutions, and determined in every way to attempt to defeat the properly elected Kennett Government.

         We are seeing Mr Keating and Senator Cook and his colleagues actively working with the ACTU behind the scenes to promote as much industrial disruption as they possibly can in Victoria in the hope that the Kennett Government's reforms will be defeated. I believe that Mr Keating and Senator Cook will start to appreciate that they cannot escape scot-free. As the disputes continue in Victoria, the blame and the public focus will inevitably swing back to what the Labor Party—the political arm of the trade union movement—is doing about it and what role it is playing behind the scenes.

In my question, I noted that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has now conceded that the number of people unemployed in Australia could exceed one million. Despite a five-minute torrent of words from Senator Cook, he did not provide me with an answer.

         Yesterday in the House of Representatives, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) asked the Prime Minister to answer yes or no as to whether he could give an assurance that the number of people unemployed in Australia would not pass one million.

        That is clearly interpreted correctly. So much for Senator Cook's attempted correction of my statement. Perhaps more importantly than that, Senator Cook was asked a simple question today about whether the Government—the Prime Minister or Senator Cook—would call on the ACTU to try to dissuade the unions from going on with this ridiculous national day of protest which can only do harm to themselves, to their jobs and to the productivity of Victoria that is so desperately in need of improvement at the present time.

         For five minutes, Senator Cook failed to answer that question, as he always does. The specific supplementary question I then asked was whether the Minister would say whether the Government supports or opposes that strike. That was another simple question which the Minister spent another two minutes not answering. Senator Cook's inability to answer questions, except by way of a torrent of words, is becoming an endemic problem. Senator Cook had two minutes in which to answer the supplementary question, but he managed to avoid doing so, even though he could have answered it in a few seconds.

         In June this year, the Attorney-General's Department advised that it seemed appropriate for my Department to take carriage of preparing a response to your Committee's Report tabled in August 1991 entitled "Aboriginal Development Commission—Legal Costs in Relation to Senate Privileges Matter". The report had previously been forwarded to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission for action but it was apparently returned with ATSIC advising that action on the recommendation made in the Report was outside its responsibilities.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         I note the (sole) recommendation in the Report that Commonwealth agencies seeking to engage legal representation from the private sector require a detailed bill of costs as a matter of course. I endorse this recommendation and can advise that the Finance Directions issued under the Audit Act 1901, for which I am responsible, already require this from Commonwealth agencies subject to that Act. Finance Direction 13B states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16">
         A department receiving a claim for payment of legal fees or costs (other than for minor amounts) must refer it promptly to the Attorney-General's Department, the local Director of Legal Services or Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, as appropriate, for assessment as to whether the claim is fair and reasonable. The department must have regard to that assessment in subsequently paying the claim.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I believe that, for the majority of the Commonwealth, this requirement more than adequately covers the recommendation made in the Committee's Report. The Finance Directions apply to all Commonwealth bodies which do not legally "own" moneys separately from the Executive Government—in practice, departments and those Commonwealth statutory authority agencies declared in the Finance Regulations to be prescribed authorities for the purposes of the Act. Many other statutory authority entities which are not legally subject to the Finance Directions find it convenient to pattern their internal financial instructions on these rules to a greater or lesser extent.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Neither the Aboriginal Development Commission nor ATSIC are subject to the Audit Act and, while it would seem a sensible practice for such bodies to accord with the Committee's recommendation, the Executive Government has limited legislative authority to interfere with the day to day administrative procedures practised by entities which Parliament has sanctioned to operate at arms length from the Executive.

         The Government's response to the Committee's report incorporates AOTC's response, a copy of which is attached.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         With regard to standards for message content (Recommendations 1-3) the Government agrees that relevant standards in line with community opinion are essential in this area. I note that AOTC accepts these recommendations in principle and is moving to put appropriate standards in place through negotiation with service providers and the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC). Clearly the Committee's recommendations on specific standards will be an important input to this process.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In relation to monitoring and enforcement of standards (Recommendations 4-7) the Government agrees with the arrangements proposed by the Committee and notes that AOTC is negotiating with the service providers and the OFLC to achieve their implementation. I have agreed with my colleague the Attorney-General that such a role for the OFLC is appropriate.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In addition, I have noted that the Telephone Service Providers Association of Australia (TELSPAA) announced that with effect from 12 May 1992 its members would remove "adult fantasy lines" from 0055, would not operate "Job Lines" that exploit unemployed people, and would support the advertising industry in developing appropriate rules for advertising of 0055 services.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government supports the substance of the Committee's recommendations in relation to consumer protection (Recommendations 8-11), although these need to be considered in the context of existing pro-consumer measures for telecommunications. At present, AUSTEL has a specific consumer protection role under the Telecommunications Act 1991 in receiving and investigating customer complaints, including complaints about charging and billing. In practice, individual complaints are referred by AUSTEL to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, to whom complaints may also be made direct.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Arrangements are currently in hand for the establishment of a Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman by AOTC and Optus in accordance with the conditions of their licences.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government believes that current and proposed consumer protection arrangements, together with commitments already given by AOTC in relation to Recommendations 8-10, provide a framework which is adequate to address the Committee's concerns. Amendment of carrier licence conditions is, in the Government's view, not necessary at this stage, but could be re-examined should the arrangements I have outlined prove unsatisfactory.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Finally, the Government agrees that all licensed carriers should be subject to the same arrangements with regard to recorded information services (Recommendation 12). I have written to the Chairman of Optus Communications indicating that should they decide to provide recorded information services, the Government would welcome their participation in appropriate industry forums, and their conformance with industry arrangements for content and advertising standards and consumer protection.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I believe that the response from the industry to the legitimate concerns expressed by your Committee is substantially resolving the major problems. Nevertheless the Government will continue to monitor this matter and, as previously indicated by Senator Richardson, will take appropriate action should current arrangements prove inadequate.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In conclusion, on behalf of the Government I thank the Committee for a comprehensive and timely report on a difficult area.

One way to commemorate that centenary would be to establish a museum at the old Parliament House with the museum the responsibility of the Parliament through the Presiding Officers.

         It is interesting to note the Auditor-General's report on Auscript and the commercialisation of the Commonwealth Reporting Service. I have expressed some concern about Auscript in the past and the way in which it appears that the predatory pricing of Auscript is starting to have a very serious effect on private sector court reporting and on reporting generally.

          Last week in the Appropriations debate I mentioned that Auscript cost the taxpayer $6.8m in the last financial year and will cost the taxpayer $4.3m in 1992-93. It is interesting that the report is critical of several aspects of the process of what is, effectively, the semi-privatisation of Auscript. One of the key findings was that the activities contemplated in Auscript's strategic planning appear to be beyond the Commonwealth's constitutional powers. It is up to the Government to say what it is doing about this.

          The questions I raised last week about predatory pricing have not been answered adequately. Senator Tate was handling this matter in the chamber last week, and he is in the chamber again today. It is time we asked about fairness and the subsidisation by the taxpayer of a service that will simply compete in the private sector. The following are the major findings:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         the activities contemplated in Auscript's strategic planning appear to be beyond Commonwealth constitutional powers. In the opinion of the ANAO, Auscript should not operate under strategies that will, if successful, result in a breach of the Constitution.
        </para>
        <para>
         My concerns remain those I have had right throughout Estimates and the Appropriations debate. Here we have another situation where the Commonwealth is placing itself directly in competition with the private sector on a very privileged basis. Let us face it: Auscript is not paying sales tax; it is not paying payroll tax; it is not paying a whole range of other taxes that private industry pays. Yet the private sector is now being regularly undercut by Auscript. The other day, Senator Tate said that that was not necessarily so. He said that it had been a matter of concern to Estimates committees over the years `because, quite frankly, the transition to the marketplace by Auscript has been far too slow'. It may have been far too slow, but what does that mean? Does it mean that Auscript should have carried out more predatory pricing at a faster rate and put some of these private companies out of business earlier than it will now obviously put them out of business?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This is a genuine concern. It is not just party politicking. This is a genuine concern for the future of these private companies, who have their own employees and who in some cases have financed their businesses over generations. The particular company in Western Australia to which I refer is a company that has gone from generation to generation. That company is now being undercut by Auscript at virtually every turn. That undercutting is being subsidised by the taxpayer. Yet the ultimate problem is that the employees of that private company will lose their jobs, effectively, on the taxpayer's subsidisation of Auscript.

          I really do need to start getting some answers on what the Government plans to do about Auscript. Last week I tried to draw the attention of the Committee of the Whole in Appropriations to particular answers I had obtained to a series of questions with regard to Auscript. Those answers related to the billable hours of total pages transcribed over 1991-92 and to revenue and expenditure for that year. When the market rate of $25 per hour is applied to 68,193 billable hours, we get a total of $1.7m. But applying the market rate of $7 per page to 767,966 pages results in a total of $5.4m. In the absence of Auscript, the commercial sector would have done the same work at a cost of $7.1m. Instead, the actual revenue obtained by Auscript was $12.6m. The Minister might say, `There is a contradiction in what you are saying because you are talking about predatory pricing which, one would suspect, is undercutting on all occasions'. That might be true, but this distortion in quoting is also making life extremely difficult for these very experienced private sector companies.

          It is not surprising that we do not have some of this material on the record, but I have now been asking for answers for a considerable length of time. I have been asking through Estimates and Appropriations, and now some of these general concerns have been highlighted in the Auditor-General's report. It is about time the Government gave us some answers on where Auscript is heading, how these private companies are expected to survive under the constant privileged pressure that Auscript is placing upon them, and whether Auscript will be totally privatised, with the Government saying, `If you want to be in that field, go in and survive on your own merits'.

          As honourable senators will recall, the AOTC annual report was tabled in this place on 11 November 1992. At that time several concerns were raised about the apparent laxity with which it seemed to be going about implementing the recommendations of the Committee. These recommendations called for the restriction of the content and advertising of adult telephone message services, which AOTC gave an undertaking to implement. Since that time, clarification of the matter has occurred and it appears that the Committee's intentions, which are shared by the AOTC, the Telephone Service Providers Association of Australia and now the Government, are being thwarted by a technical legal hitch.

It appears that stopping A.AA would involve a breach of contract and AOTC would be liable to pay damages. As the old contract is enforceable until 1996, I regard the current situation as unacceptable.

          AOTC should not have entered into the old style contract, anyway, as the provision to the general public of adult message services, with no controls on accessibility, was clearly in breach of Telecom's founding codes of conduct.

          —by leave—I support what Senator Tierney has said. The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies, in its report on telephone message services, has considered these matters, and quite a number of people have been put at great difficulty in giving evidence to us. There has been great concern in the community about certain 0055 material. It has been of concern to AOTC because it wants to see its 0055 service intact and with integrity. The Government has now responded to our Committee's report. It has supported what we recommended. We now have one company, out of all the organisations, thumbing its nose at the community.

           At present AOTC is the only organisation playing ball because it is the only one providing these services, but there is now a competitor in the field.

        IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to introduce point of entry inspection procedures for imported foods aimed at ensuring they meet Australian food standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia imports some $2 billion of food each year. The current system of imported food inspection, introduced from July 1990 under health provisions in the Quarantine Act, covers only around 10 per cent of this trade. It focuses on a small group of products assessed as high or medium risk in human health terms. It does not address the broader requirements of Australian food law.
       </para>
       <para>
        All foods sold locally must comply with Australian food law as a precondition of their sale. In practice most imported foods are subject to little checking for this purpose, and then usually by occasional sampling from retail shelves by State and municipal authorities. However, domestic product also has to comply with a network of hygiene, production and environmental requirements before it reaches the shelves.
       </para>
       <para>
        While some countries maintain broadly equivalent, effective control over their food production, others, who supply a significant proportion of our import trade, do not. Product from these sources can pose real risks. Allowing potentially risky food to reach our shop shelves before implementing control is clearly unsatisfactory.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing Imported Foods Inspection Program has found a significant incidence of non-compliance with food safety requirements in the products it covers. In its first year of operation, 8.4% of risk categorised foods failed for microbiological contamination, for the presence of mycotoxins, or for excessive levels of chemical residues. In the year just concluded the overall failure rate was 6.8%. These failure rates are, simply, too high.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are continuing claims from a variety of sources that a much broader problem exists. Reports from domestic health authorities, some survey information, and claims from local consumer and various other groups suggest a significant rate of imported food non-compliance generally with Australia's food law requirements. While indications are that much of the non-compliance is not directly safety-related, being concerned with such matters as country of origin labelling, there are disturbing reports also of obvious deterioration, contamination by filth and foreign objects, and other defects including excessive levels of pesticides, heavy metals and use of illegal additives and preservatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are claims too that product found unacceptable overseas has been redirected to the Australian market, exploiting our lack of general point of entry control.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation not only poses a risk to our consumers it also disadvantages local producers, who have to meet the costs of complying with our standards on a day-to-day basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Food Authority (NFA) whose role includes the issue of a wholesome food supply, has concluded there is sufficient concern to warrant extending point of entry monitoring to all imported foods to ensure the same safeguards are available as are required of local producers. The current Bill represents the outcome of work by the NFA and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to achieve a fair and equitable way of doing this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Imported Foods Control Bill aims at ensuring imported foods meet the same Australian food standards as local product. It will achieve this by
       </para>
       <para left-indent="16">
        first, extending point of entry inspection coverage to all imported foods; the focus will remain on public health matters, but enforcement of other food standards requirements will be included in the scope of the inspection program
       </para>
       <para left-indent="16">
        second, providing for AQIS to negotiate certification arrangements with overseas authorities where AQIS is satisfied that they operate equivalent production control arrangements to those we require of our own producers; this would largely obviate the need for inspection on arrival, although some inspection for auditing purposes would remain
       </para>
       <para left-indent="16">
        third, providing for AQIS to negotiate quality assurance arrangements direct with overseas suppliers aimed at meeting Australian food law requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The standards to apply to imported foods are those in the Australian Food Standards Code. General requirements of food safety will also apply. Risk assessment of particular food groups will remain the function of the National Food Authority and will be done on a sound and objective scientific basis. Foods not risk classified will be subject to surveillance monitoring. Monitoring intensity will reflect a food's compliance performance. Significant non-compliance may lead to the food being elevated to high or medium risk status.
       </para>
       <para>
        Current arrangements, whereby high risk classified foods are withheld from release until results of analysis are obtained, and medium risk foods allowed release subject to possible recall will continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other inspected foods will also be released once samples are taken. In many cases they will be subject only to visual inspection, particularly as compliance records are built up. There will be minimal clearance delays for these foods unless importers voluntarily hold product.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new system will maintain and build on links with overseas food import authorities to ensure information exchange on products of concern and consistency of control approaches.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new arrangements will involve, for the most part, the use of existing multi-skilled food inspection staff of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. It will add an estimated $4.5 million to current $2 million import inspection costs. These costs will still amount only to around a third of a cent for each dollar's worth of food imported, so the impact on consumer prices will be minimal. Offsetting this may be savings on costs States would face in mounting effective point of sale monitoring of imported foods to the extent they cut back on this activity—inspection at point of entry is, simply, much easier and more efficient—savings through a better control capability over defective product, savings through feedback from importers to their overseas suppliers focused on getting things right during production, and a potential reduction in health-related problems, caused by consumption of unsafe foods.
       </para>
       <para>
        Costs of the system will be recovered from importers on a fee for service basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        The system will overcome the problems inherent in a point of sale monitoring approach by different regional based bodies, including general difficulties in the coordination and uniformity of sampling, and possible redirection of product to another region if problems are found in the first, a practice known as "port shopping". It will also counter the many claims by local food producers that they operate at a competitive disadvantage where imports effectively do not comply with control requirements imposed on them.
       </para>

        I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum.

        TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this Bill follows on from the Territories Law Reform Act, which introduced major reforms to the legal regimes of the Indian Ocean Territories, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, with effect from 1 July 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth's plans for the effective and efficient administration of the new legal regime depend in large measure on the continued co-operation of the Western Australian Government. It is pleasing to note the introduction of an Indian Ocean Territories (Administration of Laws) Bill into the Western Australian Parliament on 11 November 1992, which corresponds to the Territories Law Reform Act and provides for appropriate intergovernmental arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this Bill makes minor technical amendments to the Christmas Island Act and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act, which have been requested by Western Australia, in the above context.
       </para>
       <para>
        One particular amendment relates to the manner of application of Western Australian laws. The Christmas Island Act and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act currently provide that the provisions of the law of Western Australia are in force in each Territory, so far as they are capable of applying in the Territory. Western Australia has expressed concern about possible undesirable and unintended restrictions on the applicability of some Western Australian laws, arising from this formulation. This Bill will remove references to the applicability of Western Australia law. This will not substantially affect the laws currently in force in the Territory, but removes a possible doubt as to the validity of actions under applied laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another group of amendments concerns the exercise of judicial and related powers under applied laws by Territory or State courts and court officers. The Christmas Island Act and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act currently deal differently with powers under applied laws which are vested in the courts and judicial officers of the Territories, and other powers, which are vested initially in the Commonwealth Minister administering those Acts. Provisions dealing with exercise of jurisdiction by the existing Territory courts will be repealed and replaced (by the Territories Law Reform Act) when jurisdiction in respect of the Territories is conferred on the courts of Western Australia (given suitable intergovernmental agreement).
       </para>
       <para>
        Western Australia has sought a range of amendments of these provisions, to refer to "court officers rather than "judicial officers" (encompassing officers with primarily administrative functions but possibly some judicial attributes), and to be able to deal more comprehensively and consistently with the full range of courts and tribunals of the State.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.

       <para>
        I am pleased to present the latest in a series of initiatives to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia. The problems caused by tobacco consumption cannot be denied and the Government can see no justification for promoting tobacco sales in any way.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will establish a national prohibition on tobacco advertising, expanding the existing bans in the broadcasting and print media and complementing the action of those States and Territories which have introduced their own restrictions on tobacco promotion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts about the impact of tobacco on health in Australia are clear and stark. Tobacco is the major preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. In 1990 over 18 000 people died before their time because they smoked. In addition, smoking was estimated to present an annual cost to the Australian economy over $6.8 billion in 1988. Tobacco use is clearly a serious problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, although smoking rates are declining from the extraordinary levels seen at the end of World War 2, some 28 per cent of adult Australians currently smoke. Thus, at least for the medium term future, it is not possible for the Government to simply make tobacco an illegal substance. Like powerful drugs, firearms and other legal, although dangerous, products, however, advertising of tobacco products should be severely limited. This is especially so when advertising has the effect, intended or otherwise, of persuading children to take up an addictive life-threatening habit.
       </para>
       <para>
        To coordinate national action on the tobacco issue, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments adopted the National Health Policy on Tobacco in March 1991. This policy recognises the need for a diverse range of measures to reduce tobacco related harm. Marketing, availability, taxation, education, passive smoking and cessation services are each separately addressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is the latest in a series of initiatives by this Government to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia. Achievements to date include a ban on smoking in Commonwealth buildings, a ban on tobacco advertising in the print media to extend the established broadcast media ban, a ban on smoking during airline flights and a ban on the sale of chewing tobacco and oral snuff.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the Government increased tobacco excise by over 10 per cent in the last Budget, leading to increased prices and reduced consumption. Furthermore, significant funding has been provided for education programs including the very successful `Smoking. Who Needs It!' campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to understand that removing tobacco advertising is primarily a prevention activity intended to reduce the number of children taking up smoking. Although advertising may not directly cause children to smoke, it reinforces other influences such as peer and social pressures which cause children to smoke. Tobacco advertisements glamorise smoking, making it seem like a desirable activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are reminded by the recent decision of the High Court that free speech is a value fundamental to Australia. Serious consideration must therefore be given to any restrictions on free speech, including commercial free speech. However, tobacco advertising is a clear case of where restrictions on speech are appropriate in light of the need to protect the community's health, especially the health of its children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if we accept the claim of the tobacco companies that their advertising is directed towards increasing market share, not recruiting new smokers, it is stretching credibility beyond its bounds to claim that this advertising has no effect on total consumption. Tobacco advertising supports and reinforces pressures to take up smoking and increases the difficulties encountered in quitting.
       </para>

        There is plenty of evidence to indicate that tobacco advertising increases tobacco consumption. A recent draft discussion paper released by the United Kingdom Department of Health used a variety of methods to examine the effect of tobacco advertising and reviewed existing research. One of the conclusions of this paper was that "the balance of evidence thus supports the conclusion that advertising does have a positive effect on consumption".
       </para>
       <para>
        Research has also demonstrated the beneficial effects of tobacco advertising prohibitions such as those contained in this Bill. The same discussion paper examined the effect of advertising bans in several countries. On this matter, the paper concluded that "in each case the banning of advertising was followed by a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors".
       </para>
       <para>
        Tobacco advertising in association with sport is particularly insidious as it seeks to link an unhealthy product with a healthy activity. Sponsorship of sporting and cultural activities has been exploited as an effective form of tobacco advertising. For example, a sponsor's name or logo may be recognisable for up to one third of the broadcast time of a major sporting event. One estimate is that a tobacco sponsored team received the commercial equivalent of over $4.5m worth of advertising during this year's Bathurst 1000.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will break the nexus between tobacco and sport and between tobacco and cultural activities. There can hardly be a more bizarre association than that between a product which is known to be a killer and the health giving nature of sport. This is especially so in the Australian context where sport is a vital part of our culture and where elite sportspeople are idolised, particularly by the young.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has recognised that sporting bodies may need some time to find alternative sources of funding. Hence, the Bill will allow phasing out of advertising associated with sponsorship. The elite sports can be expected to find alternative commercial sponsors readily. The fact that a range of minor sports and small scale events, including in rural areas, will also need to seek support is a measure of the degree to which the tobacco dollar has penetrated sport and culture.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government commends Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory governments for having established health promotion foundations to provide alternative funding and commends these examples to the other States and Territories. If, however, these smaller sports and events do genuinely find it impossible to replace lost tobacco funding, the Government will consider subsidising some events following the transition period.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recognition of the effect of tobacco advertising, the Commonwealth has already banned direct advertising in the broadcast and print media. Several States and Territories have banned various other forms of advertising and marketing. In particular, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales have all introduced legislation to limit tobacco advertising. This State and Territory legislation also addresses other marketing activities by, for example, banning tobacco related competitions and free samples.
       </para>
       <para>
        Different regulations addressing tobacco advertising in each State and Territory have resulted in some difficulties with enforcement. For example, national activities have needed to be exempt and there has been ongoing problems with the venue for the 500cc motorcycle Grand Prix due to differences in the legislation between Victoria and New South Wales. Thus, a national advertising prohibition is required to ensure a comprehensive approach and one which minimises any disadvantage to a particular jurisdiction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The international community is also increasingly introducing restrictions. Adoption of this Bill would move Australia from equal tenth to equal fifth in the OECD in terms of tobacco advertising restrictions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The community expects the Government to act. The Government announced in April that it would ban tobacco advertising. Recently there has been a number of calls for the promised legislation to be introduced. Recently this call was renewed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the principal medical advisory body to the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will establish a complete ban on tobacco advertising to be phased in over the period 1 July 1993 to 31 December 1995. The major additional forms of tobacco advertising to be prohibited by this Bill are:
       </para>
       <para>
        .advertising through sponsorship of sporting and cultural events (covering both naming of the event and publicity at the event);
       </para>
       <para>
        .outdoor advertising such as on billboards or by illuminated signs; and
       </para>
       <para>
        .the use of tobacco brand names, logos etc on non-tobacco products.
       </para>
       <para>
        The maximum penalty for breaching the ban is $12 000 for an individual or $60 000 for a corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill removes the potential for tobacco advertising but not to the extent that extreme measures are taken:
       </para>
       <para>
        .Accidental or incidental advertising for which the broadcaster or publisher does not receive any benefit will be permitted. For example, broadcasts of tobacco sponsored sporting events held overseas will not be affected by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        .International events to be held in Australia will be able to apply for an exemption from the ban. Such an exemption would be granted if the event has international significance and Australia would be likely to lose the event if the exemption was not provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        .Point of sale advertising will not be eliminated. In those jurisdictions with point of sale legislation, the State or Territory rules will apply. In other jurisdictions, point of sale advertising (as defined by Commonwealth Regulations) will be permitted.
       </para>
       <para>
        .Also, tobacco advertising in imported periodicals will be exempt so that these publications may continue to be available in the Australian market.
       </para>
       <para left-indent="16">
        -The Bill contains sections which, if proclaimed, would permit the Minister to specify periodicals excluded from this permission. Should it appear that tobacco companies are exploiting this exemption, these sections will be proclaimed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill, in essence, prohibits the broadcast or publication of a tobacco advertisement. It will have the effect of setting a national standard for bans on tobacco advertising. The Bill does not preclude or limit application of a State or Territory law which might apply a stricter ban.
       </para>
       <para>
        A tobacco advertisement includes any image or audio message which publicises or otherwise promotes any words or designs closely associated with tobacco products. This includes logos, brand names and manufacturer's names. Some material is specifically excluded from the definition of tobacco advertisement such as:
       </para>
       <para>
        .labelling of cigarette packets;
       </para>
       <para>
        .manufacturer's names on Company letterhead;
       </para>
       <para>
        .advertisements for specified non-tobacco products with tobacco brand names; and
       </para>
       <para>
        .anti-smoking advertisements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The act of publishing a tobacco advertisement, in addition to incorporating it in a printed document, is defined in a wide sense to include displaying or selling something containing the advertisement. A tobacco advertisement is published if it is brought to the attention of the public, or a section of the public, in some way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill creates an offence for a tobacco advertisement to be published, unless the advertisement:
       </para>
       <para>
        .is at the point of sale of tobacco products and complies with the Regulations;
       </para>
       <para>
        .is contained in an imported periodical which is not principally intended for Australia;
       </para>
       <para>
        .is associated with an exempt tobacco sponsored event of international significance and complies with any conditions attached to that exemption; or
       </para>
       <para>
        .is accidental or incidental to the publication of other matter and where no benefit has been received by the publisher for publishing the tobacco advertisement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, an independent person is permitted to publish an advertisement on his or her own initiative (eg a person may wear clothing which has a tobacco advertisement on it).
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, persons publishing a tobacco advertisement in the following categories are exempt:
       </para>
       <para>
        .advertising arising from sponsorship contracts established before 1 April 1992 which will be temporarily exempted until 31 December 1995; and
       </para>
       <para>
        .billboard and other outdoor advertising established before 1 April 1992 which are provided for by a gradual phase out period until 31 December 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        The publishing offence does not apply to Norfolk Island. The Norfolk Island administration has indicated that it wishes to be excluded from the extension to the advertising bans. In accordance with the Commonwealth Government commitment to consult, given at the time of Norfolk Island independence, only the broadcasting offence will apply in Norfolk Island. The Bill has been constructed so that a person based in Norfolk Island will not be able to use this circumstance to publish a tobacco advertisement in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Should it be necessary to proclaim those sections of the Bill concerning specification of imported periodicals, it would be an offence to import a specified periodical which contains a non-incidental tobacco advertisement. However, importing for private use or exempt library use would be permitted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part 5 of the Bill amends the existing bans on tobacco advertising. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 is amended so that it is consistent with the new bans. In addition, the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Act 1989 is repealed as the Bill incorporates the offences contained in that Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ban on tobacco advertising will lead to reduced smoking rates. The effect on the tobacco industry (growers, manufacturers, importers etc) is expected to be gradual as the major impact of the ban will be a reduction in the number of children taking up smoking rather than a sudden increase in smokers quitting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The outdoor advertising industry is also likely to be affected by the ban. In New South Wales and Queensland in particular, tobacco advertising provides a significant proportion of the income for several businesses involved in billboard and illuminated sign advertising. However, a gradual phase out of outdoor tobacco advertising in the Bill has been negotiated with the Outdoor Advertising Association of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        .Regulations will establish different deadlines for categories of signs (eg small signs are to be removed by 1 July 1993) with all signs banned by 31 December 1995.
       </para>
       <para>
        .Accordingly, the Outdoor Advertising Association has indicated that it does not oppose this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The time has come in Australia to end tobacco advertising. The passage of this legislation is among the most important health initiatives that can be taken by this Government. By supporting the trend away from smoking, it will make a major contribution to reducing illness and premature mortality amongst Australians.

        The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Pig Industry Act 1986, the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991,  the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Pig Industry amendments are designed to improve the effectiveness of the pig industry's statutory policy body in providing advice to Government and industry on issues affecting all sectors of the industry. Other minor amendments to the Primary Industry Councils Act, of an operational nature, are also proposed.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments to the Meat and Livestock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation Acts enable levy motions put to annual general meetings of industry stakeholders to be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers, and no confidence motions passed by two-thirds of total votes cast with a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill will establish the Australian Pig Industry Council under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 to replace the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council, which was established in 1987 under the Pig Industry Act 1986. This change gives the new Council enhanced powers and operational functions so that it can more effectively perform its role of coordinating and formulating industry policy. Also it will allow for funding of the Council by the Commonwealth Government.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 industry councils are required to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry; to inquire into and report to the Minister on matters affecting the pig industry that the Council or the Minister consider warrant investigation or action; to convene industry review conferences; and to convene regular meetings of chairpersons of the other relevant statutory bodies in the industry.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The passage of the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 provided the catalyst for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to review the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council with the object of improving its effectiveness.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The review found that there was a need to clarify the Council's role and functions. It found a need to improve communication of the Council's work. It suggested that the Council needed to be financially independent, and that it should be staffed full time and located in Canberra. It recommended that there should be a minor adjustment to membership to better represent those with a direct investment in the industry, with associated interest groups being accommodated through working groups.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The review also concluded that the industry needed to take a more strategic approach to securing its future.  At the moment only about one percent of domestic production is exported. Clearly, the future for the pig industry lies in developing an export orientation. The level of investment in technology in the industry needs to be increased, and greater efficiency and rationalisation in the processing sector achieved.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The review concluded that the Council would be in a better position to address these matters if it was brought under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991.

        Under this Act provision is made for the establishment of a Council and the specification of its membership by amending the Schedule to the Act. This Bill adds the Australian Pig Industry Council to the Schedule and it is proposed that the new Council will begin its operations on 1 January 1993 or as soon as possible after that date.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Besides the Chairperson, membership will include three persons nominated by the Pork Council of Australia, one person nominated from each of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia and the National Processors Association, and the Chairpersons of each of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The anticipated operating costs of the Australian Pig Industry Council, which will be met by the Government, will be about $205,000 in a full year. The present Council is funded by industry levies paid to the Australian Pork Corporation. This arrangement is inconsistent with the principle of separating industry policy development from statutory marketing authority arrangements. Government funding will remove this dependency and will bring it into line with other industry council funding arrangements.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also provides for the termination of the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and establishes transition arrangements for the orderly transfer to the Australian Pig Industry Council. These arrangements ensure that all outstanding liabilities at the date of commencement will be met by the Australian Pork Corporation. There is also a provision for the old Council to continue beyond the date of commencement for the sole purpose of preparing and submitting a final annual report to Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Bill also amends the Pig Industry Act 1986 to recognise the Pork Council of Australia as the eligible representative producer body for the purposes of Australian Pork Corporation accountability and membership of the Australian Pork Corporation Selection Committee. The industry formed the Pork Council of Australia in March 1992 to supersede the Australian Pork Producers' Federation as the sole nationally representative body of pig producers.

        At present the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Limited is represented on the Grains Industry Council by its Chairman, as provided for in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991. After introduction of that legislation the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Limited established a Food Committee, the membership of which includes major producers of grain-based food products. It is more appropriate for this Committee, rather than manufacturers of grocery products generally, to be represented on the Grains Industry Council.

        The amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1977 and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 will change the requirements for passing motions at annual general meetings. Levy motions will now be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers. Currently it requires 75 per cent vote against a levy motion put by a Corporation for it to be overturned. No confidence motions will be passed by two-thirds of total votes cast. Additionally, at least 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register must be in favour of the motion.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amendments will give effect to the Government's decision that levy motions at AGMs should be passed on a simple majority. This also has the support of the meat and livestock industry organisations.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The new arrangements will ensure that any successful no confidence motion, which represents a very serious step for the industry to take, is based on strong industry support.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In conclusion, this Bill will create an Australian Pig Industry Council that is responsive to the policy needs of the pig industry and is effective in coordinating policy input from all industry sectors to deliver an overall strategic policy direction for the benefit of the whole industry. In the case of the meat and livestock industry, AGM requirements give effect to both the Government and industry's desire to make voting requirements more democratic.

        This is an eminently sensible, reasonable and delightful amendment which I am sure I can convince everybody that they would love to accept. It does not actually say that one has to do anything except have a review. It just shows the public of Australia that we are looking after their best interests and that we are considering what is best for them and what is best for the industry. I really look forward to a bit of support on this one.

         —The Government will not be supporting this amendment. It requires an ABA review every five years. The operation of the condition relating to Australian content is already subject to a legislative review that must be held before 1 July 1997. That provision is contained in section 215 of the Broadcasting Services Act. The Government does not see much point in legislating for two reviews in 1997. The Government accepts that a review at an appropriate stage is sensible, but we feel that there is only need to legislate for one.

I take it from the Minister's polite gesture that he is not willing to support any of them. I will just explain the amendments to the Senate once more while a few of my colleagues come in here to support me. My amendments Nos 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 all support the idea that cross-media ownership rules should apply to both licences, both A and B. We believe that there are far too few people in Australia with far too much power as far as the ownership of our media—radio and television—is concerned. We think pay TV should be included in that. Licensee B should be under the same cross-media rules and foreign ownership rules as licensee A. Amendments nos 12 and 13 are on a different matter. Amendment No. 12 states:

        This means that any licensee who sets up a subscriber management system would have to make it an autonomous business enterprise and could not run it in exactly the same way as he ran his channels.

         —I suppose we are all concerned about the question of cross-media ownership. If we are going to see a situation develop, as is envisaged and forecast by some of the experts in this field, where in 15 years' time free to air television will have a negligible impact and pay TV will be the key area in the television field, then clearly we ought to be looking more closely at cross-media ownership. I believe that we are going to end up with a situation in Australia whereby the provisions that currently apply in respect of free to air television and the press media—the cross-media ownership provisions—will then not apply, even though at that stage pay TV will have taken over virtually from free to air television.

         I do not know whether these people are right in their assumption that pay TV will be so substantial and influential in 15 years' time; I have not a clue whether they are correct. But I think we should now consider legislation with the view that this might be the case in 15 years. Once it comes, there will be few cross-media ownership rules in respect of pay TV and media ownership as they exist at the present moment. I would be happy to be corrected if the Minister would like to do so—and I am sure he would be delighted to correct me on that.

Bearing in mind the definition of `expert'—X denotes the unknown quantity and a spurt is a drip under pressure—I do not know that we should take a great deal of notice of them. But these people are in the field. They are paid to do the job of forecasting what will be the case in 15 years' time, 10 years' time, seven years' time, five years' time, and they are paid to do so by people with money who have investments in the area.

It would be a very brave prediction indeed as to what level of penetration pay TV will have in the Australian market. I have to say in that sense that I think Senator Harradine's estimate would be as good as anyone else's, and so would mine. My own view is that, on the most optimistic scenario that is painted for pay television, I would be very surprised indeed if it would get a much greater share of the market within the next five years than its own projections indicate. That certainly would indicate a situation where free to air would substantially still be dominating the Australian landscape.

         For what my view is worth, and it is worth no more than anyone else's, I would be very surprised indeed if the scenario Senator Harradine paints, which may well be held by some people, occurs before the end of my lifetime. Of course, that may well be the middle of next week; I do not know. If this pay TV debate never finishes, it probably will be. It seems to have been going on for the whole of my life. Seriously, I have a contrary view. For the next 10 to 15 years, I think it is reasonably safe to assume that free to air services will continue to dominate the majority of television reception in Australia.

         I do not think it is sensible or reasonable for parliaments to try to predict that far ahead. It will be very much a question for the parliament of the day. We are legislatively planning—it is contained in the Act—for a complete review of the industry by 1997; that is in five years. I think that is as much as any parliament could reasonably expect. There will be a comprehensive review of the entire television industry at that time, and I have no doubt at all that at that time there will be a very substantive debate in this chamber. Whether Senator Harradine or I are here to participate in it is something neither of us can predict at this stage. However, we have already legislated in the Act for a comprehensive review of the entire industry, including pay television, in 1997. I think that is about as far ahead in this world as we could safely plan for.

         The Government recognised when it mandated digital technology for satellite that this technology is the way of the future. We all know that analog technology is on its way out and digital technology is on its way in. Indeed, as was made clear by AOTC when I was in Wollongong the other day to launch the fibre-optic trial which will involve pay television services in Wollongong, the full intention of all of the people who will be involved in cable fibre optics will be to go to digital on all of the services that they provide.

         Digital technology is a path to high definition television, wide aspect ratio television—that is, cinemascope on TV—multiple channels and potentially broadband services to the home on satellite to compete with cable. Other technology, such as MDS, may provide some useful transitional paths and will definitely provide a range of narrowcasting services, for which MDS is particularly suited. These will involve such things as ethnic movie channels and, in particular—and I know there will be a wide demand for these services—educational services on subscription television provided by narrowcast. That kind of technology, which not only is currently available in Australia but the equipment on which it is delivered is manufactured in Australia, is ideally suited for this role and not so well suited for the broadcast delivery of pay television.

I am sure this is something all senators will support.

        This amendment is an amendment to section 128 of the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill 1992. It is not intended at all to be a political point-scoring measure.

If one took an opposite view to that of the Government and of the Opposition in this area, one would have drafted this differently.

         At present in regard to programs for children and Australian content, the ABA need only table those and the Parliament has only a disallowable function, and it cannot amend. If, for example, the ABA developed a standard in respect of children's television which dealt, for example, with the types of educational programs that are appropriate for children of various age groups, and if there were a great deal of concern about one particular aspect of that standard, then the Senate and the House of Representatives could not deal with that particular aspect, but would have to disallow the whole standard.

         In regard to codes of practice which are developed by the industry, my amendment would again not require those codes of practice to be tabled before the Parliament for automatic determination by the Parliament. My amendment simply makes provision for the Parliament to consider questions as they arise from time to time. They may arise from time to time by virtue of interpretations, for example, that the Australian Broadcasting Authority may make in respect of its own standards and also relating to the codes of practice after a complaint has been lodged. Those interpretations may vary from time to time, and over a period of time may not truly reflect what the industry as a whole, or indeed what viewers, expected. At that time that the Parliament could come into its own, a notice of motion could be moved and consideration could be given to that matter.

         In my view, that probably would not occur all that often. It may occur more often while this system of deregulation is settling in, but in the long term it probably will not occur very often. Why do I say that? Because if there is some concern that an individual member of parliament is approaching these areas in a manner which is not broadly consistent with the views of his or her colleagues, there would be a 15 sitting day delay, as per paragraph 2 and paragraph 3, in one House and a 15 sitting day delay in the other. In total, that would mean delay over a period of about six months. If the matter is of great concern, the industry ought to get its act together within that six-month period.

         I believe that this provision is quite reasonable. The measure ought to go into the legislation in any event, but it is a measure which the Government might wish to utilise in respect of its present discussions with the industry. For example, if the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister were in discussions with the industry and at the end of the day there was no agreement by the industry to deal with particular issues, the Government may wish to utilise this measure. It could very well be quite a handy way of dealing with the matter.

It also has in mind that members of the public would feel cheated if, at the end of the day after all has been said and done, the Parliament is powerless to deal with this major question of public concern.

         Therefore, I submit the proposal to the Committee. I acknowledge that it does not cover the ABC and the SBS. I hope that that difficulty is overcome in the other House or in some other way. The Minister might have some suggestion on that point. I did not deal with the ABC and the SBS in my amendment because I did not think it would be supported. But, having regard to what the Minister said last night—that it was the Government's intention to ensure that program standards and classifications would apply also to the SBS and the ABC—which came as a bit of a welcome surprise to me, the Government at some stage might consider what amendment is needed to ensure that the ABC and the SBS are covered.

         —This is an appalling amendment that substantially removes one of the greatest strengths from the brand new broadcasting regime which, with overall support from almost everybody within and without the industry, was given to it. It has been couched in very reasonable terms by Senator Harradine in the way in which he has presented it to the Committee. I understand, to my total astonishment, that it will be carried in the Committee because it will be supported by the Opposition—and I seriously say `astonishment'. I cannot honestly believe that the Opposition could sensibly support this measure.

         This amendment fundamentally gives the Parliament a power that it already has—that is, a power to make law. As I just said a few moments ago, I believe that it fundamentally compromises the proper arm's-length position of broadcasting and politics, the independence of the regulator—the Australian Broadcasting Authority—and the Government. I am pleased that the Government was widely applauded. It carefully considered the appointment of the constituent members of that authority as people who had a wide understanding of the community and the industry with all the public consultation in which it is, by legislative requirement, required to engage. This amendment destroys that arms-length approach of politics to broadcasting regulation. It takes away from the ABA its power over these standards. It fundamentally weakens—and I mean fundamentally weakens—the new body that we have just established.

         It is an underlying principle of the Broadcasting Services Act, which has been widely applauded, that the regulation of broadcasting be carried out by the Australian Broadcasting Authority on behalf of the Parliament, with certain parliamentary oversight, such as program standards. It makes a mockery of the concept of supervised, guided industry self-regulation and allows the industry to wriggle out of its responsibilities to take full account, in the first instance, of community standards.

We should have no doubt about the fact that it will be used on a regular basis, despite the soft words. The industry will say, `Fine, we go back to being a totally regulated body by Parliament'—a very inappropriate agency to actually carry out this kind of regulation on this kind of basis—`and we will simply let Parliament make the laws or not make the laws'.

I put this on the record because it will happen for negative as well as for positive reasons. There is no question that this will occur. It will create an enormous degree of uncertainty in an industry which has only just received the new regime—the total overhaul of the Act—in a compromise. It has been a balance between an independent regulator that is at arm's length from politics. It is totally publicly accountable in everything it does and is subject to parliamentary oversight. There is the traditional oversight of the Senate in making a disallowable instrument if Parliament fundamentally disagrees in a substantive way with the standards that the authority is making.

I say again that the reason we are in this position fundamentally is because the politics of the current climate in which all this is being generated has totally overtaken any rational consideration of the full repercussions of this measure. It certainly will be used. It is unprecedented in Australian, United Kingdom, Canadian and United States' broadcasting regulations. Those overseas regulations contain nothing like it.

         The Broadcasting Services Act rightly gave Parliament scrutiny of program standards by making them disallowable instruments under section 128 of the Act. That is the proper, independent arm's length approach. It is the correct balance that should be struck between this brand-new authority with this new less regulatory approach to the industry, whilst at the end of the day maintaining the proper parliamentary role in disallowing something that Parliament felt was grossly excessive. This will provide this chamber at least with an endless opportunity—and it will be used endlessly—to set itself up in place of the Australian Broadcasting Authority.

         I indicate that the Government is fundamentally opposed to this amendment. It strikes at the very heart of what we thought was an extremely good regime of arm's length regulation of the industry. We feel strongly enough about it to divide on it. The reason I indicate that—I did so privately to Senator Alston and Senator Harradine—is that in the event we will not be dividing on it for the simple reason that we are trying to save the Senate time. But I do not want that lack of a division at the end of the debate to be taken as any indication of the Government's fundamental opposition to the effect that this amendment will have and the way in which it will fundamentally strike down what we felt was an excellent balance between a brand-new authority, a completely revamped set of regulations after 50 years, and a proper arm's length role of politics from broadcasting regulation.

With about two minutes of the Minister's speech to go, I had a bet with myself that Senator Collins, having used the word `fundamentally' at least half a dozen times, would almost certainly use it once more in that time.

         In regard to Senator Harradine's proposition, we do not want to see this Parliament being distracted on a regular basis and dealing with trivial, frivolous and capricious proposals that might reflect a minority view. We want to try to reflect community attitudes and views that sometimes get lost in the process of bureaucracy. We could not have a better example of that than to look at the question of violence on television. We have had standards authorities in this country for many years, and one would have thought that they would have got it basically right. But ever since we started talking about this whole problem and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in a fit of macho aggression thought that he would trot out the 9.30 p.m. proposition, it has been a very hot topic.

         The fact that Mr Keating has walked away from that does not contradict the proposition one iota. What we saw in today's Newspoll was a very strong indication of public feeling on the issue. We find that 72 per cent of Australians regard AO programs with a high level of violence as not appropriate in current viewing hours and that they ought to be restricted to being shown after 9.30 p.m. How do we have standards authorities, bureaucracies and the like on the one hand supposedly doing the job of protecting public standards and, on the other hand, the public itself saying, `You got it fundamentally wrong'? If the public cannot have a say through Parliament, we have come to a pretty poor pass.

Time and again it tells us that whilst we might not appreciate the virtues of superannuation, we are going to have it.

Indeed, the Government need not bring it on. Of course, if it did not bring it on, the motion would be deemed to have been carried and would go to the House of Representatives. So we are up to March.

What are the powers of the new body contained in the Broadcasting Services Act under Part 9 relating to program standards?  The powers of the body—the ABA—include determining standards that are to be observed by television broadcasting licensees and community broadcasting licensees. How is that to be done?  Standards which it is required to determine relate to programs for children and the Australian content of programs. Under the existing Act, those particular standards must be laid before the Parliament for its consideration if it wants to disallow them.

        What does the phrase `appropriate community safeguards' mean? Sometimes these are interpretations which might be appropriate at a particular stage but not at other stages. Once the ABA has registered the codes, there is nothing it can do about them. In those circumstances I cannot see where the ABA has the power to revoke a code of practice. It does not have that power. It has power to revoke its own standards, but once it registers those codes it cannot do a damn thing about it.

         My amendment does not interfere at all with the powers of the ABA and would not fundamentally weaken that new body. Without further ado, I suggest that it is not an appalling measure. It simply provides at the end of the day—and perhaps at the end of the year—a backstop for the community to have its say, provided there is support by both chambers of the Parliament.

         The point that Senator Harradine made is the very point that I made at the beginning of the debate. Senator Harradine said, absolutely correctly, that the legislative measures that we will shortly have before us in respect of what we view on our broadcast television screens at night are certainly far more intrusive than what is being proposed by Senator Harradine. That is the very point I made at the beginning of the debate.

         I do not believe this legislation is necessary for the simple reason that it gives Parliament a power to do what it already has power to do—that is, to make laws. Senator Harradine talked rightly about getting representatives from the community. He talked about these extreme circumstances where community concern was so great, as it has been—and I acknowledge it—in respect of violence. Indeed, it has been so great that parliamentarians have got a right to intervene. Of course no independent body—whether it be the ABA, a statutory authority, a GBE or whatever one wants to call it—can ever supplant the sovereign role of this Parliament. Indeed, we will be demonstrating this shortly in respect of these standards with legislation which is far more intrusive than that which Senator Harradine is suggesting.

         I simply make the point that, at the end of the day, Parliament already has this power. If Parliament feels strongly enough—I use the word `Parliament' because Senator Harradine's amendment talks about both Houses, not just the Senate—about a particular measure related to broadcasting, program standards or anything else, it has the power, as we will demonstrate shortly, to make laws to that effect.

         —The Senate has before it for debate the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Foreign Investment) Bill 1992. An earlier Bill ran into so much criticism some months ago that the Government sought comment from an overseas tax consultant, Professor Brian Arnold, from the University of Western Ontario in Canada. Professor Arnold is a well-known and respected expert in the field of international tax law. Professor Arnold released to the Government his independent review in August. He came up with 52 different recommendations. The Government, in response, subsequently agreed to 37 changes. While some major problems for industry have been allayed by the new amended Bill, some of the outstanding concerns, I remind the Senate, are still of the Government's own making.

         Following Professor Arnold's independent review, a new Bill was introduced by the Government on 3 November. This was for a commencement date of 1 January 1993. This is hardly sufficient time for consultation on the technical aspects of the Bill and for industry to establish the necessary systems to cope with the foreign investment fund measures.

         I would like to encourage my colleagues in the Government to adopt a proposal that was suggested by Professor Arnold in his presentation—that the tax industry itself should have a greater role in the formulation of tax policy and legislation. Under this proposal, input would result not only from those who receive the revenue from taxation, but from those people who actually have to work with the legislation on a daily basis.

         The Bill before the Senate today implements the Government's 1991-92 Budget announcement to complete the third element of its tax reform agenda to develop a comprehensive system for taxing foreign source income. The first element, as we know, of this agenda was the foreign tax credit system which, from the income year 1987-88, replaced the general exemption in Australia of income earned offshore and subjected to foreign tax. The second element was the introduction of the controlled foreign company and foreign trust rules which took effect from the income year 1990-91.

         In addition, the Bill will amend the existing trust provisions in division 6 and division 6AAA of the principal Act in their application to non-resident trust income. The principal change is to the way in which a person's share of the net income from such non-resident trusts is ascertained. This will be aligned in a way in which a person's share of foreign investment fund income is determined under the foreign investment fund measures. During the committee stage of the Bill I intend to raise some technical anomalies arising out of these changes.

         Industry has advised the Government that it will take about nine months to adequately implement a system to cater for foreign investment fund record-keeping. Bearing in mind that we have a start-up date of 1 January, this is hardly sufficient time. The few overseas countries that have introduced such legislation have allowed open debate. They have also allowed the Bills to lie on the table for up to two years, and in some cases even longer. The foreign investment fund measures contained in this Bill will take effect from 1 January 1993. The industry has indicated that this implementation date is unsatisfactory. The Liberal-National Party coalition will, therefore, move a committee stage amendment to defer the commencement date to 1 July 1993.

         In adopting 37 of the 52 recommendations made by Professor Arnold, the Government feels that it has solved the majority of the problems that were raised by the industry and by those who had a concern about this legislation. However, there are still a number of problems associated with this legislation, some of which were the subject of the recommendations by Professor Arnold in his review and not adopted by the Government and some others that were beyond the purview of the recommendations and the review conducted by the professor.

         It should be noted, though, that Professor Arnold's report dealt only with the technical and practical aspects of the implementation of the foreign investment fund legislation and not with the policy basis of the FIF legislation. I take issue with the Treasurer's press release No. 153, of 9 October, which states:

        I believe that it is incorrect of the Government to use Professor Arnold's report to endorse its policy in this area. The Treasurer has taken Professor Arnold's comments out of context. Let me read what the Professor states:

        Second, the terms of my appointment do not permit me to examine the policy aspects of the proposed legislation.

(Therefore,) none of the recommendations is inconsistent with, or requires any alteration of, the fundamental policy and structure of the legislation.

        Further, the Taxation Institute of Australia, for example, has expressed the view that the proposed legislation has been introduced on the basis of an anti-avoidance and anti-tax deferral measure, but notes that the proposed legislation sets out an entirely new regime for taxing investments in foreign entities generally and the anti-avoidance objective does not seem to justify the scope of these provisions. This is evident from the fact that the major burden of the proposed legislation will fall on Australian taxpayers with bona fide investments in offshore entities. That is the problem that we have with the legislation.

         The latest Bill has made concessions in this area, but they do not go far enough. Again, the Taxation Institute, for example, notes that the proposed changes to the foreign life policies are only an alternative method of valuing income by referring to the sum value of the policy. All this alternative does is effectively tax the contribution at the top marginal rate.

         Importantly, the schedule 4 so-called `white list' has been replaced with a so-called `black list', in taxation parlance. The connotations involved in such terms are unfortunate. The so-called black list exempts interest in any foreign company engaged principally in an active business other than an investment, financial services and certain real estate, banking investment businesses.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Sections of the industry have generally greeted the concept of a black list with enthusiasm. However, those parts of the industry involved with resident public unit trusts and the funds management areas have noted that the record-keeping and distribution problems have not been resolved by the introduction of this so-called black list.

         This approach does not resolve the inconsistencies associated with the de minimus exemption and the problems associated with distributions of income. Where entities have made a significant distribution, the Bill fails to provide an exemption from the foreign investment fund regime and has given rise to double taxation, a most unfortunate aspect of tax which is creeping increasingly into tax law.

         The compliance costs of establishing a system to cater for the maintenance of attribution accounts and the detailed record-keeping requirements will not differ under the black list approach.

         Another concern highlighted by the new Bill is the exemption for an interest held in a foreign bank. This has now been amended so that the test is now more practically feasible. Instead of the taxpayer having to establish the existence of a fixed number of non-associated shareholders—a most difficult task—the interest will be exempt so long as the shares in the foreign bank are widely held and actively traded. Why not the same rules for financial services institutions?

         The treatment of foreign investment fund losses has also been addressed—and this is welcomed by those who are involved in this particular area of activity—as recommended by Professor Arnold, to allow foreign investment fund losses to be offset against a taxpayer's assessable income generally. However, there remain serious concerns regarding the rationale behind the proposed legislation.

         With the large number of exemptions now contained within this new Bill, its purpose is even more obviously aimed at avoidance and deferral of taxation.

         The need to enact 113 pages of legislation in an attempt to bring into the tax net a very small proportion of the taxpaying community already covered would appear to be legislative overkill at its very worst. The enactment of such a complex piece of legislation which taxpayers will theoretically have to acquaint themselves with simply to determine whether their investments are excluded from the operation of the foreign investment funds measures does not sit comfortably with the concept of simplification of the tax law.

         Foreign investment fund legislation will prove a strong disincentive to overseas executives wanting to settle in Australia and to expatriates returning to Australia. Intending migrants with passive investments in their home country, such as endowment life insurance policies, will face a penalty tax in Australia, which would not apply to an equivalent Australian investment. Regrettably, the Government has not adopted Professor Arnold's recommendation to transfer offshore policies onshore. The Australian industry has suggested that when a foreign life policy is transferred onshore, it should not be necessary to restart the 10-year period for the purpose of section 26AH of the ITAA.

         The primary issues can be discussed under four headings. First, there is the need to defer the Bill's implementation date to 1 July 1993. Secondly, the 5 per cent de minimus exemption should be determined on the basis of the total portfolio held by a resident, including domestic investments and cash holdings. Thirdly, investments in companies carrying on an active business or providing financial services should be exempt where the shares are widely held and are actively traded on an approved exchange. Fourthly, there are the compliance and administrative issues associated with the small investor exemption and distribution from resident unit trusts.

         Of the aforementioned issues, the request for the deferral of the implementation date needs urgent examination. The Government needs to understand the mechanics involved in what it is asking the industry to perform. Let us take one unnamed investment company which invests on both the domestic and global markets according to the superannuation funds investment mandate and portfolio type. Where the investment company acts as the fund manager and custodian on behalf of the superannuation fund, detailed reports have to be sent out to the trustees on a monthly basis.

These reports reflect the type and source of the income-expenditure received and incurred by the fund and are based on each fund's year of income.

         One firm has estimated that the cost of designing and implementing amendments to the firm's computer and other systems to comply with the FIF legislation is over $3m. This is because the system has to be amended to ensure that it, firstly, monitors each client's portfolio for black-listed FIFs; secondly, determines the FIF income or loss arising in respect of each FIF; thirdly, determines whether there is an attribution surplus for a particular FIF to calculate the exempt component of a distribution from the FIF; fourthly, maintains attribution accounts for each FIF; and, fifthly, calculates the FIF income to be included in each fund's assessable income after accounting for FIF losses which have been utilised against the fund's assessable income.

         As can be seen from what I have just outlined, the compliance costs are therefore extraordinarily high. Further, many of the tax reports required are based on each fund's year of income. Often, many of the funds have substituted accounting periods in lieu of the succeeding and preceding 30 June. Given that in some cases funds can balance as early as 31 March in lieu of the succeeding 30 June, there is just not enough time to implement complex changes to many systems being used by the industry affected by these changes before us; hence, the need for an amendment to defer the implementation date to 1 July 1993. We contend that no money will be lost as a result of this because if funds of such a nature were out there they would certainly already have been brought back.

         The funds management industry has also pointed out to me that an inequity occurs for investors who invest in both Australian and global markets with regard to the 5 per cent de minimus exemption. This occurs since the exemption is determined by the total value of all FIFs held rather than the total value of the investor's assets.

         Whilst industry is very happy with the rationale for providing an exemption from the FIF legislation through the de minimus exemption, it believes that by adopting the total value of investments as a denominator in applying the 5 per cent exemption it does not contradict the Government's stated objective—that taxpayers with minimal investment in black-listed activity offshore companies and in offshore trusts do not put the revenue at risk and are rightly excluded.

         The industry has also expressed concern that this Bill has not adopted Professor Arnold's recommendation, on page 18 of his report, that it is `difficult to justify the exclusion of Australian investors from important sectors of the international economy', such as real estate, insurance and financial services.

         I am happy to note that the real estate and insurance sectors have been provided subsequently with an exemption, but not the financial services sector. The Treasurer's rationale for this action—that is, because of its potential as an avenue for abuse—is inconsistent with the comments made by Professor Arnold in his report on pages 19 and 20. The Government should consider such an exemption for the financial services sector if the shares are listed on an approved exchange; the foreign company carries on an active business of providing financial services; and the shares are widely held and actively traded.

         A further recommendation made by Professor Arnold and not adopted by the Government concerns the amendments in the Bill with regard to the exemption for unit holders investing in resident public unit trusts. The small investor exemption in section 96A(2) has not been resolved and in its present form has created severe compliance problems for fund managers. Time will not permit me to discuss this in detail here, but there are several other concerns which I wish to list. Firstly, there is the double taxation of income from interest in non-resident estates that still exists where the FIF is sold during the year of income. Secondly, the balance sheet method is an impractical method to apply and assumes the taxpayer has access to detailed information. Thirdly, the life insurance exemption can be satisfied only by using the balance sheet method. Fourthly, the Morgan Stanley Capital Index—MSCI—does not differentiate between companies carrying on life insurance and general insurance businesses. Rather, there is only one classification of insurance; hence, a taxpayer would have to use the balance sheet method to determine whether the FIF was exempt.

         —Senator Bolkus would like me to incorporate my speech, but I will not be long. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Foreign Investment) Bill 1992, which is before the Senate today, has had a long and complex history. The measure was originally scheduled to take effect from 1 July 1990, was deferred for a year and then another year until the broad details were released in last year's Budget. A detailed information paper was released in April this year and an original Bill was introduced shortly afterwards. That Bill was subsequently withdrawn because of a major alteration of policy. Professor Arnold was appointed to further review the legislation and an extensive report was released in October. This suggested dozens of further amendments, of which the Government accepted 37. I think Senator Watson was hoping that it would accept the lot. A new revised Bill was introduced incorporating these changes.

         So these measures are the final stage in a total restructuring of the taxation regime, which applies to income from foreign sources, which commenced in 1987. At that time a comprehensive foreign tax credit system was introduced. This removed the previous provision which allowed income to be enjoyed tax free in Australia if it had borne any foreign tax at all. Clearly, this system provided a huge incentive for taxpayers to arrange their affairs so that they earned their income from offshore sources. In 1990, the accrual measures were introduced. These complemented the foreign tax credit system by taxing certain income earned by foreign entities which are controlled from Australia on an accruals basis; that is, people could no longer avoid their Australian taxation obligations simply by not remitting their foreign income back to Australia.

         These foreign investment fund measures before us today buttress these accrual measures which I have just mentioned by introducing a regime to tax the interests held by Australian residents in foreign entities which are not controlled by Australians—that is, where an Australian owns an interest in a foreign company or trust which is not controlled from Australia.

         In many instances, I think Senator Watson could argue, a foreign company or trust is still an attractive investment vehicle because it allows for the accumulation of income offshore, especially in low tax countries, allowing the investor to minimise and defer Australian tax. I think it is important to realise that the current tax regime in effect provides an incentive for foreign investment by Australian residents. This contributes to a bias against local investment and, hence, has important ramifications for the level of economic activity and employment in Australia, especially in the financial services area.

         This was recognised in the Arnold report. That report clearly supported the need for and the desirability of these measures—measures which, as Senator Watson said, are incredibly complex. That is unfortunate but, given the unavoidable complexities of the world's financial markets and the world's economy generally, I guess it is to be expected. I think we have found from experience that there is nearly always a trade-off between equity and simplicity in taxation matters. While the Democrats support legislation which is as simple and, hence, as accessible as possible, we will not sacrifice equity just for the sake of simplicity.

         It is fair to say that the Government has consulted extensively on this matter and that it has targeted those non-controlling interests in foreign entities that provide the greatest scope for tax avoidance. The particular focus is on long term interests and multi-tiered offshore investments that enable the deferral of Australian tax. That income is then usually converted into concessionally taxed capital gains on the disposal of the interests.

         Short term interests, that is, those that are held for less than 12 months, are generally not caught as, by their very nature, there is no significant deferral of the derivation of income. Furthermore, there is a reasonable de minimus exemption which excludes small amounts of offshore investments—and by `small' we mean up to $50,000—from the regime.

         This recognises the legitimacy of some passive offshore investment by Australians, but it sets limits. I am in favour of setting limits. We should be setting limits on what comes in as well, but honourable senators all know my view on that. It sets strict limits on the amount which can continue to be concessionally taxed. That is sensible and reasonable and deserves support.

         As senators in the main will know—and certainly Senator Watson and Senator Kernot know—this goes back to a 1991-92 Budget announcement which outlined the broad design features of the foreign investment fund measures. It concludes the process which overcomes the taxation bias which had operated in the past and which encouraged Australians to invest in offshore tax havens rather than in their own country. That is the purpose.

         I mention the timetable for a second reason, because that is one of the two reasons why we do not accept the proposal that it is necessary or appropriate to further delay the operative date of the FIFs measure. Nobody will be taken by surprise by this legislation. It was first announced on 20 August 1991. A detailed information paper was released on 2 April 1992 and the proposed legislation was first introduced in the 25 June Bill. It is true that there has been some significant amendment since that time, but the core concepts remain constant. The essential elements of the Bill have in fact been known by the sorts of people who are likely to be affected by these measures since 20 August 1991.

         People who are dealing with the sophisticated level of investment that we are talking about here have known since that time exactly what was envisaged by foreign investment fund measures because they know other countries have such measures. Almost every other Western country has something similar and they have certainly known for a long time the broad nature of the responsibilities that would be imposed upon them. If that is not apparent as a matter of logic, I am sure it is apparent by the nature of the correspondence we have all received. People were not in much doubt about what it meant for them.

         It is also the case that people do know and have broadly known what sort of information they will be required to provide and what it is that they have to do to comply with the requirements of this legislation.

They may not have made reasonable arrangements, but that is not the Parliament's responsibility. Our responsibility is to make sure that they have reasonable opportunity. On the other hand—and let us not underestimate the significant of this, and Senator Kernot referred to it by implication—if we put back the date of operation to 1 July 1993, it means that the $90m that it is proposed to raise in that financial year is also put back.

         The other point that is made is that this legislation is too complex and that the man and woman in the street would not be able to comprehend and cope with it. I want to make two points about that without unduly taking the time of the Senate because I want to finish promptly. One is that the FIF measures have become more complex as a result of the consultation process. This is far from a unique circumstance. We all know that it happened to an even greater extent with regard to the controlled foreign corporations legislation, the second stage of these foreign income taxing measures. The size and complexity of the Bill grew, quite reasonably, as a result of the consultation process. I do not say that as a criticism. In the consultation process, new issues were raised that meant that further amendments to the legislation were required.

We want to have the variations that we suggest, the one-off or extraordinary circumstances which might arise that the Bill does not properly encompass, taken into account. But we want a simple Bill'. They cannot have both those things and I think it is more appropriate that the legislation be comprehensive and that it deals with the issues people raise with us in their consultation than for it to be simple and not cope with the multitude of different circumstances this sort of legislation has to deal with.

         The last point is that not very many ordinary men and women in the street will have to deal with this legislation. Not very many people will be doing back-of-the-envelope calculations on the kitchen table to work out how much the FIF legislation will cost them in their tax bill. It just will not happen. Let us just think about it. The FIF measures will apply only to taxpayers whose offshore investment exceeds $50,000. I have to say that there are not a whole lot of mum, dad and the kids taxpayers doing their back-of-the-envelope calculations who are worried about how they cope with their $50,000.

Certainly, a typical offshore investment of an Australian resident is unlikely to be more than 20 per cent of the total investments in a portfolio, on the normal investment advice that people get. So we are really talking in the main about people who have an investment portfolio of about $250,000 with $50,000 offshore.

         The Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill 1992 implements the Government's 1992-93 Budget announcement to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to impose FBT on certain car parking benefits. The Bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to deny deductibility for car parking expenses incurred in relation to the above benefits. This latter measure was not announced in the 1992-93 Budget and the new measures are to take effect from 1 July 1993. So it is a new tax measure.

         The Bill will include a new division 10A in the Fringe Benefits Tax Act to deal with the benefits provided by an employer to an employee in the form of car parking facilities. This proposal has taken the entire business world by storm. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has labelled the proposal as ridiculous and comical. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants has described it as absurd and a Monty Python tax. Further criticism has called it unworkable and a joke. This is only part of the huge avalanche of criticism that is flooding the newspapers as well as coalition and, I would imagine, Government offices.

         Generally, car parking benefits exist where an employer provides to the employee any car parking facility on business premises which are owned, controlled or leased in whole or in part by the employer. In summary, no benefit will exist unless a permanent, commercial car parking facility available for all-day parking is within one kilometre of the employer provided car parking facility and/or where the car is parked at or in the vicinity of the employee's primary place of employment and

         Broadly speaking, a car parking benefit will arise only where a car used to commute from home to work is parked at or near the employee's main workplace for more than four hours between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Where an employer reimburses an employee's car parking expenses, the value of the benefit will be the amount of the reimbursement. The taxable value of the benefit where the employer provides car parking facilities for the employee will be the value of the lowest cost all-day parking at a permanent commercial parking area available to the public within one kilometre of the employer provided facilities.

I am surprised that the Labor Party has introduced this tax, especially after it found in the mid-1980s that such a tax was unpopular and unworkable. At that time it was demonstrated that revenue derived from the FBT on car parking spaces would be significantly eroded by administrative costs. Little has changed since 1986, except the capacity of firms, because of the recession, to bear the extra imposts. Further, it was decided that those people who participated in the central business district parking were not really receiving a benefit, but that the parking was essential to their work.

         For example, there are three types of car parking arrangements. First, the employer makes no arrangement for his or her employees. The employee meets the expenses with his or her after-tax dollar. The second arrangement is that the employer provides car parking at the employer's expense totally independent of any salary arrangement. The employer provides the car parking free for a variety of reasons, including competitive pressures, government regulations, a lack of public transport and others.

         While this tax may encourage employers to eliminate the car parking benefit in the third category, it results in a variety of distortions with situations particularly in the second category. Those employers are forced to pay an additional tax when neither they nor their employees have been involved in any form of tax avoidance. This increase in costs is presumably in many cases passed on to their customers or clients in the form of increased prices, but others, such as schools, cannot do this as easily.

         As noted, the purpose of the proposed legislation is to bring car parking benefits into the fringe benefits tax net. Its intended aim was to prevent the executive from obtaining a fringe benefit that the ordinary worker was not obtaining.

         It does not necessarily follow that the mere existence of a commercial car parking station within a one-kilometre radius of the employer's premises gives rise to an assumption of a valuable benefit having been provided to an employee. The flaw in the logic is compounded by the proposed measure which adopts as the tax value the lowest fee charged by an operator of a relevant parking station open to members of the public for full day parking.

         The tax is said to apply only to central business district employees because of the one-kilometre commercial car parking test. However, the absurdity is illustrated by the Australian Taxation Office's own decentralisation program. In Melbourne, the Taxation  Office now has offices in Dandenong, Box Hill, Moonee Ponds and Moorabbin. Because of the number of employees involved, commercial car parks have been established for all these decentralised sites, with the exception of Moorabbin. As a result all employees within one kilometre of those taxation offices, with the exception of Moorabbin, will now have to pay FBT on the provision of car parking facilities to their employees.

         This produces a somewhat absurd result. Banks, insurance companies and retailers that provide employee parking in such large centres as Ringwood, Greensborough and Werribee are not providing their employees with a taxable fringe benefit. Yet the employees on exactly the same terms and conditions of employment who work in centres where the Taxation Office has decentralised offices are receiving a taxable fringe benefit.

         The proposed formula promoted by the Government in this tax is clearly distorting the true value to an employee of the benefit of the on-site parking provided by an employer. This is not a fair balance between the provision of benefits to employees and the incurring by an employer of a valuable business expense. The fringe benefits tax recognises that as far as a motor vehicle is concerned, vehicles may be used for business and private purposes. This is particularly the case with regard to parking bays.

         This proposed legislation is more onerous than the initial motor vehicle fringe benefits provisions. The record-keeping requirements are greater and will be extremely difficult to administer in their current form. For example, the absurdity is that the legislation requires that each employer keep daily records of the cars parked on his or her premises and must distinguish between the employee and non-employee cars. This is a very time-consuming procedure. As a result administrative overheads will rise and paperwork will increase. The proposal will increase the cost of running businesses at a time when many businesses and companies are still shedding staff. It appears that the recession we had to have must continue by government legislation.

         Other inconsistencies occur when the provision of parking bays is examined. Where parking bays are provided by the employer, there is in effect a presumption that in the proposed legislation there is no business use. This current proposal does not provide taxpayers with equal access to the otherwise deductible rule. As a result, firms will be taxed on legitimate business expenses. The proposal before us today will actually discourage firms from locating in existing commercial districts—an outcome which runs contrary to urban consolidation policies that are being pursued by State and local governments.

         Further questions raised by the Bill include: when does the use of a car park constitute the provision of parking facilities in respect of the employment of an employee? Presumably, the answer is quite clear: when a specific space is provided to an employee on the employer's premises—for example, reserved parking for the secretary or manager of the club. However, if a business is required by law to have a certain number of car parking spaces, is it a provision of parking facilities if employees are permitted to park on the premises if the spaces are available? That is difficult to determine if the proposed legislation is meant to catch these sorts of cases. Other examples include schools which permit or do not permit staff parking and manufacturers who permit or do not prohibit staff car parking in a general area or on a vacant allotment which the manufacturer owns.

         Another concern expressed has been that the tax will actively discriminate against the security of women who have to work overtime, especially in winter when it is well and truly dark by 7 p.m. The possibility exists that employers will no longer provide car parking close to their places of work. Time does not permit me to raise further examples. It is absolutely outrageous that a boss who regularly provides a taxi home to protect members of his female work force who have to work after hours should be caught under the fringe benefits tax legislation. A fringe benefit!

         In the time available, I want to deal with another aspect which goes to the heart of the Government's double standards in the area of superannuation. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992 contains a number of provisions which flow from the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on security in retirement of 30 June last. Some of these are commendable and some are long overdue improvements.

         Let me outline a most extraordinary provision which to date has not had the attention that it deserves. A government which used to claim a mortgage on social justice and which tries to claim that somehow it is out there benefiting low income earners has not only introduced a superannuation guarantee charge regime, which will do little or nothing for this generation of the work force in terms of improving its position vis-a-vis the age pension which it would otherwise have been entitled to receive, but also has provided absolutely extraordinary different levels of taxation treatment of high and low income earners. For example, at present those who are self-employed can claim a tax deduction of $3,000 plus 75 per cent up to the limit of their reasonable benefit limits.

         The Government is proposing to rationalise the extraordinarily complicated, unfair and illogical system currently in place which provides differential tax treatment of contributions, depending upon one's status in the work force, with limits on deductions for superannuation contributions. What do we find that the Government does in the case of high income earners—usually self-employed professionals with perhaps two income earners in the family? We find that this Government, with its great concern for helping the low income groups, will allow a person over a 45-year working period, taking maximum advantage of the age base limits, to contribute a maximum of $1.44m. If we average that out over that 45-year working period we find that those high net worth individuals or those fortunate enough to be employed by generous corporate employers will be able to contribute $33,000 per year on average throughout their working lives.

         What sort of treatment do we find is given to the low income earners—the ones that the Government professes great concern for and for whom the SGC is supposed to represent some sort of progressive achievement? We find that they are cut off at the knees. For contributions of $1,000 they are given a maximum $100 rebate—10 per cent of contributions up to $1,000. They get a miserable and derisory $100 a year. It is not as if that is available to everyone in the work force. In fact, it is only available—even at the full rate of $100—to those with incomes of $27,000 or less.

         If 70 per cent of the work force is in receipt of less than $30,000 average weekly earnings, the great majority of wage and salary earners will at best be entitled to a rebate of $100. On the other hand, those who are least in need of extraordinary generosity and who are least likely to be claimants for the age pension are getting tax deductible benefits of up to $33,000 a year. That is a travesty of social justice for which there has been absolutely no explanation other than that the Government, in its usual reactive negative approach to superannuation, has simply sat back, looked at the proposals that have been announced by the Opposition and tried to go one step further in so far as it thinks there is political mileage to be gained. I think this will rebound on the Government devastatingly, as low income earners come to realise that not only will they effectively be denied any tax concession but also the SGC regime will not provide them with anything near enough to a reasonable level of retirement income.

         Take the current generation of the work force. The Government says, `You would need to receive 12 per cent over a 40-year working life to get 40 per cent of average weekly earnings if you are on average weekly earnings now'. That may be a commendable target. A pensioner who would otherwise be looking forward to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings—or 28 per cent under Fightback—is being offered 40 per cent. But the fundamental problem is that the vast majority will not have anything like 12 per cent. Indeed, something like 1 1/2 million employees are not even getting the first 3 per cent under the award superannuation regime. There are a significant number who are getting 3 per cent and nothing more. Under the SGC regime, that will rise progressively to 9 per cent by the year 2002. No doubt, in due course that will be converted to 12 per cent as an employer impost. The fact remains that one will not even be getting anything like 12 per cent for at least another 10 years. So much for 12 per cent across the board!

The majority of those in the work force—if they are lucky enough to be there; and there are one million or more who are not, so they get nothing under the SGC regime—are 30 years of age or more. We have a government that is so craven and pusillanimous when it comes to policy reform that it was not even prepared to take the advice of industry and everyone else who acknowledges the need to have income set aside for genuine retirement income by raising the preservation age progressively over a 10-year period, as we have done, from 1 July 1994. What has the Government done? It has accepted the principle of phasing that in over 10 years. But when is it starting? I do not think people would believe this unless they read it in the legislation, but the Government is actually proposing that that 10-year phased increase should commence in 23 years' time.

         Not only are they not in the work force for 40 years, but if they are lucky enough to be in the full time work force at all—in other words, if they are not unemployed, voluntarily or otherwise—if they have families, they are likely to be out of the work force intermittently looking after their families. Then, of course, they are encouraged to get out at age 55 and if that is not good enough for them, they will get the pension offered to them at 60.

         I come back to the proposition that not only will members of this current generation of the work force have virtually nothing set aside for them by way of superannuation guarantee charge—in other words, force fed compulsory super that they could not have got under the pension—but in most instances they will not even do as well as they would on the pension. Who will pay for it? It is up to them, is it not? We know that the employers will not bear this multibillion dollar impost, so workers will have to go without wage increases progressively over the years in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension.

         There is the great equity of a Labor government. If you are a high income earner, if you have a wealthy employer, you can get a contribution of $33,000 a year. If you are a middle income earner, you get nothing. If you are a low income earner, you get $100 a year rebate. That is an absolute travesty of social justice.

         If we go on to some of the other initiatives we find the deductions and rebates for personal contributions. Not only was that decision made, but it was made to take effect with less than 24 hours' notice. I have not yet heard a satisfactory explanation for this. Senator McMullan might like to enlighten us. Why do all the other initiatives have at least a two-year lead time, and this one immediately and severely disadvantages about 1.3 million individual workers who are claiming deductions at the present time? They are told they are out of the game. They are told—it has not been legislated yet, we are simply being confronted with retrospective legislation to ensure that they have not been silly enough to take advantage of their legal entitlements to the present time—with less than 24 hours' notice that that tax deduction has been withdrawn.

We will force employers to make the contributions'—the lowest common denominator, of course. `Over that period, we will look after you'. That is dead right. They will fix workers right up.

         I will move on very briefly to the pension and rollover annuities provisions. They constitute a simpler approach than existing arrangements as they do not differentiate between annuities and pensions which were payable prior to 1988 or prior to the individual reaching age 55. For individuals with pensions or annuities payable prior to 1988, the new rebate arrangements will present a windfall gain. Overall, the measures are commendable in that they represent a simplification of current arrangements and do encourage the choice of an annuity or a pension over the taking of lump sums.

         But when we come on to another of the extraordinary cop-outs, in other words, the changes to reasonable benefits limits, we find that the Government is proposing to introduce flat dollar RBL amounts—$400,000 indexed for lump sums—which, of course, will not touch the vast majority of the population. If we are serious about somehow gradually forcing people to take at least a portion of their entitlements in pension or annuity form, this measure will do absolutely nothing to achieve that. Once again, a total cop-out.

         It is worse than that.

The excess will be taxed at their top marginal rate. If the fund earns ten per cent and AWE is three per cent, that seven per cent difference will again be taxed at their top marginal rate. That is another example of the gross inequity and unfairness of this flat rate approach.

All I can say, from the discussions I have had with people in industry and all those people who take a keen interest in the subject, is that they are delighted at the generosity of our transitional arrangements. We have had nothing but praise from the industry for the refinements and improvements we announced some three months back. Again, they stand in stark contrast to these flat and arbitrary limits. If Senator McMullan were to do the rounds of the industry, he would find out just what most high income earners—the very few who will be touched by this $400,000 limit, when the average lump sum pay-out is about $50,000—think of it.

         I still receive a significant number of what appear to be very valid complaints of unfairness. In many instances they are not put forward in a spirit of rancour, revenge or resentment at having to face up to legal obligations, but simply as outcomes that are very hard to justify in logical or other terms. I particularly commend the DADs organisation for trying to address some of these inequities; but one has to say there is still a long way to go. I foreshadow that we will generally support the Bill but we will be opposing the averment provision, and I will spell out why when we come to that.

         —We are debating a heap of taxation Bills. I would like to direct my remarks mainly to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill 1992. As Senator Watson has pointed out, the basic principle of the Bill is to make an employer liable for FBT if he or she provides an employee with a car parking space for at least four hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. This FBT is put in place on the pretence that it is inequitable that some employees receive car parking benefits while others have to pay for car parking out of their own pockets, out of their after tax income. In explaining why this measure was introduced, Senator Button said in his second reading speech:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This Bill will give effect to the Budget measures announced on 18 August 1992 to tax certain car parking benefits. The Government finds it inequitable that some employees receive these car parking benefits in a tax exempt form while other employees, most of whom will not get a tax deduction for their car parking costs, must pay for equivalent facilities out of their after tax income.
       </para>
       <para>
        That would be a noble idea if the Minister were to stick to his line of being equitable towards employees. I believe that was only a pretence. The real reason the Government has brought in this measure is to raise more tax via FBT. There is a shortfall in tax collection this year, as admitted in a report by the Australian Taxation Office not so long ago. The reason for that shortfall is that we are in the worst depression we have had since the 1930s. It is time to stop using the word `recession'; it is now a depression.

         The financial impact of this Bill will be to raise $90m in 1993-94, $240m in 1994-95 and $190m in 1995-96. I have not had it explained to me yet—someone can probably explain it to me later—why there will be a drop in revenue in time to come. However, according to the Bill, no benefit exists for an employee unless a permanent commercial car parking facility is situated within one kilometre of the employer provided space. So if no commercial car parking facility is available, there is no benefit.

         That is where Senator Button's idea of being equitable goes out of the window. Car parking deductions will not be available to employees who use car parking stations for more than four hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. or in the vicinity of the place of employment. In other words, when this legislation comes in, if the employee uses a public parking area for a cost and the employer does not reimburse the employee, then he or she cannot claim that as legal expenses for tax deductions. I would like to know what happens in a situation where someone works for three hours. Would they be able to get a deduction? I would like that question answered.

         I would also like to find out about the situation where no parking is available for a particular day or a particular week at the workplace. Parking spaces are limited at most places of employment where parking is available. There could be reasons why parking is available for only certain days of the week and not others. There may be one week, out of the blue, when no parking is available. Would the employee who goes to the public parking place and pays for the privilege of parking be able to claim that as a deduction for expenses incurred in getting to and from work? Certainly this Bill and the explanatory memorandum do not tell us that.

         I believe that this is very discriminatory legislation. One may ask why that is so. The main reason is that the employer is taxed differently depending on the location of the commercial car parking areas. The only criteria as to whether one is liable is exactly where those areas are located. It also depends on where the employer's work location is.

         This is another tax on business. The coalition's Fightback package is all about taking tax off business rather than loading it up so that we can be competitive in world export markets. There will be a lot of expenses associated with this measure. If a car park is just out of the one kilometre range from an employer's business, the distance will have to be measured. The employer would probably need to get a surveyor in to do the measurement. If I had a business and a commercial parking area was 10 or 20 metres inside the one kilometre limit, it would be cheaper to shift the entrance into my parking area rather than pay the FBT. That sort of thing makes the Bill inequitable. We should either have an FBT on parking or we should not. The proposal in this Bill is quite stupid. Do not bet that the driveways will not be shifted. There is enough trouble administering FBT rules without adding this stupid one.

         Employers will first have to establish where the public car parking areas are and then they will have to keep up surveillance of the area to see that one does not crop up. If employers are unaware that a car parking area has cropped up and they have not been paying FBT, I presume they will be in trouble. They will have to keep records of changes in charges at the public parking areas. In most cities, so many car parking bays have to be provided per the number of square metres of office space. The same applies to residential areas. Employers are forced by the council to provide parking. Then they are forced by the Commissioner of Taxation—in other words, the Government—to pay FBT. So it is a tax on top of a tax and nothing else.

         What about the employer in an industrial area where there is no public car parking at a cost within one kilometre of his factory, for instance? What happens if there is a vacant lot up for sale next to his factory? If someone wanted to make a quick dollar, he or she could purchase that vacant lot and create a public parking area. That employer—businessman, manufacturer or whoever—would be quite anxious to deal with the purchaser, even to buy them out. Has the Government ever thought of anything like that? As I said, if we are to have FBT on parking, let us have it, but let us have it for everyone so that a person who gets the benefit is not treated differently from someone else who gets the same benefit.

         Another question that I would like someone to answer is:  when is a commercial parking station considered permanent? I can give plenty examples of what I am talking about, and plenty of honourable senators will know of them. For instance, the Royal Perth Hospital started building its north wing on the other side of Wellington Street. The skeleton for the wing was up, and then the hospital obviously ran out of money to finish it. It was turned into a public car parking station for which money was charged. In my belief, it was never intended to be a permanent parking station because the site was to be the north wing of the hospital when it was finished. To my knowledge, that site is now part of the hospital, but it was a car parking station for about 10 years. Would that parking station be considered permanent or not? I would like to know the answer to that question.

         The point is that there is discrimination through this legislation because it is a benefit to have parking at a private hospital but it is not a benefit to have parking at a public hospital. The pretext for that discrimination is that one does not aim to make a profit and the other one does. It is a pity that the public hospitals do not try to cut costs to make a profit, because if they did we might have a better medical system in Australia. Senator Herron will probably enlarge on that point later, but I say that a person who works in a public hospital and a person who works in a private hospital get the same benefit: one car bay for that day from seven in the morning until seven at night. I cannot see why the fact that one hospital is private and one is public should make any difference. I reiterate that it is discriminatory, it is expensive to administer and it is plain stupid.

         I go back to what Senator Button said. His and the Government's pretence was that everyone should be treated equally. But, far from being that, it is inequitable. I would like to know whose idea it was in the first place—it may have been the departing Commissioner of Taxation. Whoever it was, I think, could have thought it out more thoroughly. It ranks the same as that other Budget measure, which the Government has backed down on—the withholding tax on back interest. I reckon the measure is totally stupid; I will finish my remarks on that point.

         —(7.03 p.m.)—The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 sets out to increase the low income thresholds below which people are not required to pay the levy, as announced in 1992-93 Budget. The Bill intends that individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,887 and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $20,070 will not be required to pay the levy. As well, the income threshold is increased by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. The shading-in provisions are also amended to reduce the levy where taxable income exceeds $11,887 but is less than $12,680.

         This was not the only Budget measure affecting the Medicare levy. The rate of the Medicare levy is increased by 0.15 per cent to 1.4 per cent from 1 July 1993. This latter impost is expected to raise an additional $300m in 1993-94. One might well ask: why $300m? And why 0.15 per cent? Why not 2 per cent; why not 3 per cent? The reality is that the 1.25 per cent brings in only less than 18 per cent of the total Medicare expenditure.

         It is a sham and a delusion because the majority of the population believe that they pay their Medicare levy and, therefore, they are entitled to health care. But why $300m? That intrigued me. I then looked up the figures and discovered that, over the last five years, two million people have actually shifted out of private insurance. The cost of those two million people going onto the Medicare system is—surprise, surprise—$370m a year. This increase in the Medicare levy is actually going to bring in less money than it is going to cost the system for the people dropping out of private insurance—that is, one and one would appear to make two.

         So there are two avenues affecting it. One is the people who are dropping out of private insurance and therefore costing and being dependent on Medicare; and, on the other hand, less money is coming in from the Medicare levy because of the people who are out of work. So there is a double whammy going on, and the Government is looking for more funds.

         In the last financial year, health funds paid out more than $3.3 billion in benefits. Of this, more than half a billion dollars went to the public sector and more than $1.5 billion went to private hospitals. The actual annual growth in benefits was 8 per cent. But, as I mentioned, the paradox is that the coverage of the population by private insurance is now down to 40.7 per cent. They are dropping out rapidly because of the increasing cost. Ninety per cent of contributors are now insured at the top level. So there is a paradox. More than 20 per cent of people on low incomes have health insurance—they are not prepared to trust the Medicare system—and 30 per cent of people on higher incomes are also not insured. So there is a gross inequity.

The only reason the private schools received their funding was that they closed their doors and demonstrated that those school children could not be managed by the public system. We are heading in that direction.

         The Medicare system is broke. The Government is trying to prolong it by increasing the levy by 0.15 per cent—an extra $300m. As I have demonstrated, that figure represents less than the numbers that are dropping out of private insurance and going into the public system. The Government must recognise, when one of its own Labor health Ministers resigns over this particular topic, that the time has come to rethink the whole system. The Opposition has got an answer. We are incorporating the best features of Medicare. We recognise that it has good features, but because of the ageing population and the cost of technology, we must have a system that is based on freedom of choice and the opportunity for people to determine under which system they wish to be catered for.

         —I am sure that the hundreds of thousands of people who have tuned into the broadcast of the Senate's deliberations today are getting a bit confused as speakers in the debate have jumped from car parking to superannuation to Medicare. I say for their benefit that we are debating some cognate Bills. The one I want to refer to is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Car Parking) Bill 1992. This is a matter which is of great concern to a number of my constituents in Western Australia and, in particular, to those who are either employers or employees in the central business district, and, of course, to car parking operators, of whom a number are friends and former business associates of mine, in the central business district of Perth.

         Senator Panizza quite properly said that the real reason that this tax is being introduced has nothing to do with equity because this tax is not an equitable tax. There are very few that are. This is all about revenue raising. This Government, the Keating Labor Government, has one policy when it comes to tax reform—that is, to find new ways to tax people, to find new taxes to introduce and to raise more money.

         The fringe benefits tax, when it was first thought up by this Government in 1986-87, brought in about $535m. In the year 1992-93 it is expected to raise about $1.38 billion. The explanatory memorandum to this Bill shows that in its first full year of income to the revenue—that is, for the year 1994-95—it will raise another quarter of a billion dollars or $240m. The point already made by Senator Panizza is that the tax has nothing to do with equity. In fact, if one looks at the Bill and at the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, one sees that it is an inequitable and iniquitous tax and it is another way for this Federal Government to try to rip more money out of the pockets of long suffering taxpayers.

         There are a number of anomalies which I want to refer to very briefly today. Many employers insist that their employees need a car as a fundamental part of their employment. Many ads that we read in the employment sections of newspapers today show as a requirement of the employers that the employee have a car and be fit and able to drive a motor vehicle to be able to earn income. The provision of a car bay in that circumstance is certainly not a fringe benefit. That person is required to have a car. If he did not have a car or anywhere to park it he would not be able to be employed.

Indeed, the chair on which the employee sits could be considered to be a fringe benefit provided to that employee.

         The next point, which was alluded to by Senator Panizza, is that the Perth City Council, for example—and, I expect, city councils and planning authorities around this nation—forces developers of buildings to provide car bays when they develop central city office buildings. We are now seeing a tax being introduced which will require sensible employers, sensible people who are trying to minimise the costs of doing business in this country, to analyse closely the number of car bays they provide and to whom in their organisations they provide car bays. We will find, as a natural consequence of supply and demand and the cost of supplying car bays, that the number of cars actually parked under central city buildings will diminish significantly and that the number of car bays that are required in the CBD is somewhat diminished because of this extra tax.

This is another direct cost on employing Australians. This Government has an employment crisis, the like of which we have not seen in 60 years. Senator Button has called this tax an equitable tax.

We have decided that there is a need to put in place a business tax system that encourages businesses and does not hit them over the head every time they try to do something. That is the policy I will be supporting. This policy of the Keating Government should be opposed.

As you may well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the coalition's taxation reforms will make things much simpler than they are. As you well know, what we want to do is take seven taxes that are at the moment pre-point of sale and distribute them to post-point of sale to escape the inequity and lack of logic in the way that those taxes are now applied. So we will simply take them from the pre-point of sale and spread them out across all consumers post-point of sale.

As other senators have indicated, we believe that this nit-picking tax, by and large, will affect lower income earners more than higher income earners. But, of course, not only is it a cost on business; it affects a large number of workers—including, as I have said, low income workers—in many areas: in schools, TAFE colleges, railways; it affects building workers, public servants, police, and people who have disabled parking.

         The Government really needs to give an explanation as to how it can justify implementing this sort of change when the cardinal rule on taxation reform, as laid down by Mr Keating in 1985, was that taxation reform should make the system much more simple than it is now. This change simply does not do that. It seems to be nit-picking. It seems to have a detail in it that will require more people to be supervising the tax than should be necessary if the reform were to be done in a much simpler way.

         I begin by making some general comments about the Child Support Agency. My office is still receiving regular complaints about difficulties, particularly with access to the service—complaints about the telephones that forever seem to be engaged. The complaints also relate to problems with regard to overpayments and underpayments, and the fact that those matters are not easily sorted out, it seems. There are also difficulties in enforcing orders.

         Despite these problems, I stress that we are supportive of the work of the agency. It is a very sensitive area, one where I do not think we can ever solve all of the problems. But I believe that in recent times people are beginning to have far more confidence in the work of the agency and the agency certainly is, it seems, quite cost-effective in its role of passing money on to the parent who is caring for the children, and so on to the children. It seems that the non-custodial parents are, by and large, meeting their obligations.

         We have also seen a change in community attitudes: the community now expects the non-custodial parent to come up with their fair share of support and to accept their responsibilities. Mr Justice Fogarty, chair of the child support evaluation agency, recently pointed out that the scheme has challenged strongly the pre-scheme ethos of maintenance payments being a voluntary act. The community now expects that all parents will contribute to the support of their own children and they are now more likely to make arrangements for the payments of maintenance.

         In the time remaining, I wish to go very briefly through what is in this Bill. It continues a process of improving the scheme and toughens up the powers of the registrar. There are two changes I particularly want to deal with. The first is the way in which it deals with what is substantial access to a child; in fact, the actual definition of what is `substantial access'. Previously, it was that the child had to be with the parent for at least 40 per cent of the time. That has now moved to between 30 and 40 per cent; in fact, for the purposes of actually determining maintenance payments, the definition of `substantial access' will be for 35 per cent of the time. This remedies a problem which was identified by the child support evaluation and advisory group as a major source of dissatisfaction for non-custodial parents. It is a change that represents a fairer and more flexible approach to the formula.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second change deals with taxable income where the income test is not readily ascertainable. The child support formula is based on the historic taxable income of the parties plus an allowance for inflation. Where the taxable income is not available from the Tax Office or any other source, the legislation currently says that the registrar must in all cases select the figure of 2 1/2 times average weekly earnings and calculate the figure from that. That has caused major problems. It is generally termed a rather `blunt instrument' by which to determine the amount of money that is payable. This Bill allows the registrar to select an appropriate figure of up to 2 1/2 times the average weekly earnings. We certainly support this change. Indeed, these changes and all the other changes in the Bill are supported by the Democrats, but we look forward to even further improvements in the near future.

         The only problem that we have with this Bill is clause 38. Clause 38 inserts into the Child Support Act 1988 a provision that a statement or averment will be allowed as prima facie evidence of a matter in a prosecution under the Act. At present, the onus of proof in prosecutions is on the registrar. The Bill seeks to change this by providing for the registrar to be able to aver or state from the bar or table that a particular matter is fact. Averments can, of course, be a useful prosecutory tool. However, it needs to be understood that they reverse the onus of proof.

         They should, as a matter of legislative policy, be kept to a minimum. Both the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills have stated that on several occasions. While averments might be administratively convenient, they can pose significant difficulties for defendants. There is no obligation on the prosecution to confer with a defendant and, once a fact is averred, it stands as proof. The defendant then has to rebut it.

         Clause 38 also does not attempt to restrict the use of averment at all. For example, it makes no reference to the limiting of the proposed averment to matters particularly within the knowledge of the defendant. It does not restrict it to formalities or to the specific ingredients of the charge. All limitations which may have made its use more marginally acceptable are not in here. In fact, there is no compelling reason at all, other than convenience, advanced by the Government for having this clause in this Bill.

         —Mr Deputy President, as you know, there is some public perception that members of Parliament are dishonest. This is in part fuelled by the fact that sometimes there are different interpretations of the facts. What I want to speak about tonight is one of the most blatant examples of political dishonesty imaginable. The incident to which I refer is where a member of parliament has said not only something which is not substantiable but moreover something which is in direct contravention of the facts.

         I refer to a press release issued on Friday by Mr Neville Newell, the honourable member for Richmond. Mr Newell fulminated over what evil people we were in the coalition and, in particular, he claimed that the coalition would starve the Skillshare program of funds. As I will demonstrate, this is totally without foundation, but I believe that this press release indicates that Mr Newell regards the unemployed of his electorate as people he can manipulate and exploit to his own advantage without any compunction about telling them the truth.

         Given that the electorate of Richmond has one of the highest unemployment rates in New South Wales, what he has done is particularly distasteful. In the Tweed Shire alone, there are approximately 4,000 people on Jobsearch and Newstart allowances, but the real unemployment rate is higher. This is what Mr Newell said on Friday about the coalition's policy in relation to Skillshare:

        Local employment boards would take the place of Skillshare. These boards would lack the co-ordination of a national scheme and would depend on community volunteers. The whole idea of local employment boards would be particularly worrying for small and provincial communities such as Ballina.

        His press release continues:

       <para>
        This came as something of a surprise to me, so I thought I would check the Fightback package documents. A perusal of the Fightback documents reveals that Mr Newell is wrong and that the coalition is committed to not only maintaining the Skillshare program but also strengthening it. Page 254 of Fightback refers to community based strategies to deal with unemployment, to humanise the problem. It says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Such an approach was strongly recommended by the Kirby Committee's review of Labour Market Programs in the mid 1980s. The evidence suggests that community-based strategies are more effective in getting people back into the workforce than centrally run programs. About half of all participants in the existing community-based scheme, Skillshare, either obtained employment or continued in further education.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Coalition will therefore build on the Skillshare program, while allowing local communities to determine the best means of spending funds allocated for labour market programs.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Fightback continues to elaborate on that by explaining how, with the input of departmental officers, businessmen and people involved in the community, the programs run by Skillshare will be tailor made to the particular circumstances of the area. It is very clear that the coalition will maintain Skillshare. That is a long term commitment because, on the empirical evidence, this scheme is one of the best ways of creating jobs. The basis of this absurd comment is beyond me.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is also interesting to note that Skillshare at Coolangatta, which covers people both in the Coolangatta area and south of the border in Tweed Heads, runs exactly the sort of program to which we in the coalition refer in the Fightback documents. In fact, at Skillshare in Coolangatta one finds they are running courses to assist people to get jobs as taxi drivers and limousine drivers, because these are the occupations in high demand in the tourism industry.

       <para first-indent="16">

         There is not a shred of evidence to support Mr Newell's claim. Where he gets the idea that we will run down Skillshare to zero over a 10-year period is beyond me and anybody on this side of the chamber. What will really embarrass Mr Newell is the fact that just a couple of weeks ago after the Budget was brought down the Government cut back funding to some labour market programs, particularly Job Club in Murwillumbah, by 35 per cent.

         It is not the coalition which is taking the funds away from programs to get people jobs but the Government. By this press release, Mr Newell has shown himself willing to say anything to anyone to score a few political points. Unfortunately, it is at the expense of the truth and also at the expense of the people who live in his electorate.

Either way he cannot be trusted and, frankly, people would have to be crazy to vote for him a second time.

         —I rise tonight to comment very briefly on the issue raised by the High Court's stripping of the seat of Wills from Phil Cleary, MP. I still describe him as `Phil Cleary, MP' because I believe that a number of issues are raised by that High Court decision which this Parliament ought to at least consider. As we all know, the action in the court was taken ultimately as a result of the views of Mr Sykes, a candidate who received less than one per cent of the vote in that election. Also put in doubt by the High Court's decision is the position of candidates and members of parliament who, in one way or another, hold dual citizenship, having been born in another country.

         Three issues are raised by the High Court's decision—what I would describe as a lamentable black-letter decision that has taken little account of true democratic principles. The first issue is the question of the democratic rights of the electorate to choose who should represent it in parliament. Phil Cleary won the seat of Wills fairly and squarely, beating the combined efforts—I might say the highly organised efforts—of both major political parties. We are all aware of the visits to Wills made by Dr Hewson, the Leader of the Liberal Party, and many members of his front bench and back bench. The Labor Party also ran a highly organised campaign and Mr Cleary won despite those efforts. Mr Cleary also represented very clearly to the electorate a particular view, for example, about tariff policy and industry development, which has a right to be heard in this place.

         The ostensible grounds for invalidating Phil Cleary's election is the fact that he in theory was still an employee of the Crown, in this case the Victorian Education Department. He was, however, on unpaid leave—an employment situation, or an unemployment situation, that he genuinely thought did not prevent him running for the seat of Wills. He would not be the first who was either advised that way or believed that he was entitled to run by simply taking unpaid leave from a Crown employment position.

         That raises a second issue—namely, whether or not our election system is simple, easy to understand and open to all Australian citizens. One should not need to be a legal eagle, particularly a constitutional legal eagle, or have a PhD in politics to understand one's rights as either a voter or as a candidate. This is particularly relevant in Mr Cleary's case and in the case of all independents who do not have the guiding and advisory assistance that most of us have from our major political parties.

         We all know that if it were left up to every individual member of the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the National Party to make sure that their nominations were in order, on time and appropriate, half this Parliament probably would not be here. But we all know the facts of life are that major political parties organise the tickets on behalf of their candidates, organise their nominations, ensure that the nominations are in on time and comply with what I might describe as the ever-changing electoral law. That is the reality. We all get assistance from our major political parties.

In some cases we need to ensure that we work our way through some very complicated processes to ensure that we are able to pass onto our candidates the right advice.

         The third issue raised by the High Court decision—this does not relate of course particularly to Mr Cleary—is the incapacity, I believe, of the High Court to understand that Australia is now a multicultural country. All of us who have visited the United States, for example, find it extremely unusual, first of all that they do not have compulsory voting, but secondly and more importantly that unless one has been born in the United States, one cannot run for its presidency. Again, this is a deliberate attack on the rights of those people who immigrated to the United States and who have become trustworthy, reliable and appropriate citizens of that country.

         The High Court is taking us down that road. It is saying that there is a question mark over everyone who was not born in this country. I think that is an intolerable principle for the High Court to embed in stone. We are a multicultural country. We are a country where a significant percentage of our population was born overseas. There should at no time be a question mark over those citizens, especially those who have taken out citizenship in Australia and who are long term, permanent residents and citizens of this country entitled to vote.

         The High Court has said that there are certain aspects of a person being born in another country which may preclude them from being members of either the Senate or the House of Representatives and, I presume for that matter, some other parliaments. In some countries—I believe Greece is one example—it is legally impossible for one to renounce one's citizenship. So if one emigrates to this country and says, `I want to be an Australian. I want to be naturalised here. I wish to give up all my rights and responsibilities to my native Greek country', it is impossible under Greek law for such a person to do so.

         We have had occasions in the past, both in the Greek situation and in the situation relating to some of the Balkan countries, where people returning to those countries who were citizens of Australia and who lived here for many years were subjected, for example, to the question of conscription into the armies of their native countries. We found out very quickly, therefore, that those countries were determined not to allow their citizens to give up their Greek or Balkan citizenship but to maintain some form of dual citizenship.

         If it is a person's wish to be a citizen of Australia, to become a true part of this multicultural society, then they ought to be given the right to run for parliament. What the Greek Government, or for that matter any other government overseas, happens to say about them ought to be irrelevant. They have left that country, they are now a citizen of Australia and they ought to be able to run for this Parliament. They ought not to worry about whether or not, for example, the Swiss law says that even if one has lived in Australia for 20 years or more, as the Liberal candidate in Wills had lived, one still has to do certain technical things in order to ensure that one is no longer a Swiss citizen. Even if that is the case, we should not be worrying about that here.

         The High Court has taken a black letter approach to the Australian Constitution. That in itself is a dangerous approach because we are talking about a document that was written a long time ago, where the founding fathers were attempting to predict what Australia would be in 50 or 100 years time and were trying to deal with it in our Constitution. We should not be taking the Constitution and using it in a black letter way, as I believe the High Court has done today.

         Most people would probably say, `What is a politician doing criticising the referee's verdict? What is a politician doing talking in derogatory terms about the High Court?' The answer is simply that we have a role to play in this Parliament representing the people of Australia—the electorate's voice. The High Court has a role in terms of interpreting the law, ultimately the Constitution. There is a balance in a sense between these two institutions, but I believe that, from time to time, that balance has been overturned or weighted down in favour of the High Court. The High Court is not a legislative body. It should not set the social direction of Australia and, for that matter, the electoral direction of Australia. That ultimately is a matter for the decision making processes and election processes of parliament—and, ultimately, of course, the people of Australia, the voters.

The message that I am giving tonight to Mr Sykes and to other people, including a number of people in the High Court, is simply the fact that ultimately the electorate decides.

        (1) Generally local authorities will not be required to pay wholesale sales tax on leased equipment. Under the recently enacted sales tax law, leases of goods are categorised as either "long term" (i.e. for periods of at least 2 years or the effective working life of the goods, which ever is the shorter), or "short term" (i.e. periods of less than 2 years). Where a local council leases goods on a long term basis, a full exemption from sales tax is available on that lease. Where a local council leases goods on a short term basis, the lessor may enter into an agreement with the Commissioner under which the lessor is able to exclude from the taxable value of goods leased an amount calculated to equate to the proportion of the leases of those goods that he/she could reasonably be expected to make in "exempt circumstances" (e.g. to manufacturers and to councils and other exempt persons). The benefit of the reduced taxable value would then be expected to be passed on by the lessor to those exempt clients.

        (5) The NHMRC report recommends that the cyclodienes chlordane and heptachlor be permitted to be imported and registered for use only as termiticides in the construction of housing and buildings and its use be restricted to under slab usage and in crawl space under houses in accordance with the newly developed Standards Australia Code. The recommendation does not refer to Standards Australia Code AS 2178 and AS 2057. I am not able to anticipate when the recommendations in the report may be implemented. It will be for other agencies, including the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council and individual States and Territories, to decide whether they wish to adopt the NHMRC recommendations and, if so, to decide on the timetable for the cessation of other current registered uses of the cyclodienes.
