At the same time I am very much aware of the responsibilities attaching to this office. The standards set by my predecessors have been very high indeed and I shall be doing all within my role not only to emulate them but also to carry out my responsibilities in a way that will reflect credit on each of us and on the Australian Parliament and the parliamentary system of government. With your permission, I shall now occupy the chair.

       My President, your qualifications for being President of the Senate are considerable. You were elected to the Senate in 1962. If my arithmetic is correct, that means that this is your twenty-first year as a member of the Senate. You have been a Chairman of Committees of the Senate. You were a Minister of State between 1972 and 1975. You have served on numerous committees of the Senate and, more recently, you have been Deputy President of the Senate. I believe it is appropriate that a Deputy President of the Senate should become, in the course of time and in the course of political wisdom in Australia, President of the Senate. Mr President I personally wish you well. I know that you start in your office with the support and good wishes of the members of this chamber.

       Senator Button has referred to your very considerable experience in this place- to your role as Deputy President and as Chairman of Committees. Of course you are familiar with all facets of what happens in this chamber because you have served as a senator, as a senior member in opposition and as a Minister. I am sure, Mr President, that your experience makes you very aware of the importance of your role as far as the Opposition and minor parties are concerned and of the fact that we look to you for those standards of impartiality and fairness which I believe you displayed as Chairman of Committees.

       So, Mr President, we have confidence in you because of your recent experience and we look forward to working with you. I am sure that the work you did as Chairman of Committees was part of the reason that you got the support of the majority of honourable senators in the ballot today. I can assure you that you will have the full support of the Opposition in the discharge of your duties of office. As well as extending you best wishes from the Opposition I would like to extend my personal best wishes to you on your election to the presidency.

Although it was a secret ballot I make no secret of the fact that you won our support. You won our support for two reasons, which I stated a couple of years ago when we voted for the then Liberal -National Country Party nominee and which I state again now. We believe that this place is entirely separate from the Executive. It is a House of Parliament and is a separate arm of government from the Executive. Therefore, it is irrelevant which party is in power when determining who should be President of this place.

       The fact is, Mr President, that you are a member of the political party which has the greatest number of honourable senators in this place and because of that we think it fitting that you should be President. In the same way, we believe that a member of the party with the second greatest number of honourable senators in this place should be the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees in this place. The second reason you won our support is that we believe you to be a fine and proper person to hold this very important office. I am glad personally to see you there because I am pleased to have been able to call you a personal friend of mine over the last 21 years.

       You have a difficult job ahead of you as your predecessors have had. It is a hung Senate; it will be an interesting Senate and a fascinating place in which to look at legislation. I have in mind that this Senate will run more smoothly with a greater deal of concensus than other Senates. I look forward to working with the leaders of the other parties and with you and your assistants in this place. The last Senate was not an easy one to chair, and I place on record my party's appreciation of your predecessor, Sir Harold Young, who, sometimes under extremely difficult circumstances, did what I believe to be a very creditable and worthwhile job. It is worthy to note that not once during his tenure of office was any motion of dissent from one of his rulings moved or even, as far as I am concerned, contemplated. You will have full support from us and I wish you well in your difficult task.

Consequently you have been a personal friend of mine for all of those years-pretty close to 30 years. During that time we have enjoyed a warm and friendly relationship.

We hope that as our new President you will enjoy the co- operation that has been expressed by honourable senators opposite. You will certainly have the very strong support of the Government.

       The new Government has assumed office at a time of Australia's gravest economic crisis since the Great Depression fifty years ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the twelve months from March 1982, unemployment grew from 6.6 per cent to 10 .4 per cent of the workforce. Unemployment among fifteen to nineteen year olds in the workforce rose above 29 per cent. It is estimated some two million of our fellow Australians are now living in poverty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Accordingly, my new advisers will give the highest priority to the task of restoring sustained growth to the Australian economy, now in deep recession.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government, however, is deeply committed to the need for social, economic, legal and Parliamentary reform.
      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       My advisers are confident that this historic Conference has achieved wider community understanding of the nature of the economic problems facing Australia and broad agreement upon a national effort to attack those problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       The agreement reached at the Conference contains the basic framework and approach to enable Australia to begin to arrest the serious economic decline and place the economy on a path of sustained, non-inflationary growth. My advisers have assured the participants at the Summit and their representative organisations of the Government's support and assistance in building upon the foundations laid so successfully at the Conference. An essential ingredient to the success of the Conference was the dissemination of information to an extent not previously attempted in Australia. My advisers have undertaken that this process of information-sharing, which they believe essential to the making of sound economic decisions, will continue.
      </para>
      <para>
       Certain matters arising from the Conference will require legislative action which you will be asked to consider during this Session.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will establish an Economic Planning Advisory Council, representing governments, business, unions, farmers and community groups, to advise on economic developments and provide a forum for community consultation on national economic and social strategies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government will establish a price surveillance mechanism to assess pricing decisions made by the strategic price setters, in both the private and public sectors. The Government will also review the structure and operation of the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority to ensure adequate supervision of petroleum prices.

I should say that Senator Hamer came into the Senate in 1978 and in more recent years has been a Deputy Chairman of Committees. In that role he discharged his responsibilities with impartiality, fairness and, if I might say so, an encouraging appearance of interest in the debates which took place in this chamber. I wish him well, and do so on behalf of the Government.

       Mr President, a number of honourable senators here have tasted the delights of both chambers. Senator Hamer is one, Senator Jessop is another and Senator Chipp is another. I suppose it is true in this as in all things that the converts tend to be those who are most attached to the principles of what they are converted to. I have little doubt that Senator Hamer will, in his role as Chairman of Committees, look to the interests and traditions of the Senate and the protection of them.

We have embarrassed him by criticising the Liberal Party on how unwise it has been in not using more fully a man of such talents as Senator Hamer. At least we can rest assured today that the Senate has had the wisdom to see and recognise those talents and to elevate him to this very high and respected position. We wish him well and offer our total support.

My association with him on the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs leads me to attest to his very keen intelligence, his following of an argument as to its relevance and his sense of humour. These are all qualities which I am sure he will bring to this chamber as we discharge the duties which the Governor-General indicated to us earlier in the day are our business for the coming Parliament.

        Can the Minister explain why these crucial factors in Australia's economic recovery are attributed in the communique only to business participants in the Summit?

The communique, in respect of all its paragraphs, was accepted by those members of the Government who were present at the Summit as a statement of shared views which arose from the Summit. The two paragraphs to which Senator Chaney referred are matters of concern to the Government, as they are to business participants in the Summit and, indeed, to trade union participants in the Summit.

My colleague in another place, Dr Blewett, has been consulting with the pharmaceutical profession and various pensioner groups and others to see what can be done about this matter but, of course, legislative changes are needed. Certainly the form, in its present form, will be abandoned. Agreement has been reached, I believe, with the pharmaceutical profession. The arrangements to abandon the form will be put to the Government shortly and I hope that in the May session of Parliament this matter will be resolved to everybody's satisfaction.

         —How the fallen have become mighty! I draw the former Attorney's attention to the terms of the detailed Press release which was issued jointly by myself and the Minister for Defence, Gordon Scholes, on 14 April and which describes, in very considerable detail-I am happy to seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard if it would assist the convenience of honourable senators-the precise course of events, who knew what and when. The reality of the matter is that when the news broke about the Mirage flight on the Sunday afternoon I had no knowledge that other than a single flight had taken place. It was not until Tuesday afternoon, as this statement clearly indicates, that I developed knowledge that there had been two flights. I would be only too pleased to endeavour to oblige the honourable senator with any other information that he seeks to extract from me. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the text of that Press statement which, I believe, answers the question the honourable senator put to me.

        FLIGHTS OVER SOUTH-WEST TASMANIA
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal for a RAAF photographic-survey flight over the Tasmanian Dam site was first discussed on a Department to Department basis on Tuesday morning 5 April.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was agreed by Attorney-General's Department and Defence Department officials that the most technically appropriate means of filming would be to use an F-111.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later that day, the Attorney-General spoke to the Minister for Defence and requested the use of an F-111 for the purpose of evidence-gathering in the High Court action, if that was consistent with the RAAF's training and operational activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Defence agreed with the proposal, but requested confirmation in writing. That confirmation was supplied by the Attorney-General in a letter dated and signed the following day, Wednesday 6 April.
       </para>
       <para>
        The detailed arrangements for the carrying out of the photography at the Attorney-General's request were then made by the RAAF.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the belief that the photography was required by Thursday 8 April, and because of the unavailability on that day of an appropriately-equipped F-111, the RAAF tasked a Mirage for the flight, which took place on that day.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the event, the photo coverage obtained by the Mirage proved incomplete, and the original task was completed by the F-111 when it became available on Friday 9 April.
       </para>
       <para>
        Neither Minister became aware until significantly later that two aircraft rather than one had been used to complete the task.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the Minister for Defence, this occurred when he received Departmental advice to this effect late on Monday afternoon.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the Attorney-General, he had been alerted to the possibility of there having been more than one flight by his Departmental officers on Monday morning after he arrived in Canberra from Melbourne, but did not receive confirmation of this, or an explanation as to how it had come about, until he received from his Department late on Tuesday afternoon, 12 April, the same information from the Defence Department which had been given to the Defence Minister the day before.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister first became aware of the RAAF filming as a result of the press reports of the Mirage flight on Sunday 10 April.
       </para>
       <para>
        Early on Monday morning he advised the Minister for Defence that no further use was to be made of Defence personnel or facilities in respect to the Tasmanian dam issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General first spoke to the Prime Minister on the question during the Monday morning break of the Summit Conference. In the course of that discussion-which focussed on the general question of principle involved in RAAF photo-reconnaissance of the dam site, and not matters of detail-he told the Prime Minister that he had just received information from the Attorney-General's Department from which it appeared that there may in fact have been two flights the previous week and that he was seeking verification of this.
       </para>
       <para>
        No further substantive discussion on this issue took place between any of the three Ministers until today.

I find myself rather in the position, I suppose, of a judge at first instance who subsequently is overruled on a court of appeal. Having been overruled, I must have been wrong. I indicate to the Senate however, without seeking to defend that decision, that it was taken against a background of what appeared to me to be four highly relevant factors: First, the need to monitor closely the situation on the ground in the South West wilderness area to ensure that in the period between the commencement of the action and its hearing and determination by the High Court no irreparable damage took place. The second factor that I perceived to be relevant was the wildly inflammatory statements of the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Gray, over the weekend of 3 to 5 April which suggested that if there was any attempt to monitor that situation by way of the physical presence in the area of Federal police or anyone else, then a situation of physical violence could be expected.

All sorts of inflammatory statements were being made by all sorts of people and it did not seem to me to serve the cause of rationality to have people crawling through the undergrowth with burnt cork on their noses or engaging in any other form of physical, on the ground, surveillance of that kind. The third factor that seemed to me to be of relevance in this situation, and against which my decision should be understood, is that it was undoubtedly the case, as I was advised by my Department and have subsequently confirmed, that RAAF photo reconnaissance of this kind is a thoroughly routine activity which has occurred on innumerable occasions and which I am happy, in answer to a later question, to elaborate should it become necessary and including situations where the military resources have been used in aid of the Commonwealth in its endeavour to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth.

There was no element, I might add, in probable anticipation of a further question or supplementary question, of deception or intended deception involved in an RAAF over flight at that altitude for the simple and obvious reason that, if this material was to have been of any utility in the kind of interim injunction court proceedings for which it was designed, obviously it would have had to have been produced in evidence in the court and the source of the material disclosed.

Does he agree that this course of action, if pursued, constitutes a most flagrant breach of a specific promise made in writing to the Australian electorate during the election campaign and could, according to industry estimates, cost up to 8,000 jobs as the market would clearly prefer to buy imported tyres which would be cheaper than retreads if sales tax were applied?

In regard to the second part of his question, it is correct that the Minister for Finance stated that no action would be taken to overturn the determination previously made by the Commissioner of Taxation on this matter . There are a number of reasons for that decision. Firstly, and most importantly , the full enormity of the Budget deficit which this Government had inherited required the Government to look more closely at the revenue implications of the Taxation Commissioner's decision. Secondly, it is not correct, as Senator Chipp has said, that people will be buying new, imported tyres instead of having old tyres retreaded. It is not correct for two reasons: Firstly, because a person who supplies his or her own casing for a retread will not be liable to pay tax on the casing but will be liable to pay tax only on the retreaded component-the value added to the casing-and, secondly, because, according to the advice that I have received--

The second reason that they are not likely to do what Senator Chipp suggested is, I am advised, that the price of a new tyre of comparable size is $45.50; the price of a retread, even if the sales tax were applied to both the retread and the casing, would be about $28.60. Senator Chipp asked also about employment implications. Quite clearly the claims that it will cost 8,000 jobs are gross exaggerations. It is not at all clear whether there will be any net employment effects whatsoever.

         —Senator Childs asks me about a decision I made recently to overturn the decision made by the previous Government as a result of a recommendation of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions which sought to hand over to private enterprise a considerable proportion of the work undertaken by the Government; that is, work undertaken at repatriation and artificial limbs and appliance centres. I saw fit to change that decision because it was proven to be very costly to the Commonwealth. The figures show that, despite the fact that there was an increase of only 4.7 per cent from one year to the next in the manufacture of artificial limbs and that repairs decreased by 13.7 per cent, the total cost went up by a dramatic 28.8 per cent. So we finished up with no cost benefit as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions but an increase in government expenditure which denied the very purpose of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. I have taken the additional step of indicating that no new manufacturers will participate in the free limb scheme and that the Government's operation will continue, with a great deal of assistance from the Commonwealth.

The situation is obviously fluid. Australia has obvious moral obligations to press the point about the absence of self-determination having been allowed to the Timorese people. It is a matter for judgment, which will have to work itself out in the months ahead, as to how that strong expression of a moral viewpoint, to which our party certainly remains strongly committed, can be accommodated with the overall pattern of Australia's interests here and in the region. Nothing that the Foreign Minister has said in any way reflects a derogation from the policy position which has been strongly expressed over a long period by the Australian Labor Party.

         —Yes, in general the Government will honour the funding commitments entered into by the previous Government. The centres which the honourable senator mentioned have created some difficulty for both the Federal Government and the South Australian State Government. The previous Government announced to the State Minister, the Honourable Greg Crafter, on 2 March, only three days before the election, the expenditure of some $500,000 under the States Grants (Home Care) Act on senior citizens centres, I think at Gawler, Elizabeth and Blackwood. Honourable senators may know that these centres are in fact funded by a combination of State and Federal Government money and in general the Federal Government follows as much as possible and within budgetary limits the recommendations of the State Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The difficulty in this situation was that there had been a change of government in South Australia in November. The present Minister involved, the Minister of Community Welfare, in fact was very surprised when he received on 2 March a Press statement announcing Federal Government funding for centres which was contrary to the advice he had been given. He thought that this was a funny way in which to consult with State governments. A similar situation happened in Western Australia where an attempt was made, according to my understanding, to get the State Labor Minister to agree with priorities which had been established by the previous Liberal Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        I found some difficulty when faced with a situation in which the previous Government quite clearly ignored the wishes of the existing State governments and chose to follow the views of the previous State Government, even though in South Australia that Government had been rejected by the people in the previous November. I also found it rather difficult to deal with grants which had been announced like this only two or three days before the election. Perhaps the Minister involved did not believe that anything could happen on 5 March. Unfortunately for him, it did.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there is no question that the people who sought funding for these senior citizens centres had their expectations raised. It was announced officially that they would receive such funding. In consultation with both State Ministers, we have agreed that it would be wrong of us in these circumstances to withdraw this funding even though the situation in Western Australia involves of necessity considerable funding in the next financial year. So the people involved in, I think, the Gawler, Elizabeth and Blackwood senior citizens centres can rest assured that they will get their funding. I am disturbed only at the manner in which those grants were announced by the previous Government and, in particular, their timing.

Might I indicate in relation to the tabling and free and full disclosure of this information that there are two particular points in relation to which hormones might be set racing if I do not anticipate the point at this stage. The first point is this: There is an apparent discrepancy between the account by Mr Glare of my Department in his minute dated 11 April 1983 and that of Major-General Gration in his minute of the same date as to whether a telephone conversation between Mr Glare and Group Captain Waterfield took place at about 1 p.m. or 3 p. m. on 5 April 1983.

My own clear recollection, as is indicated in my letter to Mr Scholes of 20 April, which letter is also included in this bundle of material, is that the conversation took place just before that Cabinet meeting began.

Those honourable senators who paid attention to the Governor-General's Speech would have heard within that Speech a number of very general and wide-ranging commitments to overcome these disadvantages. Undoubtedly, many of the disadvantages that young women are currently experiencing on the labour market stem from the disadvantages and the unequal opportunities which they have in the school system.

        I have already set in train a number of initiatives by which these disadvantages can be overcome. As I have indicated, I want one of the priority areas for the revived national curriculum development exercise to be in this area of the education of girls. We will also be asking the Schools Commission to upgrade its efforts in this direction and to that end I will shortly be making an announcement concerning the appointment of a new commissioner. In general, all of the projects funded through the Schools Commission and all of the activities of my Department will now be pursued in such a way that they offer full and real equal opportunity to girls and boys in post-secondary education-to women as with men.

However, the honourable senator will also be aware that the policy of the new Government is that land rights will be achieved in all parts of Australia and that the Federal Government will undertake the responsibility of seeing that they are achieved. Clearly, it is preferable if land rights in the States are achieved as a result of State legislation. That is obviously the most direct and most efficient way of achieving the objective of land rights.

        It is clear that several States are prepared to act in this way. South Australia, of course, already has land rights legislation and is, I understand, planning to extend the provisions of its land rights legislation. New South Wales has made a start by implementing land rights legislation. In Victoria there is preparation for State legislation to achieve land rights for Victorian Aborigines. In the case of the Northern Territory, of course, land rights have been enacted by the Federal Government. But it seems at this stage that the question of Tasmanian land rights will have to be resolved by some sort of Federal Government action, although clearly it is very early days and obviously a great deal of consultation with Aboriginal Tasmanians, the State Government and the Opposition in Tasmania will need to take place before an appropriate course of action can be determined.

         —I put on record my resistance to the description of these flights as 'spy flights'. That implies something in the nature of an incursion into a foreign country. I appreciate that on some occasions that is the way in which Tasmanian representatives in this place behave. Indeed, on some occasions it appears as though they come from another planet. I still think that description is nonetheless wildly inappropriate to the occasion and I resist it. As to the legality of the flights in question, I satisfied myself both before the flights took place, and certainly subsequently, that there was no question whatsoever but that the flights were legal. Indeed, in the last three or four days I have had oral confirmation of that perception from the Solicitor-General of Australia with whom I raised that question.

        There are some legal uncertainties about the precise nature and extent of the powers available to the military and the limitations on those powers in the context of aid to the civilian power. There is no question but that under section 61 of the Constitution and with the legislative back-up of the Defence Act under section 51 (6), plus a whole mass of individual pieces of legislation and Defence Force regulations and directions that bear upon this, the flights in question were not only entirely within the range of normal practice so far as the Royal Australian Air Force is concerned but also unquestionably within the legality of the RAAF, and indeed the military role.

        —Senator Crowley opened her batting in this place by asking a question about the allocation of funds under the States Grants (Home Care) Act. The purport of the question and the answer taken together was that there was something to be disturbed about in the manner in which funds were allocated under that Act, in particular in Western Australia and South Australia. As I was the Minister concerned, I would like to advise the Senate that, as was put down by Senator Grimes in his answer, those decisions are made by the Commonwealth following advice from State governments, which advice is based on criteria which have been laid down, such as numbers of aged and so on.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In all cases that I can recall I acted upon State advice in making approvals or in approving grants under that Act. I have no recollection at all of the particular circumstances in South Australia, apart from receiving representations from all around Australia from individual centres to which my response was that it was a matter which would have to await State government recommendation. I have no recollection of anything other than simply accepting the Department's recommendation. With respect to Western Australia, at the request of the State Minister, the original recommendation to make grants to, I think, three centres, the third of which was the shire of Rockingham, was reconsidered. The State Minister at the time in the previous Government, Mr Young, sought a revision on the basis that another centre in the shire of Melville might be included. I sought further advice from my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       There was a change of government. I had some representations from the State Minister. Following those representations, with his approval, people from my office spoke with officers of his State Department who confirmed a State view that the grants should be made to the three centres originally recommended and the centre at Melville. I checked, and my understanding is that the centre at Melville is in a Labor State electorate and in a Labor Federal electorate. I proceeded with the totality of the grants which had been somewhat delayed by the back and forth which had occurred. I wish to reject any suggestion that there was any political motivation in what occurred at that time.

       The meeting of the Australian Constitutional Convention to be held this year in Adelaide will be the fifth plenary meeting of the Convention. Since the last Convention in Perth in 1978 the standing committees have considered a number of proposals arising from that Convention. On this occasion the Convention will conduct its business in the presence of a number of officially accredited services which will widen the range of participation in the Convention.
      </para>
      <para>
       The motion I moved is in very similar terms to the motion which was moved prior to the 1978 Convention and earlier motions. It, of course, relates specifically to Commonwealth representation. That will be fixed at 16 delegates, with each State sending 12 delegates and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory each sending two delegates. There will also be delegates from local government and representatives from each State. There appears to be some concern about the personnel who will attend the Constitutional Convention as representatives of the Commonwealth Parliament. I understand that a document has been circulated in the chamber showing the names of the proposed personnel. The names of the senators representing the Government at the Convention are: Senator Button, Senator Evans and Senator Tate. Mr President, I understand that Senator Chaney, as Leader of the Opposition, will inform you of the names of the Opposition representatives.
