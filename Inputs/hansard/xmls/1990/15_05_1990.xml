       Animal Patents

      <para>
       To the President and members of the Australian Senate:
      </para>
      <para>
       The undersigned citizens of Australia and custodians of the Earth oppose the patenting of animals and the process for altering them. Animal patents would reduce biodiversity, compromise animal welfare, concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.

      <para>
       Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more;
      </para>
      <para>
       2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.

       Vietnam: End of War List

       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:
      </para>
      <para>
       The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.

         —I thought that Question Time was a vehicle for eliciting information. This question was put to me last night by Senator Chapman during an Estimates committee hearing. We will run through it again, if that is what Senator Chapman wants. There has been some outdated reporting on what has been happening to the prices of cars. The Government is well aware that the track record of the industry on price has not been as good as it could have been. The Government is aware of that, as is everybody in the community, because the Automotive Industry Authority publishes an annual report in which it comments on car prices, quality issues and a whole range of issues which affect the motor vehicle industry and its performance. Those comments in the annual report have not always been received with great favour by the motor vehicle industry. It has not always been entirely happy about them, but I regard it as proper for a government body which has something to do with the administration of a highly protected industry to say those things.

       <para>
        Since substantial tariff cuts were introduced in mid-1988 there have, however, been some good improvements on past performances which were influenced by unfavourable currency movements. For example, with the 1985-86 devaluation of the Australian dollar, car prices in Australia rose significantly. Whether the price of manufactured vehicles should or should not have followed up the price of imported vehicles which followed from that devaluation is a debatable point. That is a perfectly good question and a legitimate debating point.

        But price trends over the last few years will show overall that the industry has lifted its game and that often apparent price increases reflect changed specifications and upgrades of motor vehicles, both here and in other countries, demanded by an increasingly sophisticated motoring public. Motor vehicles which are manufactured here and imported today are technologically much more sophisticated then they were a few years ago. That is reflected in price.

        Last week, the Automotive Industry Authority reported that price increases had moderated substantially and, for the past two years, both imported and locally made car prices increased at rates below the consumer price index. Price increases in the March 1990 quarter represent the eighth successive quarter during which car prices have been below the CPI. My answer to the question relating to average weekly earnings is yes if that figure is spaced over a period of years. Sure, there were significant increases in car prices following the devaluation of the Australian dollar and there have been increases in car prices, both here and elsewhere, as a result of the more sophisticated specifications required by consumers.

In that context I refer mainly to the Basic Industries Group in Western Australia-and extraordinary organisation which has pushed quite lovingly the League of Rights line about world government and all the rest of it. I worry about people like that and I am not certain that they represent their constituency. Nonetheless, they have been doing it, aided and abetted by some people in the Western Australian Liberal Party. Having said that, I point out that Mr Pearce in particular has spent quite a deal of time talking to people in the region and opposition has greatly diminished. However, we need to talk more to those people and ensure that a boundary can be finalised.

        I also am aware from the newspaper report that Bunnings, the company referred to in the question, has disagreed fundamentally with the propositions that have been put by Senator Vallentine, extrapolated from the report, and has invited environmental groups to two of its facilities. According to the newspaper report, Mr Bunning said that his company recovered about 90 per cent of the average log, including chips, charcoal and low grade timber products. A spokesman for the company said that it was mathematically impossible to recover 60 per cent of a log as sawn timber.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to enter into this contention about who is right exactly and who is wrong exactly other than to make the point that these reports are generated by people with a particular point of view in this debate and they ought not to be necessarily regarded as objective in terms of an analysis of the issues. The other point I need to make is that the forests in Western Australia are managed by the Western Australian Government, through its Department of Conservation and Land Management, on the principle of sustainable yield; that is to say, when the forests are logged, they regenerate; the rate at which they are logged determines what the yield is and not what a forestry company or a timber industry company may wish to claim.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, what determines the volume of cut is the rate of regeneration and the replacement of that forest. So from that point of view the implication that somehow there will be a complete loss of forest cover is an implication that ought not to be accepted automatically; that was indeed an implication in the question. Until the report from which these details are extrapolated is made available to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy-which until now has not been favoured with a copy of the report-I do not think I can add anything more to the answer.

        If a pipeline were run from the Lake Alexandrina outlet of the Murray back to Albury and the Albury City Council had to drink that water, maybe its view of its responsibility to the downstream communities would be greater.

        Our concerns at a Federal level are real. For example, we know that the Albury City Council beat its breast that it has reduced the critically important nutrient of phosphorous in its treated sewage down to two milligrams per litre. It regards that as an achievement. That is hardly an achievement, because I can inform the Senate that the Canberra and Queanbeyan sewage treatment works' phosphorus level is 0.5 milligrams per litre-that is to say, 1.5 milligrams less than the Albury City Council claims is an achievement for it. That is just one chemical without reference to the other chemicals and heavy metals involved.

        Under me as Minister for Resources in the previous Government and now under the present Minister for Resources, Mr Alan Griffiths, we have undertaken a process of developing a water quality policy for the Murray-Darling basin. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council will deal with this matter at its next meeting, which I understand is in July, and I hope that we can see an end to some local government authorities and industrial enterprises treating the Murray as a dumping gutter and a recognition and respect for that river system as being vital to the economic and ecological well-being of the Riverland States.

        The regulation of the disposal of hazardous wastes, which includes hospital wastes of the kind to which the honourable senator refers, is the responsibility of the States and Territories and not of the Commonwealth. As I understand the situation, the New South Wales Government, however, does have this issue under investigation now. I know that Mr Gibson has requested the Greiner Government to hold a royal commission. I am not aware, though, of whether the New South Wales Government has responded.
       </para>
       <para>
        The New South Wales Government has also set up a committee of local members, which includes Mr Gibson, to look at the issue. I understand that an inspection has taken place, although no report has yet come back. When I get further information on the outcome of the review, I will let the honourable senator know.
       </para>
       <para>
        In so far as the disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes generally is concerned, the Commonwealth has for the past couple of years, along with the New South Wales and Victorian governments, had a task force in operation to look at the siting of Australia's first high temperature incinerator actually to deal with the problem. Sydney is one city sitting on a number of environmental time bombs of this kind. As I understand it from my last inquiry, there are something like 10,000 barrels of polychlorinated biphenyls being stored in Sydney. Any accident involving those barrels could create a disaster of enormous dimension. That is a matter that will have to be dealt with by a high temperature incinerator.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth and the New South Wales governments will have to keep this issue of hazardous and toxic wastes under constant review. It is something that has been ignored in Australia forever and our society cannot afford to ignore it a day longer.

        The answer to the first question is yes. As to question two: it is not the normal practice for the company-and I must interpose here that we are talking about Australian Defence Industries and not the Department of Defence-to provide detailed plans for the general public. However, the Elizabeth City Council has been provided with detailed briefs and has visited the site as recently as 10 May. Councillors and council staff were given every opportunity to examine the site and ask detailed questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Question three: The types of fuel to be manufactured at the new facility will be cast composite and cast double based solid propellant rocket motors. Question four: Fuel will be stored at the site. It will be stored in solid state as cast motors. It is not possible to discuss in a public forum the quantity of these materials which will be stored but quantities will be small and will comply with NATO safety principles. The Department monitors conformity to those principles.
       </para>
       <para>
        Question five: Yes, it will have a military use. Question six: Yes, it will be exported. Question seven: No, it will not have a role to play in nuclear warheads.

       <para>
        Question eight: Senator Coulter seeks an invitation. I now extend that invitation. He will be very welcome to visit the site at any time. I ask him to give us a day's notice so that people will be expecting him.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally Senator Coulter asked about the NATO safety standards. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Salisbury site conforms fully with the NATO safety principles. To expand on that, rather than take a lot of time in Question Time, I might write to Senator Coulter on the exact safety measures being used and how they will be complied with. It would take too long at Question Time to go into that detail.

         —I do have something in the brief of the Minister for Community Services and Health. I assume that Senator Jones is referring to a paper entitled MSG: A balanced perspective presented at the recent Australian Institute of Food Science and Technology annual convention by Dr Tarasoff of the University of Western Sydney. I understand that the paper reviews the results of ingestion of monosodium glutamate under controlled laboratory conditions in 41 healthy subjects using well accepted research techniques. The results show monosodium glutamate by itself in doses three to four times that normally ingested in a typical Chinese meal caused symptoms in some subjects. The symptoms included headaches, light-headedness, stiffness and tightness, tingling, warmth and burning and, finally, weakness of limbs. Many of the symptoms usually attributed to the Chinese restaurant syndrome, including asthma, were not found in this sample group. The majority of symptoms were described as mild and lasted from 10 to 60 minutes after onset.

       <para>
        This paper is a useful contribution to the store of knowledge on the effects of monosodium glutamate, although caution must be exercised because of the relatively small sample size. The study shows that symptoms, although mild, do occur and reinforces the need for adequate labelling of products as specified in the National Health and Medical Research Council's food standards code so that those persons who believe they are affected are aware of the presence of monosodium glutamate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that in the case of packaged food in Australia an indication of the presence of monosodium glutamate-I think by reference to a number-is required. In relation to unpackaged food there is no such requirement. I will take Senator Jones's concern in this matter into my discussions with those concerned with my portfolio interests as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs to see whether that provision of information in relation to unpackaged food might be made available so that people can make an informed choice.

        <para in-line="1">
         —At the outset it should be stated that the Government's initiative in this area of a training guarantee is based on a recognition of and very strong commitment to understanding that businesses in all States need to undertake quality training. They need to do so to realise two objectives, both for the businesses involved and for the economy in general. Those objectives, of course, are to improve productivity and enhance competitiveness, thus ensuring that businesses compete successfully in what is a growing competitive market.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The report from Western Australia is one that is of interest. It should be noted, for instance, that Western Australia is behind in terms of the amount of money expended on training at the moment. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) training expenditure survey found that average expenditure on formal training in Western Australia was 1.6 per cent of gross wages and salaries, compared with the Australia-wide average of 2.2 per cent. So there is already a very substantial difference in terms of expenditure. It should also be noted that amongst employers reporting some formal training, average expenditure was 2.1 per cent, compared with the nationwide average of 2.9 per cent. As I say, there is already some ground to be made up in Western Australia. There are a couple of reasons why there is that sort of discrepancy. The survey indicated that on average Western Australian employers who provide training provide fewer hours of training per employee than the national average. They provide 5.9 hours compared with the national average of 7.9.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other reason for this discrepancy is that a higher proportion of firms in Western Australia-about 83 per cent compared with 78 per cent for the whole of Australia-spend absolutely nothing on formal training. It has been maintained by Mr Maynard that Western Australian businesses have a different case. The 1987 ABS data show that the proportion of enterprises in Western Australia which employ fewer than 10 people is approximately the same as it is in other States-about 90 per cent. That is the benchmark which will be applied as to which enterprises are within the ambit of the training guarantee and which are not. So we have the same proportion of enterprises operating nationwide.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Maynard also makes the point that a higher proportion of small businesses in Western Australia will have to pay the levy. In response to that, it should be acknowledged that those firms which are covered by the training guarantee will have to increase expenditure on training, rather than pay the levy. That is a direct objective of the Government in this area. The third point that Mr Maynard makes is that this structured training does not suit the nature of Western Australian industries. In response to that, Senator Beahan and other honourable senators should note that all industries will benefit from improving the quality of training they offer, including structured on the job training.
       </para>
       <para>
        The role given to industry training agencies will provide an increased opportunity and avenue for the industries training committees and industry associations to develop appropriate structured training arrangements for their industries. The last part of Senator Beahan's question refers to monitoring the training guarantee. In that respect, the Government will use the training expenditure survey to monitor the effect of the training guarantee on expenditure on training at both state and industry level.

       INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY: REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA'S ENERGY POLICY AND PROGRAMS

        <para in-line="1">
         —The International Energy Agency, which is a subagency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), did conduct its periodic inspection of Australia's energy policy and programs and reported its findings on 3 May this year. Overall, the thrust and direction of the report is in line with the Government's energy policies. The report is complimentary of the Federal Government's actions over the last three years to increase competitiveness and efficiency of our energy industries through its involvement in the deregulation of the oil markets, through introducing a flexible tax regime, such as the resource rent tax, and through the rationalisation of the coal industry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In fact, the report gives a big tick to the Government's micro-economic reform program as achieved thus far and endorses our approach for waterfront and coastal shipping reform which is the responsibility of Senator Collins. It also speaks complimentarily of our deregulation of the local liquefied petroleum gas market.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report does, however, raise a number of issues and concerns in relation to the current energy policy. Several of them are the perennial issues that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development typically raises, and many are related to the fact that we are a federation of States and in that sense have a split approach, given that most of the domestic electricity generation is carried by the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the issues which were raised under the heading of criticisms included the rationalisation of tax and non-tax charges; the integration of State gas and electricity systems; emphasis on energy conservation and substitution; and the promotion of exploration and development through the appropriate taxation measures. Many of those things will be addressed by the Industry Commission inquiry dealing with those matters; and I think the Treasurer has already announced that.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the areas of criticism is the consistent area of international objective criticism of Australia-that is, where the State governments, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland under its old guise, loaded rail freight costs as an extra tax surcharge and as a hidden tax on exports. The OECD has singled that out for criticism. I understand that Mr Kerin and Mr Griffiths, the two responsible Ministers, have referred the IEA's report to the next meeting of State Ministers and they intend to take up those matters in that context. They believe that is important, given the importance of the energy and environment debate, particularly the impact on the greenhouse effect.

         —In 1988 the Government made a very substantial review of the motor vehicle industry without reference to the Industry Commission, as I said yesterday in the Senate. In 1988 we abolished quotas on the industry and announced a considerable reduction in tariffs. I would like to say that that was a unanimous decision of the Government in 1988. In 1989 the Treasurer wrote to me seeking an early review of the passenger motor vehicle industry. That, as I understand it, was on the basis of discussions with the chief executives of two companies in the industry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Subsequently I was told by those two executives and other executives of the industry that they had changed their minds about having an early review and I communicated that information to the Treasurer. As a result, no early review took place.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the context of the present Government, as I said in answer to questions yesterday, there were two ways of reviewing the motor vehicle industry. One way was for the Government to do exactly what it did in 1988 without any criticism from within the Government or from outside. There was no criticism from the Opposition parties or anybody else. What we did in 1988 was done without reference to the Industries Assistance Commission. On this occasion we could have done two things. We could have conducted a quick review without reference to the Industry Commission or we could have had an Industry Commission review. I brought forward a document which put options before the Cabinet and those options were both included.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said yesterday, my concern was that the matter should be dealt with quickly-now-because the industry has been concerned about its investment plans and it wants it dealt with quickly. If the Government had dealt with it, using the Automotive Industry Authority and the Department, it could have done so very quickly. But when the Government decided that the Industry Commission could do a quick review-that is, by 31 December this year; rather than a review of the type we are used to in this Parliament, of 12 or 18 months-I was delighted with that piece of information. The Commission now has a reference before it, the terms of which were settled and agreed between the Treasurer and me. That review will start now and will be completed by 31 December. That is very pleasing as far as I am concerned.

       </para>
       <para>
        In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1989-90, appropriations totalling $9.7 million additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1989-90 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the Parliamentary Departments. The increase sought relates primarily to essential and unavoidable costs associated with the operation of Parliament House. In addition, an increase of $0.1 million is sought in the Advance to the President. This increase would bring the amount of the Advance up to $0.3 million, in line with the Advance to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1989-90
       </para>
       <para>
        Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1989-90, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditure additional to the Appropriations made for 1989-90 under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, those amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet the impact of the National Wage Case decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of the additional appropriations in the three Additional Estimates Bills totalling $1,018.0 million, $588.8 million is sought in Appropriation Bill No 3, $419.5 million in Appropriation Bill No 4 and $9.8 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill No 2.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the Appropriation made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1989-90 reflecting the Government's continued determination to improve the efficiency of ongoing programs. These savings, amounting to $352.9 million, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document, ``Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations'', which has been distributed to Members. In addition, a clause which has the effect of reducing by $399,000 an appropriation for the bounty under the Bounty (Ship Repair) Act 1986 made by Appropriation Act (No 1) is included in Appropriation Bill (No 3).
       </para>
       <para>
        After allowance for this reduction and the prospective savings, the appropriations now sought represent a net increase of $664.7 million in expenditures financed from annual appropriations. As a proportion of total estimated Outlays-encompassing both Annual and Standing Appropriations-this increase amounts to 0.8 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now outline some of the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No 3) 1989-90 to meet expenditure for the ordinary annual services of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        $110 million, or an increase of 1.3%, is included for increased running costs, of which $80 million is included to cover the costs of the first instalment of the National Wage Case decisions, while the $30 million for administrative and operational expenses is associated mostly with transfers from salaries and various minor new policy initiatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Gross additional estimates of $240.0 million are sought for the Defence Portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No 3).
       </para>
       <para>
        The gross figures include:
       </para>
       <para>
        $52.6 million for Running Costs, reflecting the impact of the first instalment of the National Wage Case decisions and increases in certain allowances for Defence Personnel and civilians;
       </para>
       <para>
        $92.7 million which largely reflects adjustment for price movements and variations in progress on a number of projects, including payments for ANZAC Ships;
       </para>
       <para>
        $40.1 million for costs associated with the establishment of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd and Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd;
       </para>
       <para>
        $27.5 million for Defence Facilities attributable to price increases and greater activity levels; and
       </para>
       <para>
        $25.6 million for Defence Housing, reflecting interest bearing loan capital and increases in market rents to be paid by Defence to the Defence Housing Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taking account of all transactions contributing to the Defence function, including offsets provided from increased Revenues and a reduction in the provision for contingent salary and related increases, total Defence Outlays are estimated to increase by $126 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Appropriation Bill (No. 3) also provides $30 million for the Australian Trade Commission to meet eligible grants under the Export Market Development Grant Scheme. The additional funds are estimated to be sufficient to enable settlement of all grants that are expected to be processed and hence payable by 30 June.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) provides:
       </para>
       <para>
        $23.5 million to assist in the recovery of the tourism industry following the pilots' dispute;
       </para>
       <para>
        $60.1 million for the increased demand for non-departmental care for veterans and the corresponding flow-on costs in Veterans' Medical Services; and
       </para>
       <para>
        $6.0 million for a bounty on sensitised film production.
       </para>
       <para>
        These additional appropriations are required to meet commitments that have been approved by the Government since the Budget as well as requirements of an on-going nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principal factors underlying the requirements include certain unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1989-90
       </para>
       <para>
        In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1989-90, appropriations totalling $419.5 million-additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1989-90-are sought for capital works and services, payments to or for the States and the Northern Territory, advances and loans and for other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in that Act.

        The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the budget, together with other requirements to be met this financial year. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1989-90 are the provision of:
       </para>
       <para>
        $7.8 million, mainly payments to the States, to assist in the recovery of the tourist industry;
       </para>
       <para>
        $70 million for payments to the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority for charges waived under the Agreement with the airlines resulting from the pilots' industrial action;
       </para>
       <para>
        $13.2 million for the establishment of a trust fund to provide financial assistance to people with medically acquired HIV;
       </para>
       <para>
        $30 million as an injection of equity capital for Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd and an additional $20 million advance to facilitate acquisition of a 99 year lease of Avalon Airfield;
       </para>
       <para>
        $75 million for a capital injection to AUSSAT Pty Ltd;
       </para>
       <para>
        $25 million for natural disaster relief and restoration including damage by the Newcastle earthquake and provision for bushfires and floods in the first two months of 1990. The bulk of the Commonwealth's payments to the States for assistance in respect of the recent floods in New South Wales and Queensland is expected to be paid in 1990-91.
       </para>
       <para>
        $10 million for the Commonwealth/Tasmania Forest Industry Strategy; and
       </para>
       <para>
        $15.6 million for Australia's contribution to settlement of outstanding debts of the International Tin Council.

        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        SUPPLY (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1990-91
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing requirements of the Parliamentary Departments during the period 1 July 1990 to 30 November 1990. They total some $47.6 million which is $1.3 million, or 2.9 per cent, greater than the amount provided for in the supply period 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

       <para>
        SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 1990-91
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, together with its companion bills, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91, seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period 1 July 1990 to 30 November 1990, by which date it is expected that the appropriation Bills, which will form part of the Budget for 1990-91, will have been enacted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Supply Bill (No 1) seeks appropriations totalling $10,689 million for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $742 million, or about 7.5 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No 1) 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        A significant part of the increase reflects commitments which have been approved by the Government, price and cost increases and exchange rate variations.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been the case in recent years, the running cost appropriations of Departments have been adjusted to include the salaries of Departmental Secretaries and other relevant Office Holders which were previously paid from Special Appropriations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks interim provision only in respect of approved ongoing policies of the Government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1990-91 Budget context for which provision will be sought in the Appropriation Bills.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        SUPPLY BILL (No 2) 1990-91
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill seeks interim appropriations, totalling some $2,940 million, for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and certain other services for the period 1 July 1990 to 30 November 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amount sought is $73 million, or about 2.4 per cent, less than that provided in the Supply Act (No 2) 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certain new provisions in respect of which Government decisions have been taken have been separately itemised in the Bill in accordance with convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        As indicated with respect to the Supply Bill No 1, the provisions in this Bill do not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1990-91 Budget context.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.
