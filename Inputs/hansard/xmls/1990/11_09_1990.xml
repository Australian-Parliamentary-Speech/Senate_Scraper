         —My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Defence and relates to the use of VIP aircraft, is in three parts. Firstly, can the Minister confirm that the use and relocation costs for Royal Australian Air Force VIP aircraft by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Mr Warren Snowdon, have been in excess of $100,000 in the five months since Mr Snowdon's appointment as Parliamentary Secretary in 1990-including an $18,000 extravagant trip to an electorate commitment at the Tennant Creek Show on 13 July? Secondly, was Mr Snowdon's most recent VIP trip last week, from Sydney to an ethnic conference in Darwin-undertaken when commercial flights were available-in addition to an extra VIP flight to the same conference by the relevant portfolio Minister, Mr Hand? Who accompanied Mr Snowdon and Mr Hand, and were the total return costs of these two parallel flights in excess of $40,000? Thirdly, do the guidelines for the use of VIP aircraft, as previously tabled in the Senate, make any provision for their use by Parliamentary Secretaries? Will the Minister again table the guidelines together with his reasons for approving all VIP flights by Australian Labor Party Parliamentary Secretaries this year?

         —I have always said that Senator Tambling's bark is worse than his bite, and he has proven it again today. As anyone would know, it is a common feature of Oppositions, be they Labor or Liberal, to have a ball with VIP flights. We have done it in the past; now the day has come for honourable senators opposite to raise the issue. One of the amazing things about this matter is that some of the car drivers tell Labor Ministers that we are nuts. They say, `When we used to drive the Liberal Ministers they used VIP flights like taxis. We hardly ever pick up you blokes from VIP flights'. What we might have to do is to go through the record and make a comparison between this Government and the previous Government. Then the hypocritical critics on the other side of the chamber will duck for cover.

       <para>
        How often have I had complaints, as late as Sunday and at other times, about access to VIP flights-that they should be for backbenchers and for everyone else. Yet Senator Tambling, in his normal carping way, raises questions in here about Mr Snowdon. He has used four flights, three times representing another Minister and once to attend a constituency function.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures quoted by Senator Tambling are relatively accurate. In regard to the Darwin flight, I understand the problem there was that Mr Snowdon was booked on a commercial flight and that flight was cancelled.

       <para>
        The final point raised by Senator Tambling is, I think, a more serious one. The entitlement of Parliamentary Secretaries to use special purpose aircraft is set out in the entitlements of Parliamentary Secretaries made by prime ministerial statement in April. Senator Tambling asks whether they are in the current guidelines. No, they are not, because they have not been revised recently. I have been looking to revise the guidelines, on a number of bases. One even includes a self-interest in this place as to whether Senator Hill should be entitled to use it.

         —`But not to dog shows', he says. I will go no further. Also, we have to look at the charging regime to see whether it is different for Falcons compared with other planes. A further problem that concerns some honourable senators in this place is the difficulty of using those aircraft to move backbenchers when no Minister is on board. I am talking about Western Australia, et cetera. I have been considering those guidelines. I have not been rushed into doing it because I have had higher priority areas to look at. But I have that under consideration. When that does occur, I will release those guidelines.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To sum up: every now and then special purpose aircraft are always open to ridicule from Oppositions. Members of the Opposition get some good brownie points up. Then, when they come into government, they use them as vigorously and rigorously as a government does.

        Finally, I wish Senator Tambling well for the next five weeks when he will be floating across overseas first class at taxpayers' expense, staying in all the first class hotels in Europe. I could make derisory comments about that except I know that someone of his diligence will make such a fact finding tour to his own benefit.

As far as possible one tries to coordinate the times of these sorts of trips and, if it is possible, have one plane do multitasking. That is not always possible, depending on the amount of rotation time staff have been available for. It is frustrating at times. One thinks that one can get a plane to go to Melbourne and then on to Perth and then finds that the tasking arrangements for that plane and the crew on that plane do not allow for that sort of trip. I do not know the exact circumstances in this case as to the crew requirements. I will have a look at it.

        <para in-line="1">
         —There is no doubt at all that the agreement reached last night in Jakarta by the four Cambodian parties under the joint chairmanship of Indonesia and France, as the co-chairmen of the Paris conference, did represent an enormous breakthrough- unquestionably the most important breakthrough-in the whole gruelling peace process to date. The nature of the achievement is, I think, best appreciated if I were to summarise briefly the main points to emerge in the agreed communique.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        They are as follows: the Cambodian parties accepted in its entirety the framework document laying out the essence of a settlement which had been formulated by the Permanent Five members of the Security Council in a series of meetings over the last six months. Secondly, they indicated their willingness to elaborate that framework into a full-scale comprehensive settlement through the processes of the Paris conference, with there being agreement to reconvene that conference at the earliest possible date.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, they established the long-awaited Supreme National Council (SNC)-a group of 12 representative Cambodian individuals possibly to be supplemented by a thirteenth were there to be consensus about the election of a chairman, but constituted right now with 12 members-balanced as follows: six from the Hun Sen Government in Phnom Penh and two from each of the three resistance parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next element in the agreement was that the SNC will operate as the formal embodiment of the independence sovereignty and unity of Cambodia. Next, that the SNC, very importantly, would occupy the United Nations (UN) seat which presently is held, of course, by the resistance coalition including the Khmer Rouge. That is a subject of very great controversy which is now certain to be resolved amicably as a result of this agreement in Jakarta last night.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, and crucially, it was agreed that the SNC, at the time of the signature of the expected comprehensive statement, would delegate to the United Nations, `all powers necessary to ensure the implementation of the comprehensive agreement, including those relating to the conduct of free and fair elections and the relevant aspects of the administration of Cambodia'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I guess the importance of all this is pretty self-evident to those honourable senators who have been following the peace process closely through all its ups and downs and permutations over the last goodness knows how many years. It is a particularly gratifying achievement for Indonesia, and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, in particular, who have led the effort within the region to try to craft an effective, workable, comprehensive settlement, and have done so notwithstanding facing a number of set-backs in unsuccessful meetings of one kind or another, particularly those that had been held in Jakarta previously. It involved a considerable risk, in a sense, to make one more effort to bring the parties together in this way. That risk has proved eminently well-justified and I congratulate the Indonesians, in particular, for their efforts in this respect.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also want to pay tribute to my own departmental team in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the task force that has worked so closely with me over the last year or so in trying to work a way through this particular maze. The result is a gratifying one for Australia, as I do not need to spell out in detail because the Senate will be aware that those elements of the P5 framework document that I have referred to, and the more extended concept of the UN role, is very much the Australian concept that we put on the table last November and have been working away at ever since.
       </para>
       <para>
        I particularly want to thank my own team for the work they have done and, in particular, single out the Deputy Secretary of my Department, Mike Costello, for what has been a really outstanding diplomatic achievement involving creativity, imagination, stamina and just plain diplomatic skill in shuttling backwards and forwards around the region and internationally over the whole of the last period. There is a long history to be written about the course of these negotiations, but now is not the time to state any of that in detail in public.

        Perhaps I should say finally that I am also gratified by Senator Hill's response on the radio this morning.

        I. In the exercise of the mandate conferred upon them by the International Conference on Cambodia held in Paris, 30 July-30 August 1989, the two Co-Chairmen convened an informal meeting of the Cambodian parties in Jakarta, 9-10 September 1990. The objective of the Meeting was to ascertain the views of the Cambodian parties on their support and acceptance of the framework of a comprehensive settlement as agreed upon by the Five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council in New York on 28 August 1990 as well as to finalise the formation of the Supreme National Council (SNC).
       </para>

        II. The Cambodian parties accepted the framework document formulated by the Five Permanent Members of the Security Council in its entirety as the basis for settling the Cambodia conflict, and committed themselves, in full cooperation with all other participants of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia (PICC), to elaborating this framework into a comprehensive political settlement through the processes of the PICC.

       <para>
        III. In this context, the Cambodian parties addressed the question of a Supreme National Council of Cambodia, and agreed on the nature and functions of the SNC as stipulated in the P5 document. They specifically agreed as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) the SNC is the unique legitimate body and source of authority in which, throughout the transitional period, the independence, sovereignty and unity of Cambodia is embodied;

       <para>
        (b) the SNC is composed of representative individuals with authority among the Cambodian people and reflecting all shades of opinion among them;
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) the SNC will represent Cambodia externally and occupy the seat of Cambodia at the United Nations, in the UN specialised agencies, and in other international institutions and international conferences;
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) the SNC at the time of signature of the comprehensive settlement will delegate to the UN all powers necessary to ensure the implementation of the comprehensive agreement, including those relating to the conduct of free and fair elections and the relevant aspects of the administration of Cambodia;
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) all decisions of the SNC will be made by consensus among its members.
       </para>
       <para>
        IV. Accordingly, the Cambodian parties agreed to form the SNC with the following composition:

       <para>
        The Cambodian parties further agreed to accept H.R.H. Prince Norodom Sihanouk's proposal as contained in his statement of September 8, 1990 that if the 12 members of the SNC so desire, they could elect a Chairman for the SNC, who would, in such case, be the ``13th member'' of the SNC.

The Minister would also have seen that Austel then argued that more competitors produce greater benefits in terms of efficiency, price, product and service. I ask the Minister: Is Austel correct in its economic arguments against duopolies and in favour of greater competition? If so, why is the Australian economy not to get the full benefits of competition in telecommunications?

        It is wrong to describe the Cabinet's decision as pre-emptive. What Cabinet has done is express a view about these various matters and it is a view based on very sound policy considerations. In the next few weeks and months we will spell out the ground about public ownership in this country and so-called privatisation. We will find these people very much on the back foot about many of these issues when we spell out the ground which will be followed by the Government in relation to these things.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Opposition knows full well, it is very easy to spell out some in-principle policies about various issues. It did that prior to the last two elections. It spelled out what it would do with Medicare. However, when it came to the detail it was confused because it did not have any policies. Governments have to deal with real issues and real policies and the details of those policies. That is why within the Government and the Government Party the debate about telecommunications, for example, has been complex and difficult. We do not retreat from that for a moment because we are not just laying down simple political nostrums, as the Opposition does, on these various issues. We are dealing with real issues which governments have to grapple with.
       </para>
       <para>
        In so far as Senator Powell's suggestion that the Government is hell bent on some new ideological course is concerned, I inform her that that is not so. Governments, throughout their political lives-this Government has had quite a long one and will continue to have a long one in future-have to continue with the policy development process because circumstances change. I think that the Democrats would be well advised to recognise that. Governments have to be adaptable and flexible in the policies which they develop to meet changed circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say that the use of the word `ideological' in relation to the course upon which this Government has embarked in respect of many of these matters is a total misuse. One knows where we will find the ideology on these issues. `Ideology' is a word which does not appeal to me because ideologies are generally mindless. As I said earlier in answer to this question, the Government has given a lot of careful and thoughtful consideration to these issues. They are not mindless decisions which have been arrived at.

It is generally understood, and it has certainly been understood ever since I started to follow this consumption tax debate some years ago, that one of the inherent difficulties with a broad-based consumption tax is that it impacts proportionately on low-income earners much more savagely than it does on higher income earners for the simple reason, obviously, that low-income earners spend a far higher proportion of their income-in some cases all of it-on goods and services that attract a consumption tax. But what is not generally recognised and has not been part of the debate that I have heard, and certainly has not been raised by any member of the National Party that I have noted, is that the tax impacts far more severely on people who live away from the major urban areas than it does on their city cousins.

         —Ha, ha! I am glad to hear that interjection concerning zone rebates and sales tax on freight because, as Senator Tambling would well know, it shows one of the huge holes in the Opposition's taxation policy. Senator Tambling would well know that for years there has been a debate in which he and I and others have participated, in northern Australia, in trying to remove the imposition of sales tax on the freight component of goods. I have had numerous briefings over the years with taxation officers in Darwin and in Canberra and one of the difficulties is that the sales tax regime is already very complicated and the argument put by the Australia Taxation Office, which is valid, is that if one starts introducing a further administrative layer of extracting the freight component-I have to say this in fairness-and in many cases the alleged freight component, from the cost of goods before one imposes tax on it, it would become very quickly an administrative nightmare and would cost a fortune to implement. I have to say through clenched teeth that there is a great deal of validity to that argument.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is very difficult to counter that argument with a straight face because it is substantially true. It points up one of the huge holes in the nonsense that is currently being run in the bush by the National Party on its policy for a broad-based consumption tax. For everyone outside a major city the difficulty is that currently we have an imposition of having to pay sales tax on the freight component of goods. With a broad-based consumption tax at point of sale, people have to pay a tax on the freight component of everything. I might add that services such as haircuts also attract the tax. The National Party has put out a piece of arrant nonsense saying that there will be exemptions from the tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        The difficulty is that people will be paying consumption tax on meat, milk, bread and other staple items which are often produced in the area and which currently do not attract tax on the freight component because they are produced locally. But the consumption tax will apply to everything, particularly the freight component which has to be applied at the point of sale.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot responsibly do what the Leader of the National Party is now saying publicly wink, wink, nudge, nudge in the bush-that is, that his Party will provide a range of exemptions. As soon as that is done-and not one single person can deny this-we run into exactly the same problem that we have with the imposition of sales tax on freight. As soon as they start--

         —I agree with the observations that Senator Foreman has made in his question-that industrial relations systems in Australia is one of the areas in which considerable efficiencies can be achieved. Indeed, the Prime Minister, in his now famous speech to the National Press Club, identified industrial relations as a possible area of constitutional reform. I notice that, in his reply address, the Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, also targeted industrial relations as an important area of reform, and other States have made similar noises. We await now the constitutional meeting between the Premiers and the Prime Minister in October to see how far that one can go.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To answer the detail of the question raised by Senator Foreman-already industrial relations Ministers in all of the States and Territories have resolved on a course of action which will enable significant reforms to be made, whatever the outcome of the constitutional issue might be. At a meeting of the Ministers for Labour Advisory Council in New Zealand in April this year, all of the State Ministers, Territory Ministers and I agreed that they would nominate the heads of their tribunals and I would appoint to the Federal Commission, the heads of their tribunals as deputy presidents, that they would amend their State Industrial Relations Acts and enable me to nominate deputy presidents of the Federal Commission to be appointed to their benches in all of the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to that-which brings, if you like, at the arbitrational level, a blending of the Federal-State relationship-there have now been talks between my Department and the departments of industrial relations in the States about using common court room facilities, operating out of the same registry, using the same chambers, the same libraries and the same electronic information retrieval systems, and the integration, at a working level, of the operations of industrial relations around Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a reform in which the States see some cost savings, I might say, but that is not the main motivator for them. At a time in which there is a congruence about industrial relations in all States-and I include New South Wales as well with respect to the management of the system- they see it as desirable to achieve as much of a cooperative working relationship as is possible. The model will, I think, bring about a national system within a federal constitutional framework, and that will be a significant achievement. I think it will be a step along the way to an eventual unitary system when the constitutional debate about powers might finally be determined.

It is fair to say that the achievements of this Government in respect of employment have been extraordinarily good over the life of the Government, having regard to what we inherited. The reason for that is that until recently there has been steady growth in the Australian economy. The current increased levels of unemployment are undoubtedly due to the fall-off in demand in the domestic economy, which at the moment is very marked. That, as I have said, is having significant effects on employment.

        The anticipations in the Budget were that we would see a slack demand and the consequences of that in the second half of this calendar year. In terms of what the Budget has to say, we would expect some improvement in that situation in the first half of calendar year 1991. One hopes that that improvement will be obtained by improvement in export performance which the Budget predicts-that is to say, the growth in the economy, which is expected to be 2 per cent, is largely predicated on growth in exports.

I ask the Minister, was that change prompted in any way by a request based on some experience by a captain of one of our warships in the Gulf?

The rules of engagement, as announced by me today and sent to the ships yesterday, were not at the request of captains of the ships, because they were at least constructed, if not approved, long before the ships got into the deployment area. They basically arise out of the sanction given by the United Nations resolution 665, which allows the use of minimum force. I think the honourable senator also asked whether this means that some force can be employed by the Australian ships. The answer is yes.

        Senator Evans did announce, because he was the first person asked about it, the four previous criteria of operations. These three new ones are consistent with what has been adopted by the United States, by France, by Great Britain, by most members of the Western European Union, if not all, and presumably down the track by other nations. There was a lot of effort put in at the naval conference to make sure that all the rules of engagement were consistent with each other and fully understood by each other.

         —I can tell Senator Bell that the wool tax, which I think he has referred to as the wool levy, is required by legislation to be paid on all shorn wool, including medullated and other coarse wools suitable for carpet manufacture. The carpet wool growers have made representations seeking exemption from the price support component of the wool tax because they believe that the current 18 per cent tax particularly affects them. Carpet wools are bought by carpet manufacturers scoured and blended rather than in the greasy form. Carpet wool growers have established their own cooperatives to undertake these processes and prepare their wool for the Australian market. The growers themselves support these cooperatives through a 6 per cent levy. Carpet wool growers are therefore currently paying 24 per cent in taxes and levies on wool of $2.50 to $3 a kilo in value. I should add that as some 90 per cent of the carpet wools used in Australia are imported, the Australian grown carpet wool is import replacing in nature.

They are the views of both the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation.

He anticipates that he will be in a position shortly to give a decision on the matter.

         —ILO Convention 159 is properly entitled Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Workers) Convention.  It is a convention adopted by the ILO in 1983. The ILO, of course, is a subagency of the United Nations which was inherited by the United Nations from the League of Nations of which Australia was a foundation member. It is tripartite in nature.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To answer the first part of Senator Zakharov's question, the Australian Government adopted ILO Convention 159 on 7 August this year. The adoption followed consultation with the particular States and Territories and with employer organisations and trade unions through the National Labour Consultative Council. The convention has been adopted and ratified by 30 countries, including the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria and both East and West Germany, which may soon be trading under the same banner.
       </para>
       <para>
        Upon ratification, countries are required to adopt a policy on vocational rehabilitation and employment for the disabled; to consult with employers, unions and disabled organisations about how that is to be implemented; to provide vocational guidance, training and placement in employment, and for other related services for the disabled; to ensure suitably qualified staff to provide those services; and to ensure that Australian law and practice comply with the convention requirements-that is to say, the adoption of such a convention commits Australia to observe international standards in dealing with rehabilitation and employment for the disabled. That is consistent with this Government's enviable record on social justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        To go to the second part of Senator Zakharov's question-there has been a long process, beginning in 1988, firstly with an interdepartmental committee entitled the Disability Work Force. That Committee considered how income support could be best rendered and how to encourage, in particular, the rehabilitation of the disabled. It looked at labour market programs to support their needs, at their particular employment, training and education requirements and at how they could best be involved in community activities. The Budget paper referred to by Senator Zakharov comes from a report from the task force.
       </para>
       <para>
        To encourage the participation of disabled workers, there is now more work to be done on examining the wages system. My Department is working directly with the departments of the States and other departments of the Commonwealth, as well as with unions and employer organisations, on what appropriate wages policy should apply consistent with national wage fixing principles and the need to ensure that disabled workers are properly remunerated so that they are useful and valuable members of the work force and gain self-esteem through employment.

       <para in-line="1">
        —by leave-Matters have come to the attention of the Opposition that cause us great concern in relation to the procedures for reference of Bills to committees. Certain practices that are being adopted by committees, we believe, if continued, will defeat the objectives of the reforms that Parliament agreed to in December. I should say that Senator Robert Ray and Senator Powell have indicated a willingness to discuss these matters but, since I spoke to Senator Robert Ray, further matters have been brought to my attention. I simply want to put them on the record to give the Government the opportunity to think about them.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The first is a motion that has been passed, I understand, by at least two committees that the standing committee, when it receives a Bill from this chamber, in fact, operates as if it was the Committee of the whole; in other words, that a set procedure be in existence for all considerations on that basis, that witnesses not be called, that senators not have the opportunity to examine witnesses, et cetera.
      </para>
      <para>
       I remind the Government that the sessional orders were silent on how the standing committees would deal with the Bills that were referred to them, but reference to the report of the Committee of the Senate, which was almost wholly adopted, and the guidance of the Clerk in this matter, make it clear that the intention was that each committee would examine each Bill and determine the best way of handling that Bill according to all the circumstances relating to that Bill. Some Bills could clearly be dealt with expeditiously, but some- such as, from my experience, the war crimes legislation and Bills of that nature-would require a very detailed consideration, including the calling of public evidence and a full examination.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first point I want to put to the Government to consider is whether it might reconsider this practice-which, I presume, has originated from the leadership-that each of the committees adopt this rather rigid form which, as I said, would defeat the objectives of the new system.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second point that is causing us concern is that we have the strong belief that, in these circumstances, all senators-any senator-should have the right to attend a standing committee and, no doubt with leave which would be given by that committee, to participate in the debate. If we are going to try to avoid a duplication of debate, that seems to us to be necessary. I have to acknowledge that these orders that have been adopted by two committees do give that right.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I am advised that a number of my colleagues have been refused the right to appear and participate in committee considerations of Bills that have already taken place in the last few days. That is wrong. I would like the Government to consider the attitude that it is adopting in this.
      </para>
      <para>
       The third and last matter I raise is that, if this system is to work, the Bills should be considered on the day set aside by the Senate for their consideration. I understand that some committees have brought forward their hearings. This may or may not be convenient for committee members, but it is certainly not convenient for other honourable senators who wish to participate. They simply would not be aware that the matter is to be dealt with on that occasion.
      </para>
      <para>
       I raise these matters because they are of serious concern to us. We want this new practice to work. We want it to result in a better use of Senate time, in a more thorough examination of Bills and ultimately in better law-making.
      </para>
      <para>
       I bring these matters to the Government's attention. I hope that when we come to talk about them tomorrow the Government might have given some consideration to the practices it presumably is recommending.

        —by leave-Senator Hill has raised three matters. I think that the second and third matters can be dealt with fairly expeditiously. It is essential that those committees meet on the days set aside, so that everyone then has full knowledge of them. It would be like not telling anyone when the Estimates Committees are on. Whilst I might regard it as a good idea, I would never contemplate it. As to other honourable senators turning up, I always thought that that was part of it.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The nub of the problem is where we draw the line rather than which extreme committee position we take. If it had been suggested to me that this new committee system envisaged the full circus of witnesses, et cetera, I would never have gone along with it. Honourable senators know how hard it is to get a resolution of legislation. We always thought that promptness was the key to making this work; that matters could be referred and a result achieved. The moment we bring in witnesses we have to give two weeks public notice that we will have hearings on a particular matter. We will blow Bills out by six, eight or 10 weeks. Probably we should have focused on this at the time we adopted the position, but we did not.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know that the Clerk has put his views forward. I intensely disagree with that approach. It is a legitimate approach, but I happen to disagree with it from a Government point of view. All I can say is that in the next day or two the Government will be happy to sit down with the relevant people to discuss this to see whether we can come to an agreement as to how we should proceed. We prefer to do that with the unanimity of the Senate and not try to use raw numbers to impose our views. We make that quite clear.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, at this stage I foreshadow that what has been espoused by the Clerk's guidelines is more a select committee role. If it has to go that far and if legislation is that important, that legislation should go to a select committee and not a legislation committee, otherwise, although it might be fun for two years or however long we are in power, at the moment those opposite win office, and if the same applies to them, they will find it immensely frustrating not only having the draftsman slowing down legislation and all the rest of the procedures but also having the legislation bottling up in the committee and making its timeliness impossible to achieve.

        —by leave-The Australian Democrats share Senator Hill's concerns. We believe that the new procedures should envisage each Bill being dealt with by each committee on its merits. We certainly would not expect that every Bill, certainly even the majority of Bills, be dealt with in the lengthy way anticipated by Senator Robert Ray. It will be the occasional Bill on which we may seek public input.

      <para>
       Contrary to what Senator Ray has indicated, it may well be that dealing with Bills in that way may very significantly cut down the time required for the Committee stages when we come back into the Committee of the Whole in the Senate. I draw attention to the way in which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation took over 40 hours during its Committee stage in this chamber. Had that been dealt with by a committee, it may well have spent much less time in the chamber and been dealt with quite quickly by the Committee.

I did not know that this discussion was going to take place and I do not know the Clerk's guidelines: I do not know of the existence of the Clerk's guidelines.

       The matter refers to the Patents Bill. I had some questions to ask of officers of the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices. In my letter I ask that those officers attend the Committee so that we can ask them questions about statements that they have made and which I want to have clarified if I am to consider whether or not to proceed with amendments to the Patents Bill which would prevent the granting of patents for human cells. I raise the matter now so that it does not come as a bombshell later.

        —by leave-We welcome the remarks of the Australian Democrats because I think they indicate the approach that we desire to take, and that is not, as Senator Ray might otherwise apprehend, a determination to have as many Bills as possible dealt with at exhaustive length by the various legislative and standing committees.
       </para>

      <para>
       What we have in mind is that from time to time there will be Bills that deserve thoroughgoing attention and that will necessitate the calling of witnesses and probably a range of other means of examination. But all that can be accomplished much more expeditiously through the existing mechanism than by setting up a select committee. I would have thought we should be at pains to avoid having to go through that rigmarole every time we confront a Bill that perhaps those of us who might form the majority on the matter decide ought to be referred out.
      </para>
      <para>
       The present system, if approached sensibly-I am sure that we have a commitment to seeing it used sparingly but effectively-should mean that the matters can be dealt with much more quickly. Certainly, we can make use of the time saving that is involved in having more than one committee sitting at the same time, but we can also make use of those specialist committees to address particular issues. I hope that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray, will reconsider this matter in light of the remarks that have been made.

       Animal Patenting
      </title>
      <para>
       To the President and members of the Australian Senate.
      </para>
      <para>
       The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would *reduce biodiversity, *compromise animal welfare, *concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and *allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. The Senate amends the Patents Bill 1989 to prohibit the patenting of animals.

       Air Landing Fee: New South Wales

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.

        Just briefly, I comment that Auditor- General's Report No 5 of 1990-91-Report on Ministerial Portfolios-Budget Sittings 1990 is an important part of this chamber's considerations of the sorts of matters which we will be dealing with later this afternoon in the Senate Estimates committee hearings. I commend the Auditor-General for the timeliness of its presentation. If only many other reports which were germane to the proceedings that will take place this afternoon during Estimates committees meetings were presented in an equally timely manner, our job would be made much easier. I do not want to delay the Senate now because we are trying to commence those Estimates committee hearings.
       </para>
       <para>
        In passing, it is interesting to note that an efficiency audit of fraud investigation by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and a number of other agencies is being undertaken by the Australian Audit Office. The main objective of the audit is to assess the efficiency of fraud investigation procedures and to review the relationship between the AFP and agencies. It is expected that a report on the audit will be tabled early in 1991. I mention that because the question of fraud and considerable loss to the revenue in various governmental areas is a matter of great concern to all members of this chamber. I am glad to see that the Auditor-General is undertaking that report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision, announced on 28 November 1989, to establish a maritime safety authority as a further element in the total restructuring of Australia's shipping and waterfront industries undertaken by the Hawke Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's future prosperity depends on our ability to compete effectively in overseas markets, overseas markets which are themselves becoming increasingly competitive. Australia's almost total reliance on shipping for trade means that maritime regulation and Government services to shipping must be efficient, sensible and relevant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Broadly speaking, the new Authority will take over the functions currently performed by the Maritime Operations Division of the Department of Transport and Communications.
       </para>
       <para>
        These functions include:
       </para>
       <para>
        - the coordination of maritime search and rescue services, in cooperation with State and Northern Territory SAR authorities, through the Federal Sea Safety Centre
       </para>
       <para>
        - in cooperation with the States and Northern Territory authorities, the administration of the National Plan to Combat Pollution from Ships
       </para>
       <para>
        - the implementation, application and policing of maritime safety and pollution prevention conventions on Australian and visiting foreign ships
       </para>
       <para>
        - the provision of a comprehensive network of navigational aids around Australia's coastline
       </para>
       <para>
        - the provision of safety radio services to shipping through OTC
       </para>
       <para>
        - the setting of standards for the education, training and certification of seafarers
       </para>
       <para>
        - the operation of the Seamen's Engagement System, under contract to the Australian Shipping Industry
       </para>
       <para>
        - the operation of the Australian Register of Ships
       </para>
       <para>
        - the promotion of sea safety for small craft through a public education and awareness campaign
       </para>
       <para>
        - Australian representation at the International Maritime Organization.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Maritime Operations Division function of investigating casualties to ships will not be transferred to the Authority but is to remain with the Department of Transport and Communications. Like its aviation counterpart, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, it is more appropriate that the conduct of investigations into marine casualties should be separated from the regulatory body.
       </para>
       <para>
        The functions being transferred to the Authority have all been effectively performed by the Department, and Australia has an excellent record in maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment from shipsourced pollution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nonetheless, an authority which has direct accountability to the maritime industry it serves will be far better placed to provide efficient, cost effective services and to keep pace with changes in an industry undergoing rapid technological change.

       <para>
        Specifically these benefits will derive from the accountability of the Authority's direction through management by a Board of Directors. This will facilitate the development of corporate goals responsive to industry needs. It will also help ensure the rationalisation of administrative arrangements associated with safety regulation to achieve greater flexibility, efficiency and control in the use of financial and human resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        For its part the Government will benefit from the increased efficiency in the delivery of maritime services both to the community at large and to a sector of transport crucial to Australia's future prosperity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation now before the Senate will provide the new Authority with all the necessary powers to fulfil its safety, regulatory and community service obligations and to perform commercial functions, whilst ensuring accountability is maintained with appropriate checks and balances, including powers for the Minister to make directions in certain circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not propose to go through the Bill clause by clause, as the Explanatory Memorandum has been distributed to Honourable Senators. I would like, however, to highlight the key features of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 6 specifies the functions of the Authority which I have already outlined. In carrying out these functions the Authority can provide, on request, services to the maritime industry on a commercial basis and relevant consultancy and management services. It is the Government's intention that such commercial services should be consistent with the normal functions of the Authority and the expertise of its officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 8 provides the Minister with powers to give directions to the Authority regarding the performance of its functions. I must emphasise that this power is intended as a reserve power to be used only where the Minister believes it necessary in the public interest. Any such exercise of the Minister's power of direction is required to be included in the annual report, and any financial detriment suffered by the Authority in complying with the Minister's direction is reimbursable by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        A vital part of the Authority's operations, if it is to be fully effective in responding to the needs of the maritime industry and community at large, will be the consultative process. This is reflected in Clause 12, which requires the Authority to consult with government and non-government bodies and organisations where appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        As specified in clause 13, the Authority will comprise seven members, including the Chairperson and the Chief Executive Officer. This composition is consistent with other statutory authorities of a similar size. Selection of persons for the board will reflect Government policy to ensure the Authority is directed by persons having the necessary professional expertise and experience across the broad spectrum of government, community, business and industrial issues. One member of the board will be an officer of the Department of Transport and Communications to ensure the Authority is kept in touch with Government objectives and policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the operation of the Authority and associated financial matters. As with other Government Business Enterprises, the Authority will be required to prepare and maintain a corporate plan and associated financial plan covering the 3 year forward period. The corporate plan will include a statement of objectives and must outline the intended strategies and policies to achieve those objectives. These provisions, which are contained in Clauses 25 to 28 of the Bill, are intended to ensure the Authority operates in a proper business-like manner in performing its functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under Clause 29 the Minister is given powers to direct the Authority to vary the financial plan in respect of its financial targets and performance indicators. As with the Minister's aforementioned powers to give directions in regard to the performance of the Authority's functions, this ministerial power is not intended to permit interference in the proper commercial operations of the Authority, but would be used only in exceptional circumstances where, for instance, the Authority's financial planning fell short of, or was inconsistent with, the requirements specified in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 30 to 45 detail the financial arrangements necessary to establish the Authority and to ensure it has the financial capability of achieving its objectives. Provisions include the transfer of Commonwealth assets to the Authority, the payment of dividends, borrowing powers and tax provisions. The Authority will be a public authority to which Division 2 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901 applies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The powers of the Authority to make determinations in respect of fees and charges is covered by Clause 47. I would draw attention of Honourable Senators to sub-clause 47(12) where a provision has been included, as in recent similar bills, to require the amount of a charge to reasonably relate to the expenses incurred in providing the service, and not be such as to amount to taxation. I must underline, however, that it is the Government's intention that expenses incurred should include overheads and a reasonable return on capital.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated earlier, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill will enable the new Authority to pursue its goals of service to the industry and the community free of unnecessary strictures, whilst ensuring full accountability and reporting to Government. An effective, efficient Authority will provide value for money in the community services it provides. Furthermore, it will, without detriment to its safety and environmental protection functions, introduce a degree of flexibility into its operations and the setting of its priorities, to be better in tune with the needs of the industry it serves.
       </para>
       <para>
        The establishment costs of the Authority will not be recovered from the industry. The Bill does not have any significant implications for the ongoing cost to the public sector but to the extent that greater efficiency is achieved, cost can be expected to fall in real terms over time.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is an important contribution to the Hawke Labor Government's strategy for structural reform.

        The document read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill amends the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961 to convert the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) to a public company, called the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Limited. It will also remove a variety of statutory controls which inhibit CSL's commercial operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister responsible for CSL will retain strategic oversight of the new company in line with the guidelines for the reform of government business enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill is a major step in implementing the reform package for CSL announced on 16 August 1989 and is part of the Government's comprehensive program to improve the performance of government business enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        CSL has a long history of achievements in serving the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para>
        * CSL was established in 1916, following World War I, as an arm of the quarantine service, so that Australia could be self sufficient in vaccines and sera in times of war and peace.
       </para>
       <para>
        * In 1923 CSL was one of the four laboratories world wide to produce insulin and in 1944 CSL enabled Australia to be the first country to supply penicillin to its civilian population.
       </para>
       <para>
        * In 1952 CSL commenced the fractionation of serum, provided by voluntary blood donors and collected by the Red Cross, into life saving blood products, a function which it continues to perform today.
       </para>
       <para>
        * CSL has developed anti-sera and anti-venoms against specific Australian pests and diseases, the most recent being the funnel-web spider anti-venom in 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        * CSL is the only manufacturer of human vaccines in Australia and one of only two producers of biological veterinary products.
       </para>
       <para>
        When CSL became a statutory authority in 1961 its charter focused on the performance of national interest functions, in particular the manufacture of prescribed biological pharmaceutical products and serum fractionation. Provision was also made at that time, however, for limited commercial operations using any excess manufacturing capability.
       </para>
       <para>
        With support from successive Ministers CSL has since evolved into a primarily commercial organisation. Significant changes to the CSL Act between 1980 and 1985 removed the restriction limiting CSL to manufacturing solely biological products and placed CSL's operation on a commercial profit making basis, whilst continuing to perform some national interest activities for the Commonwealth under a re-imbursement arrangement. These changes to the Act also allowed the establishment of subsidiaries, joint ventures and partnerships.
       </para>
       <para>
        CSL now markets a wide range of prescribed human pharmaceuticals and veterinary products both in Australia and overseas. CSL currently employs over 1200 staff and has over 2000 product lines. As such CSL is the largest pharmaceutical company in Australia, and represents a unique pharmaceutical manufacturing capability.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, since 1980/81 CSL's sales revenue has increased from $33m to $127m in 1988/89, and pre tax profits have increased from $1.5m to $11.5m over the same period. Not only does CSL pay a 40 per cent dividend on its post tax profit to the Commonwealth but it is subject to state payroll and land taxes as well as the corporate tax. CSL's achievements are significant given the small size of the Australian market.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its recent endeavours to increase sales CSL has been a winner of several export awards. Indeed, with the globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry CSL's future must lie with the development of new products and new markets, not just within Australia but overseas. This will be achieved not only through CSL's own research activities but also through the continued development of licensing arrangements and joint ventures to access new technology.
       </para>
       <para>
        CSL can only succeed in these areas if it is allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise that can respond quickly in the market place free from day to day government regulatory controls.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reform package is therefore a further significant step in the continued development of CSL. The objective is to establish it as an efficient and commercially focused organisation able to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the domestic and international market place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reform package will thus achieve the Government's aims of firstly, fostering a more commercial focus for CSL and secondly, retaining a key manufacturing capability in Australia without the need for any subsidies from the Commonwealth. This Bill is a major step in implementing this reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of important elements of the CSL reform package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly there will be new planning and accountability mechanisms for CSL. These will include the provision by CSL of a three year corporate plan which will define the company's goals, financial targets and strategies to achieve those goals. Financial targets will be set and CSL will report annually giving an account of its performance against goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        CSL's memorandum and articles of association will be registered, as with any public company, with the National Companies and Securities Commission. The Minister responsible for CSL will exercise control, on behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, in a similar manner to shareholders in any other company. The proposed Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide for the Minister responsible to have the power to appoint and dismiss the CSL board of directors. Also the Minister responsible for CSL will be able to issue guidelines to the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, as a public company, CSL will be required to operate in accordance with the Companies Code. This will provide for the protection of the interests of the Commonwealth through its rights as a shareholder of the company. Under the Companies Code the company directors have specific responsibilities to shareholders as well as other defined obligations. There will also be revised remuneration arrangements for the Managing Director.
       </para>
       <para>
        CSL's important community service function of serum fractionation will be made more efficient and accountable through use of a formal contractual arrangement with the Commonwealth. The provision for rights to be attached to shares included in a class of shares will also protect the Commonwealth's interests in relation to the land on which CSL is located.
       </para>
       <para>
        CSL will be expected to continue to comply with government wages and industrial relations policies, in particular with those guidelines developed specifically for government business enterprises in March 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is intended that CSL operate as a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        The arrangements proposed for CSL are essentially the same as those already applying to other GBE's such as Australian Airlines, Australian National Line and most recently the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will now summarise the key elements of the Bill:
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill provides for the conversion of CSL, from its current statutory authority status, to a public company under the Companies Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill comes into effect in several stages, on royal assent and through two proclamations. This is to facilitate the consolidation of the asset base, creation of capital structure, and repeal of sections of the CSL Act 1961 which are no longer required. This also allows for the development of an appropriate balance sheet, financial performance indicators and strategic plan to enable the Minister responsible for CSL to undertake strategic oversight of the company.
       </para>
       <para>
        * As the legislation will come into effect in several stages the Bill ensures the continuity of CSL as a legal entity during this transition in order to preserve all contracts, agreements and the relationship of CSL with its subsidiary companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill ensures continuity of employment and staff conditions during the transition. Each staff member of CSL will become an employee of the company on the same terms and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the statutory authority. This includes the preservation of accumulated entitlements such as long service, recreation and sick leave. The existing provisions covering superannuation will be maintained for staff who are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. Those staff who have mobility rights under Part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 will retain those rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill also ensures that CSL's taxation position and other assets and liabilities are unchanged upon conversion in recognition of the fact that there has been no change in the beneficial ownership by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        * On the matter of assets the Bill provides for CSL's asset base to be consolidated before the assets are converted into share capital and fully paid up shares are issued to the Commonwealth. The consolidation of assets entails the transfer to CSL of the remaining land and buildings which had remained vested in the Commonwealth. These ``transferring assets'' have been employed by CSL since its establishment in 1916 but were not transferred to CSL at the time it became a statutory authority in 1961. In relation to the ``transferring assets'' the Bill contains specific provisions which ensure that, for taxation purposes, CSL is treated as if it had acquired these assets at the time they were acquired by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        * Provision has been made in the Bill for the issued shares to be divided into classes to which rights can be attached. This allows for the Commonwealth to have rights in relation to the existing serum fractionation operation, which is an important community service operation and will not become part of CSL's fully commercial operations. This provision also allows for the Commonwealth to have rights in relation to the sale of the land at CSL.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill then provides for the establishment of CSL as a company through the registration of the Memorandum and Articles of Association for CSL with the National Companies and Securities Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill removes controls such as the requirement for the Treasurer's approval for individual borrowing arrangements, and investment and banking arrangements. However, CSL will remain subject to the Loan Council global borrowing limits and will be liable for the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy on any borrowings. It will, however, forego all forms of government guarantee and will not be able to claim protection from the shield of the Crown.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill also contains consequential amendments to other Acts to ensure that the new company remains subject to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987, and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The schedule to the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930 which identifies those Commonwealth bodies which are not exempt from sales tax will be amended to delete reference to CSL. Nonetheless as a company CSL will continue to pay sales tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Bill does not involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth or additional revenue to the Commonwealth. Nor does it involve any State and Territory taxes on the transfer of assets in recognition of the fact that there has been no change in the Commonwealth's beneficial ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill implements a further stage of the Government's program of microeconomic reform by removing another government business enterprise from the restrictions of day to day regulatory control, whilst ensuring that strategic oversight of performance and efficiency is maintained. It is also a further step in the Government's efforts to encourage value-added manufacture within Australia without the requirement for underpinning by the Commonwealth. At the same time it recognises CSL's significant contribution to the Australian community in the past and present.

        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        —As one of only two of Queensland's 12 senators resident in north Queensland, my role in the Senate will be to concentrate on north Queensland and on northern Australia.

       The future of our nation lies in north Queensland and northern Australia-an area of enormous diversity, from the cattle and cotton of Rockhampton and the Central Highlands region to the sheep, beef, minerals and oil of the west; from the canefields of Mackay, Proserpine, Ayr and Home Hill, Ingham, Tully, Cairns and Mossman to the tobacco of Mareeba and tea of Innisfail, from the mines of the Bowen Basin to the bauxite of Weipa and nickel of Greenvale; from the frontiers of the nation in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York and the heritage treasures of Charters Towers and Cooktown to the natural attributes which make the Whitsundays, the Mission Beach, Cairns and Port Douglas areas, the Atherton Tableland, the cape and gulf regions-without doubt the world's leading tourist destinations of the future. Northern Australia is, after all, the area which, with only 6.5 per cent of Australia's population, produces 45 per cent of Australia's export income.

       It is my honour to have been elected by the people of Queensland to serve their interests and the interests of Australians generally in the Parliament of this nation. It is my hope that I can discharge that honour and trust with the distinction of those senators who have preceded me to this chamber. My brief experience in the chamber and of the Senate has confirmed the important and real role which the Senate plays in the democratic processes of our nation and in the protection of citizens from the excesses of government.
      </para>
      <para>
       May I at this stage, Mr President, publicly extend to you and to other senators my congratulations on your elections, and also my thanks to you all for your indulgence in permitting me to make this speech at this time. I am conscious of the responsibility that we as custodians of the nation have as we steer our land to the new century.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have a vision for Australia: a nation continuing its unique style of Australian comradeship, its strength and purpose, its peace, stability and prosperity, while becoming a sophisticated, caring and intelligent leader in the part of the world in which we are geographically placed-an Australia whose basic strengths and endowments enable us to concentrate on social, humanitarian and environmental responsibilities into the next 100 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am an Australian first. I was born here, as were my parents and grandparents, but I have no claim to any rights not enjoyed by all other Australians. As a lawyer, I understand and accept unquestionably the rule of the law, as without it we become a mindless rabble of competing interests where survival is of the fittest. There can be no group of Australians who have the right to defy the law, no matter how just they may believe their cause to be.
      </para>
      <para>
       While an Australian first, it is as a Queenslander that I enter this Parliament. I am fortunate to have lived in many parts of Queensland as a child and I can say that there are few parts of the State to which my travels have not taken me. But it is north Queensland and northern Australia that is my home. The town of Ayr, the Burdekin district, has been my teacher, my provider since my school days.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was happy to attempt to repay what the district had given me by serving for almost 12 years as an elected councillor on the Burdekin Shire Council and by helping the less fortunate of our area through my close involvement with Australia's home-grown young man's service club, Apex, for a 15-year span.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth's involvement from the Fraser years in the construction of the Burdekin Dam has guaranteed water for, and the continuing prosperity of, the world's premier sugar-growing area and has secured the small but increasingly important rice-growing and horticultural industries in the area. Water from the Burdekin will ensure that the industrial and commercial capital of the north, Townsville, can continue to expand without ever having to concern itself again with water in what is Australia's dry-or, should I say, sunshine- tropics. The Burdekin delta will be the food bowl of Asia in the years ahead.
      </para>
      <para>
       After the initial gold rushes of 100 years ago, it was the sugar industry that developed north Queensland-an industry whose history is as fascinating and instructive as its plans for the future. The establishment of Australia's major raw sugar refinery in the Townsville-Burdekin region will bring with it new activity and expertise and a range of by-products and value-added goods to enhance Australia's trading position in the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to being the fastest growing regional centre in Australia, Cairns is rapidly becoming the international gateway to our nation. It is undoubtedly the tourist capital of Australia. With Australia's mining capital in Mount Isa, joining Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Rockhampton, the north already has the infrastructure to lead the way in our relationships with the Asia-Pacific region. Our trade with Papua New Guinea and other Pacific island nations has increased rapidly in recent years, and will continue to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have the natural resources, the infrastructure, the lifestyles, the peoples, the expertise and the acclimatisation to play an ever increasing part in the lives of the some 250 million people to our immediate north who are geographically closer to us in northern Australia than we are to the 16-odd million of our fellow Australians living south of the Tropic of Capricorn.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our education and unique scientific facilities in the north will be of enormous benefit to the Asia-Pacific region in the years ahead. James Cook University, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation and the Institute of Tropical Rainforest Studies are all prominent in matters of real interest to our near northern neighbours.
      </para>
      <para>
       The space base proposed for Cape York will propel Australia to the forefront of the world's science, technology and learning in this futuristic field. It will bring unparalleled economic and social benefits not only to the area, Australia and the world, but also to the environment and wildlife, which will be absolutely protected, and to the peoples of the area, who will share in the wealth and benefits the space base will bring.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the world focus turns to northern Australia and the Pacific, it will become more and more relevant to establish our front line defence forces in the north and to properly equip and maintain them. Let us not forget that the only threat ever of invasion to our shores was repelled by our military forces, and those of our allies, operating from bases in north Queensland.
      </para>
      <para>
       Northern Australia is a great place simply to live in, but there are costs and hardships of living in the very far north and west-difficulties which were once recognised and compensated by a taxation zone allowance. I intend to work to make this equalisation for those pioneering our frontiers relevant again.
      </para>
      <para>
       The environment is of particular significance to northern Australia. It is part of our lives; we feel it every day. Long after southern newspapers, politicians and pressure groups have ceased to cynically squeeze votes out of the issue, we will still be vitally concerned with the environment. That is why it is just so important that matters of the environment are dealt with in close consultation with the people of the area sensibly and with sensitivity. The flat earth policies espoused by some groups should not be allowed to capture the government of the day. If these groups had been in charge of things in the past, north Queensland would never have been settled. The hysteria and blatant politicism of some groups are repulsive to the many of us who work to protect the environment in which we live.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think many Australians now appreciate the genuineness and sincerity of the Liberals' proposals for the environment, as their childlike faith in the promises of the ALP and its lackeys at the last election are shattered daily. The Barrier Reef is north Queensland. Its future must never be put in jeopardy by the decisions of man. Land care and prevention of soil degradation, proper management of our rivers and river catchment systems, and sensible management of our tropical wet rainforests-these are the major environmental issues for northern Australia. Sensible guidelines must be established and adhered to so that those developing our nation know that once they have reached those goals their projects can proceed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, it is my privilege to represent the Liberal Party in this Parliament: a party of great ideals, principles and philosophies; and a party which has shaped the destiny of this nation and will lead Australia into the next century. Often the Liberal Party is referred to as a conservative party. Do honourable senators know what `conservative' means? The Oxford Dictionary defines `conservative' as `opposed to change'. It was the Liberal Party in Australia that first introduced child endowment, provided the first assistance for aged persons homes, established the Great Barrier Reef marine park, and saved Fraser island. The Liberal Party was the choice of Australia's first ever Aboriginal politician. It was the Liberal Party in Queensland, like its counterpart in South Australia some years before, which virtually voted itself out of office on a matter of principle so basic as accountability and honesty. It was the Liberal Party in Queensland which paid almost the supreme sacrifice for its ideals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some, often mischievously, confuse the word `traditional' with the word `conservative'. We certainly are a very traditional party. We have a very traditional commitment to our flag, the family, freedom and democracy. But can a party that has been to the forefront of social, health, democratic and workplace reform be rightly referred to as conservative, as opposed to change? The dictionary definition of `liberal' is, `forward thinking, democratic, broad-minded, committed to individual liberty'. That is why I reject absolutely the label of being a conservative. I am a Liberal. I have been for all my adult life and I always will be.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is with pride that I take my seat in this chamber contemporaneously with a great Queensland Liberal who stood out as one of the principal players in the drama that unfolded at the time of those real trials of democracy and accountability in Queensland in 1983. It will be my privilege to continue to work with Senator John Herron for the betterment of our State and nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Liberal Party in Queensland has had its ups and downs politically-more down than up in the last decade-but John Herron and I are part of a resurgence which will return Liberal governments for the good of Australia and Queensland in this decade. In an election result which so many so-called expert commentators labelled as a loss for the Liberals in Queensland, the Queensland Liberal Senate representation has doubled and, for the first time ever in Queensland's history, the Liberal Party has four senators and, equally with another party, the largest single representation of Queensland senators in this Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       Queensland is the only State in Australia where the coalition has two senators more than the total of the combined Australian Labor Party-Australian Democrats liaison. The Liberal vote in Queensland in the Senate rose from about 16 per cent to 29 per cent-in many electorates, particularly in North Queensland, exceeding the Liberal vote in the House of Representatives. It will continue to increase to the next election.
      </para>
      <para>
       I pay tribute to my two colleagues, Senators MacGibbon and Parer, for their carrying of the Queensland Liberal flag in this chamber in the past 13 and six years respectively-at times a very lonely and sobering experience, but one which they have carried out with great distinction and courage. It is of some sadness to me to see today that neither of them could be here for very good reasons. However, I congratulate them on the efforts they have made over the past years.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should also like to mention some other dedicated Queensland Liberals such as the late Eric Robinson, Mr John Moore, MP, Sir William Knox and Mr Denver Beanland, MLA, whose loyalty and principle over a period has placed Queensland Liberals in a position where they will be, for the first time, the leading-in numbers-political party in the Sunshine State.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also want to mention some of the previous Liberal senators whose footsteps I follow in this chamber. The late Dame Annabelle Rankin was a great Australian and Queenslander, a great Liberal and one who, long before it became fashionable, advanced the cause of women in politics. Former Senator Kathy Martin-Sullivan continues to serve the nation in this Parliament in another place. I refer also to former Senator Neville Bonner, who represented Queensland, the Liberal Party and his race with great distinction in this Parliament and whom I fondly recall welcoming to my home often during his many trips through the Burdekin.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also make special mention of former Senator Ian Woods, the last and, I believe, only other Liberal senator from North Queensland. Ian Woods was a legend in his own time, firstly as Mayor of Mackay for many years and then as a Queensland Liberal senator. He was always in the news fighting for his constituents, whether or not that suited the Party, most notably crossing the floor against the Government's sales tax on motor vehicles legislation-an even more remarkable event when we remember that his only means of transport ever was a bicycle. Ian Woods assisted me in my campaign recently and often recounted the heady times when he stood alone in the cause of his constituents.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not presume that my time in the Senate will have the colour and excitement of Ian Woods. But his ability as a Liberal to cross the floor where the real interests of his constituents transcended his party loyalty is not lost on me. It is a right which few other political groupings tolerate, and I might say a right which has attracted me and many others to the Liberal Party over the years.
      </para>
      <para>
       During our history, the Australian public has had flirtations with odd groups and individuals, with minor parties which, for a few years, have held some sway in the running of the country. But the intrinsic good sense of Australians has, over the years of our history, seen these parties fade and die as Australians realise that the good of the country demands a democratically elected government that is allowed to govern free of the dictates of grouping which represents such an odd part and view of our peoples.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Liberal Party provides the opportunities for minorities and people with particular interests and concerns but who have an underlying belief in the individual and free enterprise, to join and play a part in ensuring that the views of all sections of Australia are implemented democratically by a caring government governing for the good of the nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, I want to make some reference to my family and friends. Over the years my wife Lesley has shared my efforts, excitements and disappointments-in politics, my career, my activities, my life-with a special loyalty and commitment. The rewards have been our achievements, our ability to help others, and the friends we have made on the way. I publicly acknowledge the support of my brothers and sisters and their children and grandchildren, my tireless helpers in the Burdekin branch of the Liberal Party and my friends, some of whom have travelled long distances at great expense to be here today.
      </para>
      <para>
       Canberra has been the source of some very sad memories for my family. My eldest brother Neil, an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, lost his life over Duntroon College in March 1957 while training in the defence of his country. I hope that my connection with the national capital will, for my family, give a happier but equally as proud memory. I know that my aged mother in the geriatric ward at the Ayr District Hospital is with me today in her prayers and will find a happiness of Canberra along with her sorrows of the past.
      </para>
      <para>
       My late father would have loved to have been here today, and I guess he always thought this might happen. I fondly recall as a child sitting with my father listening to the parliamentary broadcasts on the wireless in the late 1940s, at the time of the bank nationalisation dramas.
      </para>
      <para>
       My first blooding to politics came when I and my best mate from next door of Irish Catholic parentage fought often over the merits of Liberal and Labor when neither of us quite knew what the terms and names even meant and had no idea of the ramifications of confiscation of private property.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr President, my early ideas of politics crystallised somewhat more intelligently in my formative years, when I came to realise that even those who had no inherited wealth or position had the right and the opportunities to succeed in Australia-to be an individual, to do what they aspired to do. I have always considered it a privilege that I had the opportunity to work long hours for practically no pay during the day, whilst studying externally through the Queensland University at night to achieve my profession in life. My parents had no money but I had the opportunity, the health and the encouragement of a caring family.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has been built by those who had the opportunity and seized it-not complaining about what others got or had given to them. It is only by giving the opportunity to succeed, by providing incentive and encouragement to work and produce, by ridding ourselves of the negativeness of high taxation and overgovernment, that we will return to the progress and comparative standards of living we enjoyed in the past. We must again become a nation of contributors rather than recipients.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am committed to the individual and opportunity. I want to encourage Australians to succeed, to pursue excellence, for success enables us to provide for those whose disabilities deny that opportunity. I believe that Australia's future is assured by encouraging people to attain their fullest aspirations, by seeking to reward effort, for in so doing we strengthen the country and provide a foundation to allow a compassionate and caring society.
      </para>
      <para>
       So, Mr President, as I do from northern Australia humbly join you in this chamber, it is my hope that my time in the Senate will coincide with a new spirit and enthusiasm in Australia, such as that of our pioneers, and a realisation of our destiny in the Asia-Pacific region. If, in my term, I have made some contribution to that new-born spirit and understanding, I will have succeeded.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) OTC formalised a lease in May 1990 for Levels 6 and 7 of 255 Elizabeth Street, Sydney. Total floor space covered by the lease amounts to 3500m2. 500m2 of this space is sub-leased to another party as it is not required by OTC. OTC's lease commenced with the completion of the building on 18 July 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The net cost to OTC is $1,393,770 for the lease of Levels 6 and 7 at 255 Elizabeth Street. This comprises rent payable of $1,638,210 per annum offset by sub-lease rental revenue of $244,440.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) 120 OTC staff will initially be accommodated in the premises when the building fitout is complete in September this year. Over the next three years, staff located at 255 Elizabeth Street will rise to 150.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) OTC has a lease term of three years with an option for a further three years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) New business activities arising from the deregulation of the telecommunications industry and growth of business generally has resulted in increased accommodation needs for OTC which could not be satisfied in its present headquarters building at 231 Elizabeth Street, Sydney. This building of some 23,000m2 is owned and occupied by OTC and is located just outside the traditional Central Business District of Sydney. OTC's leased accommodation in nearby 255 Elizabeth Street was chosen because of its close proximity to the headquarters building.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am advised that the lease was taken for a term of only three years to maintain the existing cohesion of OTC's headquarters administration, pending assessment of future accommodation needs to meet the business restructuring now underway in OTC.

       4. The following table shows a comparison of the number of Officer positions (requirement), against the number of Officers borne (manning). The requirement contains not only actual employment positions, but an additional number of positions to cover such things as advanced training, long service leave, special one-off projects, and periods of non-effective service such as maternity leave and leave without pay. Because the actual size of this additional requirement varies considerably from day-to-day, the number of Officers available to fill employment positions also will vary from day to day.

       18, 19, 6 (f) and 6 (g). The cost of converting a graduate pilot to operational standards varies greatly depending on the level of proficiency required and the aircraft type. For example, the cost of converting a graduate pilot to a F/A 18 pilot is $1,174,000, whilst the basic cost of converting a graduate pilot to a transport pilot (Hercules) is $65,700. As the transport aircraft are multi-crewed, the graduate pilot will initially become operational as a co-pilot and then requires at least two years and approximately 1000 flying hours on a Hercules to become an operational aircraft captain (1989-90 prices).
      </para>
      <para>
       20. Assuming that the 10 year period commenced after graduation, the pilot remained a fighter pilot for the period, and has undergone instructional courses, the direct cost of training a replacement for a trained pilot with 10 years flying experience and with F/A 18 training has been estimated at $10.9m (1989-90 prices).

        —The Minister for Community Services and Health and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training have provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Comprehensive statistics of road accident injuries are not compiled. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. Most outlays on the treatment and care of people with traumatically acquired head injuries are made from funds provided through State Government traffic accident compensation systems. Analysis of major compensation claims from motor vehicle accidents in New South Wales suggests that approximately one per cent of all motor vehicle accidents result in permanent, serious brain injury.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;RC) currently supports a Road Accident Research Unit within the University of Adelaide. For the 1990 calendar year, funds allocated to the Unit amount to $438,650, of which 80 per cent is used in the research of head injury disabilities. This represents approximately one half of one per cent of total NH&amp;RC funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) NH&amp;RC funding conditions require that recipients of grants/funds publicise the results of their research in appropriate scientific journals. Research results are also presented at national and international conferences.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The internal allocation of an institution's annual operating funding is determined by that institution, within the context of agreed educational profiles. The direction of resources to a Chair of Neurosurgery in any University is therefore a matter for that University to determine, having regard to its own priorities for development.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Australian Research Council (ARC) does not fund research into clinical medicine under its Special Research Centres program. This means that a Centre for Brain Injury Research with a clinical emphasis would not be seen as an ARC responsibility. Such research is more appropriately supported through the NH&amp;RC. To date, no research in the area of neurosurgery has been funded through the NH&amp;RC.

       (1) The Commonwealth has no direct knowledge of the operational arrangements of local Councils for spraying public areas. With regard to the toxicology of Round Up, while the concentrated product does have irritant properties, data supplied to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) indicate that diluted Round Up did not produce skin sensitisation or dermal irritation in animal studies.

       With regard to tumourgenicity, data supplied to NHMRC do not indicate a relationship between the incidence of tumours in mice and treatment with Round Up.

       (2) The data on Glyphosate, Dicamba and Simazine received from manufacturers are treated on the same basis as all agricultural and veterinary chemicals, i.e. it is available to the extent that public release would not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act.

      <para>
       (1) The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 imposes strict regulations on telephone interception, including Telecom's monitoring of subscriber telephones.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Act makes it unlawful for any person to intercept telephone calls without the knowledge of the person making the call, except where interception is performed by an officer of a telecommunications carrier (Telecom, OTC, AUSSAT) in the execution of their duties while installing, connecting or maintaining telecommunications equipment or lines.
      </para>
      <para>
       Interception may also be performed according to a warrant issued under the Act. A warrant may only be issued for a period of up to 90 days following an application by a specified law enforcement agency such as the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority, or the NSW and Victorian Police Forces. A warrant will be issued only for the investigation of specified offences, which include fraud where the offence is punishable by at least seven years imprisonment. A warrant is not available for the purposes of defending civil law actions or claims.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Telecom has advised that prior to 1986, aural monitoring of a customer's service was utilised on infrequent occasions where difficulties with a telephone service were reported, and no fault was able to be located by normal test measures.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In 1986 the Commonwealth Ombudsman raised with Telecom issues concerning aural monitoring of Telecom services. Telecom reviewed the situation and decided that in the investigation of service complaints by customers Telecom should not monitor conversations by means of a loudspeaker in the exchange unless prior approval to take such action has been obtained from the customer.
      </para>
      <para>
       These arrangements meet the requirements of the Ombudsman, and are the current practice on the rare occasions when such a situation arises.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Telecom has advised that its Security and Investigation Section is not maintaining files on a Mr John Doohan, nor has it ever maintained such files.

      <para>
       (1) Restoration of the old Lapston Hotel Building at RAAF Glenbrook to adapt it for use entirely as the Officers' Mess has not been completed.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its Eleventh Report of 1977 to Parliament, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works recommended that there was a need for new and upgraded living and working accommodation at RAAF Glenbrook to replace existing inadequate and temporary accommodation.
      </para>
      <para>
       At that time the old Lapston Hotel building was being used, and had been used for many years prior to that time, both as office and administrative accommodation, and for officer messing; officer sleeping accommodation was in temporary wooden huts.
      </para>
      <para>
       The project was progressed in four phases of which the first three were implemented as planned. Stage 3 included new airmens' accommodation and a new airmens' Mess. Stage 4, which provided for the restoration of the old Lapston Hotel building, was deferred on the grounds of more urgent competing priorities. It was decided to progress renovation of the Officers' Mess kitchen and dining room in 1985-1986 at a cost of $665,000, and for the balance of the works to the old Lapston Hotel building, which included conversion of original bedrooms to their original purpose (having been used as offices for about 40 years), to be undertaken progressively over a number of years as funding availability allowed.

       Since March 1983, $1,684,094 has been spent on the renovations and cyclical repairs and maintenance to the Officers' Mess building which includes the kitchen and dining room works. It is estimated that about another $250,000 is required to complete the renovations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The renovations included the provision of a Ladies' Powder Room adjacent to the Mess Anteroom at a cost of $22,000. This work was authorised last financial year, and involved conversion of an old store room for its new purpose. The work was both necessary and reasonably priced.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Airmens' Mess is a relatively new building (opened in 1983) and meets the Defence Scales and Standards for the airmens' population it serves.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the period 12 to 18 months ago, the Officer-in-Charge of the Airmens' Mess requested that a number of minor repairs and improvements be undertaken to the facility. These included provision of new curtains, repainting of the kitchen, repairs to the verandah, lights and pergola roof, and materials for the construction of a barbecue. All those requests costing a total of $46,381 have been implemented. At present no maintenance requirements are outstanding apart from a request submitted on 22 July 1990 to repair an ice-making machine which is being attended to.
      </para>
      <para>
       The redevelopment works at Glenbrook gave priority to the provision of new airmen and senior non-commissioned officer messing and accommodation, and renovation of the Officers' Mess has had to be on an opportunity basis.

      <para>
       (a), (c) and (d) The information sought by the honourable senator is contained in the Prime Minister's answer to Question No. 1870 on 2 November 1989 (House of Representatives Hansard, page 2501). The Prime Minister's answer includes details of consultants engaged by the Office of the Status of Women and the National Women's Consultative Council to 30 June 1989. Details of consultancies from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990 are below.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) An internal procedures statement on establishing and supervising consultancies has been prepared by the Office of the Status of Women. This statement supplements guidelines on the engagement of consultants produced by the Department of Administrative Services. In accordance with the internal procedures statement and the Department of Administrative Services guidelines, briefing papers and background notes are provided to prospective consultants. The amount of detail in written briefing material is related to the size and complexity of the task. The project briefs and consultancy contracts specify working details such as results to be achieved and the time frame for their achievement, administrative arrangements including management of the consultancy and reporting requirements. If the Senator has a specific enquiry concerning any particular consultancy I shall examine what information can be provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) Information is not readily available as to the payment of any fees in excess of an initial quote. To provide this information would require accessing and examining all consultancy files for the period nominated. In the circumstances, I am unwilling to authorise the time and expense involved in obtaining the information. The following general comments are, however, relevant. Details of fees negotiated with consultants are set out in the consultancy contracts. An increase in fees may result from a variation or extension to a consultancy contract including a change in the scope of consultancy services. However, additional fees would not be paid to a consultant because of failure on the part of the consultant to cost the proposal accurately or for additional work claimed to have been undertaken for which proper authorisation was not obtained in advance.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The latest figures available from the Transport and Storage Group (TSG) of the Department of Administrative Services are that at 9 August 1990 there were 479 male and 22 female Commonwealth car drivers in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I have been informed by the TSG that female car drivers were first employed in 1984 following press advertisements around Australia. They advise that since 1984, 66 males and 4 females have been employed as car drivers from within the Department, and 79 males and 19 females have been employed from outside TSG.
      </para>
      <para>
       The number of women appointed over that period was proportionally higher in relation to the number of their applications than for men.
      </para>
      <para>
       The selection criteria do not discriminate against women and TSG has continued to appoint women as and when vacancies arise. It should be noted that the number of vacancies which arise is very small.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) TSG follows the Equal Employment Opportunity guidelines of the Government and has ensured that women are given every opportunity for employment when vacancies arise.
      </para>
      <para>
       There have been, however, a few occasions when the need to redeploy longstanding employees from other areas of TSG has meant that males have been placed as car drivers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Given that the number of Commonwealth car drivers to be recruited in the near future is unlikely to be significant, it would not be appropriate to conduct a campaign to increase the number of female drivers.

       Yes. The Four Corners team making ``The Wood for the Trees'' hired a helicopter on Sunday, 2 June 1990. The booking, which was made a week in advance, was expected to last four hours. However, heavy fog in parts of the south-west that morning disrupted the filming schedule, extending the hire to just over six hours. The cost was $4,554.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Australian Electoral Commission has surveyed, in six electorates, all addresses for which electors were newly enrolled between 1 January 1990 and the 26 February 1990 close of rolls for the 24 March 1990 federal election.
      </para>
      <para>
       As field investigation of all newly enrolled electors at these addresses has not yet been completed, it would be inappropriate, at this stage, to release the names of the electorates involved in this survey. However I can say that three of the electorates were selected from those held by the Government, and three from those held by the Opposition parties prior to the March 1990 election.
      </para>
      <para>
       Analysis of the data gathered is continuing, and the Australian Electoral Commission expects to report shortly to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on its findings in each of the electorates surveyed.
