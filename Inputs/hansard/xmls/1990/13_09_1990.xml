      <para>
       (1) They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.

       The undersigned citizens of Australia oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would:

      <para>
       *compromise animal welfare, *allow genetic engineering companies to appropriate the fruits of centuries of selective breeding, *reduce biodiversity, and *further concentrate ownership of breeding stock.

       Therefore, please take all possible steps immediately to ensure that:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The Patents Office rejects all existing applications for animal patents and declines to accept any more.

First, let me say that as far as my colleague Senator Walsh is concerned, he can speak for himself; he frequently does. The Government is fully committed to the support of the Melbourne Olympic Games bid. The support of the Commonwealth Government has been manifest in a variety of ways but will be particularly displayed by the Prime Minister being a member of the bid team visiting Tokyo next week for the International Olympic Committee meeting.

         —Yes, with the Leader of the Opposition-and I personally feel that the bid stands a very good chance of success. The Commonwealth Government agreed in January this year to the request from the Victorian Premier to provide $125m towards a world standard sporting complex at Albert Park in Melbourne should the bid be successful. That Albert Park sporting complex will be the major new facility for the Olympic Games if Melbourne is successful. Of course, the Melbourne Cricket Ground is being refurbished, but that is going to happen anyway. The decision to commit Commonwealth funds to the Melbourne Olympic Games bid in terms of the Albert Park project was subject to an interdepartmental committee decision which included the Department of Finance and the Australian Construction Services and other bodies reporting on the Victorian estimates of the costs and general economy of the Olympic Games bid. That IDC reported that the cost estimates were reasonable given the scope of the project. At this stage the Commonwealth has no other commitment to support the Melbourne Olympic Games bid-other than, I should add, a general enthusiasm on the part of most members of parliament and certainly the Government to support that bid.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Michael Baume also asked me about an industrial relations agreement signed in Victoria recently relating to cost escalation and time for completing projects such as the new facility at Albert Park. I am very confident that the unions will honour that agreement and will appreciate the potential of this project to boost the Victorian and Australian economies, and will cooperate in its successful implementation. I should add to that that I felt that members of the Melbourne Olympic Committee who were in discussions with the unions the week before last shared that view and felt that there was unanimous support across the spectrum of industrial relations in Victoria for that view.

It is not the first time a woman has appeared in such a case representing one of the major parties; it is the first time for the Commonwealth. The reason why Ms Lynne Tacy of my Department is appearing is that she is simply the best choice to represent the Australian Government's position in the case.

        The second part of Senator Giles's question related to the Government's position in the case today. We believe that wage policy in Australia is at a critical stage in that we are transferring from a centralised system to a more decentralised system. It is imperative that in that period of transition there be a continuance of the award restructuring process, of the structural efficiency principle and of the workplace reform that that framework for wage fixation is meant to generate. In all of that we see the role of the Industrial Relations Commission as being central. We will be advocating that the accord-accord mark 6-that this Government enjoys with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) be adopted by the Commission as the basis for wage fixation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Budget we announced tax cuts which effectively reduce the taxation levels for ordinary wage earners in this country and which, on the projections, have improved household disposable income for ordinary Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of our submission we will be arguing that the September quarter consumer price index increase should be the basis of the next wage adjustment, followed six months later by a $12 per week increase across the board; that superannuation provision in this country should increase by 3 per cent, phased in over three years commencing in May next year; and that there should be an element of enterprise bargaining in which the emphasis is on sharing between employers and workers the achieved productivity and profitability gains that arise from the restructuring process that has gone on, that being on the basis of no double counting and following the guidelines to be laid down.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is all on the basis too that the accord commits both the accord partners-the unions and the Government-to an aggregate wage outcome of no more than 7 per cent in the 1990-91 year. We think that the direct bargaining that has characterised the wages landscape over the last few weeks is appropriate, but we do not endorse stoppages of work in support of those particular claims.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the face of continued restraint and discipline by workers in achieving moderate outcomes for wages, one of the most significant pressures on wage fixation in Australia is that senior executive salaries continue to rise at a rate faster than for the rest of the community. Employers or senior executives are saying to their workers, `Do not do as we do and take massive wage increases, but do as we say and restrain yourselves in a way which we find is comfortable'. The most graphic illustration of this appeared in a recent news- paper article in which a senior executive of a leading Australian company was reported as having a base salary of $1.2m a year. The article said that he had exercised `commendable restraint' in accepting only an 11 per cent increase. In the same newspaper, on the editorial pages, the ACTU's so-called 7 per cent claim-the newspaper was wrong about that-was described as `rapacious'.
       </para>
       <para>
        A base rate of $1.2m and an 11 per cent increase is seen as commendable restraint at one end of the market. For ordinary Aussie battlers, something less than 7 per cent is regarded as a rapacious claim. The pressure on the wages system is not coming from workers who are observing the accord; it is coming from rapacious executives who, in the face of a need for restraint, ought to exercise it themselves.

        <para in-line="1">
         —We have, of course, noted the wire service reports this morning that the Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i, has attacked the United States of America military presence in the Gulf-particularly in Saudi Arabia-and has called, as Senator Hill says, for a holy war against what he described as American aggression, greed, plans and policies in the Gulf.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The statement is, at face value, disturbing and puzzling-puzzling, particularly in the light of previous statements by Iranian leaders that have opposed in very clear terms the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait, called for Iraq's withdrawal and acknowledged the reasons behind the international effort to enforce the blockade against Iraq. It also, of course, runs counter to the quite often stated and re-stated Iranian position of support for international sanctions against Iraq.
       </para>
       <para>
        As such, it has to be carefully evaluated. I have to say that I am not yet in a position to make a full evaluation of it. We are waiting for further reports as to the context in which the speech was given, and whether there is any evidence of support for it-or that kind of language-in current statements by the civilian leaders, and, of course, we are looking to assessments by other countries with an involvement and interest in the affair.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not at this stage want to read too much significance into the statement. It would be inappropriate to react too dramatically. There is a tradition in Iran of really quite extravagant statements emerging from time to time from the clergy, from that side of the polity, which are not always mirrored either in the language or the performance of the Government itself. Clearly, the situation will bear very close watching indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, I might add that the references yesterday to Iran possibly considering supplying food to Iraq, and giving Iraq an outlet for unspecified products in return, is also a report that needs to be treated with some caution at this stage. There is a continuing discussion going on about the circumstances in which food and medicine might appropriately be allowed into Iraq subject to the humani- tarian exception to the sanctions regime. I do not think it would be proper to assume at this stage that any full-scale breach, or intended breach, by Iran of that sanctions regime is imminent. But, once again, that is an aspect of events that will need very close watching.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the last part of Senator Hill's question about the longer term military balance in the region, and the presence or otherwise of foreign or multinational forces, that is very much a question that does remain to be addressed in the event- ual working out and resolution of the whole Gulf affair. I do not think it should be assumed in any way at all that the American Government has any commitment or desire to establish a permanent ongoing presence in the region. It may well be that there is a case for some continuing international presence, whether of a pan-Arab character or of a wider international character.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may well be that a case can be made, in particular-as I think Secretary of State Baker intimated in his recent congressional testimony-for some presence of American materiel in the Gulf region on an ongoing basis, even if not accompanied by American personnel, but creating, as it were, a capacity to rapidly deploy personnel with equipment there on the ground to cope with contingencies that might arise in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply say that all these issues are obviously subject to quite active ongoing discussion and policy formulation within the countries that are involved. It is simply premature to be making any judgments either about the long-term intentions of any of the various players in respect of this, or about what the long-term probabilities are of particular scenarios working themselves out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly, I do not think there is any rational foundation for the kind of suggestion which seems to underlie the Iranian spiritual leader's speech that the Americans are planning effectively a permanent presence in the region. I do not think there is anything on the record which gives support or foundation for that assumption.

         —Senator Beahan gave me advance notice of this question and I am able to supply the following answer: under the arrangements applying prior to the Budget announcement, home owners were able to retain capital gains tax exemptions for their principal residence in respect of a period of absence of up to four years, regardless of whether the residence was rented or not during that period. In order to qualify for the temporary residence exemption, it was necessary for the taxpayer to reoccupy the dwelling before sale of the property.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Recognising that legitimate absences, particularly work related, can result in the taxpayer being absent from his or her principal residence for more than four years, the Government has decided to extend the current four-year period to six years. Whereas an absence in excess of four years previously disqualified the exemption even for the four-year period, the exemption relating to temporary absence will now be lost only in respect of the period of absence in excess of six years. There will be no time constraint on the period of absence qualifying for exemption where the principal residence is not used to produce income.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, recognising the difficulties imposed by the current law for near retirees and others who choose to relocate following a period of absence, owners will no longer be required to move back into their principal residence in order to qualify for the exemption.

        The new arrangements are of obvious benefit to those people who are forced to move either to or away from remote areas for work reasons, which really was the substance of Senator Beahan's question.

         —There are concerns around the world about rainforests and logging, not just in the countries which the honourable senator has mentioned. The concerns are not only about the maintenance of the biological diversity but also the maintenance of the culture of indigenous peoples who are threatened by logging. The Hawke Government's conservation policy on rainforests states that `Australia's future timber needs should be met without placing at risk the long term conservation of the rainforest resources of other countries'. Senator Aulich would be aware that last year the Government engaged Coopers and Lybrand and Fortech as consultants to review the extent of Australia's involvement in international trade in tropical timbers, the impacts that trade had on consumers in Australia, and also options for increasing tropical rainforest management and protection. That consultants' report was completed in April of this year and has been reviewed by relevant Government departments.

       <para>
        The environment movement and many people in this country have been calling for a ban on those tropical timber imports as one part of a package of measures to protect those forests and the biological diversity within them. A group known as Friends of the Penan, with support from other environment and aid groups, has been staging a protest outside the Malaysian High Commission in Canberra in support of tropical forests and the rights of the Penan people. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is drafting a Cabinet submission on these timber imports and related issues. I think Mrs Kelly will be seeking the joint sponsorship of that submission from Senator Bolkus and Senator Evans in their ministerial capacities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The kind of issues that have to be considered will include allowing imports of tropical timbers only from those countries which have proper sustainable forestry management plans. I would not deny that such a scheme would be difficult to implement. Nonetheless, that has to be examined. Other issues include encouraging producer countries to set aside some wilderness areas and biosphere reserves for the preservation of biodiversity and, of course, for the security of the culture of those indigenous peoples, like the Penan, whom we have been referring to; improving forestry management practices in producer countries; and ensuring that development assistance activities and overseas aid programs generally are environmentally sound and contribute to ecologically sustainable development of forest resources in the countries to which aid goes.

        Obviously the river system there has been under stress for a long time.

        Anything that was done to add to the problems of the Murray-Darling system would be of concern to millions of Australians. The possibility of further pollution of that system should not be opened up without very careful environmental examination. In saying that, while being very critical of Mr McLachlan I am not criticising Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd (ANM), which has offered, as part of its development proposal, to clean up parts of the river. I do not think that ANM is attempting at any point to underestimate the seriousness, the gravity, of the problem that we face.

I hardly need to remind anybody that this Government was not responsible for that hopeless effort, not only in calculating the number of unemployment beneficiaries but as a step in attempting to send this nation broke. Having said that, Mr Hewson and Senator Alston fail to comprehend that the 475,000 is an average figure. I do not think there is any evidence at all that that figure is likely to be exceeded.

         —I will give you a codeine solution, Senator; that is what you need. I have looked at the sales figures and the registration data for the motor vehicle industry up to the most recent months and those figures-which, after all, are the test of what is happening in an industry-are in fact quite different from the picture which might emerge from some of those reports.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The figures show that motor vehicle sales were still growing strongly and in July were up by about 10 per cent on the figures for the same period last year. I have been told that the preliminary figures for the month of August show the same sort of trend. This is the third year in a row in which sales of locally produced cars have increased. In fact, this year has seen the biggest increase in sales since the start of the motor vehicle plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is very important to note that the increased sales have not been coming from imports at the expense of local products. In fact, the share of the imports has decreased this year. It is currently around 23 per cent, compared with some 26 per cent last year. One can only speculate as to why there is all this talk of doom and gloom when the official figures indicate continuing growth in the vehicle market.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say that when we began in 1985 with the motor vehicle plan it had three overriding aims. The first was for Australians to be able to buy better quality cars; the second was for cars to be cheaper; and the third was to see a viable and competitive motor vehicle industry in Australia with a real future. Part of those proposals was to create greater competition in the marketplace, and that is what we have got.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I might deal briefly with each of those issues, there are distinct signs of improved quality in Australian produced cars in the last 18 months or so. For the last eight quarters car price increases have been less than the consumer price index increases and the industry, of course, is enjoying a period of very high and volatile competition. The competition has created problems for some manufacturers because they have to compete. In a competitive market there will be winners and losers and in this current market the consumers are winning. Some sections of the manufacturers are winning and others are not; they tend to be more noisy than those who are.
       </para>
       <para>
        Much has been achieved but there is still much to be done with the motor vehicle industry. The Industry Commission will report soon and the Government will be making decisions about the arrangements which will succeed the car plan when it runs out in 1992. It is not appropriate for me to speculate on the outcome of the Industry Commission report, but the existing plan has given the industry a stable policy framework, which we will ensure exists after 1992.

He has done so because of concerns about health and safety aspects but also, of course, concerns about the security and integrity of the Australian Federal Police in its operations and in the way in which the community is entitled to hold it in very high regard. If it is given the task, as it has been, to enforce our drug laws nationwide, the Australian people are entitled to be confident that the members of the Australian Federal Police are themselves not indulging in the use of those illegal drugs.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Commissioner is satisfied, I may say, about those provisions in the regulations governing the Federal Police dealing with alcohol, which of course is a drug which can cause problems of a health and safety nature. But as far as the question of illegal drugs is concerned, this is a matter which he is giving particular emphasis to. I believe he will be able to call on the experience of international organisations which have adopted such a drug free policy for their work forces and on the experience of some organisations with Australia. I believe that elements of the various testing procedures adopted to combat the use of drugs in sport here in Australia may also be of use in devising a regime to implement this policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the cooperation of the Australian Federal Police Association in any such move is absolutely crucial to its success, both as to the testing of entrants and then as to members of the Federal Police during the time of their contracts with the Federal Police. I understand that such discussions with the union are taking place at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this matter of a drug free policy for law enforcement agencies is a matter of much wider concern than simply that of the Australian Federal Police, and I am seeking to put the matter on the agenda of the Australian Police Ministers Council, which is meeting later this year, to see whether a nationwide approach might not be adopted in relation to a drug free policy in Australian law enforcement agencies.

         —It is nice to see the Commonwealth Bank being cast in such a warm glow by Senator Spindler. I do not agree with the honourable senator's assessment of the various matters which he read out as being `community service obligations'. Telecom Australia, for example, has community service obligations which are imposed on it by government. The Commonwealth Bank, as I understand it, does not have community service obligations imposed on it by government. What it depends on very much is the Bank's policy in relation to the sorts of services which Senator Spindler refers to, some of which may even have been loss-making in themselves but which are, nevertheless, designed to attract and maintain the patronage of particular community groups for essentially commercial reasons.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I might say that other banks, private banks, do some of the same sort of thing in various areas of their activities, which suggests that the Commonwealth Bank's community service efforts, as the honourable senator puts them, may be more palatable and attractive to him than some of the services or special benefits provided by other banks. It is a matter of taste.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having made that point, I doubt very much that the management of the Commonwealth Bank would want to change the policies which have made it so attractive to many of those community groups. After all, it is in the banking business and it has clients and customers whose allegiance it wishes to retain.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should add that the Commonwealth Government will remain effectively the dominant shareholder in the bank, so legislation to guarantee policy objectives will not necessarily prove essential. Finally, Senator Spindler asked me about whether there should be a Senate committee investigation of this matter. Senate committees are often useful bodies but I doubt that this would be so in the case of the Commonwealth Bank.

It just happens that the Commonwealth Government is the majority shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank, or will be the majority shareholder, and there is legislation-I think it is called the Commonwealth Banking Act. I did not say anything about private sector banks fulfilling community service obligations to people. What I said first of all was that I did not believe that the sort of services which you referred to in your question were in fact community service obligations. They were, if you like, marketing bait for the customers of the Commonwealth Bank which keeps them happy-me amongst them. Banks adopt different strategies to look after the interests of their customers, and they should be entitled to do so. What the honourable senator wants seemingly to put on the whole banking sector is the palsied hand of Democrat warm inner glow.

        I might say that the Government has indicated that that is its position as far as its employees are concerned. But the operative date of the first increase and the endorsement of the package is subject to the national wage case proceedings before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Our offer stands on the basis that the Commission, which is central to wage fixation, determines an operative date and an endorsement of the package.
       </para>

        That, I think, in part answers the second part of the question-that is, does it threaten the system?. The short answer is no, it does not, because of the central processes of the Industrial Relations Commission.

        I might also add that we believe that entering into direct negotiations with our employees, as represented by their unions, is an appropriate course of action. I am somewhat surprised that some other employers do not seem to share that view. We think the way in which the Government has approached these negotiations is an example for constructively facing our responsibilities to our employees and to recognise their real wage needs within the terms of the accord and within the commitment in the accord that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has pledged itself to adhere to-that the aggregate wage outcome for Budget year 1990-91 has a ceiling of 7 per cent. While that figure of 7 per cent has been bandied around as if it is a maximum wage outcome for this year, we have to recognise that in the pipeline that makes up the 7 per cent there is a 3 to 3 1/2 per cent pipeline from last year and there is an allocation of wages drift in the wages system of about one to 1 1/2 per cent.

       <para>
        I have indicated, not through any indifference or casual response but simply because of a lack of information at this stage, that we ought not to get too excited about these reports. They do not appear to reflect explicit Iranian Government statements. They are at odds with previous very clear statements about Iran's position on the Gulf crisis and the question of the appropriateness of the sanctions.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a question that has to be addressed by the international community, in any event, about some possible scope for humanitarian exceptions to the sanctions regime in the food and medicine area, although the context of the report does not suggest that it was being put in that way. So it is simply appropriate caution rather than any other characteristic that leads me to respond as I do on that particular question.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the whole question of the Iran-Iraq rapprochement and diplomatic settlement, that is in itself something that the international community ought to wholly welcome. It was a bloody, unproductive and appalling war that was fought between the two countries over eight years with the loss of some one million lives. If the two countries, for whatever reason, whatever motives, have found it possible to reach agreement or a settlement, and do so on appropriate terms, they will be acting in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations, which has urged the parties to do just that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We, of course, hope that none of this will reflect itself in any undermining of the international sanctions effort against Iraq. We will, of course, be making strenuous representations to Iran and acting in consort with the rest of the international community as appropriate should it appear that the Iranians are, in fact, embarked upon such a course. But, I repeat, it is premature to make any such judgment.

        Australia Post will be actively promoting the sale of its standard stamps in multiples of five. Senator Short and Senator Brownhill should work it out; they got it wrong. This is consistent with the merchandising trend for many small value items and will remove the need to consider the question of rounding. Concerns that the cessation of issues of 1c and 2c coins will be inflationary are unwarranted. A number of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France and, most recently, New Zealand have ceased to issue or have withdrawn their lowest denomination coins and have not experienced inflationary problems as a result.

        There is no reason to expect that the position in Australia will be different. The cent will remain the basic unit of account in price setting. Goods sold by supermarkets and other retail outlets can still be priced in lc stops. Rounding is intended to apply to the payment of bills rather than the pricing of goods. Many retail goods are of course normally purchased in multiples rather than individually. So, only the final bill for payment will need to be rounded. The question of rounding arises only where final bills are paid in cash. Payments by cheque, credit card or electronic funds transfer at point of sale will not be affected and should continue to be made to the exact cent.

        I refer to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1990 No. 35, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 17 May 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee noted that the Statutory Rules were sponsored by `John Kerin, Minister of State for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories'. Your advice is sought on the accuracy of this description.
       </para>
       <para>
        Various provisions relating to strict liability in the principal Regulations have been questioned previously by the Committee and an undertaking was obtained to remove them. Regulation 13 in the present Statutory Rules appears to be another strict liability provision. Unless there is some exemption in the parent Act, if more than 20 persons are discharged from a vessel or hovercraft because of, say, fire or other emergency, an offence is committed to which there seems no defence. Such a result, the Committee suggests, cannot have been intended. If the Committee's understanding of this provision is correct, it appears appropriate that the Regulations be amended to provide a defence of `reasonability'.

        I refer to your letters of 17 May 1990 referring to the Standing Committee's queries on a number of issues. My advice is as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        * The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority had been working on a package of regulation amendments that had arisen over a period of many months, dealing with issues that included the concerns of the Senate Committee, the introduction of permit assessment fees, consequential amendments required because of the passage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Act in 1988, and an amendment dealing with contract limits. The drafting instructions for the amendments were of differing complexity, were prepared by different draftspersons in the Attorney-General's Department, and took different amounts of time to finalize. By the time it was clear that two amendments to the Regulations would be due for submission to the Government-General at once it was not possible, without what was considered unjustified delay and expense, to reprint the two instruments as one.
       </para>
       <para>
        * As far as I am aware the GBRMPA has no outstanding undertakings to the Senate R&amp; Committee. A letter to this effect was sent by Senator Richardson in early December 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The published version of Statutory Rule No. 35, which appeared to be sponsored by Mr Kerin, is a misprint. I understand it is to be reprinted.
       </para>
       <para>
        * Regulation 13 was drafted to deal with a specific set of circumstances that had arisen in the Cairns Section of the Marine Park. The Authority took legal action to stop a ferry operator who was operating his vessel to Green Island, a Marine National Park `B' Zone, without a Marine Park permit. The Court found that certain terms used in the Cairns Section Zoning Plan intended by the Parliament to prohibit such activities were ambiguous. The Authority appealed this decision, however the ferry operator continued his operation. As an interim measure the Authority sought to have drafted a new regulation (regulation 13) to prevent this person from continuing to operate to Green Island.
       </para>
       <para>
        * It is the Authority's intention to repeal this regulation within the next few months. Changes to the principal Act which close this alleged loophole were recently passed by Parliament. Evidence has been collected, however, for a prosecution under this regulation and the Authority is waiting for advice from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether they wish to proceed with a prosecution under this regulation before any action to repeal it is taken.

        With respect to undertakings to the Committee your advice would be appreciated on progress with amendments of the Administrative Procedures Orders under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and other administrative matters in respect of six concerns raised by the Committee. It is understood that drafting instructions have been issued and draft guidelines prepared. The Committee is grateful for this progress but would welcome an indication of when these are likely to be finalised. Similarly, the Committee would also appreciate advice on progress with amendments of the Environment Protection and Management Ordinance 1987, Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands Ordinance No. 1 of 1987.

       That principle would have been preserved if the House of Representatives had suspended its standing order, as the Senate did when it passed my motion, and passed the Bill. The Senate as presently constituted would have agreed that the Bill pass, and the House as presently constituted would have agreed that the Bill pass. The House of Representatives has mistaken the standing order for the principle which it is meant to safeguard. I intend to reintroduce the Bill, and I hope that the Senate will give it a speedy passage.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The modernisation of Australia's extradition laws has been an integral part of this government's strategy in the war against crime. It is no secret that crime is increasingly taking on an international perspective. There is no starker example of the international dimensions of crime than the drug trade. Not only is there an importation of illicit drugs but also there is the associated exportation of money from Australia to pay for this filthy merchandise. Often legitimate international business channels are used to make just such payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        This government has taken significant initiatives to combat crime within Australia. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 provides for a comprehensive regime of freezing and confiscation designed to attack the very motive for crime, profit. The cash transaction reports act 1988 establishes regimes for the reporting of significant cash transactions, the reporting of suspect transactions and for the verification of identity of persons opening accounts. These measures will greatly assist law enforcement by producing criminal intelligence and creating a money trail for large amounts of cash. Having established these measures domestically the next step is to reach agreements with other nations that will facilitate international cooperation in the fight against crime. The mutual assistance in criminal matters act 1987 provides just such a mechanism. Where Australia has a mutual assistance relationship with a foreign nation many of these domestic remedies may be available to that other nation. Similarly, domestic remedies regarding the freezing and confiscation of assets in that country may be able to be used by Australian law enforcement agencies. This government has actively pursued the negotiation of mutual assistance treaties with other nations and to date has concluded 9 treaties, with 16 in various stages of negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Complementary to these measures is the modernisation of Australia's extradition relationships. The government formed a task force to negotiate modern bilateral extradition treaties or extradition arrangements. So far treaties or arrangements have been negotiated with 26 countries, with 14 in various stages of negotiations. In 1988 the Parliament passed a modern extradition Act. In light of the experience with the act over the past 12 months or so a need for some technical `fine tuning' of the legislation has become apparent. The Bill before the Senate contains those technical amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I propose to deal only briefly with the more significant of these amendments. As section 11 of the Act now stands it is not possible to list in regulations all countries to which Australia can extradite for crimes created pursuant to multilateral treaties such as the hijacking convention and the convention for the protection of internationally protected persons. It is clearly desirable that all Australians be able to ascertain easily the crimes for which extradition can be considered and all the countries to which Australia can extradite for those crimes. The amendments to section 11 are designed to enable the regulations to comprehensively list the countries to which persons may be extradited for `multilateral offences'. Other amendments streamline Australia's extradition relationship with New Zealand where a person consents to being surrendered to New Zealand. Finally, a new provision is inserted into the Extradition Act 1988 which will give police power to arrest, without warrant, a person who is about to abscond. A detailed explanation of all the amendments is set out in the explanatory memorandum.

         I move that motion on the basis that the Bill that was referred to the Committee by the Senate was dealt with by the Committee on 4 September and not 12 September, the day that the Senate had set aside for the consideration of Bills referred to committees. The Selection of Bills Committee report came into this chamber on 24 August. Under that report, the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill 1990 was referred to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I was a member of that Committee at the time, although my name does not appear on the report which has been brought into the chamber today by the Chairman, Senator Foreman. The report indicates that the Committee at present is Senator Foreman, Senator Chapman, Senator Faulkner, Senator Kernot, Senator Macdonald, Senator Panizza, Senator Schacht and Senator Walsh.
        </para>
        <para>
         I heard about the arrangements to bring the meeting on earlier-at 11 a.m. on 4 September-because that Committee, of which I was a member at that time, was meeting at 1.30 p.m. on that day to discuss the Very Fast Train inquiry. I told the Secretary of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that I was going off the Committee and that Senator Panizza and Senator Macdonald would be on it when it dealt with the Bill on 12 September. Senator Macdonald was not available on 11 September at such short notice as he had arrangements to tour with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in far north Queensland. Senator Panizza had no knowledge of the early date and was not able to attend. Senator Chapman was not able to be there at 11 a.m. His plane was delayed and he got to the Very Fast Train inquiry at 2.30 p.m., the Committee having commenced at 1.30 p.m.
        </para>
        <para>
         I was told that the hearings would commence at 11 a.m. but had commitments in my electorate which precluded my attending at the earlier time. In fact, the Committee met-I am unsure of the number present-with only Government members in attendance. I understand that Senator Kernot was not able to be present because of a bereavement and other commitments. The Committee dealt with it.
        </para>
        <para>
         I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of my letter to the Chairman, dated 3 September, objecting to the Bill being dealt with in that fashion. It is for those reasons and for the way the report is now brought into the chamber that I believe the airlines Bill has not been dealt with properly by the Committee. It should be sent back to the Committee and the report of the Committee should not be received by the Senate.

        The Committee's fifty-third general report covers the activities of the Committee during 1989. As the report will show, it has been a very busy year. Twenty-six reports were tabled. This is the highest number of reports that the Committee has presented on domestic projects. The estimated cost of the proposals reported on by the Committee during 1989 was $1.1 billion. Sixty-eight meetings were held to conduct public meetings, to carry out inspections and to consider reports and a number of other matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of matters of concern to the Committee are raised in the report. These are: first, the question of consultations between departments or authorities and organisations and individuals who may be affected by a proposed work. Far too often the consultative process is perceived as tokenism. The Committee believes that meaningful consultation within realistic time frames is essential during the development of any project.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter is the provision of child-care facilities in Commonwealth office buildings. The situation now is that departments are able to provide child-care centres for employees, subject to cost- neutral and accountability guidelines. This, the Committee believes, is a step in the right direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third matter is environmental reviews. The Committee would like to reiterate what has been a longstanding practice. Any assessment of the environmental impact of a proposal should be completed before a proposal is referred to the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to pay tribute to all members of the previous Committee who worked very hard throughout 1989. Senator Glen Sheil and Mr John Mountford have left the Parliament and the Committee is grateful for their support during their service on the Committee. George Gear, the honourable member for Canning, and Bob Halverson, the honourable member for Casey, also were members of the Committee and are now Whips of their respective parties. Special mention should be made of the former member for Wide Bay, Clarrie Millar, who as vice-chairman of the Committee was an example to us all for his dedication to the work of the Committee. I commend the report to the Senate.

         —I would like to take this opportunity to discuss a number of matters that arose during the recess between when this chamber met in June and when it met again in August. I would like to talk about some of the issues that were raised with me when I travelled around Queensland during that time. In particular, I want to mention the number of young people to whom I spoke in schools throughout Queensland, starting with my old school-the Southport School on the Gold Coast-and ranging through a number of schools in places such as Cairns, Charters Towers, Rockhampton, smaller schools in places such as Homestead and Prairie and other schools in Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek, Cloncurry, Mount Isa and Kenilworth.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of the things school children continually said to me as I travelled around was that they were gravely concerned that the present parliamentarians did not seem to answer the concerns of many people of their generation and, of course, my generation. I think it is very sad that we have a large number of young Australians-Australians who will be the future leaders of this country-who do not believe that the parliamentary process answers the needs of the people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason we are sent to this place is to represent our States and the people who make up those States. One of the things I say to young people as I travel around is that it is up to them to make the most use of the processes that exist, which means that there must be more interaction and that the interaction must run in both ways. It must not just be parliamentarians going to the electorate and pushing their views to the people; it must also be a process by which the people can have access to their parliamentarians and the parliamentarians represent them here in Canberra and here in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is very important that we as senators listen to what is said. It is very easy in this chamber for us to feel that we are somehow special, that we are somehow sequestered from the rest of Australia and that because we do not have a constituency per se, as exists with the House of Representatives, we can ignore the wishes of the people. One thing that is very obvious from my travels around Queensland is that this is not the role that the people see us as having to play. They see us as a very important link in the processes in Canberra and they see us as extra local members.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was very pleased to have the opportunity to visit schools and to talk to school students about what we do here in Canberra, because there is a great lack of understanding among our school students of what happens and many of them feel very alienated by the processes, by the media, by the whole aura of parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very fitting and proper that parliament is conducted in a manner that displays decorum. It is very fitting and proper that the deliberations of the Senate are solemn deliberations, because we are concerned with the national interest. It is not proper, however, that we should use this opportunity to divorce ourselves from the people. We should remain approachable and accountable and should always have very firmly in our sights an obligation to be so. That involves, therefore, an obligation to be willing to talk to people about the decisions we make.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the great difficulties in this age of modern media is that the media necessarily simplifies many of the things we say. We in the chamber all know how complex many issues are; how many hours or days or weeks of deliberation and careful thought we give to these matters before we come into the chamber. Sometimes it can be very disappointing that all of that careful thought and careful consideration is condensed into one or two lines of newsprint at the very best. Therefore, I think it is very important that we go out to the electorate and give people the opportunity to ask us questions and to seek from us information and elucidation over the decisions that we make here in Canberra.

        The other thing that is important in travelling around the electorate is talking to people and finding out what is of concern to them. It is very easy while we sit in Canberra, in our comfortable chairs behind our big desks, for us to get too wrapped up in the processes of Canberra, to become Canberra-ised. Of course, as far as the electorate is concerned, many of the matters that may seem personally or politically important to us are unimportant. The people have a different view of what is happening in Australia and of what is of concern to them.

        I take this opportunity to raise a number of the issues that were brought to me by ordinary people in Queensland and which I said I would raise here in our national capital. Obviously, one of the most important issues for the people of Queensland-an issue that was raised first in Toowoomba but also in Longreach, Winton, Muttaburra, Richmond, Rockhampton and Ingham-is the Federal Government proposal to license road transport within this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the points that was made to me by people throughout Queensland-not just in small towns like Muttaburra but in big towns along the coast, separated from Brisbane-is that the Federal Government proposals on road transport and its proposed licence fees for the road transport industry will have disastrous consequences. These proposals will affect not just the many small people in the industry, the battlers who work very hard to take the produce from where it is grown to the markets, the people who work during the nights when we are asleep to take the goods from the capital cities and deliver them to the provincial centres; they will also have a terrible impact on everybody outside the capital cities, not just in Queensland but in many other States, who relies on road transport.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is wholly inequitable, unjust and unfair that small operators, who may have put 10 or 15 years service into the road transport industry, should be pushed out of that industry in the face of Government proposals that will see the licence fees, for example, for a road train operator increase from $5,000 a year to $42,000 a year-fees which the Federal Government expects to be paid up front. It is unacceptable that these many small, hardworking Australian businessmen- because truck drivers are businessmen-should be forced out of their business and their livelihoods. It is unacceptable that their families should have their prosperity, security and happiness jeopardised because of a bureaucratic system that wishes to push these people off the roads for some perceived benefit in putting freight on to rail. I state clearly that we must all recognise that although rail reform is important, one will never make the railway more efficient by making the road network less efficient.
       </para>
       <para>
        A point that was continually raised as I travelled around Queensland is that the Federal Government has the means here and now to do something about the road network if it wants to do so. Every year the Federal Government receives from ordinary Australians-from ordinary motorists, truck drivers and so on-over $6 billion in Federal fuel excise. Yet as I travelled around Queensland the question asked of me over and over again was, `How much money does the Federal Government give us back?'. The answer is a little over $1 billion-$1 billion of the $6 billion that is paid at the bowser is spent on the roads. That is a sad indictment of this Federal Government and of its priorities when we talk about provincial Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that many roads throughout Queensland and provincial Australia are wholly unsatisfactory. Although people in the capital cities may feel some degree of personal dissatisfaction if the pothole outside their driveway is not repaired in one week or two, many people throughout provincial Queensland do not even have a bitumen road in which to develop a pothole. Many of them, at best, have four metres of bitumen which passes as a national highway, and many have to drive hundreds of kilometres every week, to go to town or to schools or to the shops, on dirt roads that are totally unusable in the wet. The consequence is that many people cannot even get from their home to town when it rains. Many of these people are the real underprivileged of this country-the people for whom this Federal Government does not seem to give much consideration. Despite all the talk by the Federal Government about caring for provincial Australia, it is very clear that when it comes down to the real issues in provincial Australia-real issues such as whether the road is there or not or whether one can use it when it rains-the Federal Government has turned its back. Now it comes along with a scheme to raise more and more money in those areas which seem to receive less and less each year.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the statistics handed to my office in the recent recess was that the local government funding in Queensland would increase in money terms by 3.2 per cent this year. Inflation runs at between 6 per cent and 7 per cent in Queensland. The consequence is that many local authorities that rely on Federal Government funding to attempt to maintain their hundreds, or in some cases thousands, of kilometres of road will have a reduced ability to do so. The consequence of this real cut in local government funding in many of the very disadvantaged and underprivileged areas of Australia will be more social dislocation, fewer services or a lower standard of services. This again is a sad indictment of the policies of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I travelled around I also spoke to many wool growers and many horticulturalists and small farmers. As we all know, they too are reeling from the consequences of the last couple of years of this Labor Government. Let me talk, for example, about the problems faced by the navy bean industry and the peanut industry in Kingaroy, Queensland, because these people are on the point of bankruptcy. It is these small farmers who are facing the very real prospect of being forced off their land. It is these small farmers who will bear the brunt of the 51 per cent decline in farm incomes that was highlighted by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in its report but a couple of weeks ago. One of the reasons why they face a declining market and why they face the very real prospect of less money every week to pay the bills to send their kids to school or to pay for the clothes or the shoes that the children need is that the market in Australia is being flooded with cheap imports that are being dumped from overseas, and yet we see no willingness on the part of the Government to face up to the issue of dumping.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last two times, from my understanding, that the Federal Government has used anti-dumping legislation were: firstly, the protection of the vinyl floor covering industry in respect of floor coverings less than one millimetre in depth; and secondly, the protection of the piezoelectronic thermometer industry. Well, I do not pretend to know anything about piezoelectronic thermometers, apart from the fact that they do not grow on trees, and I do not know many people who produce them. But I do know many people who produce peanuts and navy beans and who face the prospect of cheap inferior products being dumped from places such as China, Israel and the United States- a prospect which is going to destroy the livelihood of the producers and their families.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question I ask-this should be of great importance to us all-is what are we going to do for these real Australian battlers? What importance do we place on the survival of rural industries in this country? Are we as a Senate and are we as representatives of the people going to turn our backs on these hard-working battling Australians or are we going to stand up for them and represent them in this place and in the deliberations of this Parliament?
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that if we are going to turn our backs on these small farmers, like this Federal Government has done, then we are failing in our duty as representatives of the people, and we are failing to keep firmly in view the idea that we should have one Australia where people could work together for the greater prosperity of all. If we turn our backs on primary producers, if we turn our backs on provincial Australia, then what really is left of this economy, and what really is left of the Australian vision of a better place for us all? I think the answer to that is a very disappointing view of Australia and a very disappointing future for many young Australians in my generation. I think these are the issues that are very important in Queensland and throughout this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would hope that over the next couple of weeks this Senate will have a greater opportunity to discuss these issues and a number of other issues that I intend to raise in the next few weeks. I would hope that the Government might see fit to pay attention to what the representatives of the people of this country, the representatives of the people of Queensland, have to say on these matters, and I will be looking forward to the response of the Government in seeing some action from them. But at the moment I see very little action at all. Therefore, it gives me a great deal of concern for the future of Queensland, for the future of Australia, and for the future of my generation of young Australians.

         —Honourable senators are aware of the fact that, for two years now, I have been tabling for their consideration examples of what I consider to be malpractice and corrupt practice in Australian banking. I have tabled in excess of 80 such cases. On the last two adjournment opportunities I have returned to flesh out detail in relation to a number of very significant cases. On 24 August on the adjournment I was in the process of dealing with what I termed the saga of Huon Valley Springs Pty Ltd, which, to my way of thinking, was one of the clearest examples that one could get that the Commonwealth Development Bank of this country deliberately stripped a private company of its assets and manipulated it into a position where it was deliberately passed into the hands, through a process of bankruptcy, of an awaiting buyer.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I had neared completion in describing that particular case and I was citing a conversation which occurred on 6 February 1986 between Mr Peter Allen, of Arthur Andersen and Co., who attended at the offices of Huon Valley Springs. He served a letter of notice on behalf of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The notice demanded payment of $525,020.10 within one hour. That notice was nothing more than a sham made in anticipation of a receivership and was the last link in a chain of seizure of the business. I had described each step along the line in that chain of events. Mr Short, who was the financial adviser to Huon Valley Springs, received this notice of demand and passed this comment:
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact that you take over the company as receiver may jeopardise the whole transaction and the leases which form an important part of the company business.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Allen is reported to have said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I will advise the Commonwealth Development Bank to wait to put the company into receivership until the negotiations are finalised one way or the other.
       </para>
       <para>
        The following day the Commonwealth Development Bank appointed Messrs Peter Allen and John Murphy of Arthur Andersen and Co. as receivers of Huon Valley Springs. On 7 February 1986, Messrs Dawson Waldron, acting for Huon Valley Springs, wrote to the Development Bank as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        We note that we have been instructed that the leases which form an integral part of our client's company business may be placed in jeopardy by reason of your appointing a receiver.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Development Bank did not withdraw the receivers. I seek leave to table that letter in support of the statement.

         —The punch line in this whole process is that Evanford Pty Ltd was a wholly owned subsidiary of Durna Pty Ltd and the directors were the same. I referred to these directors in my speech in the adjournment debate of 24 August. The directors of the company were Anthony Joseph Sofia, Dominic Vizzone and Maxwell John Reynolds. On 9 April 1986 ICLE Bank wrote to Durna, Evanford, Sofia, Vizzone and Reynolds referring to `your subsidiary, Evanford Pty Ltd' approving finance from Evanford. The letter provided for ICLE to receive 50 per cent of the trading profits and 50 per cent of the profits on sale of Evanford. I therefore call upon the Attorney-General of Tasmania to forthwith lay charges against Maxwell J. Reynolds for fraud and conspiracy supported by the documents which I have tabled previously and will seek leave to table at the end of my speech. I call upon the Attorney-General of New South Wales to forthwith lay charges against Bruce W. Naghten, James J. Vanner and Kenneth M. Simington for fraud and conspiracy.

        Another of the 80 cases which I have tabled in the Senate is referred to by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia as `the Rigg incident'. That is its term for an incident which I have cited on a number of occasions previously. It has been the subject of correspondence between the managing director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and myself. That correspondence has previously been tabled by former Senator Stone and is available for the perusal of honourable senators.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now propose to expose, to the Australian people, 'the Rigg incident' in detail. I am sad to say that honourable senators have not shown a great deal of interest in it, but many people in the community are very interested in the details. I will do so over a period of two adjournment speeches. I draw Senator Alston's attention to the fact that I will be tabling many documents because the allegations that I am making are very serious and must be supported by the documentary evidence, much of which has been previously tabled by leave.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1982 the bank saw the need to improve its return on foreign currency assets by providing foreign currency lending to Australian customers. I am going back to 1982 and I will describe, step by step, a profit making strategy which was pursued by all Australian banks. It finally led to-in what is known as `the foreign loans fiasco'-the demise of approximately 1,400 Australian businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a bank memorandum from the general manager dated 16 March 1982 entitled `Foreign Currency Lending to Australian Customers', it is stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The subject is considered important for the following reasons:
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) The need to improve our return on foreign currency assets generally. In the study conducted last year . . . comment was made on the rate of return being achieved on our overseas assets-a return somewhat less than our domestic assets . . . there was an evident need to have a greater content of the higher yielding commercial loans on our books . . . our lending should be directed to areas that will give a higher return than is achievable from prime corporate business.
       </para>
       <para>
        What this memorandum is saying is that customers at the bank-I am talking of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia-other than prime corporate business should be targeted by offering foreign currency loans at the highest return achievable by the bank. The new philosophy of banking was beginning to emerge even preceding deregulation-the philosophy of maximising profit even at the expense of customers. We see the beginning of the erosion of the ethos of banking in this country which has progressively got to the stage where we have nothing worse than an outrageous set of circumstances in banking in Australia. Who the customers were, and what the margins were, is explained in the memorandum:
       </para>
       <para>
        This lending should be directed to the small and medium size business area for development, investment and other financing requirements . . . I would see this lending attracting fees and margins a good deal higher than those for existing Australian borrowers . . . fees and margins could be pitched at levels to match or better those applying for domestic bill facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        So here we have the ethos of banking being spelt out in an internal memorandum. It is clearly targeting small business in this country and is beginning to create a foreign borrowing facility to maximise the bank's profits to the detriment of its customers. Domestic bill facilities traditionally carried high interest rates and high fees and margins.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the memorandum is saying is that the bank will offer an expensive facility to customers who do not have the bargaining power to negotiate a better deal. That is naked greed. We have seen a good deal of it from the banking sector in the deregulated banking context since 1984-85.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Rigg, to whom I have referred on a number of occasions in this place, never needed a foreign currency loan; all he needed was the first mortgage finance to build commercial lease premises and a factory at South Nowra. As we shall see, the bank's greed was such that Mr Rigg would be offered a facility calculated to extract every last drop of blood out of his business.

        There was a problem in 1982-the cost of hedging against the exchange risk. The memorandum continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The more contentious risk is, of course, the exchange risk . . . it is now possible to use the hedge market to cover the risk which would mean that all up costs should broadly match the costs of AUD finance.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the cost to the customer of entering a hedged foreign currency loan was about the same as entering into a domestic loan. Accordingly the bank had a product it could not sell. The bank's greed was to overcome this. I will be seeking leave to table a memorandum.
       </para>
       <para>
        How was the bank to induce customers to accept fees and margins for foreign currency loans which were pitched at levels to match those applying for domestic bill facilities? It is simple. The foreign currency loans were to be offered to the targeted customers in conjunction with a domestic bill facility. That ploy was explained in a bank memorandum by Messrs B. Moran and J. L. Edwards, dated 15 April 1982, entitled `Foreign Currency Loans to Australian Borrowers':
       </para>
       <para>
        When considering applications for existing or prospective customers . . . it is recommended that the following course of action be introduced immediately:
       </para>
       <para>
        * All applications of $250,000 or more for bill facilities to assist with capital expenditure (working or otherwise) are to be approved . . . as a `bills discount/offshore finance facility'.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The CTB will have the option to exercise either facility at each rollover . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That is worth marking well. The bank was to decide, upon its own motion, whether to adopt the foreign currency loan on any roll-over of the domestic bill facility. I will be seeking leave to table a memorandum from which I have just quoted.
       </para>
       <para>
        How is the bank to overcome the problem of hedging costs? This, also, was simple-make the customer wear the exchange risk. That ploy was explained as follows in a bank memorandum by Messrs J. O'Brien, dated 6 May 1982, entitled, `Foreign Currency Facilities for Australian Customers':
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it is highly unlikely clients would readily accept foreign currency loans . . . unless they and the CTB are prepared to allow the facility to proceed on an unhedged basis. The statement is regularly made that the cost of hedged foreign currency loans is approximately equal to the cost of borrowing funds in Australia . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I will be seeking leave to table that memorandum. The bank left no doubt that it would not, itself, accept the exchange risk. Added to a bank memorandum of Mr J. B. Gledhill, dated 6 May 1982, entitled, `Senior Managers Comments', is a handwritten note as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        I assume it is intended that in no circumstances will the CTB itself accept any exchange risk in respect of overseas borrowings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The response was yes, also written in the margin of the memorandum. I will be seeking leave to table that memorandum. Accordingly, if Mr Rigg had applied to the bank for finance in June 1982 he would have been provided with: (a) a bills discount facility with offshore finance options; (b) the option, to be exercised at the bank's discretion, upon any roll-over of a bank facility; (c) fees and margins to be the same as for the bill facility and the offshore finance; (d) Rigg to accept the exchange risk; (e) Rigg to pay withholding tax on interest payments to offshore lenders.
       </para>
       <para>
        The mechanics applicable to the facility would have been, first of all, that Mr Rigg would sign a bill, leaving the identity of the acceptor of the bill blank. Secondly, the bank would negotiate the bill to an independent dealer on an open money market; the dealer's name would be inserted on the bill as acceptor; the dealer would purchase the bill at a discount, representing interest payable to the dealer; and the bank would credit the discount amount to Mr Rigg's account. I am describing precisely the procedure that was used in approximately 1,400 such negotiated offshore loans.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, upon the maturity of the bill the bank would pay the full face value of the bill to the dealer and debit that amount to Mr Rigg's account. For providing that service, the bank would charge its usual fees and margins. The bank would not act as lender to Mr Rigg and would be in no way exposed. Fourthly, the bill could then be rolled over, or a foreign currency loan substituted. In the latter case, the bank would negotiate with an offshore financier to lend to Mr Rigg direct the foreign currency equivalent necessary to pay out the discounted bill facility. Fifthly, Mr Rigg would pay periodic instalments of interest in the foreign currency to the offshore financier, less withholding tax. Sixthly, any downward movement of the Australian dollar against the foreign currency would be a loss to Mr Rigg, payable to the offshore financier.
       </para>
       <para>
        Seventhly, any upward movement of the Australian dollar against the foreign currency would be a profit to Mr Rigg, payable by the offshore financier. By providing that service, the bank would charge its usual fee and margins and would not act as lender to Mr Rigg.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, upon maturity of the foreign loan, Mr Rigg might pay out the loan by way of a fresh bill facility from the bank, for the Australian dollar equivalent necessary to discharge the loan.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bills discount facility with offshore finance options would have been in accordance with the normal market practice. However, that facility would deny the bank the substantial profits it could earn by going behind market practice and inducing customers to enter into sham transactions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of the bills discount facility, all the bank had to do was discount the bill to itself, inserting its own name as acceptor of the bill. The bill would be kept at the customer's branch of the bank and not negotiated on the open money market. The bank's money market dealers would fix the interest rate and the bank would lend the money on the bill to the customer. In this way, the bank would receive the interest that would otherwise be payable to the independent dealer and would receive its usual fees and margins as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        The offshore finance options would have been abandoned altogether. The bank would want to lend to the customer itself but would not accept the exchange risk of borrowing the foreign currency to on-sell to its customer. Accordingly, the bank would have to acquire the foreign currency by way of a currency swap, thereby incurring no exchange risk itself. The bank would then lend to the customer in Australian dollars but induce the customer to enter a forward exchange contract in the foreign currency acquired pursuant to the swap. Accordingly, the bank would `simulate' a foreign currency loan and `simulate' the exchange rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this way the bank would receive the interest that would otherwise be payable to the offshore financier, would receive its usual fees and margins and would gain a potentially enormous profit from the downward movement of the Australian dollar against foreign currency. In reality, of course, there was no exchange risk for the customer, only a contractual pretence calculated to enhance the profits of the bank at the expense of the customer. Both of these sham transactions, if adopted by the bank, would, of course, be fraudulent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concept of currency swaps and simulated foreign currency loans were known to the bank in mid-1984. A bank memorandum from International Division, Accounting Department, dated 13 June 1984, entitled ,`Australian Interest Withholding Tax' provided as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . avenues being used in the market to obtain withholding tax free funds include-
       </para>
       <para>
        * Simulated or synthetic foreign currency loans, i.e. an AUD loan is obtained from an Australian resident (eg the CTB) and a hedge contract simultaneously taken out to `create' a USD liability. The USD equivalent of the AUD loan and interest are effectively sold forward. Obviously, this technique could also be used to create liabilities in other currencies as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        * Currency swap arrangements . . . These transactions are, in effect, the same as simulated/synthetic loans except that physical currency is produced . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I will be seeking leave to table the memorandum from which I have just quoted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The loan is described as `synthetic'-that is, artificial. The word `create' is in inverted commas, meaning that no actual United States dollar liability was created at all. In addition, no physical currency is produced. What that all adds up to is that a simulated foreign currency loan option is a sham.
       </para>
       <para>
        The adoption of the currency swap technique avoids any exchange risk in respect of a simulated foreign currency loan. A technical manual entitled, Foreign Exchange in Practice, relied upon by the bank, provides as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        8.5 Currency swaps provide a powerful tool for manipulating cross currency cash flows without creating a net exchange position.
       </para>
       <para>
        The applications of swaps include:
       </para>
       <para>
        2) Simulated foreign currency loans.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now quote from paragraph 8.10, under the heading, `Simulated Foreign Currency Loans':
       </para>
       <para>
        Currency swaps provide a means of generating liquidity. A borrower may wish to borrow HK$ for 3 months. Perhaps he has no facility in place through which he can access either the local HK$ or euro HK$ money markets. Provided he can borrow another currency, say US$, and enter into a US$/HK$ swap he has the means to generate the HK$ required. Generating liquidity in one currency by borrowing another currency and entering into a currency swap is known as a Simulated Loan.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am still quoting from the handbook-the handbook from which people learn how to perform these simulated sham loans. An example is given as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Step 1: borrow US$ for 3 months
       </para>
       <para>
        Step 2: Sell US$ and buy HK$ spot
       </para>
       <para>
        Buy US$ and sell HK$ 3 months forward
       </para>
       <para>
        The cash flows are equivalent to borrowing HK$ for 3 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        Step 2 represents a swap. The borrower has borrowed US$ and swapped them into HK$.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is nothing sham about this type of transaction. It is perfectly legitimate. The borrower receives actual foreign currency without incurring any exchange risk. As we shall see, this is certainly not what the bank had in mind for its customers.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that the bank had the opportunity of providing an exchange risk free facility to its customers but did not do so. It is equally clear that the bank requires its customers to accept the exchange risk, even if it was a sham. A bank memorandum by Mr J. M. McAnary, dated 28 June 1984 and entitled `Simulated Currency Loans' provided that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a simulated currency loan enables a borrower to maintain his actual borrowing in one currency (eg AUD) but through a forward exchange contract can `simulate' a liability in another currency (eg CHF)-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, Swiss francs-
       </para>
       <para>
        and effectively obtain the benefit of the lower interest rate of that currency . . . The overall result (in terms of overall cost and foreign currency risk exposure) will normally be the same as an outright borrowing in the other currency involved . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I will seek leave to table that memorandum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question arises: Why did the bank insist upon customers accepting an exchange risk? A bank memorandum from Corporate Banking Division, dated July 1984 and entitled `Simulated Currency Loans' contains an example. I emphasise to the Senate that I am quoting from internal bank documents that spell out this ethos and the methodology.

I am doing so, hopefully, in the public interest. I will return to this task of exploring the Rigg incident at the next available adjournment opportunity.

         —Leave is not granted. I wish to address my remarks to Senator McLean in particular. I think it is fair to say that in the last couple of years Senator McLean has developed quite a considerable expertise in translating a lot of jargon in the commercial banking area into some language that most of us can understand. He has done that in the process of developing what seems, in many respects, to be an elaborate conspiracy theory suggesting that at least one bank has been in the business of forcing people to the wall through depriving them of access to funds and, in general terms, acting in bad faith.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Those are very serious allegations. As I understand it, until today he has not gone so far as to suggest under cover of privilege that certain persons ought to be prosecuted. Having done that, he has put his allegations into another league altogether. It seems that his fanaticism has taken him to the point where he no longer is terribly concerned about due process. But we in the Senate ought to be particularly vigilant to ensure that fanatics do not rule the day.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regard as a gross invasion of privacy in many respects the suggestion that one can come in here and, on the basis of the end somehow justifying the means, table documents which might severely prejudice any further inquiry. It certainly shows a cavalier disregard for the proper formalities. Most importantly, it is likely to prejudice a fair trial.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not impressed by the fact that Senator McLean chose not to show the documents either to our side of the chamber or, I believe, to the Government side. He has been around long enough to know the rules. On two occasions when he rose to seek leave he proceeded as though it were simply a matter of course that he would be doing certain things. He showed no remorse whatsoever. To me that is evidence of the fact that his judgment has been overtaken by his enthusiasm.
       </para>
       <para>
        I view the matter very seriously. I do not wish to inhibit him from investigating these matters. It may well be that there is a good deal of substance to some of the allegations, but they are very serious matters. Alleging criminal fraud is not alleging negligence; Senator McLean is suggesting that people ought to be behind bars. If that is his position, he should not grandstand on it; he should bring the matters to the attention of the authorities. If there is sensitive correspondence, which he has very fleetingly shown to me, that consists of legal documentation, it is absolutely impossible for us to make judgments about how significant that might be, let alone how crucial it might be, in justifying the bringing of proceedings. It might also be just as crucial in a judge ruling that it is not possible to obtain a fair trial because of the publicity attached to the allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        If Senator McLean is simply allowed to wave documents around in this way, McCarthyism is alive and well in Australia. The Senate should not condone those sorts of efforts to bypass the legal system. I will certainly insist that we continue to deny leave to table documents when they are brought forward in the manner in which these were.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not troubled by the fact that in the past some documents have been allowed to be tabled in this manner, and I am in no position to judge how significant they were vis-a-vis the ones that were put forward today. But to make the sorts of serious allegations that Senator McLean has made is in itself something that needs to be scrutinised very carefully indeed. Senator McLean has had a full half-hour to make all sorts of statements and perhaps even unwittingly to denigrate people in the process. He is certainly very enthusiastic about developing a conspiracy theory. He ought to stand back and just think about where he is taking the whole issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Out there in the sticks it might be pretty popular stuff to be beating banks around the head. From time to time everyone from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) down seems to have a field day doing it. I have no doubt that Senator McLean thinks that he has developed a lot of mileage out of turning this into a long suit. But that is no excuse for ignoring the proper processes of the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one gets to the point where one is making not just general allegations but specific allegations against particular individuals, one has to tread very carefully indeed. I hope that, as a result of the refusal to grant leave, Senator McLean will think very carefully in the future about just what rules he wants to see applying to the way in which people are treated by the courts and by the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats are the ones who wax eloquent about privacy; they are the ones who will go to the wall on the tax file number; they are the ones screaming and yelling about how people are being downtrodden by big bad government. Yet today we have a classic example of an honourable senator allowing himself to be ruled by the headlines that he can see down the track. I do not accept for one moment that that is the proper way in which allegations ought to be aired. There are very well established procedures in this country. Australia has one of the best legal systems in the world. If Senator McLean is fair dinkum about wanting these matters to be investigated and individuals brought to justice, he ought to proceed in the proper way.

I then asked a series of questions which confirmed to me progressively that there was a problem. I sought a lot of legal advice on how to approach this matter.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is incumbent on Senator Vallentine to declare that neither she nor any of her supporters sought in any way to influence Australian servicemen posted to the Gulf from performing their duties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier in the release Senator MacGibbon said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite proper for a senator to publicly express an opinion on any matter of public importance.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It was quite a different matter, particularly for a member of parliament, to attempt to persuade someone to break the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        I quite gladly now respond to the challenge from Senator MacGibbon. The truth of the matter is that I had nothing to do with the decision of Terry Jones to leave HMAS Adelaide on Tuesday, 21 August. That is the day he left the ship. That is the day on which he was in Perth for final leave. The ship sailed from Stirling naval base on Wednesday, 22 August. I want to put very clearly on the Senate record the sequence of events which flowed on from there.
       </para>
       <para>
        Terry Jones phoned me-he was totally unknown to me; I had no idea of his identity-on Sunday, 26 August, to say that he was handing himself to the Royal Australian Navy the following day. That was precisely five days after he had left the ship and four days after it had sailed. He told me about his decision and to me it was very clear that he was committed to taking a decision which was obviously going to cost him quite a lot but that he was convinced that he should not be part of the Australian deployment to the Gulf region. I sounded him out and heard his story from him, and it was left at that. I could have gone to the media immediately. I did not do that because I was concerned that whatever was made public from Terry Jones was in his words. The first long conversation I had with him occurred on Sunday, 26 August. At that stage he was in Coffs Harbour. He had gone by bus across the country to rejoin his family.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then phoned me again on Tuesday, 28 August, having handed himself in to the Navy the day before. It is very important to note that I did not say anything about this to the media. It was a hot story and, had I had chosen to, I could have. But I respected the fact that this was Terry Jones's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that morning of Tuesday, 28 August, Terry Jones said, `I want to go public on this issue. Can you help me put out a media statement? Can you arrange some legal advice?', because the Navy had told him that he could have independent legal counsel. I advised him to go away for an hour or so and write down exactly what he wanted to say in the statement. I told him that it was very important for the words to be his, not mine or from my office. Terry Jones went away and subsequently phoned my office in Perth an hour or so later and read the statement that he wanted to put out to the media. I now read it to the Senate. A preliminary parts of the statement was prepared by my office indicating who Terry Jones was and putting it into context. The following parts of the statement are his words:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am prepared to die to defend my country but not to protect United States oil lines. The largest insult I felt personally in the whole affair was turning on the television last Tuesday night and seeing Mr Bush on the international media refusing to discuss what negotiations were going on (over Iraq) while he was on holidays.
       </para>
       <para>
        Up until this point I had no intention of jumping ship but after seeing one of the parties responsible for it all on holidays playing golf while committing thousands of young lives including those of Australians-it was enough for me to decide not to be part of the killing, knowing that I might have killed innocent people for nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not a coward and I would be prepared to die for my country but I am taking a political stand because this is not our war-we are just following the Americans.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our ships are inadequately prepared and are designed for anti-submarine warfare which is not a front line defence.

       <para>
        Our chemical warfare equipment is obsolete and probably dates back to the Vietnam period. Even our instructors expressed doubt about the effectiveness of this equipment in the high temperatures and conditions of the Gulf which was terrible for our morale.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week Defence Minister Robert Ray said Navy personnel were not pressured or forced to go to the Gulf. I dispute this comment because the ships crews were not given the option of not going.
       </para>
       <para>
        I approached my immediate superior and explained my concerns about going to the Gulf and I was told that I would not have the option of leaving.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am highly concerned about the limited information given to the families of naval personnel because of the rapid deployment which gave us little time for proper preparation or goodbyes.
       </para>
       <para>
        During naval training, recruits are given religious education and they have the commandment `thou shalt not kill' instilled in them. The Australian Navy is contradicting the belief that the Defence Force is a God believing outfit because they answer the call to America not God.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, if the navy is a defence force why did we commit to the Gulf region at the request of the Americans without UN approval in the first place. That is not defence.
       </para>
       <para>
        Who gave the Americans and the British the right to impose their ways of life on others and to get Australian's to die for it?
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are Terry Jones's own words. There has been a lot of community support for Terry Jones. There has been some criticism which he also expected but he has had a great deal of community support around the country from people who question the Australian Government's commitment to the Gulf. He expected action to be taken against him by the Navy for being absent without leave. He has reiterated that to me on several occasions. He now awaits the outcome of the internal hearing which was conducted last week. Tomorrow he will be told whether he faces a court martial or disciplinary action as a result of this internal naval inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I point out that there is a great dilemma for the Navy in all of this because it used the term `conscientious objector' to apply to another unnamed seaman from the HMAS Success who also refused to go to the Gulf for much the same reasons as Terry Jones. The Navy used the term `conscientious objector'. I refer to an article from the Australian dated 28 August 1990:
       </para>
       <para>
        A conscientious objector on HMAS Success and two `non-volunteers' on HMAS Adelaide were excused from sailing with the Australian naval contingent to the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further eight seamen did not sail as a result of their `commander's discretion', the navy's director of public information, Commander Paddy Hodgman, said.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have never had an elaboration from the Navy about that Commander's discretion but it could have covered quite a range of contingencies, such as very ill family members. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, told Federal Parliament on Friday-
       </para>
       <para>
        this was in response to a question I asked-
       </para>
       <para>
        that one sailor had deserted the Gulf Task Force.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Defence ought to know better than to use that word `deserter' because technically-it may come as a surprise to some people-Australia is not at war. War has not been declared. So Terry Jones was absent without leave but he is not a deserter. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Ray emphasised in answering a question by the Independent Senator Jo Vallentine that `not one person was forced to go on the ships'. The conscientious objector will not face charges arising from his request to not serve in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the unnamed seaman from the HMAS Success. In the article, Commander Hodgman is quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        His objection was about the particular operation . . .-
       </para>
       <para>
        this is where the Navy has got itself into a real dilemma over its use of this term-
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously a conscientious objector does not join a volunteer Navy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article goes on to quote Commander Hodgman as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        He will face no action but would probably want to consider how he felt about remaining in the service.
       </para>
       <para>
        I take that point. Terry Jones knows that he would be due for some disciplinary action for having gone absent without leave but it is very important to understand that the Navy has given this status of conscientious objector to a seaman from HMAS Success. In the case of Terry Jones the Navy has to be seen as being fair. It has to decide whether or not it will use this definition of conscientious objector. Yesterday, evidently the Navy decided that it would not use that terminology, that it did not acknowledge it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Navy cannot have one rule for one person who has objected to go to the Gulf for political reasons and a different rule for another who has objected to go to the Gulf for very similar reasons. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald today states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Commander Paddy Hodgman . . . said the Navy had no place for volunteer sailors who wish to be conscientious objectors and excused from overseas assignments . . . on the grounds that they were opposed for political reasons.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true-and I quote from a story by Tony Hewett in the Sydney Morning Herald today-that the Navy would appear to contradict the previously expressed views of the Minister. This also has widespread implications in the case of Leading Seaman Terry Jones who left the Adelaide because he was opposed to the particular engagement.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true historically that the term `conscientious objector' has been associated with those who refused to participate in compulsory military service. So there is a difference between young Australians who refused to serve in Vietnam because they were conscripts and this case of Leading Seaman Terry Jones and the other unnamed seaman who volunteered for service in the Navy.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, it is important to point out that in the last generation the term `conscientious objector' has come to have a wider meaning and to include individuals in the armed services of various countries who object to particular engagements. In other words, there is a selective conscientious objection to a particular engagement. I want to give two examples.

        In South Africa there were many whites-and they are the only ones who are volunteers in the South African armed forces-who refused to do service in black townships in South Africa because they did not want to be used as policemen in their own country and who also refused to do service in Namibia and Angola. Just like Terry Jones, they claimed that they would fight to defend their own country but would not engage in non-defensive military expeditions in other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also the example of the British troops in Northern Ireland who refused to do service and claimed conscientious objector status. And they have been granted conscientious objector status. They did not want to be used as policemen in their own country. They could make an objection to their commanding officers that they would prefer not to be engaged in a particular deployment. That has been the more recent use of the term `conscientious objector'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Navy cannot have it both ways. It must clear up what it means and it has to be seen to be acting fairly. This unnamed seaman is not going to be charged. Terry Jones is going to be charged. He expected to be, of course, because he did go absent without leave, as I said.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also important to note that there are American servicemen who are refusing this deployment and who have appealed for conscientious objector status. One of these is Jeff Paterson, a US marine, and I quote from his statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        I cannot and will not be a pawn in the US's power play for profits and oil in the Middle east. I will resist my scheduled departure by immediately filing for conscientious objector status and physically refusing to board the plane.

There have been many Iraqis who have refused to go and fire on their brother Arabs. Some officers refused to take part in the invasion of Kuwait. So it happened on the other side as well. Many of them, unfortunately, were executed. Thank goodness we do not go to quite those lengths. But the fact remains that there is disquiet on all sides of this engagement and the term of selective conscientious objection is one which has to be taken seriously and addressed by the Navy.

He and Ian Alexander, the member for Perth, are two elected representatives of the Labor Party in Western Australia who have had the guts to speak out about this decision.

        I want to quote from the resolution of the State executive meeting of the Labor Party on Monday, 27 August 1990. It is important that I quote the whole resolution, because to quote selectively from it might give an impression that is not the total view that was intended by the mover of the motion. The motion, which is headed, `Crisis in the Middle East', reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        That the State Executive, in asserting that the invocation of Article 51 of the UN Charter allowing nations to aid others in case of attack is an insufficient and dangerous justification for military enforcement of the UN Security Council trade embargo,
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) condemns unequivocally the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the taking hostage of foreign nationals to use as human shields;
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) expresses its strong concern about the manner in which the Federal Government decision to commit naval forces to the Persian Gulf was made without consultation with the full Cabinet, the FPLP Caucus or the Leader of the Opposition;
       </para>
       <para>
        (3) insists that Australia's present commitment of three warships not be committed to any military action beyond the provisions of UN 665 (1990), and that no further military commitment to the Middle East of any kind be considered until and unless military command of all forces is in the exclusive hands of the UN Military Staff Committee under Article 47 of the UN Charter; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (4) in the event of any military action by any element of the multinational force before the application of Article 47 and beyond the provisions of UN resolution 665 (1990), calls upon the Federal Government to rescind its present and any subsequent decisions to commit Australian military forces to the Middle East.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend Frank Donovan for putting forward that motion and for the strong position that he and Ian Alexander have taken. I do not know whether other members of the Labor Party-elected representatives in other States-have taken a similar strong stand but I do applaud them for doing so. I know that in Caucus and in private many members of the Left in particular have expressed angst about this particular decision. But I do wish that they would speak out about this decision of the Prime Minister as they are prepared to speak out on privatisation and other issues. They are prepared to do battle with the Prime Minister and senior Ministers on some issues but I cannot understand the deafening silence on this one.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was also agreed at the Caucus meeting that there would be full consultation before any further decision was made for extra deployment in the Gulf region. Yet we heard the Minister for Defence in this chamber on Tuesday admit that, yes, a small force of technical support people had gone to the Gulf region and that, yes, a hospital team had also gone to the Gulf region. So what we are seeing is a gradual escalation of the Australian contribution, again without consultation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, I believe that the Minister's office did not even have notice or consultation, although the Minister says that he was consulted. I have had this on authority from people who telephoned his office to ask about this particular deployment of ground support in the Gulf region. People volunteered to a journalist who phoned up, `Yes, we know all about everything. We are up to date with everything. We have had a full briefing. What is it you want to know?'. When the journalist asked the question about this ground support deployment there was a stunned silence at the other end of the telephone line.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time, the Prime Minister's office has said that this is purely administrative so there was no political decision involved. That is tantamount to saying that there had been no consultation. We have to get these matters cleared up. We have to ask, `What will be next? Will there be further deployment?'. I asked a question of the Minister on Tuesday and I am satisfied with his answer as of Tuesday. But it seems that that same question would need to be asked at every moment of every day, because we have no confirmation and I do not trust any assurance that has been given about Australia's deployment to the Middle East not being increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time we have George Bush seeking ground support from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and other allied countries. He is talking about a permanent force in the Gulf region to maintain oil supplies for the West. It has often been said that the first casualty of war is truth. Perhaps the same could be said of preparations for war. I do not like the way that the gradual escalation of Australian forces is continuing in that direction. I think it is a very dangerous situation for Australia to have got itself into.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not see that the Prime Minister is about to withdraw those forces from the Gulf because the President of the United States would not like it. It would seem as though Australia was losing face in the international community. But it is far from the rest of the world against the Iraqi forces. Although the Soviet Union has supported the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations (UN) -which I would also support, with the exception of sanctions in regard to humanitarian and medical aid-it has stopped short of committing any military force to the region. That is what President Bush hoped to get out of Mikhail Gorbachev and he failed to do so. So we cannot say that it is the rest of the world militarily lined up against Saddam Hussein. Perhaps a saving grace in all of this is that we may stop short of a war in the Middle East. There is room for negotiation and for consultation, and that is what we need to be engaging in.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will not repeat my original opposition to the Australian deployment. I think that is well known, United Nations resolution 665 notwithstanding. I believe that the UN Security Council was manipulated and that this was an attempt after the event to secure legitimacy for what had already happened. Resolution 665 is not a call to arms. The emphasis is still on diplomacy and that is the way we should be going.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a great opportunity for Australia to suggest a mediated settlement to this dispute. If Australia under the guidance of our Foreign Minister could get the Cambodian four warring factions together to work out a mediated settlement under the guidelines of the UN and under UN monitoring-and he deserves full congratulations for having done that, as does our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Mr Mike Costello in particular-I challenge the Foreign Minister to put forward an Australian plan which would involve a negotiated settlement between the Arab League and the United Nations: for the Arab League and the UN to supervise the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and to monitor the return of an elected government in Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think that we particularly want to see the return of the petroleum kings, the emirs who do not care much about spreading or sharing their enormous wealth with their subjects. Of course, there is no illusion that Kuwait was any kind of democracy, so we cannot talk about that. But I believe that Australia could put forward a plan for the Arab League and the United Nations to work together towards a mediated settlement, to supervise the Iraqi withdrawal and to monitor the return of an elected government in Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is far too much at risk in either the war scenario or the permanent forces scenario in the Gulf to maintain the oil lines. Neither scenario will settle the longstanding and deeply felt disputes in the region. A negotiated settlement is indeed the only longstanding settlement which will be satisfactory on a global and permanent basis. I would like to quote Richard Leaver on this first major postwar dispute and its handling. This is the first time that there has been a massive international crisis since the Cold War could be considered over. I quote from Richard Leaver writing in the Australian Financial Review of 6 September 1990:
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact remains that the first crisis of the post Cold War era is essentially being `solved' through the sort of heavy unilateralism that was a primary characteristic of the Cold War era.
       </para>
       <para>
        The heritage of our Labor Government is made of better stuff. It includes a distinguished effort by Evatt to redress inequalities of power within the UN.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is therefore particularly disappointing that the Hawke Government has chosen `good American citizenship' in preference to the `good international citizenship' . . .

This is the spirit of free enterprise working. I congratulate them on their orderly and progressive proposal to this Parliament. The way they have conducted themselves has been beyond reproach.

        Today I want to address a problem that arises in the aftermath of some of the World Heritage areas decisions and which in the north Queensland area has affected the brothers of the people demonstrating outside. What do we say to a group of small businessmen who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars by investing in the footsteps of the Federal Government? What do we say to a community whose survival depends on the Government's honouring its commitment to see it safely through a time of great and traumatic change directly caused by an Act of Parliament? Finally, what do we say to the people of Ravenshoe who were told time and again that no-one would be disadvantaged by World Heritage listing?
       </para>
       <para>
        The compensation package required as a result of World Heritage listing of Queensland's wet tropics has been nothing more than a showbag of toys, tricks and gimmicks designed to give temporary short term relief from the hardships imposed by World Heritage listing. This $75m package was full of promises of plantations, tourism and plenty of work for all. In reality, it has provided some short term local council work. I see that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia (Senator Collins) has now entered the chamber and I welcome his participation in this debate. This situation has resulted in people having to do menial work, tidying up the streets, and painting and cleaning toilets, because that is all the work that is offered.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most significant single plank of the compensation package was the financial assistance to be rendered to the Ravens- hoe mill. The Commonwealth agreed to pay millions of dollars to the mill to enable it to be retooled to cope with non-rainforest timbers, thus ensuring its continued viability. The Ravenshoe mill has been the economic focal point of the town and the town's biggest employer. Not only has it provided steady employment for 48 people, but the retooling program has given a much needed boost to the fortunes of Ravenshoe's small businesses, which were suffering as a result of World Heritage listing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The town was knocked for six by the cessation of logging. The social and economic disruptions were severe. The only thing that kept hope alive in Ravenshoe was the future of the Associated Plywoods Sales Pty Ltd (APS) timber mill, as assured by the Government. `Securing the future of Ravenshoe' was how the then Minister, Senator Richardson, described it in a statement in April 1988. However, if all our futures were dependent on the ability of the Minister to follow through on his pledges, we would be paying very high life insurance premiums. No wonder pensioners are concerned and suspicious when they are told by the same Minister that no-one will be worse off under Budget changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        In north Queensland the current situation is that the Ravenshoe mill is in the hands of receivers and has been since April of this year. The mill owes local townspeople $220,000, which is a considerable amount of money for a small town. It owes Far North Queensland some $500,000 overall. In addition, the mill is indebted to the Westpac Banking Corporation for an unspecified amount. The mill has also received significant funding from the Commonwealth. At the time of the receivership, the Commonwealth had provided approximately $7.5m in loan and subsidy assistance. A sum of $4.5m was for an interest-free loan, repayable over 10 years. This loan was provided to the company on 30 June 1988. The sum of an additional $2.125m in the form of a grant was provided to the company in July 1989. That is a significant grant, as I think the Minister would agree. At Question Time I asked the Minister to give us some information on this matter. He has agreed to do so and I thank him for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy President, who would have thought that the company would be put in the hands of a receiver less than 12 months after a government grant of $2m. What has happened since the company received the Government loans and the subsidies? The only thing we know for sure is that the people of Ravenshoe are even worse off now than before the agreement was reached between the Government and the company, Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd.
       </para>
       <para>
        It all seemed such a good idea at the time: Price Waterhouse checked out the company and said it was indeed financially viable; the Commonwealth went ahead in a great fanfare of media releases and back patting and spent millions on this particular project. In reality, the Federal Labor Government wrote a couple of cheques as the easiest way to absolve itself from guilt over the tremendous negative social and economic impact of World Heritage listing on towns like Ravenshoe.
       </para>
       <para>
        The then Minister, Senator Richardson, did a Pontius Pilot, washing his hands of the people of Ravenshoe. But this washing of hands for something that was going dreadfully wrong at the mill was too premature, even though Price Waterhouse had checked the company out.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the Government money the mill started its retooling and bought heavily from local businesses. They ranged from earth moving, transport, engineering, electrical and plumbing businesses to hotels and motels. They believed the Minister when he said that no-one would be disadvantaged under World Heritage listing. They were prepared to extend credit to the Associated Plywoods Sales sawmill during the period of retooling knowing that the Federal Government had thoroughly investigated the project and made an ongoing financial commitment to its future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now these same people, guilty only of showing faith in their government and taking the commitment of a Minister seriously, are carrying significant debts at a time of high bank interest rates. Some businesses will be forced to close. Townspeople report that there has been an increase in unemployment, vandalism, drug abuse and child abuse as the pressures build up on their families.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cannot put it more plainly, Mr Deputy President: the Government and the Minister at the table, Senator Collins, as the Minister responsible for the wet tropics, owe them for disrupting their lives by World Heritage listing the forests that they have lived in and worked in for generations. The Government owes them for replacing the dignity of work with the indignity of welfare handouts. And now the Government also owes them for not keeping a proper eye on a multimillion dollar investment that was supposed to save a whole town. All taxpayers in Australia have the right to know what happened to their money that was poured into this venture. Some $7.5m has gone down the chute. The venture has never given anyone any degree of work or continued prosperity as it was supposed to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is fond of bank bashing, saying that the banks lent money too readily to too many risky ventures without proper analysis and follow-up. The case of Ravenshoe Mill is a classic example of the Government being guilty of the same thing. There was clearly a lack of audited management, a lack of checks and balances, to ensure the proper use and distribution of millions of taxpayers' dollars.

        According to answers given to me in Estimates committee hearings, it was not until the first week in April this year that the Department was alerted to the fact that there were problems with the whole corporate structure, as one officer put it. There are a number of questions that must be answered if the Government is to be accountable on this matter, for $7.5m is a lot of money.
       </para>
       <para>
        Has it been spent according to the terms of the agreement between APS and the Government-that is, for retooling and subsidy payments relating to the employment of timber workers? If not, where has it gone? To the parent company in New South Wales, for instance? What checks and balances were in place to ensure that this amount of taxpayers' money was spent in a financially responsible way and in line with the terms of the agreement made by this Government?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has already admitted that it has no legal obligation to bail out the unsecured Ravenshoe creditors of the APS mill, but is it also a fact that the Government itself has had little chance of recouping any of the $7.5 million it gave to the mill? Is it not also true that the first secured creditor, Westpac, which called in the receivers, is also unlikely to recoup all its money?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also pertinent to ask whether the Sydney parent company, Scotswood Streets Ltd, was fully investigated prior to the multimillion dollar agreement. In addition, there is the matter of the proceeds from two auctions in December last year and as late as June of this year. Prime rainforest timber valued at some $200,000 was sold at these auctions. I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that these moneys did not disappear south but were put towards the Ravenshoe mill operators and/or its creditors.

        While I am sure that the people of Ravenshoe do not need to be reminded of all the empty promises made to them by the politicians among the Labor Party, I think the Government needs to be reminded. Firstly, there was the famous or now infamous statement by Senator Richardson, then Minister for the Environment, that no-one would be disadvantaged by World Heritage listing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subsequent to the company being placed in receivership, the good people of Ravenshoe tried to follow up this promise. They contacted a number of elected representatives explaining the difficulties being caused by the sudden collapse of the mill company. The reply was deafeningly quiet from State and Federal Ministers. I am sure that Bill Eaton, the local State member, did his best. The reply that really took the cake was a telephone call in which the Queensland Treasurer and member for Cairns, Keith Delacy, thanked the people concerned for their low key approach.

        The rewards did not appear to be forthcoming however. The mill receiver-manager, Mr Greg Kelly, of Price Waterhouse was reported in the Australian dated 17 May as saying that the Ravenshoe business community would probably be the last in line to be repaid once a buyer for the operation was found. Furthermore, the article says that Mr Kelly said he had received a commitment from the office of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly, that Federal assistance for the APS operation would continue. However, the last paragraph states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A spokesman for Ms Kelly said yesterday the Federal Government would wait for the outcome of any sale negotiations before considering further assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the people of Ravenshoe are confused, one could not blame them. They are people that have made a living out of cutting trees, not understanding ministerial doubletalk. The Government was making all sorts of ad hoc statements with no thought to the trauma and confusion it was causing the Ravenshoe community and its business plans. The new Minister has more recently chimed in with, and I quote:
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a legal obligation to the existing mill. That is a priority-to keep it open. I shall look into it and see if the business people can be paid. I am very sympathetic to their cause. The first priority is to protect the jobs in the town and I will do whatever is necessary to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was reported in the Cairns Post of 14 June 1990. Then a couple of months later there were two conflicting reports. The Tableland Express, a north Queensland paper, reported in its 11 August edition that the member for Kennedy said that `the community's best prospect was the early sale of the APS sawmill, which explained why Ros Kelly had her Department negotiating with the receiver-manager on conditions for temporary assistance to keep the sawmill operating pending its sale'. On the same date the Courier Mail reported:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Environment Minister, Mrs Kelly, in Cairns to announce a new management authority for the World Heritage area, said yesterday no further funding would be given to the north Queensland town's Associated Plywoods Sales Timber Mill or its creditors.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there are two directly conflicting statements. I ask the Minister to tell the House today the real story. Where is the Government going on this? The Government has behaved in a most amateur and cavalier fashion towards the people of Ravenshoe. I call on Senator Collins to answer the questions I have raised so that we can bring some normality back to the debate and to the lives of the Ravenshoe people. I call on the Government to honour its pledge and recommit itself to the future of Ravenshoe, to a future that does not depend on social welfare but on the dignity of the worker.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind Senator Collins that the people being affected up there are unionists; they are his grassroots. They are not small business people or farmers; they are timber workers in the main; they are people that always support the Labor Party. They are members of the Australian Workers Union and are coming to us for help when they should be turning to the Government members. Those are the people they elect to parliament. They are the people they pay $160 a year to. They are the people they rely on. I ask the Government to look after their interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is fully aware of an offer to purchase the mill since the retooling. A Government commitment is still incomplete. The potential buyers have asked that the Government maintain the level of funding as per its original agreement with the previous company. According to these interested buyers, the mill requires at least another $750,000 to buy new equipment just to raise the capacity of the timber mill to some 25,000 cubic metres and make it viable. Millions more are required to finish the job properly as promised by the Federal Government. It appears that the retooling done so far has not been appropriate or sufficient.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Government were to honour its original funding agreement, which involves the balance of the $13m set aside, the mill could continue operating and become a viable enterprise. It does not require the Government to fork out any additional money than has already been set aside for this project. The potential purchasers merely want the Government to continue its original arrangement. Such an arrangement would ensure that the mill and its assets were not split up for a bank fire sale. It would ensure that the mill would continue to provide employment and business for the small business people in Ravenshoe and the local small business people would have a chance to recoup some of the losses suffered as a result of the collapse of the original company.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think that the interested buyer's request for the Government to honour its original funding commitment is unreasonable, as long as some financial checks are carried out. I ask the Minister to give these matters that I have raised urgent consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that Senator Collins and all members of the Government are concerned about this. But it seems that there have been insufficient checks and balances as to how the money has been handed out. But that, I say to Senator Collins, who I hope will respond, is not the fault of the timber growers, the timber workers or the small business people; it is the Government's fault for not looking after taxpayers' money.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge the Government not to take the stick out on the people that are innocent. They trusted the Government's commitment of $7.5m by way of compensation for the World Heritage area. It is not their fault that the Government did not provide sufficient checks on where that $7.5m was going. On their behalf I ask the Government to admit its mistakes, to pay for them itself, and not pass its sins onto the timber workers and the small business people of Ravenshoe.

         —I want to take just a few minutes of the Senate's time to support what Senator Boswell has said. Senator Boswell has given a very lucid history of the issue here and it is one of great sadness and distress to the people of Ravenshoe. I am sure that the Government understands as well the trauma that has been caused to people who, believing in all good faith that the mill was being supported, gave it credit and then found to their dismay that the mill had gone into receivership.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am aware, as I am sure the Government is, that there is no legal compulsion once the mill goes into receivership for any payments to be made. The Government obviously feels that it has done what it said it would do, but I simply rise to urge upon the Government and Senator Collins a very sympathetic consideration of the requests made by the small business people of Ravenshoe. They have lost an extremely large amount of money. It is not large in absolute terms-it is about $250,000-but for people whose average gross profit is around $20,000 to $40,000 to lose $10,000 or $20,000 in one swoop poses enormous difficulty for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, I am aware that the Government has no legal compulsion to make payments, but I do ask the Minister and the Government to consider an ex gratia payment from the funds which are already available and unexpended for World Heritage compensation. Perhaps an ex gratia, one-off payment could be made to those people who have lost such a lot by advancing money and giving credit to a company and business, a timber mill, that those people thought was being propped up and supported by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to take the matter any further at this stage, Mr Deputy President, but simply add my plea to Senator Collins and the Government to make some special allowance for the people who in this instance have lost so much.

         — I will respond briefly, much to the disgust of the Government Whip, and try not to detain the Senate long because Estimates committees are to meet shortly. However, there is one thing I want to make clear. I am indeed the Minister responsible for advising the Prime Minister on Northern Australia but that is not an executive responsibility I have to this Parliament, which Senator Boswell understands.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I simply make that point because the Minister in this place who is responsible for this issue is Senator Richardson. I have spoken to Senator Richardson in accordance with the undertakings which I gave Senator Boswell this morning and Senator Richardson will, in fact, respond in the Senate at a later stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been provided with some information by the Minister responsible-that is, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mrs Kelly-which I think is important to put on the record in response. The circumstances are: the holding company, Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, which owns the Associated Plywoods Sales Pty Ltd sawmill, is in financial difficulties and that cannot be overstated.
       </para>
       <para>
        A receiver-manager was appointed for the company in April 1990. The financial difficulties were caused by a cash flow in the holding company elsewhere and in fact are not due at all to the World Heritage listing. Indeed I see Opposition senators nodding in agreement that that is understood at this stage. I am not suggesting for one minute that that detracts from the difficult situation that the business people of Ravenshoe are facing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The APS sawmill at Ravenshoe in north Queensland was affected by the listing of the wet tropics of north Queensland as a World Heritage area in 1988. A 10-year, $8m-that is, net present value- assistance agreement was signed on 30 June 1988 between the Commonwealth and the holding company that owns the sawmill to retool it to process plantation timber. The assistance was provided under the structural adjustment package established to mitigate the impact of the World Heritage listing in accordance with undertakings that were given by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The receiver-manager, at his meeting with the Minister on 19 June this year, advised that the sawmill was continuing operations for the foreseeable future and that the business had been advertised for sale as a going concern, as Senator Boswell has said.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister then decided that the best way to assist the community at Ravenshoe was to negotiate temporary assistance to keep the sawmill operating until it was sold. The Minister invited the receiver-manager to negotiate for temporary assistance pending the sale of the APS sawmill as a going concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ravenshoe community has received significant support from the Commonwealth Government to mitigate the impact of World Heritage listing. A number of businesses in Ravenshoe have in fact received income from the sawmill during its retooling phase and the sawmill's work force expanded during this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, approximately $1.2m in addition to that $8m package, has been paid in compensation, directly to Ravenshoe businesses that have been directly and substantially affected by the World Heritage listing. At least 20 retrenched timber industry workers in Ravenshoe have received assistance from the Commonwealth Government under the wet tropics structural adjustment package.
       </para>
       <para>
        In these circumstances the Minister considers that it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth Government to intervene in what has been and is acknowledged to have been a commercial failure by the holding company in its various operations in the State of New South Wales. The best prospect for the future of the Ravenshoe community is for the early sale of the mill. There have been five bids to acquire the mill. In respect of what is a very serious point about the money that is owed to local businesses as a result of the failure of the mill, all I can say is that there are a wide number of figures being debated as to what this is. People in Ravenshoe are claiming that they are owed $500,000. The figure of $250,000 was mentioned in this debate.

They are a matter for resolution, as they would be under any other circumstances, between the unsecured creditors and the receiver-manager of the sawmill.

        On 25 June this year the Minister advised unsecured creditors that they were unlikely to receive their funds until Westpac had recovered its debt. Senator Boswell has raised that point. The Minister said that the Government's first priority was to try to assist the sawmill to continue operating, as I have already said. Nevertheless, the Minister has said that if this fails the Government will do the very best it can to look at ways that the Commonwealth can further assist the businesses and residents of Ravenshoe. That undertaking has been given.

Having had the opportunity for the first time in years to visit that area, although I have been there before, I can say with absolute conviction that in terms of the magnificent asset that those tropical rainforests of north Queensland are-I say this even as a Territorian-it is some of the most spectacularly beautiful country in Australia.

Senator Boswell knows full well that before I came into politics I spent eight years of my life as a researcher with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation working in Kakadu National Park. I have a great commitment, a lifetime commitment, to the preservation of the national parks of this country for future generations because I see them disappearing everywhere I go.

        I simply conclude by saying, again, that those areas that were preserved are magnificent areas that need to be preserved. The decision the Government took was the correct one, and it will be a decision that generations not just of Australians but citizens around the world will thank us for over generations to come.

         —Order! I advised the Senate earlier of the situation regarding industrial problems at the Australian Government Publishing Service and its effect on Hansard. The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has the capacity, as a result of its new computerised system, to produce in-house a number of proof copies of the Daily Hansards.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Initial advice received by the Department is that these copies are protected, in so far as their circulation to senators and members is concerned, by the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        The initial advice suggests that it would be desirable, to cover the eventualities of these copies going outside Parliament House, for a copy of each Daily Hansard to be tabled to give protection.
       </para>
       <para>
        I table the Hansard report of the proceedings of Senate Estimates Committee A for Tuesday, 11 September 1990 and the Hansard reports for the proceedings of the Senate Standing Committees on Industry, Science and Technology and Environment, Recreation and the Arts for Wednesday, 12 September 1990.
