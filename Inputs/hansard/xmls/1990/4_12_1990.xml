        The Government is not alone in this. There have been plenty of similar statements from Opposition spokesmen, plenty of similar statements from economists in the banks who have said to the Government again and again, `Stick to your guns. Maintain your nerve'. Why do they say that? They do so because they knew that when the Opposition was in government it did not do it. It went to water and left us with a $10 billion deficit and 620,000 people unemployed. Opposition members get up trying to make fun, trying to get the very little pleasure they ever get at Question Time, from the fact that we now have a recession in this country.

The fact of the matter is that we now have a recession for a variety of reasons. In so far as the question of a soft landing is concerned, let me just say that throughout 1990, in looking at economic indicators, one can read a variety of very conflicting signals and circumstances about the recession. As the Treasurer has said, it is very difficult to finetune a slowdown in an economy like the Australian economy. He said that on a number of occasions.

         </name>

        <para in-line="1">
         —I think I should point out, firstly, that the facilities at Footscray, Maribyrnong and St Marys are not Defence Department establishments but are, in fact, owned by Australian Defence Industries Ltd (ADI). Honourable senators will recall that ADI is a government-owned company which was established some 18 months ago to take over the operations of the old Office of Defence Production, including munitions, army engineering works, the Garden Island Dockyard and the Australian Government Clothing Factory.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        ADI is run by a board of experienced business people charged with the responsibility of operating modern, efficient and competitive defence industries in this country. While in the final analysis ADI is answerable to its owner, the Government, we do not seek to intervene in the day-to-day commercial decisions of the company. In this context, it is important to understand that the announced closure of the Footscray, Maribyrnong and St Marys facilities, and the subsequent establishment of one, state-of-the-art new ammunition plant, is an ADI proposal based on its commercial assessment of its future. It is not a Government decision. Having said that, I should point out that ADI consulted the Government and the Defence Force prior to last Friday's announcement. It has informed me that the restructuring program will be self-financing and that it will not be asking the Government for money.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government accepts that the ammunition and missile division of ADI is in a particularly difficult position, being faced with both outmoded Second World War facilities and a substantially reduced Defence demand due to our changed and technologically superior training methods. Put bluntly, ADI's options were to do nothing and face the prospect of going broke; close the facilities and have our defence forces totally dependent on imported ammunition; or, finally, to undertake a restructuring to enable the establishment of a cost-efficient industry with export potential.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the Government supports the general direction of the ADI board, including this proposed reorganisation, we have a particular concern for the future well-being of the existing employees who will be affected. In that context, it is now appropriate for negotiations to proceed between ADI and its employees and their unions. Before the Government can give its final seal of approval to the ADI proposal, it will be necessary for us to resolve issues relating to funding of redundancy levels and any borrowing requirements that may be involved. The ADI announcement last Friday was a very important transitional step towards the establishment of a secure and internationally competitive munitions industry in this country and one which we trust can be brought to a successful conclusion.

         —I thank Senator Colston for his question. At the outset I must say that the Government is of course committed to the principle of social justice for all Australians. In regard to that commitment, I ask the Senate to note that the last seven years have seen the greatest gains for Australian women than under any previous administration. A particular aspect of these achievements and these gains in our delivery of social justice to women is seen in the way that the Government has addressed the issue of maternity leave and the question of return to employment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As an employer, we have taken a responsible approach. In order to avoid possible discriminatory action against women returning from maternity leave, the Public Service Board, I think in 1987, changed the administrative practices related to the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act so that women on maternity leave could be unattached from their substantive positions only if they had given their consent to such change. Those arrangements mean that a woman who goes on maternity leave has a choice of returning to the position that she occupied before she left the work force. I also indicate that consideration is being given to amendments to the maternity leave Act to give legislative effect to this requirement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also, on 2 August this year Senator Cook announced a new provision applying to Australian Public Service staff who retire to care for children. As from 2 August, those staff can apply for any vacant job in the Australian Public Service up to six years from the birth of the child involved and, in doing so, can retain their seniority.
       </para>
       <para>
        The policy also applies to government business enterprises and those enterprises which have been covered by the provisions of the Maternity Leave Act 1973 prior to their incorporation, unless the parties agreed otherwise. The Australian Wool Corporation is one of four authorities for which the development of equal employment opportunity programs is included in enabling legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The specific issue that Senator Colston raises relates to the movement by the Australian Wool Corporation of a Ms Margaret Gibbs to another position upon her return from maternity leave. In this case, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission examined the matter and found that Ms Gibbs had been discriminated against. The Wool Corporation has been formally advised of the decision and also of shortcomings in its management procedures. I am advised that the situation arose because of a breakdown in such management procedures and practices. I am further advised that the management will ensure that there will not be a repetition of these events.

         —I understand that the National Party Opposition members have not made up their minds on the rejection of this proposal and an acceptance of the alternative proposal put forward by the Liberals, but the stance of, I understand, the Liberal Opposition members in the upper House in Western Australia is reprehensible and will create such a fracturing of the Australia-wide supervision of corporate activity in Australia that it could easily leave the way open for the type of corporate criminal activity which we are most concerned to combat. The fact is that governments of all political persuasions and all jurisdictions throughout Australia have accepted the need for an Australian Securities Commission operating throughout the various regions of Australia and taking sole responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the companies and securities law of this country.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Not only have all governments, of all political persuasions, come to that conclusion but also it is interesting that in the last few days both the New South Wales and Victorian parliaments, for example, where those governments do not control the upper Houses, have passed this legislation, as required, through all stages, through both Houses, with the support of all political groupings in those particular parliaments. This cannot be said to be a party political or partisan matter. It is one which I think should commend itself to the Liberals in Western Australia in the upper House.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I think the matter is a bit more worrying than even suggested in Senator Beahan's question because when one looks at the situation in Western Australia, what one will have, if the Western Australian Liberals have their way in the upper House, is two sets of regulations and fees required. Any burdens therefore put on the business community of Western Australia will have been put there deliberately and knowingly by the Western Australian Liberal Party, using its numbers in the upper House. It would be an extra regulatory and financial burden on those companies which still wish to register and operate out of Western Australia and also, of course, which wish to operate in other parts of the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that investors, both domestically and from overseas, will look upon Western Australia as trying to retreat behind State borders in a way which raises very real questions about the commitment of Western Australians and the Parliament of Western Australia to the sort of better corporate regulation which is so evidently required here in Australia. The losers, I believe, will be the business community of Western Australia as investors look askance at this particular retreat from an Australia-wide approach. I would also believe that as far as investigations and related activities are concerned, corporate crooks will take advantage of any fracture whatsoever in an Australia-wide approach. This is, of course, a great danger in the proposal put forward by the Liberals in Western Australia.

        One would therefore ask the very question which lies behind the honourable senator's interjection: what lies behind the Western Australian Liberals in not permitting the Australian Securities Commission to act as the Australia-wide administrator of companies and securities law throughout Australia? I would have asked Senator Campbell who, reluctantly-he has indicated his misgivings-is reconciled now to the scheme, to use his good offices with his colleagues in Western Australia in order to try to secure their support for the passage of this legislation. Certainly he would be in good company because Mr Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales, was reported on the radio this morning, as carried by 6WF news.

That notion seems to me to be so far fetched, so far removed from reality, and most importantly so far removed from the national good, that simply to state it, suggests you ought to reject it.

       <para>
        I believe that the Western Australian Liberals should reject this notion that has been put around apparently and has some sympathetic hearers amongst their group. They ought to reject this particular notion which would fracture the enforcement of companies and securities law throughout Australia. I believe that Senator Campbell should use his good offices to ensure that rejection.

That kind of country doctor is certainly a rare and declining breed. The multiple doctor suburban clinic is obviously providing greater attraction to new graduates from our medical schools, particularly, I guess, because of the roster and career paths to specialisation, which are clearer if one is a member of such a suburban practice. So few doctors are choosing to work in the country and I believe that in Senator Herron's State of Queensland, which no doubt prompted Senator Reynolds's question, 200 country doctors are required in order to provide a reasonable service of general practitioner activity throughout that State.

        This is a matter of great concern and the Federal Government has been trying to revive rural health services in many ways. In particular the general practitioner program and support for rural GPs is a part of that Federal Government support. It is intended to build upon the vocational registration arrangements already in place by improving country general practitioners' access to training and support, quality assurance programs and continuing education. It is also intended that the program will encompass the wider range of health service needs of rural communities by including other health care workers, such as surgeons, nurses and physiotherapists, under the national rural health support education and training program. It is anticipated that the program will address all levels of training-undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing-and relevant professional groups and rural users of such medical services will also be consulted.

        I understand that the Minister for Community Services and Health has recently approved funding for the Rural Doctors Association of Australia to organise a conference on these matters, which is to be held in Toowoomba from 14 to 16 February. As well as being part of the consultative process associated with developing a rural health strategy, this conference will provide a forum at which the program I have outlined can be further developed. It requires much consultation, but I believe that the Rural Doctors Association of Australia is to be commended for the work it has undertaken to make fellow practitioners and, indeed, the general community aware of this predicament in our rural communities.

         —The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has completed its consideration of the proposition to allow the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia. It ought to be acknowledged straight off that there has been considerable grower opposition to the allowance of these imports and a fairly high level campaign has been conducted. A number of questions have been asked in this chamber about the potentiality of fireblight to be introduced by virtue of that importation. In Senator Schacht's preface to the question I can see the mirror image of that being reflected in views expressed on the New Zealand side of the Tasman.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has stuck to its task in carrying out a proper, scientifically-based study and it deserves to be acknowledged for doing that in the face of this controversy. It has stuck to it because our quarantine laws need to be open and transparent at all times, particularly when we are dealing with a country such as New Zealand, which is a member of the Cairns Group of free trading nations, as is Australia, so that it is quite clear that quarantine is a non-tariff barrier and that it is there for what it should be-that is, to screen out disease and the importation of disease into this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's report considered the New Zealand proposal and the sources or locations in New Zealand from whence the apples would come. It has circulated a draft document for comment, and has received and analysed those comments. It has also received comments from the Bureau of Rural Resources and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics.
       </para>
       <para>
        AQIS has announced that it will not proceed with allowing New Zealand apples into Australia. It has done so because it has identified a number of scientific gaps in the knowledge. Given those gaps, the seriousness of fireblight and the potential economic damage if there were an outbreak of that disease in Australia, AQIS has decided not to allow the proposition at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The gaps identified relate to the reliability of the orchard surveys conducted in New Zealand and the efficacy of the dip treatment used against bacteria in the fruit. AQIS has concluded that there are inadequate safeguards against fireblight and the proposal fails at this stage. That is a typical cautious approach in risk assessment by AQIS, and one that I applaud. AQIS is now producing a paper explaining the reasons for its conclusion for dissemination to grower organisations in Australia and for commentary by New Zealand quarantine officials as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying, since this has been a matter of high controversy, that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has been under the microscope by interested sections of the community during all this time. If its conclusions were the other way round they would be as well regarded by this Government as professional, scientifically detached and appropriate conclusions. The fact that they concur with the view adopted by a lobby group does not diminish the professionalism of AQIS as an organisation. But, given the level of attention to its procedures that this event has brought on, it has demonstrated that we have in Australia in the AQIS a very professional service. That is to be applauded by all sections of the community.

        I am aware that the averaging arrangements in the previous GMP scheme provided support to growers in circumstances of extreme market downturn such as in 1986-87. If such a crisis were to occur again the Government would need to give close consideration to special support arrangements for the industry.

        The decline in net returns for the current pool reflects the impact of the continued use of export subsidies by the United States (US) and the European Community (EC) on world market prices. The indicator or card price has held relatively steady at around $US124 to $US125 per tonne, whereas US subsidies have increased from $US35 per tonne in September to more than $US40 per tonne at present. The EC is paying about $US135 per tonne to exporters to match these prices. The Australian Government will not get involved in this subsidy war by giving growers a direct compensation payment, as called for by the Grains Council of Australia. The cost would be around $400m for the current season if we did so. The Government provides a significant benefit to the industry by its underwriting of the Australian Wheat Board's borrowings to finance advance and cash-out payments. The guaranteed limit of Australia-$1,052.6m-represents around 90 per cent of the revised pool returns estimate.

        The domestic market for quality wheats remains strong and, under the deregulated market, growers have the option to take advantage of that. I am advised that Mr Kerin will meet with the Grains Council next week to discuss the possible means of government assistance. Earlier requests for accelerated payments to growers by increasing the level of past national interest insurance were not accepted by the Government at that time. Also, the Wheat Board has renewed its offer of $30 per tonne against the insured component of such credit sales, which will provide significant cash flow benefits.

         —Regrettably, the use that was being made of these services was dramatically below the level required to justify their continuing existence. The Australian National Railways Commission has in fact recommended the closure of the three regional passenger services that it operates in South Australia between Adelaide and Mount Gambier, Whyalla and Broken Hill. Australian National advises that these services are very heavy loss makers, covering only one-third of their direct costs and little more than one-sixth of their full costs. Occupancy for the three services averaged only 38.5 per cent in 1989-90 and these services would not in fact have covered their operating costs even if they had been running full.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        An independent study of Australian National's passenger services by the Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics found that there would be considerable economic benefits in the closure of these services, except in the unrealistic situation of there being no excess capacity on alternative means of transport.
       </para>
       <para>
        The alternative coach services range between 60 per cent and 80 per cent full and average a 30 per cent excess of capacity. Bus operators have advised that they could accommodate the existing rail passenger services and perhaps assist further by changing some of their existing schedules to do so. It is not possible to provide a complete assurance concerning the cost and convenience of alternative transport for each and every person, but I can advise Senator Foreman that because of the significant lower capital and operating costs of road coach services, they are able to provide a significantly more frequent and in many instances cheaper service. There are 80 services a week each way between Adelaide and destinations served by Australian National, but only 13 are by the rail cars.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I add that the situation is, in terms of some of the suggestions that were made during the debate on the closure of these services, that perhaps the rolling stock could be replaced-because it was ageing rolling stock. Regrettably, were that to be done-as I said before, the services were currently returning only one-sixth of the cost of operation-that would in fact effectively have doubled the loss on the existing service.

There have been the normal procedures, as I understand, which have occurred in the past and which will continue in the future. Quite clearly, if there appears to be a likelihood of hostilities there would be a need within Australia at all military installations and other civilian installations for a higher security level than would exist in normal times. That is based on fairly clear evidence of links between Baghdad and terrorist groups-which have been remarkably quiet, the Senate will note, in the last few weeks-but I have no doubt at all that in the event of hostilities those terrorist groups would become very active. So the Government will make the necessary plans, not just in the north of Australia but at any vital military installations and other vital civilian installations, to make sure that security is heightened.

Is the Government prepared to modify these policies to ensure the survival of a viable horticultural industry in the Riverland? Will the Government consider the removal of the sales tax on 100 per cent fruit juice-and I would interpolate here: the measure introduced by the Government, supported by the Opposition, and voted against by the Democrats? Finally, will the Government enact comprehensive legislation complimenting any passed by the States ensuring that consumers will be able to clearly identify, through labelling, the country of origin of all the contents and the percentage of Australian content in an item such as orange juice so that the Buy Australian program has some meaning in this industry?

        As Senator Coulter will have seen, my colleague John Kerin has had special meetings with representatives of the citrus and other horticultural industries, as well as a special meeting on this subject with the agricultural Ministers from the three States concerned. Mr Kerin issued a press release on 13 November saying that he was prepared to take the matter to Cabinet. It is my understanding that that submission to Cabinet will be dealt with next week. I cannot, of course, canvass what will be in that submission at this time.

        On the general question of free trade policy, which Senator Coulter raised in his question-if I might be anecdotal for a moment-I myself raised this issue with prominent representatives of the farming community only a week ago. They have perhaps a slightly different view in terms of the Uruguay Round discussions and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) than would be held by orange growers in the Riverland. Australia's main advantage in agricultural products lies in a freer world trade. Concern and interest has been expressed by successive Australian trade Ministers and is currently being advanced by Dr Blewett in the GATT round.

        Senator Coulter asked about sales tax policy. The Government has been reconsidering this matter, although I am aware of continuing concerns regarding both the sales tax on fruit juice and the local content provisions, which are due to change next year. With regard to labelling, honourable senators will be aware that Senator Tate answered questions on this matter here last week. As I understand it, at least two of the three southern citrus States are intending to legislate for changes to the labelling requirements, and it is expected that all States will adopt uniform labelling requirements making it clear when juice is made up of imported ingredients or local content.

         —I have become aware of problems faced by Bay View laundry. Indeed, it is a very fine service housed at Mount St Canice in Hobart. Some 37 people with disabilities engage in various employment in that major laundry facility. I know that several honourable senators from the south of the State would be aware of the particularly fine work undertaken there by these people with disabilities, many of whom I know personally.

        The fact is that members of the Bay View Parents Support Group came to my office a few weeks ago to inform me that there had been delays, as they put it-certainly some difficulties for them-in gaining Commonwealth funding to compensate for operating losses associated with the laundry. Of course, I undertook to give speedy consideration to the matter by asking the Minister for Community Services and Health, Mr Brian Howe, to deal with it as quickly as possible. Indeed, I am delighted to know that some $45,000 is being made available to Bay View laundry immediately to help it with its immediate cash flow problem. The problems will be identified by the consultant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Peat Marwick Hungerfords Management Consultants has been asked to investigate the factors leading to the laundry's operating losses and strategies to secure the viability of the laundry. I believe that the particular strategy coming out of that consultancy will need considerable financial support from the Federal Government, and that support will be forthcoming. I am very confident that funds to implement that rehabilitation of the Bay View laundry service and to secure its viability will come by the end of this month in order to ensure that the consultancy recommendations can be carried through in a way which will support the activity of that very fine institution in Hobart.

         — On 27 November 1990 Senator Crichton-Browne asked me a question regarding interception of telephone calls. I undertook to provide the honourable senator with further information, which I now have to hand. Telecom Australia has informed me that it is not aware of any cases of interception occurring between technical staff and clients. Prior to 1986 aural monitoring of a customer service was utilised on infrequent occasions where difficulties with the telephone service were reported and no fault was able to be located by normal test measures.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In 1986, the Commonwealth Ombudsman raised with Telecom Australia issues concerning aural monitoring of telephone services. Telecom reviewed the situation and decided that, in the investigation of service complaints by customers, Telecom should not monitor conversation by means of a loud speaker in an exchange unless prior approval for such action had been obtained from the customer. This is the current practice on the rare occasions that such a situation would arise, and meets the requirements of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The response from the Director of Public Prosecutions in regard to the compensation cases mentioned in my answer to Senator Crichton-Browne's original question has not yet been received by Telecom. I will provide it when it is available.

The Joint House Department has advised me that the reduced lighting levels have saved an estimated $365 a week or $19,000 per annum in energy costs. Since moving to the new Parliament House, the Joint House Department has achieved a 10 per cent saving in energy costs. A comprehensive energy audit is presently being undertaken. Its recommendations will lead to further savings in energy costs. Senator Coulter's request to reduce the use of lights is being taken into account by the energy auditors.

        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The responsibility for the transcription of the proceedings of parliamentary committees rests with Hansard. When a transcript is completed, Hansard forwards that transcript in electronic and hard copy form to the committee, which undertakes the printing and distribution of that transcript. The committee subsequently advises Hansard of any suggested corrections to the transcript. Any request to Hansard for access to a tape-recording of the proceedings of a committee or an unproofed version of the transcript is referred by Hansard to the committee for decision. Usually that decision is advised to Hansard by the committee secretary after consultation with the committee chairman. This is what occurred in relation to the matter raised by Senator Vanstone. The principle is that transcripts, both proofed and unproofed, are the property of the committee and it is a matter for each committee to determine access to that material and advise Hansard accordingly.

       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469,274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

       Air Landing Fee: New South Wales

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the proposed air landing fee for regional and commuter airlines landing at Sydney Mascot Airport during peak times discriminates severely against people in rural Australia and will force many airlines to either revise their schedules, cancel flights or increase passenger fares to cover this additional financial impost of the Federal Labor Government. This will result in less accessibility for country businessmen and travellers alike, will increase the costs of business for rural people and threatens the viability of many smaller airlines who provide valuable services to rural towns. We therefore call on the Federal Government to abolish all plans for the introduction of this discriminatory fee and allow commuter airlines to continue to provide their full range of services to towns throughout New South Wales.

        —Mr President, the Committee is giving this notice because it is now at the end of the 15 days after tabling when such action must be taken. The Committee's concerns with the guidelines relate both to the parliamentary proprieties and personal liberties. In respect of parliamentary proprieties, the guidelines may not have been made in accordance with the parent Act. In respect of personal liberties, important discretions exercisable by public officials and affecting the livelihood of individuals may not be subject to review of their merits by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Other possibly defective provisions affecting personal liberties empower officials to enter premises, inspect and copy records and require people to answer questions. The guidelines do not appear to include all the safeguards which are usual in such cases. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement of the concerns of the Committee with the guidelines and with another instrument of delegated legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Leave granted.
      </para>
      <para>
       The document read as follows-
      </para>
      <para>
       Industry Training Agents' Guidelines No. 1
      </para>
      <para>
       ITA 1 of 1990
      </para>
      <para>
       The Guidelines provide detailed criteria for qualifications and conditions for registration as an industry training agent under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. The Guidelines have important financial and commercial implications.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Guidelines helpfully provide Notes in the body of the instrument. The Notes advise that where registration of an agent is cancelled under the Act that AAT review is available. There is no such assurance that an initial refusal to register is similarly subject to review. The Committee believes that review rights should not only be provided, but also notified as widely as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       There may also be defects in the drafting of the Guidelines which could affect their validity. It is an important function of the Committee to scrutinise delegated legislation to ensure that it is legally valid. In the present case the parent Act provides that the registration of an agent may only be cancelled if this power is granted under the Guidelines. There does not appear to be such a power, apart from where a person has requested cancellation. Several provisions are drafted as though such a power does exist. A Note in the guidelines also assumes that such a power exists. However, the actual drafting of the relevant provision does not provide expressly for cancellation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another provision empowers public officials to enter premises and inspect and copy records. The agent is required to make the records available and answer questions. The Committee always scrutinises closely such provisions and insists on appropriate safeguards. In this case the power in the Guidelines may duplicate a similar power in the Act which provides extensive powers of entry. Also, unlike the Act, the Guidelines do not provide that officials entering premises must produce written (preferably photographic) identification and that the official must leave on request if unable to produce the identification. The Act provides a penalty of $1,000 for an agent who refuses to allow officials to enter or otherwise fails to comply with the provision. There appears to be no penalty in the Guidelines. There appears to be no protection against self-incrimination in the questions which the agent is required to answer.
      </para>
      <para>
       Determination under s.98c (1) (b) of the National Health Act 1953
      </para>
      <para>
       This instrument does not appear to be subject to tabling and disallowance. However, it is clearly a legislative instrument, affecting as it does the rights and obligations of classes of persons. The Committee decided that it would scrutinise the instrument in the same way as it does other delegated legislation, although it may not be possible to give notice of a protective motion of disallowance.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee decided to do this because it has often expressed the view that such instruments should be subject to tabling and disallowance. Also, the Committee receives such a high level of cooperation from Ministers that it is appropriate to raise possible defects in such instruments.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee's copy of the Determination is neither signed nor dated. The Determination also refers to Schedules 2, 3, 4 and 5, none of which is attached. If the original instrument is purported to be made in this fashion it may be invalid. If the original was validly made then defective copies should not be circulated to the public.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Determination was not numbered. The need for numbering is illustrated by several references to another Determination under a separate provision of the Act. If more than one such Determination has ever been made, or if one or more have been made and amended, there are problems of interpretation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Determination grants many important discretions. There is no indication on the face of the instrument that any of these are subject to AAT review. No criteria are provided for the exercise of many of these discretions. Other criteria are inappropriate. For example, one provision reads ``A computer software system is not, or ceases to be, acceptable to the General Manager if . . . the General Manager deems the system to be unacceptable.'' Another reads ``A claim is not of acceptable standard if . . . the General Manager deems the claim to be of unacceptable standard.'' The General Manager is not required to give reasons for these or other important decisions affecting the livelihood of individuals.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Determination refers to ``operational testing'' and ``operational audit requirements.'' These terms are not defined. If they involve entry onto premises by public officials then the usual safeguards should be provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the provisions of the Determination appear to affect privacy. It is customary to consult with the Privacy Commissioner on such issues. Normally the fact of such consultation is advised in the Explanatory Statement or other explanatory material. The Determination was not accompanied by such material.

         —by leave-It is unsatisfactory that the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will not appear in Hansard, whether it is read in full by the Minister representing the Prime Minister or whether it is incorporated. We are not particularly fussed as to which of those mechanisms is used. We were prepared to give leave because all statements of this nature are made available some hours before debate. That gave us time to read it, and I cannot see how anyone could say that they did not have time to read it. Therefore, we wanted to allow more time for the debate on the statement to take place. I invite the Minister to reconsider the procedure that he has adopted because, although it seems that he can table it without leave and that is an option that is open to him, I think it is creating an undesirable precedent.

If we allow this practice to occur we will be able to do the same with second readings of Bills about which we may have had no notice at all. It is an important procedure to be followed. It is a defence by any senator to deny leave if that senator has not had the opportunity of considering the subject matter of the material about which leave has been sought for incorporation in Hansard. I fear that by proceeding along this line, we may well be creating precedence.

He sought leave to incorporate the document in Hansard; he sought leave to move a motion in relation to that document. It is not in Hansard and, therefore, he needs to seek leave again to move a motion relating the tabled document. How do we know it is the same document?

He was denied leave on the second of those three propositions-the incorporation-but granted leave both to make a statement and to move the motion. That leave has been granted and cannot now be withdrawn. In the absence of leave also being given for the incorporation--

          —I am coming to that. In the absence of being given leave to incorporate the statement, Senator Button tabled the statement. He does not need to seek leave from anyone to do that. Ministers can table documents at any time. He did so. There is in existence a tabled statement, in respect of which Senator Button has already sought and been granted leave to move a particular motion. He did not in his original language refer either to the statement as incorporated or the statement as tabled; he referred simply to the statement he was about to deliver on behalf of the Prime Minister. That is the order and sequence of events. The motion properly before the Senate now is to take note of the statement which happens to have been tabled, unfortunately, rather than incorporated, but it is a clear and straightforward motion. The whole point of this exercise was simply to allow the Senate more time, as the Opposition has acknowledged, to debate the substance of this, given that the thing has been circulated in ample time for everyone to be aware of it. I suggest that we get on with it.

         —I am not going to read the Government's statement. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) should read the statement. I am going to address the motion that the Senate take note of a statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that has been tabled in this place, notwithstanding that we are dissatisfied with the procedure and we might, respectfully, have some disagreement with your ruling, Mr President. But it is not the sort of matter that we would want to take any further. The statement is an important statement and we welcome the opportunity to debate it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government's decision has taken Australian forces a step closer to involvement in armed conflict. The ships, of course, have been located outside the Persian Gulf-as you know, Mr President, in the Gulf of Oman-where they have been enforcing the trade boycott pursuant to previous United Nations (UN) resolutions. They have been challenging and searching those ships which may have been in breach of the boycott. However, the United Nations Security Council has now carried resolution 678 which in effect authorises the use of force to end the unlawful occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. The resolution calls upon states to consider their contribution and to use all necessary means to uphold and implement all previous Security Council resolutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        We note that the Australian Government has, pursuant to the resolution, reassessed the military role of Australia-in particular, Australia's naval commitment. The ships will now operate in the upper reaches of the Gulf with American, Canadian and British contributions. They clearly will be training for the offensive action which may have to follow after 15 January. We support the expanded function-not lightly because of its gravity-after a great deal of careful thought and consideration. It is clear that Saddam Hussein will not withdraw from Kuwait until he is convinced that a failure to withdraw will result in the destruction of his regime. However, to convince Saddam of that consequence, the alliance forces must be prepared to take offensive action. Regrettably, that means an offensive action might have to be mounted. It is not possible to be assured that Saddam, even when faced with the most dire consequences, will in fact withdraw.
       </para>
       <para>
        It must be recognised that having gone this far it is not practicably possible for Australia to pull back without an Iraqi withdrawal. I doubted whether it was possible when Australia took the first step of sending a force to enforce the boycott. In some ways we on this side of the chamber seemed to understand better than the Prime Minister what the Australian Government was getting into. That is why we questioned the ambiguity of his initial statement, which actually was in the form of a press conference. Perhaps he was aware of what he was taking Australia into and we were more honest. In any event, recognising the sequence of events which could follow, we accepted the consequences because we believed it was in Australia's best interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        Resolution 678 should not be interpreted as the identification of force as a preferred means of resolving the crisis, but it confirms the resolve of the international community to use force if sanctions are incapable of forcing an Iraqi withdrawal. The specification of a time limit makes clear to Iraq that a strategy of delay to take the crisis past the point where the use of force will be a credible option will not work. It therefore helps produce a peaceful resolution, if such a resolution is at all possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        It follows that a peaceful resolution requires the international alliance to keep its nerve; to consistently and persistently apply pressure; and, to use an American expression, not to blink. Any sign of weakness, lack of resolve or disagreement within the alliance gives strength to Saddam's hand. He will seek to outlast the alliance. Regrettably, his ruthless application of the hostage strategy has already won him time and enabled him to play off some of the alliance partners against others. The next delaying tactic will be a willingness to negotiate; to talk of a partial withdrawal; perhaps even a partial withdrawal. The hopes on the alliance side will be raised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Saddam knows that whilst there is hope of peaceful resolution the alliance is unlikely to attack. In other words, Saddam Hussein is planning on the humanity of the alliance, particularly the Western elements. He senses that the values which we see as our strengths, our respect for the value of individual human life, is also our weakness. This is not an easy challenge for the alliance of nations that are facing him. There have been many who have already criticised the delay in bringing the matter to a head, saying that it only strengthens Saddam's hand. It is true that during this time he has been able to build fortifications, particularly around Kuwait. I am of the school that believes that all peaceful alternatives must be first exhausted, but these efforts must not be seen as an unwillingness to fight and sacrifice if ultimately necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the leadership of President Bush and the United States of America (USA) in this incredibly challenging situation. I am pleased that Australia is standing alongside the United States, Britain, Canada and others in a joint commitment to repel the illegal use of force. If this action is successful, I believe that it will establish the basis of a new world order in the post-Cold War era environment, an order that will be based on collective security, albeit for some time with the leadership of the United States and its other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation partner-and this is important. In our own region with a reduction of United States forces, stability and security will be harder to guarantee. We will all have to play an increased role, which further demonstrates how foolish and short-sighted has been this Government's very limited defence strategy. No doubt that is something that will be taken up either today or on other occasions by my colleagues Senator Durack, Senator MacGibbon and others.
       </para>
       <para>
        To re-establish, at the outset of this new multipolar world, the principle of respect for international law and the sovereignty of nation states is vital. To demonstrate that the use of terror, threats and the taking of hostages is intolerable and will incur a massive penalty is important. Although some have dismissed this as a conflict over oil, for a dictator to control almost one half of the world's oil resources, which he would have done if he had taken the oilfields of north-eastern Saudi Arabia, and thus to hold the world to economic ransom is just as dangerous.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many lessons which should have been already learnt from this conflict. The regional political history is complex. It should be realised that Iraq's claims to Kuwait predate Saddam Hussein. Iraq's claims and its justification for its invasion are a mixture of anti-colonial rhetoric and appeals to national interest. To Iraq, Kuwait was an undemocratic relic from colonial days which needed to be swept aside in the name of decolonisation. Kuwait was further perceived to challenge Iraq's national interests. In particular, its policy in relation to the price of oil was said to be hurting the Iraqi economy to the point where it could no longer be endured. There was a demand for $2.4 billion in compensation for oil claimed to have been syphoned off from an Iraqi oilfield during the Gulf war, and the border dispute over the Rumeilah oilfields provided grounds for Iraqi claims of Kuwaiti indifference to their interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, Kuwaiti credentials under the UN charter were quite in order. If one legitimises the historical challenge which Iraq seeks to make of Kuwait in this instance, then there will be no certainty in state sovereignty or the sanctity of borders. That does not mean that I do not see democratisation of the somewhat feudal regime in Kuwait as important, but that is another issue. One may argue that such reform is overdue in much of the region. In any event, Kuwait's credentials as a responsible member of the international community more than match up alongside those of Saddam's regime.
       </para>
       <para>
        The West misread Saddam Hussein. He was seen for some time as the more moderate alternative in the war with Iran. He was seen as soft on pan-Arabism and he was seen as pro-West in Western disputes with Syria and Iran. His brutality was overlooked and in that lies a lesson-the lesson being not to overlook gross human rights abuses in search of short term political gain. Even if it is not possible for other countries to take decisive action to redress human rights violations, this conflict demonstrates that it is a mistake to allow this to obscure intelligence assessments or policy development.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the benefit of hindsight, what seemed like a readiness to accommodate Western interests in relation to, say, Arab unity or the Palestinian issue now seems more like a complete lack of principles. Flexibility may be more dangerous than inflexible adherence to unpalatable principles. The Iraq experience has also demonstrated the danger of massive military support to help maintain a balance with another state-in this case it was with Iran-when what it does also is put the first state out of balance with others in the region. It is an important lesson because there is already talk of massive regional arms build-ups in an attempt to guard against further Iraqi aggression. It is now clear that Western nations should have paid more attention to the armaments programs in Iraq.
       </para>
       <para>
        The scale of conventional armaments, as well as the gas and chemical warfare weaponry being amassed by Iraq, created a potential threat that should not have been ignored in favour of the short term expedience of assisting Iraq to wage war against Iran. The effect of this military capacity on the evolution of Iraqi intentions should also have been considered. Even if defensive motives alone had led Iraq to acquire such huge military capacity, the possession of military might on such a scale would itself inevitably become a factor in the equation. It would inspire fear in Iraq's neighbours and expand the options available to Iraq in dealing with its neighbours.
       </para>
       <para>
        The armaments programs in Arab states now being proposed to guarantee the security of other Arab states against Iraq, if they go ahead on the scale being reported, have the potential to become a major destabilising factor in the whole Middle East equation. This would arouse fear not only in Israel but also internationally. There are other lessons which should have already been learnt from this conflict, not least the need for a more sophisticated understanding of the Arab world. There was, in fact, a lot of evidence that Saddam might invade Kuwait, but Western intelligence organisations, including our own, apparently misread it. The line was drawn in the sand to protect Saudi Arabia when there was much less evidence of Saddam's intention to attack the Saudis. Saudi Arabia has never been an historical claim of Iraq. In making that point, I do not criticise the decision because, having misread Saddam once, the West could not afford to misread him twice.
       </para>
       <para>
        The conflict will inevitably change the balance in the region, and not necessarily for the better. Syria's power and authority, and particularly that of President Assad, will be enhanced by victory over Iraq. Syrian-Egyptian friendship seems to be blossoming following the restoration of diplomatic relations broken 12 years ago. President Assad is thought to be hoping that this will lead to financial assistance from Saudi Arabia and political favours from the West. Relaxation of sanctions imposed following Syrian association with terrorist activities would obviously be high on the Syrians' agenda. They have already achieved their objective with Britain. Pressure on Israel to return the Golan Heights captured in 1967 and a place at an international peace conference on Palestine would be further concessions that Syria may hope to achieve in the longer term with this new tack.
       </para>
       <para>
        Events in Lebanon further complicate the regional picture. The overthrow of Aoun, barely noticed against the background noise of the conflict over Kuwait, represents a widening Syrian influence in the region. Clearly, its alliance with the United States in relation to Iraq has given Syria a new confidence, the full significance of which is yet to be determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        Iran is another potential winner in the Middle East power struggle. It now has the opportunity to rid itself of its hated enemy, Saddam Hussein, at no further cost except the presence of the US and other non-believers in the region. That presence is unlikely to be tolerated for long after the conclusion of the conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Palestinians seem to have particularly suffered as a result of the conflict. Yasser Arafat has said that they should take side with the force that opposes their enemy most firmly and, therefore, chooses Iraq. That has lost him legitimacy in the eyes of the Western world as he has similarly lost the support of key Arab previous supporters, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. At the same time, the invasion has cut off the Palestinians from their valuable source of funds through their guest workers in Kuwait, and efforts by Saddam Hussein to link the Palestinian issue in an effort to divert attention to the common enemy, Israel, fortunately have so far proved unsuccessful.
       </para>
       <para>
        Jordan has looked particularly fragile as it has wrestled to balance its beneficial interests in, and fear of, Iraq with its interests in the West. All of this demonstrates that there will be fundamental changes as a result of this conflict which go far beyond the consequences of the front line battle.
       </para>
       <para>
        A security order in the post-conflict environment will be very complex. If Saddam maintains his military machine-and it is worth noting that the UN resolutions are limited to the invasion and occupation of Kuwait-the Saudis and the Gulf states, as I have said, are likely to want ongoing US or Western presence. As I also said, that is unlikely to be tolerated for long and efforts will be made to find an Arab security arrangement. Such an arrangement at the moment is difficult to envisage. The split in the Arab League is, in fact, likely to be an important, enduring effect of the invasion. Within the League, new alliances are being formed with unpredictable future consequences for the Palestinian and other regional issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ultimately, Saddam will be forced from Kuwait, one hopes peacefully. But this conflict-the Gulf crisis-as a whole will not be resolved if he retains his chemical, biological and potential nuclear capacity. Whether Australia is becoming engaged in a conflict to achieve that objective has yet to be acknowledged. The conflict will further not be satisfactorily resolved without the achievement of regional stability. This will inevitably call for longer term negotiation and compromise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst the immediate conflict is the paramount consideration, it would be wise for Western interests now to be contemplating the post-crisis regional security arrangements. Even Australia, which has had a good record in peacekeeping and observer contributions within the region, should be contemplating the contribution it might make in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, therefore, Australia has vital interests in this conflict which require a commitment to preserve. We should not underestimate the potential cost of that preservation, as has been set out in the Prime Minister's statement. Our genuine thanks must go to those servicemen who are at risk for our benefit and to their families. We, as policy makers, must work harder and more capably in developing international relations in a way that ensures justice, peace and stability. It seems to us on this side of the chamber that that is the least we can offer to those who put their lives at risk to preserve our interests.

         —In normal circumstances when a significant statement such as this has been made, the National Party of Australia would allow the leader of the coalition, Senator Hill, to respond on behalf of the National Party. But because this is such a significant statement, I feel that I should support Senator Hill in his contribution-a very good contribution too, I might say-and also put down a statement on behalf of the National Party.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        At the outset, let me say that the National Party supports the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on developments in the Gulf. Rarely has the world been so united in condemning the actions of one country oppressing another. The resolution was carried and supported by four of the superpowers, and significant countries such as Canada and Romania, showing that it has world support.

       <para>
        On 2 August, Iraq overran Kuwait and seized that country by force. Our response at that stage was to send three ships into the Gulf of Oman to enforce an embargo. The world was outraged and placed an embargo on goods leaving and entering Iraq. The ships that we sent helped to enforce that embargo. The United Nations ratified this action and has now authorised all member states of the United Nations from 15 January 1991 to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the resolution of the Security Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the National Party supports the Government's authorisation of the Australian Defence Force to deploy ships of our task force in the Persian Gulf to exercise and operate with our naval allies, in particular, the United States, Great Britain and Canada. We also support the participation of our Defence Force in allied military planning. The National Party commends the professionalism of the Royal Australian Navy and applauds the effort of our task force to date.
       </para>
       <para>
        We extend our sympathy in this festive season to those families who will be separated at Christmas time-not only of the Navy personnel on the three ships of our task force but also of the medical teams which are there at present and the two other medical teams which are about to leave to serve as well on the hospital ships in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our thoughts at this time must also be with the 30 Australian hostages still in Iraq who not only will be without friends or families at Christmas but also who do not even know when they will be able to return to Australia and be united, once more, with their families and resume their normal lives. We support the Prime Minister's statement because their future must be considered at all times.

        The USSR also supports the United Nations Security Council resolution authorising the use of force to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait as a step forward in the quest for a peaceful solution in the Gulf.

        Saddam Hussein is a man who runs a bankrupt country of 16 million people; who fought with Iran for eight years, thus costing millions of lives; who has hostile relations with most of his neighbours; who uses poison gas on his own people; who executes his own colleagues; who overruns another country with unjustified aggression and continues a regime of torture, arrests, executions and abductions of helpless people; and who detains foreign nationals against their will and uses many of them as human shields by holding them near military and strategic installations. This man, who governs that country, will not be overcome by sanctions alone. This man must be forced to withdraw from Kuwait before he has time to build up even greater military forces. We cannot stand by and accept Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Therefore, we welcome and support the Government's move, which will bring us closer to a peaceful but definite conclusion to a situation which Iraq alone has created.

         —The Australian Democrats welcomed the news, when it was conveyed to us via the mass media, as it was to other Australians, of the decision of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to inform the Parliament of the Government's approach to the Gulf crisis in light of last week's resolution of the United Nations Security Council, which authorised the possible use of force against Iraq after 15 January next year. But we deeply regret the fact that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) was not prepared to verbally deliver in this place that statement of the Prime Minister, which is probably the most important statement in this chamber and in this Parliament for decades. It is especially a matter of regret since it is only in this chamber that there is any dissent at all from the Government's position and from the position of the United States of America in this whole matter.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Before turning to the substance of the Prime Minister's statement, I express my extreme disappointment that the Government has failed to follow what the Democrats regard as appropriate democratic processes for authorising military action by Australian forces deployed overseas. The Senate will recall that the Government consulted Parliament over the deployment of Australian naval vessels to join the United States-led blockade in Iraq and Kuwait by way of a resolution put to both chambers. The decision to commit our naval forces to possible military action under United States operational command is clearly of even greater significance than the decision to join the blockade. It should have been possible only with the concurrence of both Houses, yet we do not even have a motion before us seeking the Senate's opinion.
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise that the Democrats, who represent more than one million voters-a majority of whom gave their second preferences to the Australian Labor Party-were not consulted in advance of today's statement. The Government has clearly decided to consult only those who will agree with it or who can at least be neutralised by the consultative process. That was all the more reason why we wanted to hear the Leader of the Government in this place deliver this very important statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addressing the substance of the Prime Minister's statement, I begin by acknowledging that the Democrats strongly agree with some of its premises and conclusions. Throughout this crisis we have attempted to play a constructive role in support of a peaceful outcome. In making what we believe are justified criticisms of the Government's stance, we have remained mindful of the fact that an act of international aggression which demanded a concerted international response was committed by Iraq against Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no excuse for Iraq's actions. Despite the historical basis of Iraq's claim on Kuwait and its grievances against the ousted al-Sabah regime, the use of military force cannot be justified. We have never attempted to justify that invasion. It is for this reason that the Democrats fully support the comprehensive sanctions imposed, with humanitarian exemptions, by the Security Council so speedily after the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein. Those sanctions must remain in place until Iraq withdraws from Kuwait and releases all hostages. Indeed, mandatory sanctions banning nuclear, chemical and military cooperation should be imposed for a considerable period thereafter.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth reminding the Senate that the sanctions are unprecedented in their scope and effect, partly because of the international community's determination to liberate Kuwait, and partly because of Iraq's unusual economic vulnerability. Ninety-five per cent of Iraq's exports and about 90 per cent of its imports have been cut off. Industrial production is thought to have dropped off by 40 per cent already, a trend which will eventually bring the Iraqi economy to an effective halt. It is at this point that the Democrats strongly contest the Government's judgment. I quote from today's statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        Nor does the Government believe that further economic hardship . . . is likely to change the minds of Iraq's leaders. Sanctions . . . cannot force the hand of a dictatorial leadership which is willing to ignore the interests of its people.
       </para>
       <para>
        We ask: on what basis has this judgment been formed? Surely, sanctions which have the capacity to cripple Iraq's economic activity will eventually lead its leadership into an impossible position. To make such a sweeping judgment as is made in this statement, that sanctions are guaranteed to fail, is excessively pessimistic and extremely premature.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, if this judgment is correct, why did the Australian Government support the imposition of sanctions in the first place? Why has Senator Gareth Evans repeatedly called for sanctions to be given time to work if the Government could see that they were never going to work? If the Government genuinely supports this judgment-the judgment articulated in today's statement-the quality of its assessments must be seriously questioned. If it does not believe that sanctions cannot work but is simply grasping for a justification for a United States led war, and at a time which suits the United States, it stands condemned for its dangerous cynicism.
       </para>
       <para>
        From the outset of this crisis, it was widely acknowledged that the sanctions would have to be given 12 to 18 months to convince the Iraqi leadership that it had no way to move but out of Kuwait. This point was emphatically reinforced by the former head of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe, when he told a congressional committee that the wait would be worth while as a means of avoiding war. The Australian Democrats would urge the Government in the strongest possible terms to allow this period to pass to give sanctions time to work or to bite harder than they are already biting.
       </para>
       <para>
        We fear that Security Council resolution 678 is creating an expectation that war will commence soon after 15 January if Iraq has not withdrawn by that time. Those who argue for early military action point to the deteriorating situation in Kuwait; the impact of the sanctions on the economies of developing nations; the possible development by Iraq of further military might, including a nuclear weapons capability; and the possible loss of domestic support for President Bush's policies if the crisis drags on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The military and nuclear arguments are furphies. The continuation of military and nuclear sanctions against Iraq, even after it complies with the Security Council resolutions, would constrain such developments. According to all sober assessments from outside the Pentagon, Iraq is still years away from acquiring the bomb. The impatience of the public of the United States is the single most important force behind the push for war and in the timetabling thereof. This of course is an entirely insufficient justification. It is also a double-edged sword. The United States people may be impatient but they do not want war. The awful situation in Kuwait and the economic impact of the sanctions, both of which are highlighted in today's statement, are of great concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats freely acknowledge that there is no easy solution to this crisis. The choice is not between good and bad options; it is between bad and worse ones. In choosing between these options, it is essential to look at both sides of the coin, to count the costs as well as the benefits of military action. Today's statement by the Government completely fails to count the costs. No attempt is made to assess the human impact of an attack on Kuwait and Iraq. The suffering caused by such an assault would, in all likelihood, exceed the suffering which has been caused by Iraq's occupation so far. According to yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, the Office of the National Assessments has concluded that war would last just two weeks and cost only 500 lives.

        Today's statement by the Prime Minister fails to count the political cost, even though it more or less acknowledges that any war may effectively be fought between Third World Iraq and the Anglo-Saxon First World-the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia. The potential to divide the international community and, particularly, the countries of the Middle East is all too real with the resulting international tensions lasting for many more generations. While the Democrats do not believe that an Iraqi withdrawal should be contingent upon a resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict or vice versa, we believe that the campaign against Iraq should not worsen existing problems in the Middle East. A non-military approach carries far fewer risks in this regard than the threat of war.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement makes no mention of the possible use of nuclear weapons by the United States. It should be appreciated that Australia would be directly implicated in any nuclear attack. The bases in Australia and our warships in the Gulf are firmly tied into US military strategy. The Government has already indicated that the use of nuclear weapons would not lead it to cease its military involvement in the Gulf. Brian Toohey pointed out in the Sun-Herald of 2 December that the Government's position will not enhance Australia's credibility on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation, a credibility which in any post-invasion scenario will be tremendously important.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister's statement emphasises the precedent that the campaign against Iraq sets for the post-Cold War international order. Does this mean, we have to ask, that military action should be taken against all big countries that are attempting to subjugate smaller ones? Will we see an assault on East Timor to drive out the Indonesian forces there? Is Tibet to be liberated by a massive US force? Should the Soviet Union and China have invaded Panama in response to the illegal US invasion of that country? Will troops be sent into the Occupied Territories to drive out an invader that clearly has no intention of leaving? The answer in each case is no. If the international campaign against Iraq is to serve as a precedent, as this statement before us today suggests, it must be sustainable under other circumstances. This is yet another compelling argument in favour of a non-military strategy built on patience.
       </para>
       <para>
        In essence, the Democrats' view of the Gulf conflict is that Australia should not be involved in any military action in the region. We need long term solutions to pressing issues which exist already in the Middle East and, as I have suggested, in many other parts of the world. Early in the conflict after the invasion, the Democrats stood ready to support any measures of the Security Council deemed necessary to monitor and, if necessary, to enforce the sanctions.

        It soon became obvious that the naval forces in the Gulf far exceeded the demands of sanctions enforcement. It is now clear that their presence was in preparation for a more offensive role. Australia's naval commitment is no exception and is part of that exercise. Australia's warships in the Gulf must be withdrawn. We must redouble our efforts to work for a peaceful resolution rather than blindly follow the United States into the abyss of war.

         —Australia is a country that has always taken its international obligations very seriously indeed, both in peace and in war. We are a country that has been very conscious of the need for principles of good international citizenship to be a central prevailing theme of our foreign policy. We are a country which has spoken out without fear or favour when questions of freedom and justice have been an issue on the international stage. We are a country that has been prepared, over the years, over the decades, to match our rhetoric with action in appropriate circumstances. We are a country that has given the strongest possible support to the United Nations (UN) since the very inception of that international organisation. We were present at its creation with the activities particularly of Dr Evatt being of pre-eminent importance in the measures embodied in the United Nations charter to protect the interests of small states.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have been present at just about every peacekeeping operation that has been put in train by the United Nations over the 45 years of its existence. We are also a country and a government which is very conscious of the need to protect our own national interests and in particular our security interests. We are conscious of the volatility that has traditionally existed in our own Asian and Asian Pacific neighbourhood. We are conscious of the need to ensure-and it is very well understood in our part of the world, as elsewhere-that aggression and adventurism will be met by united and concerted international response.

       <para>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, all of those factors come together in the decision which has been announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today in response to a specific request for assistance, for support, from the United Nations. Those factors have come together in the decision that has been made and announced that Australia is prepared to make our naval task force available to serve with allied forces in operations authorised by UN Security Council resolution 678, if that becomes-we all hope it does not become-necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together with the two additional small medical units that will also be sent to the Gulf, that is a specific and quite substantial contribution, meeting a very real need and constituting a very valuable addition to the available resources now concentrated in the Gulf. It is not a contribution that we propose to increase and it is not one that we would expect to be asked to increase. I appreciate the support that the Opposition has given to this response and indeed throughout this crisis.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are some specific points that need to be made or emphasised at this stage of the debate, not least in response to some of the things that Senator Powell has just been saying. The points I want to make are these. First, the Australian response is pursuant to the United Nations request in what is now very much a United Nations exercise, not a United States one, whatever Senator Powell might be inclined to continue to assert. Secondly, I want to make the point that this is an eminently appropriate case in which the United Nations should be involved in the way in which it has now become involved. Thirdly, this is now the time to act in the way that the United Nations has done. Fourthly, there is every chance that the actions of the Security Council and others in support of it will bear fruit without there being a need for military action to actually occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as the United Nations itself is concerned, however people may have wanted to characterise the Gulf crisis in its early days, there can be no conceivable doubt whatsoever that the response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is something that has the wholehearted support and endorsement of the United Nations. We have seen a series of 12 resolutions passed by the UN Security Council-most of them unanimously, none with more than two states, usually Cuba and Yemen, opposed. Those resolutions have involved a steady escalation of response over the period since August, making clear what the world's objectives were so far as Iraq was concerned; initially seeking to achieve those objectives by way of economic sanctions and boycott; then supporting those economic sanctions with military backing; now proceeding to make clear that unless those objectives are satisfied by the middle of January, Iraq must expect member nations to take all necessary means, including the use of force, to ensure that they are observed. It is a carefully modulated, carefully developed systematic response by the body that was set up to do just exactly what it is doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tragedy of the United Nations, of course, over the last generation, over the last 45 years since the War, is that it has not been able to do what we would all have liked it to do in terms of responding to situations of aggression or indefensible intervention that have occurred over that 45-year period. The Cold War has imposed its own discipline over that period on the capacity of the United Nations to respond, and it is only with the death at long last of the Cold War that that kind of capacity is now there.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let it not be forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood that what the UN has now authorised, through the latest Security Council resolution, is something squarely within the contemplation of the Charter and squarely within the contemplation of the founders of the United Nations. There were four peace related roles explicitly or implicitly spelt out in the Charter or in the understanding of those who were present at its birth.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was understood and believed that the United Nations would have a role in peace making, in conciliation, particularly through the efforts of the Secretary-General to anticipate problems, to mediate, to negotiate, to resolve them. Secondly, it was well understood that the UN would have a role in peacekeeping, in sending bodies of member nations, troops and officials, to implement, to monitor, to supervise settlements of disputes that were reached under UN auspices, and there have been many examples of such peacekeeping operations, in most of which, as I have already said, Australia has participated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the UN had a role identified for itself, which it has exercised since, so far as disarmament is concerned. The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva is the standing UN body directed at achieving just those objectives, which we all share-again, crucial in the peace process. But there is a fourth peace related role for the United Nations and that is peace enforcement, peace enforcement of the kind that is anticipated, spelt out in outline, in Chapter 7 of the Charter itself, a peace enforcement role of the kind that Dr Evatt very articulately identified back in 1945 as something the UN had to be prepared to do. We have the quotes there, they are in the Prime Minister's statement, when Dr Evatt said in 1945 that if economic or diplomatic sanctions:
       </para>
       <para>
        are deemed inappropriate to the situation or prove ineffective, the Security Council may take any military action necessary to suppress the aggressor.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also said-I quote again from the Prime Minister's statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        It must be made crystal clear that the nations seeking representation in the world organisation must be prepared to contribute their share of physical force to restrain the action of proved aggressors.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not a latter day invention; this is something that has been part of the whole fabric of the concept of the United Nations because most people around the world have understood, much better than the Australian Democrats seem to understand, that ultimately there are some situations of naked aggression, of indefensible exercises of military raw power, that can be satisfactorily responded to at the end of the day only by the threat of a similar response. Far better that that response come from the world body and its member states, acting through the world body, than for it to come individually.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point that I am making is one that is particularly important to draw attention to in the present context when one reflects that Senator Powell herself and the Australian Democrats have been saying from the outset of this crisis that the UN must have a role; have been acknowledging from the outset that there is a role for the United Nations to play in a military enforcement sense. Senator Powell on 10 August in a press release said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Without UN approval, Australia has no legitimate military role in the Middle East.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now there is UN approval. Is Senator Powell going to eat those words? Senator Bourne on 17 August put out another news release in similar terms. Senator Powell on 21 August is reported in Hansard. Senator Spindler is reported on 22 August in Hansard again. Senator Bourne again on 9 October stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that a peaceful solution is still possible through negotiation, and I am encouraged by the involvement of the United Nations (UN). I believe that stronger involvement by that body is desirable and probable.
       </para>
       <para>
        She was right: it was probable, it had to happen, it was desirable. It has now happened and let us have a little less churlishness, a little more honesty and a little more consistency from the Australian Democrats. Let us have a recognition that the Democrats have now exactly what they said they wanted: not just a unilateral United States exercise or an Australian exercise, they have a genuinely international exercise led by the very body that they owe recognition and respect to and that they have already acknowledged in those earlier statements.

         —Of course they are silent; they have nothing to say. The second point I want to make is that this is a very appropriate case for the exercise of this kind of response by the international community.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are many circumstances of indefensible intervention by other countries in the past that would, I believe, equally have justified such a response. The fact that that response was not possible for reasons of the Cold War and the exercise of competing veto powers does not in any way make less appropriate the response on this particular occasion. Of course I accept the point that Senator Powell makes, that this must not be treated as one-off case; that, if we are serious about an international response to the exercise of aggression by one sovereign country against another, we must be prepared again in the future if these situations do arise-and one hopes to God that they will not-to react in a similar way. It is a point that is well taken. I believe in the virtue of consistency here as elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important nonetheless to appreciate the particular enormity of what Iraq has done in this situation. Gianni de Michelis, the Italian Foreign Minister, made the point very clearly in a statement not so long ago when he said that there has been no analogy since Hitler of the total annexation of a weaker neighbouring state by another. There have been examples-Timor is one-of annexation of a weaker neighbouring territory by another. It may be that the moral difference is not very great, but one needs to appreciate that there is something very specially unsavoury about what has happened with the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. It is an example, a precedent, that we have not seen in precisely these terms since the 1930s, and God forbid again that we should see any such example in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is an example that assumes a particularly alarming character when one bears in mind the nature of Iraq and the Iraqi regime. It is a country of only medium size but with a million people under arms. It is a highly militarist country, a country that has shown a demonstrated willingness to use chemical weapons against its own people and other countries. It is a country that is in the business of manufacturing nuclear weapons just as soon as it proves able to do so. Moreover, it is a country that is in a position to impose a stranglehold not only on its immediate neighbours but on the economies of the whole world because of the particular sensitivity of the Gulf region. But all those considerations, especially unsavoury and especially alarming as they are, do not change the fundamental nature of the problem in this instance. The thing that makes it so crucial that there be an international reaction of the kind that we have seen is that it is simply a case of naked, indefensible aggression by a stronger neighbour against a weaker one. It is the kind of thing that must not be allowed to succeed, if any of us are to have any confidence about the viability and stability of the post-Cold War world.
       </para>
       <para>
        My third point is that this is an appropriate time for the international community, for the United Nations and for those acting pursuant to its decisions to act. We had all hoped that sanctions would bear fruit by now. The kind of timeframe we were all talking about within which we hoped that that would occur was six months. Twelve to 18 months was, as Senator Powell said, one of the outside suggestions that were being made, but certainly it was nobody's conviction that we could afford to wait that long for something to actually happen, other than on the most pessimistic assumptions. The unhappy truth is that nearly six months have now elapsed in the application of those sanctions and, successful as they have been in all sorts of ways, they have not yet borne fruit in terms of an evident willingness on behalf of the Iraqi regime to accept the logical consequences of those sanctions and to abandon its aspirations to maintain control over Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part of the problem, I suspect, is that sanctions always have at least as much a psychological dimension as a physical one. It was not really a matter for those of us who pinned our faith on sanctions of actually physically driving Iraq to its knees within that kind of timeframe. Rather it was a matter of demonstrating enough damage within that timeframe and demonstrating enough solidarity and persistence on the part of the rest of the world to make the inevitability of that damage apparent to the Iraqi regime. The point of sanctions was to make clear the inexorability of very real damage to the Iraqi people and the Iraqi economy, and to encourage on that basis a rational decision from the Iraqi leadership.
       </para>
       <para>
        What was crucial if that psychological impact was to apply was solidarity in the international response. There has been solidarity in the application of sanctions to the extent that one could possibly hope for, but there has not been solidarity in terms, regrettably, of the bizarre experience that we have seen in recent weeks of the hostage envoys and the hostage negotiations. I fear that it has to be acknowledged that that has done something to create already, at least until the United Nations resolution of last week, a feeling in Saddam that if he only hung on long enough he could divide, confuse and weaken that international solidarity and make in due course the threat of that sanctions pressure upon him fade quietly away. This is only speculation and that may be an overstatement but, when one is talking as one so often has to in these contexts about the likely psychological reaction of a nation and of a leadership to the international pressure upon us, these points, regrettably, cannot entirely be pushed to one side.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only is the sanctions strategy not showing signs of bearing fruit within a reasonable timeframe but it is clearly bearing a very devastating fruit on the economies of the developing world. While the uncertainty persists and oil prices stay as high as they are, the economic damage to innumerable countries in Asia, in Africa and, indeed, in eastern Europe, is all too starkly evident. That is the discipline, as much as anything else, as was spelled out in President Bush's statement and in the Prime Minister's statement, that has made the world appreciate that an additional form of pressure should now appropriately be applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final point I make is that following the decision that has been made by the United Nations Security Council to create the threat of military assault on Iraq, an achievement of the United Nations objectives by military means, the pressure that has been now so placed on Iraq has, I believe, every chance of producing a peaceful solution. There is no inevitability, no necessity, no compulsion about that particular UN Security Council resolution now being followed by military action. What was necessary, for all the reasons I have been trying to spell out, were some additional layers of very self-evident pressure, creating an appreciation, as nothing else could, of the overwhelming might and the unanimity of forces stacked up against Iraq. That pressure, there is some ground for hoping, will bear fruit in terms of an appreciation by Iraq that it has everything to lose and nothing to gain by persisting with its occupation of Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time it needs to be appreciated that the pressure inherent in the UN resolution itself has been accompanied by an expression of willingness to talk, to open up a line of communication and to explore the possibility of achieving a peaceful solution. The United States leadership has made it very clear that such a willingness to talk will not be a willingness that will put at risk in any way the unconditionality of the three basic UN articulated objectives-withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, recreation of the status quo as far as the Government of Kuwait is concerned, and of course the release of all the hostages held there against their will.
       </para>
       <para>
        But there is no doubt that talk of the kind that is contemplated in the statements of the United States leadership and which has now been accepted by Iraq will ease the way, will make it possible to define some areas where, without sacrificing those basic principles or attaching conditions to what must remain unconditional, progress can nonetheless be made. I am talking of the kinds of matters that were bilaterally in issue between Iraq and Kuwait before the invasion occurred, and I am talking in particular about the whole range of matters which go to the future security of the region about which Senator Hill spoke in his contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to questions about the presence or absence after the crisis is over of the United States and other foreign forces; questions about the presence or absence of Arab League forces operating as a buffer zone; questions about a possible negotiated conventional force reduction agreement in the region; and questions about a possible chemical weapons-and, indeed, even nuclear weapons-free zone arrangements for the region, all of which could well prove to be at least as much as in Iraq's longer term interest as everybody else's.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not part of the objectives of the UN, the United States, Australia or anybody else to demolish Iraq militarily. Some people would like to see that happen but it is not something that is necessarily required, I believe, by the situation if Iraq can be persuaded otherwise to peacefully withdraw. There will need to be some rethinking about the security arrangements in the region as a whole in the aftermath of such a withdrawal. There will need to be some guarantees that Iraq will not behave in this way again-not that it is likely to be minded to after experiencing the combined reaction of the international community in this instance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make that point because it is sometimes said-it has not been in today's debate-that Western or United Nations objectives will only really be satisfied if there is a military downsizing of Iraq, and that can only be accomplished by military action. That is not part of the objectives of this enterprise and, accordingly, a peaceful scenario is still very possible indeed. Certainly, as I have made clear, and as the Prime Minister and Senator Ray have made clear, the Australian Government hopes against hope that there will be a peaceful solution.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are in no doubts about the costs of a military action. We have no doubt that any military action-however quickly it can be accomplished-will be brutal and bloody. There is no foundation for believing that as few as 500 lives will be lost in such military action and no basis on which that figure has ever been put before us by the Office of National Assessments or anybody else. That particular press report, to which Senator Powell referred, was a complete furphy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We hope, as we always hope, that this will be capable of peaceful solution. But it is only capable of peaceful solution if Iraq understands the nature of the forces that are now amassed against it; if it understands the enormity of the breaches of international law that it has committed; and if it acts to avoid disaster for its own people. We hope it will.
       </para>
       <para>
        We express that hope, too, from the point of view of our own hostages and the hostages of so many other countries that are still trapped in that country and in Kuwait. Our policy reaction cannot be driven by that consideration and we know that that is well understood by the hostages themselves. But that does not mean that we are in any way forgetful, heartless or oblivious to the continuing human tragedy-it is a tragedy in some instances-of the position of those people of ours and other countries in Kuwait and their families back at home. We will continue to do everything we possibly can to get them out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia will go on acting as we have in this matter; we will go on holding together firmly with the international community; and we will go on supporting the United Nations in the kind of strategy that is now being mapped out. Simply, we believe that this is the best way of bringing this whole unhappy affair rapidly to an end. We believe that it is the best way of getting all our people out. We believe it is the best way of creating the conditions for a lasting peace-not only in the Gulf but, indeed, worldwide.

         —On 21 August this year this Parliament overwhelmingly supported a number of resolutions which condemned the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq as contrary to international law and morality; called upon Iraq to withdraw its forces unconditionally from Kuwait; affirmed the fundamental importance of the United Nations Charter as the basis for the conduct of international relations and the preservation of peace; welcomed the United Nations prompt and unprecedented action in adopting mandatory and comprehensive sanctions against Iraq to force it to comply with the United Nations decisions; and supported the Government's decision to send ships of the Royal Australian Navy to the Middle East to assist in enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The only exception to the overwhelming support of those resolutions in this chamber and in the other place was a qualification by the Australian Democrats in respect of support for the decision to send Royal Australian Navy ships. But other than that, they had the overwhelming support of the Parliament. As Senator Evans has pointed out, all parties in the Parliament have given strong support to the role of the United Nations in this whole sorry episode since 2 August this year when Iraq invaded and very rapidly occupied the whole of Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prior to the debate in this Parliament on 21 August, the Opposition had supported the decision of the Government made on 10 August this year to send a naval task force to the Gulf region for the purpose of enforcing the United Nations mandatory sanctions which had been imposed just a few days before by the Security Council on 6 August. The Opposition has consistently supported that decision that Australia should play a role in giving effect to the stand by the United Nations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is now the responsibility of this Parliament again to take note of a further development in the Middle East. Last week the United Nations passed another most important resolution. It has passed a series of resolutions since 6 August when it imposed mandatory sanctions. The most recent resolution authorises members of the United Nations to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the Security Council's previous resolutions on the crisis which substantially call for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and the release of hostages.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Security Council resolution of 29 November is only the second resolution of its kind in the history of the United Nations. The first was in 1950 when the United Nations called for the use, if necessary, of armed force against North Korea when that country invaded South Korea. However, last week's resolution is really much more significant than the 1950 resolution which was passed only because the Soviet Union, which has a veto, absented itself from the Council meeting.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, last week resolution 678 was sponsored, not just supported, by four of the five members of the Security Council. Never before has there been such international unity in opposing an act of aggression by one state against another. That is the important background to the decision made by the Government, which we are discussing in this debate. Resolution 678 also explicitly requested members of the United Nations to provide support and assistance for that resolution.
       </para>
       <para>
        For that reason alone, I think the situation is very different from some of the other cases to which Senator Powell referred when she said, `Why are we taking military action to enforce the United Nations decision? Why wasn't it be done in relation to Indonesia and Timor or China and Tibet?'. In none of these cases, over a period of 40 years, did the United Nations pass a resolution specifically of this character, nor did it request members of the United Nations to give their support. For that reason alone-of course there are many other reasons, which have already been well expressed by Senator Hill and Senator Evans in this debate-the significance of last week's resolution of the United Nations cannot be overemphasised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only is it significant in the sense that this is only the second time the United Nations has done this in over 40 years; it is also significant that the United Nations has so promptly in the post-Cold War era-as it is now referred to-taken the opportunity to achieve the purposes its founders had in mind at the end of the Second World War. By 1945, the world had experienced in the first half of the twentieth century the enormous convulsions of the first and second world wars. The determination of the world at that stage was to set up an international organisation to prevent, if possible, acts of international aggression or at least to minimise them as much as it could, to reverse the sorry history of the first half of the twentieth century and to reverse the whole history of mankind.
       </para>
       <para>
        The world had been brought to such a crisis by the first half of the twentieth century that high hopes were held that by supporting the United Nations the world might be able to prevent the sort of naked aggression which had occurred particularly in Europe and in our own region during the Second World War. It also had in mind the prevention of such acts of aggression; if they did occur, action would be taken by the entire international community at least to deter such acts but, if necessary, force would be used against such aggressors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those were the hopes with which the United Nations was founded 45 years ago. It is only now, in 1990, that those hopes have some possibility of realisation because shortly after 1945 the world was plunged into the long era of the Cold War. As a result of the situation that created, it was impossible for the United Nations to operate in the way it was envisaged it would. The most important aspect of the present position of the United Nations is the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union were two of the five member nations of the Security Council which supported this resolution. It is by that agreement that now mercifully has occurred that the world can hope to see the fruits of the work done by the founders of the United Nations.
       </para>
       <para>
        All the parties in this Parliament and in others around the world have been calling for the United Nations to have some effect. In this case the United Nations has taken action and it is absolutely vital that Australia play its part in responding to that action. The Government has made its decision in responding to that request, which has been outlined in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) now before the Senate and which we are asked to note. We have not been asked to pass a motion supporting it, as we were on 21 August. It may have been better had the Government done that, as it did before. Nevertheless the Opposition supports the Government's decision and would see its response to this statement to that effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision taken back in August, which was supported by this Parliament on 21 August, to send a naval task force comprising at that stage two frigates and a supply ship, HMAS Success, was put into effect. In fact as we debated the motion in August the ships were already on their way to the Gulf. They have been deployed there since early September doing the tasks they were assigned to do; namely, taking part in enforcing the United Nations mandatory sanctions. They have performed that role with distinction and dedication. The frigates were scheduled to return to Australia in any event and to be replaced by one other frigate and a guided missile destroyer, HMAS Brisbane. Those ships have now arrived in the Gulf and are in the process of taking over the role of enforcing United Nations sanctions which the frigates performed successfully, as we would have expected them to do, over the past three months. Had it not been for the decision of the United Nations last week, that role would have continued to be performed by the new vessels in that task force.
       </para>
       <para>
        On behalf of the Opposition, I take this opportunity to express its gratitude for, and acknowledgment of, the work done by members of the Australian Defence Force who have been deployed in that operation. Overwhelmingly they have been the officers and the crews on the ships themselves; however, there has been a small Army unit on HMAS Success and there have been two medical teams of 20 personnel which were also deployed in the Gulf in that capacity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has now decided to send two further medical teams to join their colleagues and give further assistance in this important work. It is really all of these members of the Australian Defence Force whom we must have in mind and whom we must congratulate and thank for their efforts. We confidently expect those people who have just arrived there to carry out their duty and perform their role with the same distinction as that given by those who are now returning to Australia. However, by the decision of the Government yesterday, which is set out in this statement, that role is now to change quite substantially. The role of enforcing a blockade was largely losing any significance as there were very few Iraqi ships left at sea to be the subject of that deployment. In light of the United Nations resolution last week and its request that, as a member of the United Nations, we take action, the Government has decided to change the nature of that deployment and deploy the new vessels in the task force in the Persian Gulf to exercise and operate with the other allied naval forces in preparation for the extended role which the Government sees as a likely and necessary result of the resolution of the United Nations last week. The ships will be there in their new role to prepare for and obtain the necessary training with the allied force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the statement says that, if necessary, they will be available to participate in any action which may be required of that allied force in the Gulf. We all hope that that conflict will not occur and that there will be a peaceful resolution. But if, after 15 January, that does not occur, it is clear that the role of the allied naval forces in the Gulf will be very different indeed from the one which they have been performing to date. Our ships and our men on them will of course have a different and very much more dangerous role to play. But it is one which we have every faith they will perform well, as the traditions of the Australian defence forces indicate that they are capable of performing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ships will of course be protected by their own weapons system, by being a part of the allied force which has a very powerful weapons system and also by the communications system operating between all of the ships of that force. So they will have very substantial protection indeed as a result of their being a part of a carrier battle group of the United States. Indeed, that in itself will give them added protection which will be far better than if they were operating on their own.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to refer to a matter which seems to have caused some doubt in the minds of many people, that is, what will be the nature of command of these vessels when they are deployed in this different and, indeed, more hazardous role. The Government has made it very clear that they will still remain under Australian command but that they may, in fact almost certainly will, operate in this allied naval force with ships of the United States, Britain and Canada and that that force will be under United States operational control. This is not a new experience for members of the Australian Defence Force. Indeed, as I have said, these Australian naval vessels have already had experience in exercising with United States and British ships. Of course, it will be a new experience for many of the sailors who, in the next few weeks, will be operating in the new portion of the Persian Gulf region.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage, the ships will be exercising in this way and the Prime Minister's statement says that these steps need to be taken because of the need for the forces to be fully prepared to play this larger role if conflict should break out. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        They do not formally commit Australian forces to any action; ADF units will remain at all times under Australian national command.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister may confirm this, but I understand that to mean that a further decision will need to be made by Australia or by the Australian command to commit our forces to any new form of action should conflict arise. If it does, their actual role, from hour to hour and minute to minute, will probably be under the control of the United States commander of that task force. This seems to me to be a sensible, perfectly workable and understandable arrangement, but it does of course mean that the Australian Government will have the ultimate say as to the particular tasks that our forces will perform, where they will perform them and for how long they will perform them. But I have no doubt that they will be performed as is required by the exigencies of any conflict in which they are engaged.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also have noted another point in the statement. I raised this matter in Question Time today and the Minister gave me an answer. The Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not proposed to make any other contribution to naval, air or ground forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        It had already been stated that the Government would expand the role of the three ships that are already there and send another two medical teams, so the Prime Minister's statement is made in that context. I trust that that does not mean that the Australian Government is completely ruling out any further contribution that Australia may be called upon or may be able to make. Those questions all need to be debated further, but I hope that the Government is not now under the influence and pressure of its Left and centre Left factions and is totally ruling out that Australia may make some further contribution depending, as I said, upon the exigencies of any conflict. I understood the Minister's answers to me today to be to that effect but perhaps, as he is following me in this debate, he will further elaborate on that particular matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by reiterating how fervently we all hope that this troubling matter will be resolved without war and that a peaceful solution will be found. However, it is clear that the best chance of that occurring is for a firm action and resolution to be made by the members of the United Nations; for Australia to perform the role the Government has assigned to it, with our support; for our own forces to be part of that allied force; and to work with it and perform what is undoubtedly a most important role and one which is worthy of the long and honourable traditions of the Australian Defence Force.

        <para in-line="1">
         —I congratulate Senator Hill, Senator Boswell, Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Durack for their contributions so far. I will begin my speech today by paying some tribute and reference to the previous role that our ships have played. The earlier decision of Government was to deploy those ships in the Gulf of Oman, which proved to be a critical area when it came to interdicting Iraqi ships. In many cases it was not possible to interdict Iraqi ships in the middle of the Persian Gulf-for obvious reasons, not the least of which were environmental concerns. Those ships that we, in our task force, committed to the Gulf of Oman were very active in the interdiction process. Many ships were interrogated. Several other ships were intercepted and searched to make sure that the naval blockade was effective.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We also found that the cooperation in the area, in which we were operating with other naval forces, was enormous. The cooperation between those ships proved that international action could work effectively. Just before I visited the Gulf region, many of the people ironically noted that the Argentinean and British ships were exercising together in the Gulf of Oman. At this stage, there were virtually no Iraqi ships trying to run the blockade. Most of the ships have in fact been laid up in other ports. Most of the ships have had their crews flown home. So that particular era in this saga is over. I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of our sailors on the Darwin, the Adelaide and the supply ship for their efforts in this regard. They have performed well. They have performed particularly well in terms of their interoperability with other navies in the area, and I believe they are to be thanked for their efforts. I appreciate Senator Durack's comment in regard to this.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the situation has changed. We now do have a direct request from the United Nations (UN). The decision of this Government was to authorise our naval task force to operate in the Persian Gulf. It was made very clear to the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) on his recent visit to Riyadh and Bahrain, in discussions with various military people in that region, that there is a shortage of escort ships in the naval build-up. It is in this particular role that Australia can make its most valuable contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian ships are highly suitable for operation in the Gulf. This is for a number of reasons. Firstly, we fit into the integrated air defence system. The type of missiles and the type of phalanx fighting system that exists on our ships makes it ideal for their presence in this particular part of the Gulf. The second reason why they are particularly suitable is the compatibility of communications. I am not going to go into a lot of detail, but I was very impressed with the real-time intelligence that our ships receive at the same time as every other ship from Canada, Britain and the United States in this area. This is a remarkable achievement of technology. I will not go into the details, but it does reinforce why the United States (US), the Canadians and the British will find our ships most welcome in the region. The third reason for the compatibility between the ships is that we regularly exercise with the US, the British and the Canadians, and many of the other naval assets in the Gulf have not been through that experience. Overall, this interoperability of the ships is absolutely crucial. For its staff it reduces the possibility of blue on blue; that is, taking a hit through friendly fire.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also want to say at this stage that it is not just the frigate and the destroyer that are playing a vital role here. It is also the supply ship, the Success. The Success has managed, not necessarily through Government regulation and direction, to be one of the most effective supply ships in the Middle East. I will not detail the intricacy of the deals that the captain has done on this particular ship to make sure the whole operation works well in the Gulf other than to say that he is now famous right throughout the Middle East for his methods that have achieved results.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that an early decision in regard to this matter, following the United Nations request, is absolutely crucial, both for planning and exercise purposes. Australia will be involved in the planning process and it is essential that our ships, if they are to operate in the environment of the northern Gulf, should exercise there rather than elsewhere in that region because the air environment and the sea environment are quite different from anywhere else. It is essential that they train and get used to that particular area.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have the situation, to which Senator Durack asked me to allude, that the ships will remain under Australian national command. We will be amending the rules of engagement and the operational guidelines, and these will be forwarded to the naval task force. Ships will be under the operational control of the overall task force commander-almost certainly to be someone from the United States. If there is any conflict with the rules of engagement and operational guidelines, this will be referred immediately to Australia. I do not expect that to be the case.

         —Almost. We do work along those lines, to answer the honourable senator's question. Again the operational guidelines would almost be the same. It would be in exceptional circumstances that our operational guidelines would not cover most contingencies. I do not mean this to be a harmful example, but if the operational commander suggested we fire on a neutral country, I would expect our commanders to seek our response to that particular request. I will, of course, make available to my colleague Senator Durack, the shadow Minister, for his perusal the rules of engagement and the operational guidelines. Operational control, however, is essential for both the purposes of coordination and the safety of ships.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I know that one of the big counter attacks on this particular arrangement is that we are simply the lap-dogs of the Americans; that we are placing our ships under US operational control. I say to those critics that if you believe in the safety of the ships, and if you believe in having a decent integrated air defence system, then you go under the coordination of the people best suited to do so. I know that in some quarters-I have not heard it here today but no doubt we will-it is said that these should be under some UN commander. I can tell the Senate now that if some Ruritanian commander is going to be put in charge and he does not understand these systems, we will have to seriously rethink that commitment to that particular region of the Gulf. So it is for the safety of the ships and decent coordination that we must have operational control.
       </para>
       <para>
        At no stage has the Government tried to mislead the public about the hazardous nature of this deployment. Whilst I am confident that our ships will return home, there is no invincible weapons platform in the world. What we have sought to do as a Government is to provide the necessary equipment to make those ships as invincible as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of a further commitment of medical teams, this derived very much from the CDF's visit to the area where, in discussions with both British and US military people there, they made it clear to him that there were some shortages in this area. The Senate will note that Australia has responded by sending two more teams to serve on one of the hospital ships where two teams currently serve. I also note for the record that New Zealand is making a contribution to medical teams in the Gulf region.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress that I believe that our commitment is about right. It is commensurate with our military size and our role in international affairs. I think to do less than we are doing would not do justice to the United Nations. To do a lot more at this stage would place us in a position of being far more heavily involved than other countries that could make an equal or greater contribution. Our actual contribution is tailored to meet two areas of major shortage; that is, in the medical area and in escort ships.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some people will probably ask, either in this debate or outside: why not other defence assets? I might address those arguments when they actually come to me. Essentially, the Australian defence forces in recent years have been configured for the defence of this country and not as expeditionary forces. To some extent there are not as many alternatives available now as there may have been in the past to use forces in an expeditionary sense. Rather than that being seen as a sense of failure, I take it as a sense of success. It indicates that the way we have configured our defence forces for the defence of this country is the right policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me turn to the contribution of Senator Powell. It did not take much prescience by me to remark after Senator Powell's speech here in August that, if the United Nations were to sanction the use of force in the Middle East, the Australian Democrats would change their minds. We have seen exactly that happen here today-they have changed their position. I want to give two quotations, but there are numerous quotes on the public record. In a media release on 10 August, Senator Powell stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Without UN approval, Australia has no legitimate military role in the Middle East.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will hold her and the Australian Democrats to that statement. They are now saying that we have a legitimate military role in the Middle East. If not, I want to know why they have changed their position. I refer to Senator Powell's speech on 21 August 1990. She stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats believe that as with the economic sanctions, so in the event of any military intervention the United Nations is the appropriate body to enforce that sort of action and to implement, indeed, that sort of action. We would place on the record the fact that, should that have been the case, then we would see it appropriate for Australia to fulfil its international obligation . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the same person who, in this chamber 1 1/2 hours ago, called for us to withdraw the ships in the Gulf region. Senator Powell went on to say a few other things. Firstly, she said-and this really did stun me-that the Democrats support the sanctions. I am not sure what she meant by that-whether she meant that in theory each country should apply a sanction to Iraq with no interdiction or anything else, or whether she has finally come on board three months late to support interdiction in the Gulf region. I would like the Democrats to make that clear because at no stage have they ever endorsed the multinational naval force which has enforced the sanctions. We then went on to have described to us that resolution 678 was, in fact, a matter of war expectation and that it was pushed by countries in expectation of going to war. Frankly, that is a ridiculous statement. If anything, resolution 678 has been more likely to crystallise the thinking of the Iraqis and more likely to bring about peace than any other single action so far.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats tell us that there is no easy solution. That is true, but what is their solution? Their solution is to withdraw the ships and negotiate for peace. If the Democrats had been in government in 1940-41 we would have finally concluded our negotiations when Hitler was holidaying on the Gold Coast. At some stage the Democrats must have some understanding of realpolitik. Good intentions and the Father Christmas philosophy do not apply in the real world. I will come back to that point later.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also had the furphy introduced here, clutching at straws: what about the report in the Sydney Morning Herald that only 500 people would in fact lose their lives in a two-week war? I have never seen such a report; I believe that it is simply an invention. I do not normally comment on security matters, but when something seems to me to be a total invention by the press, I think I am at least, from a credibility point of view, able to rule it out entirely.
       </para>
       <para>
        We then have the next introduction, as a distraction, of the nuclear weapons issue. This was introduced as a means of scare tactics in some way to weaken our credibility in the community. Guess what? Guess who was inserted into the debate as a credible witness in this matter? One Brian Toohey, the most embittered journalist. Brian Toohey has nothing on those opposite in terms of hating this Government, and he is introduced as the evidence in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        At least I can say to the Australian Democrats' credit today that they have not introduced two other matters: they have not re-run the conscription furphy that they got on their bike about a couple of weeks ago, and I must say that in terms of a distraction in the community it got a lot of mileage; and they have not argued about neutral, peace-loving New Zealand not wanting to help in this regard. The reason is that the previous Government and the current Government both had plans for some deployment to the Middle East. Once the writs were issued the previous Government could not take any action, but it was planning to do so. To its credit, the current Government of New Zealand has made-it does have very limited military resources-a valuable contribution in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most offensive thing that Senator Powell said, and I have to correct her on this, is that it was always intended that our ships have a more offensive role. I do not know how she has become a mind reader, but I can tell honourable senators that that is absolutely untrue. It is incumbent on every government to develop every potential scenario to meet every particular circumstance, but when the original commitment was made there was no intention for an offensive role in my mind, neither could I gather that from the intense conversations I had at the time with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans).
       </para>
       <para>
        In the end Senator Powell says that we should withdraw our ships and pursue peaceful means. What does that entail? Does that not entail negotiating with someone who will come to the table with good credentials? I will conclude on that basis. What are the credentials of the person in the other country with whom we are dealing? First of all, he invades a sovereign state and annexes it. That is a real nice guy to go and negotiate with!

         —The honourable senator is saying that. She has changed her position from August to now. I wonder what the motive is. In terms of the border dispute, the fact is that on three occasions in the last two decades Iraq has recognised the borders of Kuwait, the same as it recognised the border with Iran in 1975, went to war in 1980 and conceded the same boundary in 1990. That is the sort of consistency of negotiation that we are dealing with. The only cost on that switch of border position was one million lives! The other factor involved in this is Saddam Hussein's duplicitous behaviour days before the invasion of Kuwait, assuring Mubarak and everyone else that his intentions were peaceful. This is the person Senator Powell wants to go and negotiate with without any sort of strength behind her. He would just laugh her off like he laughed ex-Senator Haines and the rest of them off.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second matter I want to mention in regard to Iraq is that it does have a disproportionate military presence, much more than it would ever need for self-defence. It has an arsenal of ships, planes and missiles; it has one million men at arms compared with Australia's 100,000 servicemen, including reserves; for a country of the same population, it has 10 times our military personnel and it has only half our gross domestic product; and it has an arsenal of chemical warfare that is staggering. No-one is sure when it will realise its nuclear arms ambitions. I would not want to take a risk on that on Senator Powell's assessment that it will be in a few years time.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one looks at Iraq's internal organisation, one sees that it is a military dictatorship where opposition is never tolerated. Dissidents are routinely killed. Dissidents in the army and dissidents in the Government are never given a superannuation scheme-they are given a bullet in the back of the head. We know that this is a country capable of genocide. We know that this is a country capable of gassing its own people, as we saw with the treatment of the Kurds in Iraq. Nothing draws this to our attention more explicitly than the taking of civilian hostages and the sorts of scenes we have seen coming in and out of Baghdad in the last three months.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that Senator Evans laid out to this Senate that what we are seeing now is a possibility of a new world order; a world order, post-Cold War, where the United Nations original intention can be revitalised and revived. What we may be seeing now is a pretty tough investment but we may be seeing a far more peaceful world for it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I wish those who are representing Australia on the Success, the Sydney and the Brisbane well. I wish very much that they will not be involved in any conflict and that they can return to this country and be reunited with their families. But I know, from having talked to the crews of the three existing ships there, that they are all willing to do their duty to this country.

My purpose today, as shadow Minister for defence personnel and veterans' affairs, is somewhat different-that is, to talk about the impact of the Government's statement on our defence personnel. While the Government's statement says that the Government has committed ships, in actual fact it has committed our men and women-Army, Navy, reserve and regular-to serve in the national interest and in the international interest for the sake of peace. The statement says:

       <para>
        I hope that the Government really means what it says because it has a very poor track record when it comes to responsibility towards returned servicemen.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the Opposition supports the actions of the Government in sending and keeping our ships in the Gulf, we do have some serious personnel concerns which we have raised and which the Government, to date, has failed to answer. The Government, when speaking of the Defence Force, means an integrated force, that is, both regulars and reservists. That is the Government's own policy. Therefore, one would assume that any reserve allowances or conditions of service would have been worked out at the same time as those of the regulars.
       </para>
       <para>
        In an interview on the radio program PM on 14 August, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We've decided that the servicemen who are going to take part in the Gulf force, will be entitled to the highest level of service benefits which it is possible to give.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is simply not true because the Government, it would appear, has not even thought about the benefits to reservists. Minister Bilney, speaking in response to an Opposition member on the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill in the House of Representatives on 14 November, said that it was his advice that the situation of reservists called up for service in the Gulf will be the same as that of regular servicemen in the Gulf. But then he said that that is only if they are fulltime reservists.
       </para>
       <para>
        This raises two interesting questions. The medical reservists have not been officially called out in terms of the call-out legislation. Does this mean that because they are volunteers and have not been legally called out, they will be treated the way in which the Minister has indicated? Secondly, what is the definition of full time duty for this situation in the Gulf? In normal circumstances, a period of one year's full time duty is required for reservists to be eligible for regular conditions of service such as Defence Force retirement and death benefits compensation. The majority of reservists in the Gulf will not have one year's full time duty and, therefore, will not be eligible for such compensation.
       </para>
       <para>
        To the best of my knowledge, the only supplement available to medical officers to compensate them while they are rendering reserve service during a period of their absence from their civilian practices is the locum tenens allowance. Defence public relations told me only today, `We may be looking at that'. I would certainly hope so because it has not been updated since 31 March 1983 and it provides the princely sum of $22 a day to a medical officer in order to help put a locum into his or her practice.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one reads the qualifying service one sees that that allowance is only payable for attendance at a reserve camp or for continuous training at a military school, course, bivouac, naval ship or establishment during the year provided that the periods claimed do not exceed a total of 10 days in that year. So it does not even have a provision for reservists who are operating in a conflict or war situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Committee of the Whole on 13 November I questioned the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) about medical reservists who stood to lose up to $10,000 a month by way of fixed costs and overheads that they have already committed on their practices. I asked whether the Government intended to reimburse these reservists for those costs that they will have to meet, whether or not they are in their practices. The Minister did not have a satisfactory answer and none has been announced since. I find this lack of preparedness totally unacceptable and I challenge the Government to act on this issue immediately to set in place some clear guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill 1990, which will soon be before the Senate, waives the six-year initial service period for those regular servicemen serving in the Gulf. Yet, this does not apply to reservists unless they have had one year's period of full time duty. As I said before, this will not apply to reservists in the Gulf. Further, this legislation contains reversionary benefits allowing the surviving spouse of a regular serviceman who is killed still to be eligible for the loan calculated on his prospective service had he not been killed. This, it would appear, does not flow on to reservists in the same situation. Why are they so different in what is supposed to be an integrated force?
       </para>
       <para>
        This is compounded further by the fact that currently only female surviving spouses are eligible for benefits. If it is a woman who is killed while serving, her husband gets nothing. We have five women medics serving in the Gulf on the American hospital ships. What will happen if one of them is killed or disabled?
       </para>
       <para>
        Another issue relates to the Sex Discrimination Act which indicates that women are not to serve in combat zones. The Persian Gulf, being determined a combat zone, will have Australian women serving in it. What legislation will or will not cover their being there? This is yet another question the Government does not seem to have an answer for.
       </para>
       <para>
        Life assurance companies are indicating that they are reluctant to extend their cover to those who go to the Gulf. Has the Government addressed itself to this question? If so, what can be done about it? These are serious concerns. The fact remains that the Government has said nothing and done nothing about these issues despite calls from the Opposition and letters from reservists who are directly concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 9 August the Opposition issued a press release wishing God speed to naval personnel and welcomed the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the Government had faith that the equipment and training of the Australian naval personnel being sent to the Gulf would enable them to deal with whatever confronted them. In that same press release, I called on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to determine the allowances for the force and asked for clarification of the eligibility status for entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Problems have arisen in the past and I was very concerned that they be cleared up at the outset.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current crisis in the Gulf has highlighted to Australians the fact that war is never as far away as we might like to believe. Australian men and women who are currently serving in the Gulf will be feeling this more than anyone else. In serving their country in a crisis situation in the interests of all Australians, it is essential that they be secure in the knowledge that when they return to our shores they will receive full and proper recognition of their service.
       </para>
       <para>
        If any personnel are injured, they must be provided with full compensation and medical care. If-and it is to be hoped that such a tragedy does not occur-any service personnel are killed, their dependants must be properly compensated; that is, proper recognition of the debt all Australians owe to such servicemen must be accorded to their dependants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question which confronts this Government and which must be answered immediately is: what does it intend to do to ensure that current serving personnel on their return are not subject to the same anomalies and irregularities that veterans from previous wars have found themselves having to face? A question Gulf personnel will be asking themselves is, `If I should require help of any kind, how will I be looked after when I return home?'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Veterans around this country from previous conflicts are worried that this Government, over the last seven years, has been continually whittling away their entitlements and benefits. In addition, there remain significant anomalies in our repatriation system. The current Gulf crisis makes it more important than ever that these concerns be addressed and resolved.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have received assurances from the Government that if any Gulf personnel are seriously injured they will be fully compensated under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. If, for example, a Defence Force member were totally and permanently incapacitated, he or she would be eligible to receive the TPI pension and associated benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, such a devastating disability could mean years of special care being required of the spouse. If the member is a man, then subsequent to his death, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, his wife will be automatically entitled to a war widow's pension. This is only fitting. However, as I have already said, in the Gulf there are currently five women serving as part of a medical support team. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act as it stands, spouses of deceased female veterans who receive special disability rate pensions are not eligible for war widowers' pensions. These present legislative provisions relating to war widows' pensions obviously are derived from principles which were generally accepted at the time of World War I and subsequent operations, but this is 1990, and such sex discrimination is now unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a letter to a constituent dated 30 August this year, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Humphreys, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the question of extending the equivalent of war widows' pensions to husbands of female veterans where death was related to war service was considered at the time of drafting the VEA. The Government considered that, in view of the climate of financial restraint, no new categories of pension were to be created.
       </para>
       <para>
        He finished his letter with:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sorry that I do not have better news for you.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is this the Minister's message to the women risking their lives in the Gulf?
       </para>
       <para>
        I now move to the hospital care which personnel returning from the Gulf can expect to receive should they require it. In the past they could have been confident of high quality health care being delivered through their own repatriation system. At the very moment that Australia is committing further personnel to the Gulf the Government is seeking to have repatriation general hospitals integrated with the State health systems and their long queues and waiting lists. The Government has said that the veteran population is an ageing one and the numbers are dwindling rapidly. This is spurious because demand on hospital services by veterans will not peak until 1995-96. But returned personnel from the Gulf or indeed any other veteran should not be faced with the prospect of joining long State queues and receiving less than top quality health care, given the service they have rendered for their country. With the threat of war in the Gulf, it is now more important than ever that the Government recognise this.
       </para>
       <para>
        Gulf personnel would also be concerned at the very recent tabling by the Government of the third edition of the guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensions, which will restrict the ability of wounded veterans to have both medical impairment and the effects of this impairment on their lifestyle taken into account in the determination of a disability pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister, in his statement today, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . we cannot deny that the decisions we are taking are onerous indeed. Should it come to conflict, Australians may be involved in combat for the first time in nearly 20 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Twenty years ago Australia was committing troops to Vietnam in the interests of all Australians. On their return soldiers faced hostility and a lack of acceptance from their own people. Today Vietnam veterans are still fighting for recognition and compensation for the effects of agent orange. Twenty years later they are also seeking recognition for exposure to asbestos while serving on logistical support vessels such as the HMAS Sydney. We must ensure that returned service members from the Gulf are not fighting for their entitlements 20 years from now.
       </para>
       <para>
        The concerns that I have highlighted here are just some of the more important personnel issues facing the Government as a result of the statement made today. Personnel returning from the Gulf must be reassured that they will be accorded recognition and access to entitlements commensurate with the sacrifices they have made in serving their country. We in the Opposition salute these men and women who are serving our national interest. We also salute their families back home and recognise the worry and the strain that these months ahead will bring. We also welcome the news from the Minister for Defence that our New Zealand neighbours are sending a medical team. The size of its contribution is not what is important. The recognition that the nations of the world are standing shoulder to shoulder for the sake of world peace-that is what is important.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition agrees with the Government's decision to commit ships to the most recent development of the Gulf conflict. But, as I have said before, we have committed Australian men and women and it is most important that that commitment carry with it the responsibility of looking after the personnel that have been sent, whether they be regular or reserve, male or female. In 1946 Prime Minister Chifley said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Upon this national Parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done for those who served this nation in a time of war.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope, with all my heart, that this commitment that we support today will not end up as a commitment to war. If it is, this generation of Australians will not accept a lesser responsibility from this Parliament towards today's service men and women.

         —Unfortunately, what we have seen today in the chamber and in the other place is the Government and the Opposition joined together in this debate. This is another example of the `Laborials' at work. There is little or no difference between them except that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) would like Australian ground forces to go to the Gulf as well. Thankfully, that has been resisted. No wonder the majority of Australians are deserting the major parties. Their structures and decisions are increasingly irrelevant in the community. They are desperately serving up tired old rhetoric, which is increasingly unacceptable. Ask ordinary Australians now whether they want Australia to go to war in the Gulf and mostly they will say no.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I agree with Senator Newman, however, that, if this awful statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that we are debating here today results in Australians being engaged in combat in the Gulf, our service men and women there should be looked after. We should not be creating another generation of veterans who are not cared for by a careless government which is only too willing to commit the services of our young men and women to fighting foreign nations' wars.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Ray finished his speech with the amazing gobbledegook of a new world order. There is nothing new about the use of military force against an aggressor; there is nothing new about the threat to use the military. In fact, it is the same old world disorder that we are seeing played out on the world stage at the moment. There is nothing new or creative about it whatsoever. This is not the way for sane nations and sane people to solve disputes in these days of chemical and nuclear weapons, which have such devastating force and such devastating impact. It is absolutely outmoded to talk about war as a way of resolving this crisis and to say that war may bring peace.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite distressing to hear the negative arguments being put forward in support of the Prime Minister's motion and the illogical attempts by the Government and the Opposition to justify a war effort. Senator Robert Ray said that the multinational force is short of operational escort ships, that our ships fit into an air defence system, that we have compatibility with communications, that that is very impressive, that Australia regularly exercises with the United States, et al or, in other words, how jolly important we are and how jolly useful we are, how ANZUS has prepared us well for a war role, and how the United States plans to ensure that our warships have interoperability with theirs and will serve the US led force in the Gulf very well indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Ray also said that the rules of engagement and operational guidelines will be amended but that it is likely that the overall task force commander will almost certainly be from the US. If we want some expertise, that is probably the best place to find it. To ensure the safety of our personnel there, that is probably the sensible thing to do. I will finish, as Senator Ray intimated somebody might, with the suggestion that this should be under the control of the United Nations (UN) military command.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far in the debate today I have not yet heard, either in the Prime Minister's statement or in the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), any suggestion that United Nations military command committee is operational or that there is any intention to make it operational. It may well choose, if it becomes operational, to have a United States commander at its head. But it has not even gone through the process, not that I would sanction it even if it did. We have no justification for the Prime Minister deciding to upgrade the Australian contribution. No good reasons are given in his speech. I need to go through it and look at the more ridiculous things that the Prime Minister said in his speech, such as:
       </para>
       <para>
        In passing Resolution 678, the Security Council is not seeking war.
       </para>
       <para>
        We could say that, in not seeking war, we are just making it possible, that we are making it internationally palatable and that we are providing a framework for war, a legitimacy for killing. That is what resolution 678 is all about, and it is wrong. I do not care whether the United Nations Security Council agreed to it with two negative votes and one abstention. It is wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 3 of the speech, the Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Sanctions can be very powerful instruments of persuasion-as they have been in South Africa . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Right, Prime Minister, let the sanctions work. It took 12 years to find that the sanctions worked in South Africa. In the meantime, the black South African people have suffered and continue to suffer. The sanctions finally worked there without a military blockade to back them up. Why could not time have been allowed in the Gulf for the sanctions to work? The international community did support economic sanctions with humanitarian reservations against Iraq because nobody supports-well, very few support-the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. I certainly do not represent anybody who supports it. That sanctions path has not been allowed time to work. The Prime Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Resolution not only authorises all necessary means;-
       </para>
       <para>
        to use force-
       </para>
       <para>
        it explicitly requests that member states provide support.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are already doing that with the economic sanctions blockade. The United States military staff has not requested any further support. No request or any mention of any request has come from the United Nations military command-because it has not met-for member nations of the United Nations to upgrade their support or to be ready to fight under a United States command. It is still very unclear. Even if the United Nations did that, there would not be any sane person on the face of the earth who would want the type of war that might be unleashed in the Middle East-United Nations permission granted, or not. The Prime Minister continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The passage of Resolution 678 clearly requires us to consider whether we should extend the operational role of our task force . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I disagree. It does not. No way. In the light of the direct Australian interests which are engaged in the crisis, the only direct Australian interests engaged in the crisis are the lives of the Australian hostages, which this Government seems to be quite willing to put on the line. At a time when it was very possible that the hostages might have been released, the Prime Minister decides that it is time to upgrade the Australian engagement, the Australian forces, by putting our naval forces into the Gulf area. That could well jeopardise any chances that the Australian hostages have of getting out. That is absolutely deplorable. There is a total contradiction on page 7 of the Prime Minister's statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        Our ships will remain at all times under Australian national command.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet, in the next paragraph:
       </para>
       <para>
        Our ships will operate principally with troops of the US, Britain and Canada, under US operational control.
       </para>
       <para>
        For goodness sake, which is it? Finally, there is the admission I have been waiting for since 10 August when the Prime Minister first indicated that the Australian ships would be there. I knew that that admission would be made. I have been asking questions about this matter and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Defence have repeatedly said, `Oh, no, the ships will not be under US command'. Finally, they have had to admit that that is exactly the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The slide towards war has been very obvious to those who do not think that war is an option in this situation. What a cheek the Prime Minister had to say, on page 9 of his statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Government and people have no ill-will to the people of Iraq, and wish them no harm.
       </para>
       <para>
        How dare he say that we wish the people of Iraq no harm when we are prepared to engage in a military force which will unleash all types of terrible weapons and terrible suffering on the ordinary people of Iraq, who are not responsible for what their leader has done? How dare the Prime Minister make such a statement? It is cant and hypocrisy of the highest order.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister is like a little bully trying to elbow his way into the big league. Is he determined to slavishly support his mate in the White House to the extent of spilling Australian blood? Is this another test of nationhood like the slaughter at Gallipoli? That is how it is appearing. Mr Hawke knows full well that, to remain Prime Minister, he has to be in the good books of the President of the United States, whoever happens to be in the White House. He has demonstrated that consistently since day one of his Prime Ministership.
       </para>
       <para>
        I feel great sympathy for the families of Australian servicemen and women and fervently hope that all of those people, rushed to the Gulf at the Prime Minister's request, will return home safely. It is a sad scenario when we have old men, politicians, playing with the lives of young men and women. If the Prime Minister, the President of the US and others had to sit in the Saudi desert for months on end, the massive forces would not be there now. They blithely send young men and women off to do their dirty work.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the United Nations, its role and the sanctions. I have already said that the sanctions should have been given time to work. The latest resolution is very distressing. I take issue with the Foreign Minister when he says that some people, who have opposed the slide towards war, have said, `It would be all right if the United Nations were in charge'. We have not said that at all. The United Nations can make mistakes. I think resolution 678 is a grave mistake.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am disgusted at the hypocrisy displayed by the United States and Australia over the United Nations resolution 678 which authorises the use of force. The UN has lost a great deal of credibility because of the manipulation by the United States which wields considerable powers of influence over that body, leading to the view of it as a toothless, international watchdog. Of recent years, the UN had been reclaiming its international reputation as a peace broker. Unfortunately, this resolution damns that, but I hope not totally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has had a hand in supporting the United States at various times in history when it has vetoed resolutions on issues such as disarmament and peace, international law, terrorism, the Middle East and South Africa. They all add up to a record that is less than impressive. The Soviets and others have also used the power of veto regularly throughout the history of the United Nations. This is what is different now: they are not using the power of veto.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister piously quotes the United Nations resolution today in his speech and refers to the Korean war as a precedent in justifying Australia playing a competent role in the Gulf crisis. There are those who argue, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics among them, that the UN resolution to send forces to Korea in 1950 was illegal. They did not recognise it then and they do not recognise it now. United Nations analysts now say that this resolution is also illegal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ironically, the United Nations was suspiciously silent during the US historic forays into Indo-China, which certainly did not represent the liberation of people or the creation of democratic statehood. I will mention just a few cases of the US history of vetoes relating to the Middle East, going back just two years, to refresh the minds of my colleagues.
       </para>
       <para>
        In early 1988 the US vetoed a series of resolutions that condemned Israeli attacks on Lebanon, proposed a UN role in peace negotiations, and called on Israel to abide by the Geneva conventions. In October, the General Assembly condemned Israel for killing and wounding defenceless Palestinians by a vote of 103 to two. Guess which countries were the two who did not support that? Of course, they were the United States and Israel. In June 1989, the United States again vetoed a resolution deploring Israel's violation of Palestinian human rights. The US has vetoed 23 of 66 Security Council resolutions on these matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        To mention a few other important Middle East resolutions, the US was alone with Israel in opposing the General Assembly resolution calling for an end to hostilities when Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982. The United States vetoed the Security Council resolutions condemning Israel for ignoring the United Nations demand for withdrawal of its forces and calling for simultaneous withdrawal of Israeli and Palestinian armed forces from Beirut at a time when Israel was saturation bombing Beirut.
       </para>
       <para>
        More recently, the Security Council resolution on 23 December 1989 condemning the invasion of Panama by the United States was, of course, vetoed by the United States with British and French assistance, and that was the one which I may need to remind honourable senators about in which our Prime Minister intervened. The Australian Government delegation was going to support the condemnation of that aggression against Panama and Bob Hawke rang the Australian delegation and said: `No, we will vote with the Americans on that one, thanks very much'. That probably followed another phone call from George Bush.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United States performance in the United Nations has been less than impressive historically and could be noted for the blatant hypocrisy of its bleatings about maintaining democracy and sovereignty with regard to invasions of lesser powers. For example, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was bitterly censured, but the United Nations never took on the US after its forays into Indo-china. The US uses the United Nations when it suits and treats it with contempt at other times, to the extent of not paying its dues during the Reagan Administration, which nearly crippled the organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia should be more cautious about associating itself with UN resolutions gained through manipulation by the US considering its less than democratic performance. It is a sad day for the United Nations when it allows itself to be bullied, to be used in this disgraceful headlong rush towards war. It is as though the United Nations has set a date for World War III to begin if Iraq does not do what it is told.

        Of course, we then have the words of the Foreign Minister that the response to the naked aggression has been carefully modulated-an escalation of response towards aggression-and he keeps on using this ridiculous phrase about naked aggression. Is clothed or slightly less obvious aggression all right and more acceptable to the Australian Government? It would appear so, if we consider the Government's vote in the United Nations about the US invasion of Panama. It had some `excuse', some `justification'. That was clothed aggression, was it?

        The United Nations Security Council is wrong in this decision, and I am quite happy to say that. The United Nations will be constantly at war if it is seen as appropriate to allow the use of force in any resource disputes. There will be many of them in the future. Are we going to resort to the use of force every time? We will be constantly a world at war. That is why I cannot accept any notion that this is the heralding of a new international order. Finally, the United States is beginning to negotiate with Iraq. I suppose that is the only good thing that has happened in the last couple of days. This should have been happening since August; that is when it should have begun. Where is the United Nations mediating team in all of this? That is its role, to get in there and to mediate, to ensure that we do not slide into a war, instead of passing resolutions which legitimise war.

        I think the role of elected representatives in this country has to be clarified. This decision, which is the most important and far-reaching decision made in the life of any sitting parliamentary member, should be acknowledged for what it is: it is putting Australia onto a war footing. I do not think it is good enough for the Australian Labor Party to hide behind its factions and its caucus debate, which I gather this morning was pretty much a set piece because the decisions had all been made in the various factions yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not good enough for the people of Australia who voted for the Labor Party to have individual members hiding behind the Prime Minister and not coming out and saying what they think about it. Every one of them should be individually accountable. This is Australia on a war footing. I appeal to members of the Labor Party to do that for their own personal integrity. It is that which is on the line. The Labor Party's integrity has been shot to pieces long since, but the individual integrity of many members of the Labor Party may be redeemed if individual members have the guts-and I acknowledge that it would take a lot of guts-to say how they feel about Australia being put on a war footing by the party which got Australia out of the Vietnam morass. The biggest irony is that this is the same party which could be taking us into the most devastating conflict that the world has ever known.

        What we do not hear about is that war means death; it means death to ordinary citizens, probably hundreds of thousands of them. It is not going to be over in a matter of a couple of weeks. It is not going to be an easy victory for either side. There have been reports that one of the United States' latest shipments to the Gulf was 100,000 body bags and 10,000 units of blood plasma with a shelf life of 60 days. This was at the end of November, so their blood plasma units will be unuseable by the end of January. I think we have to take these things into account.
       </para>
       <para>
        Various people in the United States, senators included, have been asking for a confirmation of that from the Pentagon and of course they get the neither confirm nor deny treatment. They are not being told. I think it is pretty serious. There is also a dispute about the disposal of bodies. From a good source, I understand that the Saudis would not initially allow either burial in their country or export of bodies in body bags, that they would permit only cremation of non-Muslim casualties.
       </para>
       <para>
        This, of course, creates a big problem for the United States military. The disposal of bodies was being negotiated between the US and Saudi Arabia and a resolution was expected by the end of the year. Without this resolution, a war could not proceed. The American public would not stand for it; their boys not only dead, but also burnt in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. This is the kind of information that we really need to think about. It is dead bodies that we need to think about in a war. We should not be allowing this to be countenanced any further.
       </para>
       <para>
        The human cost would be terrible; the environmental cost would be huge. We should remember the lessons of Vietnam on both counts, and the costs of war in the Gulf are being ignored. Vietnam is still a mess environmentally, to say nothing of the social and psychological status of the people there who were abominably misused in that conflict. Their environment is unable to produce food for the people to live because it was so devastated by the chemical weapons that were used by the United States. Yet all we keep hearing all the time is about the Butcher of Baghdad who used chemical weapons on his own people. I admit that and I am not condoning it for one moment, but we must remember that it is not only the Iraqis who have used chemical weapons, the Americans have too and the Americans are the only ones who have used nuclear weapons as well, and they have 400 of those ready to go in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many actions around the world; ordinary people are speaking out against the possibility of war in the Middle East-thank goodness. From the Netherlands and Spain there are ships heading for the Gulf region. From Italy there is an Italian team presently in Iraq. From the United Kingdom the Gulf peace team has gone there and they are setting up peace camps on either side of the conflict zone. Whether that will help at all when the politicians make their decisions, I do not know, but I would hope that ordinary citizens who do not want war, placing themselves literally on the line, would have some impact on the decision making of the leaders, if it comes to the showdown.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we have to acknowledge that there is also a lot of domestic opposition in the United States. The President's first gung ho approach, the first military response, was very well received by the American people, but not so as time wears on. His support is decreasing rapidly. That is one reason why there is a 15 January deadline being imposed. It is too expensive for the Americans to keep people there indefinitely, and we do not know whether that is their intention, to have a United States permanent force there to monitor the oil wells and to have control of that region. I do not know the answer to that, but certainly United States domestic opposition to the war option is growing. George Bush knows that. If it comes to a debate in Congress, he may not have the permission of Congress to declare war. Of course, that will not stop him. They did not declare war in the Vietnam situation either.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Vietnam Veterans Association in the United States, which is a strong lobby, has made a very strong plea to the President. It has said, `Don't create another generation of veterans when the last generation has not been dealt with'. In the United States more Vietnam veterans have committed suicide since the end of that war than casualties in the war. A total of 60,000 of them have committed suicide because they were in such a mess after that war-an unpopular war. Those veterans were not well treated when they got back home; many of them were on drugs by then. They were social, psychological and physical wrecks, and 60,000 of them have committed suicide, which is more than were killed in combat in Vietnam. If that is not a lesson for the world's leaders when they think about war, I do not know what is. But it is a very strong plea for an alternative path to be taken-a very strong plea for a negotiated settlement.

        On Sunday, 2 December in many of the countries whose military forces are engaged in the blockade at the moment people gathered at war memorials to express their concern about the slide towards war. That happened in Perth where 100 people participated in a silent vigil at the Kings Park war memorial: `We do not want to see more dead people as a result of politicians' decisions'. It happened here in Canberra as well and probably in other parts of Australia which I have not heard about yet. The plea came from people at the Aldermaston peace camp in the United Kingdom and from the Greenham Common women's camp. They called on people in the countries that are participating in the military blockade not to allow their governments to go ahead with the United Nations legitimisation of the killing in the Gulf. They said, `Not in my name'. This was the plea of ordinary people, saying, `No, I do not support this war. I don't think that it should go ahead'. I quote from a poem by Justina Williams which was distributed at the vigil in Kings Park, Perth, Not in my Name:

        With thanks to Justina Williams. The opposition in the United States grows from the churches. The Catholic bishops conference in the United States has come out strongly and publicly against this. What about the church hierarchy in Australia? What are those people to say? I have not heard a word from them. Let them speak out, too. But the ordinary Christian people are speaking out very strongly, and I quote from a letter by Peter Akerman to the Archbishop of the Anglican fraternity:
       </para>
       <para>
        I don't believe the Christian criteria for a `just war' can be met either, mainly because the conflict is not winnable, and because of the huge slaughter of innocents that would ensue once the conflict escalates.
       </para>
       <para>
        I accept that the church as an institution, particularly the hierarchy, has to compromise its position to some extent with the established power of the privileged, if it is to survive in the temporal world, but this was not Jesus's way to victory as you are well aware.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe we have a very clear message to offer in this crisis and the only message that will matter in the end, which must be loudly proclaimed. We should support a position of containment, rather than violence for as long as it takes to achieve a fair and negotiated settlement in the Gulf.

         —Yes, of course. That is not contradictory at all. I am just saying that this is an ordinary Christian's point of view. There was a very strong and powerful action in Perth yesterday morning from Christians also. They dug graves on the causeway on the lead-in to Perth in peak hour traffic. They had white military crosses laid out and put into the ground. Two big graves were dug and the police did not quite know what to do about it. They stood there and watched while this was going on. One bus driver leant out of his window and said, `It shouldn't be you blokes digging the graves; it should be Bob Hawke digging them'. I concur with that sentiment. But the human cost, the human casualties, are never mentioned by the Government or the Opposition. I want to mention them loud and clear.

        Of course, a war will not solve the problem in the Middle East. Anybody who has looked at the history of the Middle East should understand that. A jihad-holy war-will rage, and not only in the Middle East. There could be terrorist attacks globally if this thing gets going. War is legalised, government-backed killing on a massive scale. The idea of it is anathema to a civilised society. We degrade ourselves totally, utterly and absolutely by killing, even in response to violence involved in the unacceptable aggression committed by Iraq on 2 August. Violence begets violence. We do the same to innocent Iraqis and Kuwaitis. We continue to commit heinous crimes if we allow that war to go ahead. It will not be in my name. We would be showing that we are no better than the Iraqi Government aggressors. Ours is a calculated and callous response, with the most damning consequences. Two wrongs do not make a right-they never have, and they never will.

        All the invading forces in the Middle East should be put on the agenda. Let us get everyone to a peace conference, as that is the beginning of the way to solve this crisis. That is what Saddam Hussein has been calling for for several months, and he has not been heard. Now, finally, the United States is willing to talk to the man and I think that is high time. We could cut out the killing phase and get straight on to the peace talks, because after a war there have to be peace talks anyway. After a war it is victor and vanquished discussing who will get which bit. Why not cut out the slaughter in the middle and get straight on to the peace phase? Otherwise another monster will be created. Wiping out Saddam Hussein will not stabilise the Middle East.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make a plea for restraint, not further confrontation. It will not solve the problem. Australia should have no part in the killing. How much more difficult it will be to withdraw later if and when the fighting starts. We are meant to be glad that the Prime Minister is not committing ground troops or substantially increasing Australian personnel there at the moment, but I think that is a very small mercy. This is the slide into war. It is how we began in Vietnam with just a few advisers, with the view, `Oh, no, we will not get involved in the fighting'. If the fighting goes on now, there is nothing surer than that Australia will be involved, and there will be Australian casualties.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a tragic decision of the Prime Minister's to send Australian ships into the war zone, ready for fighting. It comes hard on the heels of Senator Evans's deplorable statements about nuclear weapons: `No, we do not advocate their use; no we don't support their use--

         —I take no joy or comfort in standing here this afternoon in the Australian Parliament speaking to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about events in the Middle East. In fact, I wish that I was not here undertaking this task. But I am an elected representative of the people in my State, and that brings with it some responsibility. It brings with it a responsibility for me to represent the electors or the people and their dependants in my home State and with it, in turn, I have to be a representative of this nation. I do not take a narrow view of my role on this earth at the moment. I try to confine my thoughts to what is happening in my home State of Western Australia, but I think what happens outside the borders of my State and of this nation has an impact upon me and my family, my constituents and, indeed, all humankind.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are speaking this afternoon on a very serious statement, despite some of the comments and criticism that have been levelled at it. It relates to a very serious issue which has the potential to lead to a major conflict, a major armed struggle. That is not something I would welcome. Indeed, I will do whatever I possibly can to avoid it. I have had some small role as a member of parliament in trying to bring about a peaceful resolution to a potential conflict. It is only a minor role, but nonetheless it is a role I have taken together with my colleagues on all sides of this Parliament. It is a role that we have got to build on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, what we have done to date collectively has not borne fruit. We still have naked aggression taking place in the Middle East. We have seen one nation move in and take over another nation. As politicians and members of Parliament, I do not think any of us can stand idly by and allow that to happen or continue. We cannot be silent and acquiesce in that happening. This is irrespective of who initiates the action or which country the action is initiated against.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have enormous responsibilities. This Parliament has debated this conflict on many occasions. But, as I said earlier, we have not yet reached a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Our Government, in some cases with the support of other political parties and in some cases with perhaps criticism of some of its actions, has played a role in it. It has ensured that Australia has honoured its international obligations to bring about world peace and a direct resolution to this conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has run into some very great difficulties, none the least of which is the leader of the aggressor nation, Saddam Hussein. Over the four months since the occupation started, he has proved by his actions that he is not going to pack up his bags and move out of Kuwait. To ensure that he is not going to be pushed out, he has collected innocent human beings who have done no harm to him or to his fellow nationals, and he has held them as hostages.
       </para>
       <para>
        What brings it right home to us, as members of the Australian Parliament, is that some of these people are actually Australian nationals with family, dependants and loved ones here in Australia. And yet, they are being held by Hussein and his army to further his aim of becoming a major power in the Middle East. Indeed, his actions of a few years ago proved that he has aspirations in that regard. After realising that he could not win the useless war that was waged against Iran and in which there were over half a million casualties, he decided to settle and turn his attentions in another direction. I now quote from the Prime Minister's statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has been deeply concerned by the consequences for the Middle East as a whole if Iraq's aggression was allowed to stand. Who could doubt that having swallowed Kuwait, the stronger Iraq would not then turn on its other neighbours? Who will explain how Iraq could then be prevented from establishing a hegemony over the entire region; a hegemony backed not only by chemical weapons, but sooner or later by nuclear weapons as well?
       </para>
       <para>
        As Australians, whether we are in the Parliament or not, we cannot ignore the record of this particular man and the fact that his Government has obviously given him the authorisation to do what he has done. I do not think we can turn our backs and not do anything.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia has done a number of things. One of the areas in which Australia as a nation has acted is the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations has been oft times criticised for not being the effective organisation that perhaps it could have been. Indeed, perhaps senators on all sides of the chamber could cite particular areas of criticism. However, the United Nations exists and we have sought to use it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The United Nations acted very quickly in this conflict. On 2 August, the United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and demanded that Baghdad withdraw its forces. The vote for resolution 660 was 14 for, nil against with one country not participating. This was then followed by a further resolution on 6 August; a further resolution on 9 August; yet another one on 18 August; others on 26 August, 13 September and 16 September; and so on. Resolution 678, which is not a resolution of war or a declaration of war, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) Demands that Iraq comply fully with resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and decides, while maintaining all its decisions, to allow Iraq one final opportunity, as a pause of goodwill, to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        That resolution was carried on Friday of last week Australian time and already it has shown some results. An offer of negotiation was issued and, thankfully, that offer has already been taken up. We know that the Foreign Minister from Iraq will next week visit the United States for negotiations. We also know that the United States Secretary of State, James Baker, will visit Iraq in the week preceding Christmas-it might even be Christmas week. If resolution 678 is going to show such immediate results, I think the United Nations is now fulfilling the role for which it was established.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a very important deadline of 15 January next year, which is all but six short weeks away. A lot of work has got to be done. The greatest regret-and there are a number of regrets that we should not be doing this at all-is that if there were not an aggressor in the Middle East we would not need to be involved. Another big regret is that it has taken the threat of force, war or aggression to bring one very belligerent party-a man who is willing to hold innocent human beings as hostages to facilitate his quest for immortality, power, wealth or whatever his particular aims are-to the negotiation table. It is something that I do not enjoy. Indeed, I do not believe that any of the nations who were involved in the Security Council will take great joy from this success.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real success will be when Iraq withdraws from Kuwait and when other matters that are in dispute in that region are settled through a peaceful process. We all know, because we are all adult and grown up, that we have to act sometimes by cajoling, sometimes by the use of force and sometimes even by threatening to use force in order to achieve objectives. It is a pity that it has reached this point. I am certainly hopeful that our efforts will be successful.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the interim, we wish the Australian personnel who are playing their role by serving on those Australian ships well. We also wish their worried families in Australia well. We certainly hope for an immediate peaceful solution.

         —I have much pleasure in supporting my colleagues on this side of the chamber in the National Party and the Liberal Party in their support for the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Gulf crisis, which was tabled this afternoon. I am personally very conscious of the importance of that statement. I am also very conscious of the grave implications and consequences that can flow from it. I do not shrink from them. The nations of the world are faced with as blatant an act of gross lawlessness as we have seen in recent times, and through the United Nations they are taking the correct approach to resolve that problem. The Prime Minister's statement is upholding the charter of the United Nations, which is the rule of international law. Beyond that it is support for the United Nations and those great and noble ideals which led to the United Nations being founded in 1945.

        Like the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), at the outset I would like to praise the crews of the Australian ships that have been on service in the Gulf for the past l7 or so weeks. The crews of HMAS Darwin, HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Success, and the medical teams, have served in the exemplary manner that we have come to expect from Australian service men and women. They are there because at 2 o'clock on the morning of 2 August Iraq chose to invade, without any provocation at all, its peaceful neighbour, Kuwait.

The Iraqi Air Force bombed and rocketed Kuwaiti airfields; helicopter gunships attacked Kuwait City and landed at least a brigade of Republican Guards special forces with light armour in an assault against the palace and main government buildings. The forces employed exceeded 100,000 soldiers with 1,250 tanks plus armoured personnel carriers and artillery. Their only opposition was the Kuwaiti Army which was numerically around one-tenth of the Iraqi force. The Kuwaiti forces were not deployed defensively at the time of the attack.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is estimated now that the Iraqi forces in Kuwait exceed 450,000 men, with between 2,000 and 3,000 tanks. For the past four months they have been assiduously preparing defensive fortifications in strategic areas in Kuwait-pouring concrete, building tank traps and digging ditches they can fill with oil to set alight in the event of an attack.

        Without provocation, one country invaded another and seized its entire territory and incorporated it into its own state. It expelled the legitimate government ruling that country and set up its own puppet regime. Since then it has systematically plundered all the assets of that state. It has harassed and quite probably murdered many hundreds of its citizens. In addition, it has resorted to the most barbaric of actions by holding as hostage any national of a third country who was present in either Iraq or Kuwait at the time the invasion took place. It has held those hostages as a bargaining chip, as terrorists do, to try to justify and maintain its position as the usurper of the seized territories. Above all, as I said before, it is an act of unprovoked aggression. There are no shades of grey about this. Very often disputes arise in history where both parties contribute to them, but in this case the issues are black and white. It was an act of unprovoked assault on a peaceful neighbour.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is relevant to consider a bit of history here because Iraq claims that Kuwait is part of it. The border between Kuwait and Iraq was drawn up in 1923. All of that part of the world was part of the Ottoman Empire and was ruled for hundreds of years by the Turks. The British and the French were given administration of that area by the League of Nations nearly 70 years ago. Britain's involvement with Kuwait goes back centuries before that; it goes back to the eighteenth century. Of course, the al-Sabah family, whose descendants were ruling Kuwait when it was invaded, have been the legitimate rulers of that territory since the time Australia was settled over 200 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        Iraq itself was created by British fiat in 1932 as an independent state. Kuwait remained a British protectorate until 1961 when the British withdrew. Iraq then moved opportunistically to seize Kuwait; it was deterred because the British very promptly moved back in military strength. The British stayed there only so long as it took for the Arab League to come in with its own military forces and Iraq was dissuaded from proceeding with its claims against Kuwait at the time. In 1963 Iraq formally recognised the Kuwaiti border.
       </para>
       <para>
        Among the many statements being made by Saddam Hussein is the claim that somehow or other Kuwait is an illegal state because its borders were drawn up by a colonial power-that is, Britain-some years ago. That same argument applies to every state in the region. If it is a valid argument against Kuwait, it means that the borders of Iraq are also illegal and illegitimate, of Saudi Arabia and all the Trucial States in the area. However, that is not the point at law, which is beyond dispute and which is that Kuwait is a sovereign state, Iraq is a sovereign state, and Saudi Arabia and all the other countries, however their borders might have been derived, are legal entities and are entitled to enjoy their own sovereignty.

        In 1980 war broke out between Iraq and Iran. It was a particularly brutal and bloody war. No wars are pleasant but that one took us back to the horrors of earlier centuries in the way the carnage mounted and because of the fixed defences, the attacks of one army against another, the poverty of medical attention and the general lack of hygiene and resources to look after the injured. It is estimated that nearly one million citizens and soldiers of Iraq and Iran died in those terrible eight years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Throughout that war Kuwait made loans to Iraq as its neighbour. In 1988 Iraq sued for peace with Iran and later took up talks with Kuwait about repayment of the loans. It did not want to repay the billions of dollars that it owed Kuwait and it also wanted to increase the price of crude oil so that its financial position could be improved. Kuwait, being a much bigger oil producer, had a very much bigger share of the world market than Iraq.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those talks, as the Minister for Defence accurately pointed out, were under way when the invasion took place. Prior to the invasion on 2 August, Iraq had given explicit and categorical assurances that it had no intention of invading Kuwait. A matter of weeks before it invaded its neighbouring territory Iraq had given these undertakings to Egypt and Syria.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is against this background that the present actions of the Government and the United Nations have to be considered. Two things happened after the invasion: the first was that the United Nations responded with very great rapidity. For four months in 1983, I had the privilege to serve in the United Nations as one of the parliamentary delegates to the General Assembly. There might be difficulties in embarking on the normal course of diplomatic activities where one nation talks to another but, where multilateral negotiations are involved-something like 168 nations were involved in the United Nations when I was there and there would be more now-it is extraordinarily difficult to move anything along quickly because of the differing points of view of all the nations that are represented. It takes time, and it is very hard to get agreement on anything. But to its credit, the United Nations responded on the same day that the invasion took place. It passed its first resolution condemning Iraq for invading Kuwait and called for its withdrawal from that territory and the restitution of the Kuwaiti Government. A series of resolutions passed through the United Nations leading up to the one that was passed at the end of last week, which initiated the statement from the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those resolutions from the United Nations Security Council reiterated the position that it took initially, and firmed it up. It provided for the sanctions to be applied and for a blockade to be put on supplies to and from Iraq. It provided for the provision of humanitarian aid-food supplies in the event of starvation and medical supplies-but with the proviso that the United Nations was to decide whether or not it was a humanitarian case. Finally, we reached the stage last week where resolution 678 was passed which gave the Iraqis an ultimatum to withdraw from the territory and to free the hostages by 15 January or face the consequences of military intervention.
       </para>
       <para>
        The two senators who have spoken so far in this long debate and who have been opposed to the Government's action seem to hold the somewhat misguided view that the United Nations resolution somehow lacks the authority of law. That simply is not so. It is perfectly within the charter of the United Nations and perfectly within the legal system in every sense. It is quite a proper exercise of the United Nation's power for it to have taken this action.
       </para>
       <para>
        Parallel to the United Nations actions, the United States responded to an appeal from Saudi Arabia and from Kuwait for military support. The Americans, again perfectly legally, operated on their own, initially to guarantee the security of Saudi Arabia in that area and, as well, have complied completely with the legalities of the United Nations determinations. I would suggest to those people who do not understand it that they should get a copy of the United Nations Charter and look at chapter 7, which I have with me. It deals with action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. That chapter starts at article 39. Article 51 reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        Nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 51 covers the initial actions with respect to the Gulf emergency and, later, as the Prime Minister points out so lucidly in his statement, the Charter provides that military force shall be used in the appropriate circumstances, and the present circumstances are clearly appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have to have a rule of law. Every nation on earth has internal laws for its own operations. It also has a police force to enforce them because laws without the means of enforcement and punishment are held in contempt. Just as every nation has an internal set of laws for its own affairs, we ought to have a set of international laws governing the affairs of the nations of the world. I do not want to live in a world where the strength of the military machine in one country dominates my country. I do not believe that that is the goal that citizens want extended into the future. That has happened through the centuries-through the millennia-and we now have the opportunity, with the ending of the Cold War, for the United Nations to uphold the rule of international law with respect to sovereignty, without the threat of the veto, and to see that the relationships and disputes between nations of the world are resolved peaceably. That is what this motion is all about-the peaceful resolution of conflict, being able to put a system in place which will avoid a resort to armed force in future disputes. That is why it is so important that Australia support this motion and get right behind it in every way that it can.
       </para>
       <para>
        The actions taken by the present Government have been impeccably correct all the way along the line. The Government was correct initially in responding rapidly and meeting the need at the time, which was to dispatch ships to enforce sanctions on Iraq, and it is correct in what it does today in recognising that the interdiction phase for those ships has now passed, because there is very little sea traffic going into or out of Iraq. It commits the Royal Australian Navy to a far more active role. In the words of Paul Jones, the father of the United States Navy, they are going in harm's way when they go as part of a carrier battle group into the Persian Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are very conscious of the dangers that those ships and their crews will face there. They will face real danger from air attack and a real danger from mine warfare, but I am quite confident that they will discharge their duties with all of the skill and dedication that the Australian services have shown in previous generations. The arrangements that the Government has outlined for command and control also seem to be perfectly appropriate. Australia will maintain a national overall control of the ships and define their general operational tasks, while the specific operational control will rest with the American battle group that they are with. It really cannot operate in any other way.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was very pleased to hear the Minister respond to my interjection during his speech and say that the rules of engagement for Australian ships would be almost the same as the rules of engagement for the American ships because, if one is operating in a battle group, it is absolutely essential that there are not mistaken views as to what is and what is not the situation with respect to self-defence or opening fire.
       </para>
       <para>
        That brings me to the United Nations' strategy. The United Nations, quite simply, is seeking to force Iraq to withdraw its forces by demonstrating both overwhelming military power and a clear and unwavering intention to use it if the deadline is not met. By doing that, it will avoid the use of force and having to put its powers which it has resolved to use into effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        We can see some results of that already. Saddam Hussein has been one of the most intransigent of leaders, not prepared to talk to anyone despite what Senator Vallentine hallucinates about. Yet since the resolution passed through the United Nations last week there has been agreement that the Iraqi Foreign Minister will go and talk to the American President and that the American Secretary of State will go to Iraq. I hope that leads somewhere. I would hope that leads to further and more productive talks by 15 January.
       </para>
       <para>
        I recognise that the policy the United Nations has embarked upon is highly dangerous. But we now have to see it through. We are adults, and as adults we know that life cannot be lived without risk or danger. Certainly risk and danger are very much part of the course we are following at the present time. Of course, what we try to do is minimise, by all means that are open to us, the dangers that are inherent in it. None of us can foresee the outcome of the path we have embarked on. We all hope that hostilities will not take place, but if hostilities do take place there is certain to be a price to be paid. It will be a very high price, because it will be in human lives, and they cannot be measured. But our strategy is to avoid war, the use of armed force. We do that by being absolutely determined in the path that we are going to follow and to be there with as much military force as we can at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        My criticism of the Government action is that since the strategy of the whole exercise is to put as much show of force as possible into the situation to compel Iraq to withdraw, the Government should find more resources to commit to the Australian component of that force. The sad part, of course, is that the Minister conceded that we do not have much more to give. For a nation of 17 million people, which spends about $8 billion a year on defence, that is a tragic confession for the Minister to have made here this afternoon. He tried to gild the lily by saying that he took it as a compliment that we could not send more because the forces now were designed for Australia's self-defence and, therefore, they were not applicable in other theatres.

         —As Senator Newman has said, we certainly need to spend more because the reason the forces cannot be committed is that the defence vote has been too low for too long; for so long that we have designed scenarios to fit what the Government has been prepared to pay for defence. We now have an army that we cannot use in war-although it is the largest of the three services-except for limited incursions, light scales. We do not have one army unit trained which we could put into the field, effectively, in a conventional battle. It is a fatal tragedy to be training defence forces for roles rather than training them professionally as an army, a navy and an air force with the range of skills that they must have.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the Navy we have only four ships that can be safely dispatched to that area. Two more could be brought up if money was spent on them. But there are only six ships at best-four in reality at present. It is incredible. I have already dealt with the Army. There are simply no suitably trained and equipped troops to take part in land operations if they take place in Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is only in the air that we can make a contribution. It is there that I think we ought to be sending some of our own forces, because the one place where Iraq is vulnerable is in the air. We can make a very real contribution there. The naval forces are important, supporting the carrier battle group in a defensive role, but it is the air wing of the battle group which is the critical part of the naval wing. With No. 1 Squadron, with its pavetack equipped F111 aircraft, we could make a very tangible contribution to the American strike capacity in the air in that region. In my judgment there is a very sound case to be argued for the commitment of at least one Royal Australian Air Force squadron there to support the already large air strike capability that is in the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of my other concerns is that if it does go to the use of armed force to resolve this issue, there must be no political interference at all in the military operation. Critics of what the Government is doing talk about another Vietnam. That is absolute nonsense. But if we get politicians trying to tell generals what to do in the field, we could end up with the same sort of situation that we had in Vietnam, where certain targets, for political reasons, were declared off limits. I have a fear that politicians may say that since the object of the exercise is to get Iraq out of Kuwait, operations will have to be confined to land operations in Kuwait itself. Nothing could be more bloody, more protracted or more disastrous than an assault on the well prepared, well defended Iraqi positions that have now been four months in preparation in Kuwait. The principal objective must be to gain air superiority in the short term and then to go around, isolate and let any forces of the Iraqis in Kuwait that have not surrendered wither on the vine. Let me deal with the case that has been raised in this chamber against the Government's action. First of all, we have had the far Left which has been trying to extract promises from the Government -fortunately they have not come from the Government-that there will be a cap on the Australian commitment. The Government, quite correctly, has resisted this because no-one knows what is going to eventuate. I have to say on this point that the Left has been morally incoherent, because if its members can justify supporting the present operations, they can justify seeing it right through.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine, I think that Senator Ray dealt with them quite adequately. All I could say about the plea from the honourable senator who spoke for the Democrats, who said that we ought to wait for four or five years, is that justice deferred really is justice denied, and justice needs to be seen to be done in this circumstance. It really is a variation of the old theme that he who feeds the crocodile thinks that he will never be eaten, but history shows that that is not true.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the points I want to deal with is one that I have met when interviewed by the media. They ask the question, `How many Australian lives is Kuwait worth?'. That is putting the question around the wrong way because the cost is in relation to the value. The value that we are seeking here is the upholding of an international rule of law, respect for the sovereignty of nations, and if we can make the United Nations Charter work the way the founders of it anticipated 45 years ago, then whatever the price we pay now is well worth paying.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I was at the United Nations, in 1983, I was privileged to hear an address by General Carlos P. Romulo, who at the time was the only surviving signatory to the group which signed the original United Nations Charter in 1945. He spoke of those ideals that led them to form the United Nations in those years. I believe that he would approve enthusiastically of what the United Nations is now doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final point I want to comment on is the rather specious argument of Senator Vallentine about Christians. Some while ago, in September, I was in the United Kingdom Parliament for the emergency debate on the Gulf crisis and the Archbishop of Canterbury had this to say:

        The scriptures speak of our responsibility for seeking justice and the well-being of creation in the world as it exists. The hard fact is that the use of force is caused as much by human virtues-our sense of justice; our belief in the difference between right and wrong; our readiness for self-sacrifice on behalf of others-as it is by any of our failures.

         —In the interests of time, the Australian Democrats were to have only one speaker on the motion to take note of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Unfortunately, having listened to various speakers and having been invited by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to respond on various issues which he raised, I would like to make just a few points. I will not take much of the Senate's time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Firstly, it is obvious from most of the early contributions that few of those speakers actually listened to Senator Powell's outline of the Democrats' position on this statement before condemning the Democrats on that stand. One could be forgiven for concluding that most of the gratuitous and paternalistic statements about the Democrats' attitude were written before Senator Powell made her statement, because they bear little or no relation to what she said. I recommend to honourable senators that they read the statement in Hansard if they want to know what the Democrats' stand is.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Gareth Evans claimed that the Democrats' support for a United Nations (UN) role in the Middle East crisis was inconsistent with our stance against war. There is no doubt that United Nations Security Council resolution 678 authorises the possible use of military force after 15 January next year, but there is also no doubt that the resolution sets no timetable for military action. To wait a further 12 months or even six months for sanctions to work would be completely consistent with the UN's wishes on this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Democrats do support a role for the UN. However, the UN's resolutions on sensitive issues such as sanctions enforcement and the use of force have been open to a range of interpretations to suit national preferences. There is nothing in resolution 678 which compels Australia to follow the United States interpretation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Ray criticised the Democrats' unwillingness to support the enforcement of sanctions as evidence that we support sanctions in theory but not in practice. This is based on the entirely false assumption that, in the absence of naval enforcement, the sanctions would have failed completely. Do we need to remind Senator Ray yet again that the sanctions began to take effect before the naval force assembled in the Gulf? Do we need to point out that the Prime Minister himself conceded that South Africa did respond to sanctions? There was no naval blockade there.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the early stages of the conflict, diplomatic pressure was successful in persuading countries such as Yemen from breaking the sanctions. There may have been some extra leakage in the absence of enforcement, but there is no evidence that this would have been significant. But if it had been, then we have no doubt that the Security Council would have been capable of initiating and coordinating a small naval force to enforce sanctions, and we would have supported such a move. The fact that this did not happen suggests that there was simply no need. I should reiterate that the Democrats support the continuation of nuclear, chemical and military sanctions against Iraq after it withdraws from Kuwait to make doubly sure that there is no repetition of this act of aggression.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last point I would like to make is that Senator Ray was particularly offensive in claiming that the Democrats would have supported a policy of appeasement towards Hitler. Our support for the most comprehensive sanctions in history in no way equates with appeasement. It is blindingly obvious that Iraq is on the road to economic ruin. No such straitjacket was applied to Hitler's Germany, which in any case had a far greater domestic industrial base on which to support its military expansionism.
       </para>
       <para>
        The issue is not whether we should appease Iraq; it is whether we should kill tens of thousands of foreigners, Kuwaitis, Iraqis and Western service men and women rather than wait for sanctions to work while exacting a much lower toll. The issue is whether the prospects for a long term Middle East peace would be enhanced by a more patient and a more peaceful approach.

         —I want to make a few remarks tonight on the Government statement that was tabled in the Senate. First of all, I clearly indicate my support for the statement. I have been involved in many of the discussions in the Australian Labor Party and in the Government over this issue since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August, and I have been supportive of the measures the Government has taken at each of those stages.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I believe that Australia responded correctly initially in deploying a naval force in the Gulf of Oman, and I think that was a very successful deployment. It indicated that we, as a middle sized power, were willing to indicate our support for the United Nations (UN) resolutions that existed then and that we, as part of the Western democracies, would oppose the naked aggression of one country against another. I certainly support this so-called second deployment, this upgraded or advanced deployment where naval ships will now be placed inside the Persian Gulf. Quite clearly, if there are hostilities the naval ships would be at much greater risk than if they had stayed in the Gulf of Oman, but I think that risk is commensurate with the role that Australia has played in this issue and with our international role as a middle sized power not just in our region but in general world affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Many people have commented that we should be playing a similar role to that which we have been playing in Cambodia in promoting a peace agreement and putting forward a proposal to get peace in that unfortunate country. I do not find what Australia is doing in the Gulf in any way contradictory to what it is doing in Cambodia. The situation in both places is different, but in both places we are supporting a settlement that guarantees the security of a sovereign country. In Cambodia it is Cambodia, and in the Gulf it is Kuwait. I believe that the decisions taken by the Australian Government are entirely appropriate for the role that we have taken for ourselves and which we should be playing as a middle sized power. We should not be shrinking violets in stating that position and we should not overstate our influence in world affairs, but I think we have the measure about right.
       </para>
       <para>
        I certainly believe that there is no need for Australia to increase the size of its deployment in the present circumstances. There would have to be a substantial and dramatic change in circumstances for Australia to contemplate any further extension of its present forces in the Gulf. When one compares Australia's response with those of most similar countries in the world, ours is about right and I think other countries should take our lead. If middle sized countries like Australia and the world responded as we have across the board, I think there would be an even stronger presence in the Gulf against the aggression of the Iraqis.
       </para>
       <para>
        My main comments tonight concern the role of the UN. I know that in the initial stages, in the first month of this crisis, there was much comment to the effect that the response from the West was totally inspired by the United States Administration and that this would lead us into an incremental arrangement whereby step by step we would fall into a war similar to the way in which the Americans involved themselves, Australia and other countries in the West in the war in Vietnam. I do not believe that the analogy in any way is correct, for one very simple reason: at no stage in the whole history of the sorry Vietnam war did the UN ever carry a resolution supporting the involvement of the Americans, the Australians, the New Zealanders, the Koreans, and so on. It never declared its support for such an involvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Gulf crisis over the last 3 1/2 months we have had a number of UN resolutions-I think there are now about 10-which are all absolutely clear-cut in their total opposition to the aggression of Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi forces in invading Kuwait. They have been unequivocal in their denunciation of the invasion, calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Last week we had a UN resolution-only the second time in its history, as I understand it-enabling member states to take all necessary action against Iraq if by 15 January it has not begun to withdraw its troops from Kuwait.

        Many people say that this is a declaration of war and that we should not be involved in war. I do not think that anybody in his right mind, in the pure sense, would ever support war. But occasionally the hard and tough decisions have to be made. It is better to bite the bullet early rather than let it pass by and find that we are in a much more difficult situation. The 1930s show, again and again, that if the Western powers had not kowtowed but rather had stood up to Hitler when he marched into the Rhineland, Austria and Czechoslovakia and especially in the Munich crisis of 1938, the Second World War probably would not have occurred in the way that it did.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know some people say when I use that analogy that that is what the Americans used to justify their involvement in Vietnam. I believe it was a totally false analogy that the Americans used to justify that involvement. The situation in Vietnam was a civil war which had undercurrents of nationalism and anti-colonialism. It was not an aggression from an outside country against another; it was an internal matter which, in my view, the Americans totally misread and, unfortunately, convinced our country-our government of the day-to be involved. I do believe the analogy of the 1930s and the way the West did not stand up to Adolf Hitler is, in a number of ways, applicable to the Gulf situation where one country, without hesitation, marched in, invaded, occupied and annexed another country to its own territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think in the longer term the great hope of this crisis is that for the first time since the United Nations was founded it is acting as the founders hoped it would act-as a force to stop aggression by recalcitrant countries. I note that the statement of the Government quotes on two occasions the remarks of Dr Evatt, the Foreign Minister of the then Chifley Labor Government and also the first President of the General Assembly of the United Nations. On page 6, the Government's statement says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Evatt, who as Australia's Foreign Minister played a leading role in establishing the UN, said in the House-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the House of Representatives-
       </para>
       <para>
        in 1945 that if economic or diplomatic sanctions ``are deemed inappropriate to the situation or prove ineffective, the Security Council may take any military action necessary to suppress the aggressor.''
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement further says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Evatt recognised not only that aggression must be resisted, wherever it occurs, and by armed force if need be. He also recognised that all nations must be prepared to contribute to that task. As he said in 1945:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``It must be made crystal clear that the nations seeking representation in the world organisation must be prepared to contribute their share of physical force to restrain the action of proved aggressors.''
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that aggression has been proved against Iraq. It has been proved against its leader, Saddam Hussein. There can be no argument-and I do not even find comments from the Australian Democrats or anybody else, disputing the fact-that overt aggression has occurred. The dispute seems to be from some people in Australia about the response we should make.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Evatt, who helped draft the charter of the United Nations, makes it quite clear that there is a military response appropriate to aggression, and that is what the United Nations Security Council carried last week in its resolution. It called on the member countries, in conjunction and consultation with the Government of Kuwait, to take all necessary action to overcome that aggression. It was made quite clear that, if need be, that includes military force.
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one wants war. Certainly I, no more than anybody else, do not want to see war and the consequent casualties that would occur. I have no doubt that if war breaks out in the Gulf the casualties will not be light. They will be significant and they will be horrible. With hundreds of thousands of soldiers on either side and the array of modern weapons that both sides have, one can only anticipate that the number of casualties will be severe. Unfortunately, there is a risk that some of those casualties could be-and I say could be-Australians who are on the Royal Australian Navy ships in that part of the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        The real point is that at long last the United Nations is acting as we, Dr Evatt and most middle powers wanted it to act when it was established in 1945-as a basis of protection for one country against the aggression of another. Now that the Cold War is at an end after some 45 years, in some senses we should cheer the fact that the United Nations Security Council was able to make a decision to, if necessary, invoke the military option without a veto being used by one of the P5 in the Security Council. It has happened only once before. This was when the Korean War broke out and the Soviet Union at that stage was boycotting the Security Council meetings. If it had been in attendance it would have vetoed the resolution to commit forces to defend South Korea.
       </para>
       <para>
        This time all the P5 were present. One country abstained and the other four clearly voted in favour of this final option. This means that the UN is again becoming the relevant force we all hoped it would be in world affairs. It will be a great example to any tin-pot dictator in the future who chooses to try to use aggression against another country that the UN is capable of taking action. That will be the great deterrent-a great deterrent based on the combined actions of the nations of the world. I believe we should welcome that development even though the circumstances which have brought it about are very sad and do, as I say, risk the loss of life in any subsequent military action.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, it may be that Saddam Hussein realises that, with the world arrayed against him through the United Nations Security Council and its resolution, the only option he has got is to withdraw his troops and negotiate a settlement. A peace settlement will only be achieved because the UN carried the resolution it did last Thursday which was, if necessary, to invoke the military option. One cannot imagine Saddam Hussein responding to the pleas-the pitiful pleas in some cases-of people asking him to be nice. The man does not have that record. He is probably the only world leader who has used poison gas against his own people-the Kurd minority. I believe that the circumstances that have arisen in the UN are to be welcomed because, in the long term, they give us much greater hope that the world will be able to manage its affairs more effectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that some people take a very cynical view about the United States of America's use of the UN. I suppose people have a right to be cynical about the way superpowers over the years have used, misused, abused or ignored the United Nations. But America has committed itself to using the UN forum. I believe that it will be very difficult for the United States, in the future, to invoke its own veto in the Security Council on such issues as the Middle East. On a number of occasions during the Reagan years it invoked its veto on resolutions which condemned or criticised Israeli action in the Middle East and the occupied territories.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that, now, the United States will find it much more difficult to use the veto in that or any other area as would the other superpowers-the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France-because it would bring upon their heads world condemnation that they were acting without consultation with the other members of the United Nations. In fact, we may see out of this dispute in the Gulf the end of the veto which was used as an instrument of Cold War tactics and that, again, should be welcomed by all countries, particularly countries such as Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should also take note of the fact that the Soviet Union and the United States, the two world superpowers-though one of them may be a little sicker than the other economically at the moment-both agreed, as difficult as it was, to vote for this United Nations resolution. Again, that sets a new tenor, a new atmosphere, in the operation of the UN and in world affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my remarks I have tried to explain how Australia's role has been correct and moderate and in line with our role in world affairs. We have not been afraid to stake our position early in our decisions. I think they have been correct. The subsequent events since the invasion of Kuwait in early August have proved that the Australian Government's judgment has been overwhelmingly correct on these issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the long run, the events in the Gulf crisis can prove overwhelmingly that the United Nations is, and will be in the foreseeable future, the appropriate forum not only to negotiate peace but also to enforce peace and to tell those would-be tin-pot dictators that aggression in the world is no longer tolerated. Also, it will set the stance of the UN; it will give it the credibility in a number of other areas to take decisions and influence actions in other countries, such as Burma and those that I and other honourable senators have an interest in.
       </para>
       <para>
        The UN, as a result of its new credibility, will be able to make decisions to influence the military regime of Burma to realise that the days of its operations are numbered and that it must support the return to democracy in that country. All members of this Parliament would welcome that step forward. We are all committed to the development of democracy in all parts of the world. Though the situation in the Gulf is now severe and difficult and there is a real risk that there will be substantial casualties if war takes place, in the long run, the concerted action of all the world's nations, through the United Nations, will make the world a better and safer place, just as Dr Evatt envisaged when in 1945 he made those remarks referred to in the Government's statement.

         —On 2 August Iraq invaded Kuwait. Four months later Iraq did not look like moving from Kuwait, that is, until a few days ago, when the United Nations adopted resolution 678. Last Thursday the Security Council met the five permanent members of the Council and 10 others and, by a large majority, with one abstention-only two opposed-a representative of world opinion adopted the phrase `to use all necessary means' to achieve the goals that the United Nations set out in the first week after that aggressor, Saddam Hussein, took the Iraqi forces into Kuwait.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is timely. It sets out Australia's response to the United Nations resolution. I happily support the Prime Minister's statement. I believe it contains the right set of decisions for Australia at this time. I commend my colleagues Senators Hill, Durack, Newman and MacGibbon and the others from the Opposition who have spoken. Genuinely, I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, and indeed Senator McKiernan and Senator Schacht, who have spoken for the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is correct, when that small group of Independent or Democrat senators make the reflection here, that the Government and the Opposition have the same considered view about what Australia should do in concert with the world to resist the aggressor, Saddam Hussein, and to see the best pathway, even if it promises not to be painless, to achieve a solution to the situation in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition supports resolution 678 of the United Nations. The Opposition supports the Prime Minister's statement. The Opposition supports the announced modified deployment of our ships. This is bipartisan and it is correct to observe that it has been bipartisan from the beginning. It is a set of conclusions which have been arrived at independently. Indeed, the Opposition called for the Government's response in early August. That was eventually announced. Similarly, in thinking through the need for resolution 678 over the recent month, we have readily come to an independent conclusion that happens to be that which has been announced by the Government today.
       </para>
       <para>
        By the expression of considered support in this chamber and in the House of Representatives for the Prime Minister's statement, this Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, is expressing to three particular groups a message of clear support for what is intended by us and our allies towards a solution in the Gulf. First, we are engaging in dialogue with the Australian people. We are listening to the Australian people. The highest priority in our considerations is what we conscientiously believe to be in the best interests of Australia and the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, we are expressing these views in dialogue with those Australians who represent us all in serving their country in the Gulf-in the ships, in the medical teams to be deployed and those individual Australian servicemen who at the moment happen to be serving other allied military units that have been deployed by other countries to the Gulf region. We are highly conscious of each Australian involved in those three groups. We want, by our strong statements in the Parliament today, to give them a clear message of support. We appreciate what they are doing for Australia and for the world. Thirdly, we are clearly confirming to our allies, and indeed internationally, where we stand in regard to resolution 678; we support it.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are four matters in the Prime Minister's statement to which I shall refer. The first concerns the naval operations arrangements that have been announced on page 7 of the statement. It is appropriate that our task force of ships be integrated into the Persian Gulf and that it becomes part of the allied defence operation that will provide a sound air defence in the Persian Gulf. It is very clear that were our ships to remain further out they would be isolated, they would not serve with the same military capability and they would be considerably less safe than in the integrated deployment announced today. Similarly, we note that the Australian Defence Force will also now participate in allied military planning. This is appropriate. The details of that one sentence in the statement have not been given, as is appropriate, but it will be a matter that we, on the Opposition as well as on the Government side, will watch most carefully.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note, too, that the command for deployed Australian forces remains entirely with Australia, which is a sound tradition that should never be transgressed. An integrated operational command involves the deployed forces of the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia and other allied nations. As is clear in the statement, in all circumstances Australia will retain priority over the assignment of our ships. There is no debate about that. Had those statements been lacking, there would have been debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to operational arrangements, it is also clear from the statement that it is not proposed to make any other contribution of naval, air or ground forces. It is very clear from the Government's decision that there will not be additional personnel or forces deployed to this region without a completely new round of consultations and a completely new basis for a decision in the future, should that ever be necessary. In the same way as the Opposition has been consulted, and in the same way as the Parliament has now been given a clear statement, one would expect similar consultation before there is need to consider any further contribution, and let us hope that that is not necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter I wish to refer to relates to the hostages. It is an appalling evil that Saddam Hussein has not only kidnapped and held totally against their will persons of foreign nations, who happened to be in Kuwait or Iraq at the time of his invasion on 2 August, but also, against all humanity, against all the codes of international law, and against even the conduct of any military operation, is using such hostages as human shields to try to deter any possible attack upon military assets in Iraq or Kuwait, and to use the hostages as bargaining tools to try to gain some military or political advantage for Iraq.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Parliament is appalled at this evil. I am sure that members of parliament from all sides-certainly we in the Opposition-uphold this part of the Prime Minister's statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        We have all heard in the last twenty-four hours of suggestions-including from Iraq's Ambassador in Australia-that Australian hostages may soon be released.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, we know that about 30 are detained in this evil way. The statement continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        We hope that is true. We say to Iraq, as we have said continually over recent months-let them all go.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have not, in the consideration of this statement, in any way overlooked the human needs of the Australian hostages in Kuwait and Iraq. We will not stand with those former Australian members of Parliament who have, I believe, let us down in terms of their own association with this Parliament by luxuriating in self-publicity at everyone else's expense. I fear that that action, at everyone else's expense, may even be at the expense of some of the hostages. As we all do, I still call for Iraq to stop the evil and let the hostages go free without any negotiation other than that plain moral request. I have been sickened at the parading by individual former members of this Parliament in a way which has been to their own self-publicity and at everyone else's expense, even at the expense of the bona fides of the Australian Government, the Opposition, or the people of Australia. Who do they think they are?
       </para>
       <para>
        My third point relates to those parts of the statement that clearly address the need to restrain aggression. Parallels were made today and have been made at other times with the events of the 1930s which, with hindsight, were the preamble to the Second World War. Our own children ask -I ask, as one who was born during the Second World War-why did the allied nations that eventually came together to fight the evil of Nazism in Germany not act sooner to resist the aggression of Hitler and the Nazi army in the Ruhr, in Austria or in Czechoslovakia before the line was drawn at Poland?

         —Yes, they had disarmed, they hoped, in some flowery notion for peace. There was a height of pacifism in Europe more than at any time before or since, there was the painful memory of the First World War, and some felt there was some consolation in drifting away from any military response. The 1930s remind me of the speeches made by three senators today. The first was Senator Powell. I heard her speech. I did not make any notes about what the Australian Democrats might say until I heard her speech and the notes I have are entirely of what she said. Similarly, I heard Senator Vallentine and, very briefly, Senator Bourne.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Not to place labels on it, but for accuracy of analysis, I have tried to place the arguments that those honourable senators have put, and one or two other arguments that have not been put here but have been put in the community, especially in the United States, into three categories: the pacifists, the isolationists and what I will call-making up a word-the `painlessists'. There are genuine pacifists. I thought that Senator Vallentine, who is a genuine pacifist, was ranting and raving without credibility in her speech today. I have listened to Senator Vallentine on a number of occasions when she has spoken about matters of peace and war, and she has made much more sense because she has used evidence and logic. Today, she tried to win her point, which was entirely isolated, just by shouting louder. Those fellow travellers of pacifism, such as the flower power advocates who want to negotiate in a rose garden or the like, are deluding themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not a pacifist. It must be conceded that the majority of honourable senators in this chamber are not pacifists. We do concede that there is, for the benefit of the nation and for the benefit of the people, the need to use force to safeguard the peace. That is why we allow our police within our own domestic community to be armed, why we have gaols, why we take security measures, why we put locks on our doors and why we have a Defence Force. The goal of all of us in having a provision for defence is to be so strong, so professional, so capable that those military forces would never need to be used because they act as a deterrent against any that would trespass upon us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not have time to go into a philosophical or, even in the case of Senator Vallentine, a theological debate about why I am not a pacifist. The great majority of Christians in Australia are not pacifists. We seek peace even where the steps along that road require force. Let me make it entirely clear to Senator Vallentine, in relation to her statement that we do not want to see more dead people as the result of politicians' decisions, that that is what moves both the Government and the Opposition, as I see it. By taking action, such as is supported by the United Nations resolution 678, we want to minimise the pain, the evil and even the deaths that would be predictable in the event of a 1930s escalation of military might in the hands of a Hitler or a Saddam Hussein.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation is not as the honourable senator describes, too cynically, too insensitively, in her speech here today. I recognise that the second group are isolationists; that is, they are mostly from the hard right which wants allies not to be involved in a small country at the top of the Persian Gulf because that is apparently, on first look, too far away. Isolationists are wrong because there will be repercussions even from a long way away eventually, if aggression is not resisted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, there are the painlessists, those who recognise the illegality of the action of Iraq. Sure they want Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait; they even support sanctions, especially if there are not any naval deployments, planes and military that have to go there and make sure the sanctions work. They want a completely painless solution, where there is no military deployed so there could be no possibility of a person in that deployment being killed. They are living in a dream, in a fog.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that any of these three positions are tenable. It is in order to gain peace that we come, as in the Prime Minister's statement, to a support of all that is involved in United Nations resolution 678. The fourth matter I wish to refer to is the statement on page 3 asking whether now is the time:
       </para>
       <para>
        The question is, whether now is the right time to contemplate this further and graver step.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer is plain. The aim of the sanctions has been to prove to Iraq, both through the seriousness of the action itself, and through the great sacrifices which the sanctions have imposed already both on Iraq and on its former trading partners, that the world would not accept Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement is correct when it says:
       </para>
       <para>
        And yet they have not succeeded in persuading Iraq's leaders to withdraw from Kuwait . . . it is therefore timely . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        I support page 3 of the statement. As I started off, I said that it was on 2 August that Iraq invaded Kuwait. It is more than four months since then. The sanctions have been in place for more than three months. Had anyone at all put forward a view that Saddam Hussein looked like withdrawing or was even thinking about withdrawing before last Thursday? United Nations resolution 678 was the first thing that led to any movement in Iraq, and that led to the Foreign Minister of Iraq preparing to go to Washington for discussions or indeed to Secretary of State Baker preparing to see Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this whole decision, that is bipartisan between the Government and the Opposition, is looking firstly to peace through a direct and complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. In the event that there is not that withdrawal, and the deterrent, or the threat, of the use of force after 15 January is not heeded, then they will be forced from Kuwait.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to refer at this stage to two or three paragraphs of an article written by David Pryce-Jones entitled `The Conquering Hero', which was published 10 weeks ago, in mid-September, in the New Republic. I quote it at length because I think this concept needs to be understood in Australia. I know that parallel statements, to a minor degree, can be made of any culture and indeed of any military organisation, but I think that there is a particular carefulness in the choice of words by this Arabist scholar that ought to be understood. The article states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Refusal to reflect upon the reality of the Arab world leads time and again to being disagreeably surprised by it. Anwar Sadat's crossing of the Suez Canal in 1973, the use of the oil weapon, the collapse of Lebanon and its invasion by Syria, the intifada, Saddam Hussein's attacks on Iran and Kuwait-all are presented in the West as unpredictable as acts of God. Their perpetrators are thought to be irrational or suicidal. Yet all are a natural part of the Arab social and political order. The violence is systemic, therefore self-repeating. So strong is the logic of Arab behaviour that Westerners are obliged to fall in with it in a crisis like the present one.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to Arab culture, power belongs to whoever has the will and strength to grasp it. Victory goes deservedly to the strong, while the vanquished and the weak are to be despised. Force is therefore a necessary instrument, the means by which the would-be leader eliminates his rivals. Once he has become an absolute power-holder at home, he finds some pretext to extend his reach by attacking abroad. Far from being considered a crime, the use of force establishes credentials in a leader and determines the primacy of his status. So it happens that Arabs come to applaud a leader who is very obviously endangering them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Western societies are based upon free association, government by consent under the rule of law-in a word, contract. Contract is incompatible with the Arab concept of absolute power sanctioned by status. The gap between status and contract was perfectly illustrated in the way the invasion of Kuwait was answered by the legalities of the United Nations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This refers to the decisions that were made in August by the United Nations and that, by inference, are being criticised by this author for lacking the kind of decisiveness, the kind of analysis that is now reflected in last Thursday's decision:
       </para>
       <para>
        To Westerners, the use of force indicates social or political breakdown, and they can hardly conceive it in any positive connection with leadership and honor. It seems paradoxical that what looks like disorder and violence is actually a form of stability, a constant Darwinian testing of internal and external relationships. What puts an end to the ambitions of a leader is the arrival upon the scene of another who is more than his match. Communism in its heyday offered an approximation. The Party deemed that the promotion of its ends justified violence. The alleged class struggle of Nicolae Ceausescu resembled the careerist struggle of Saddam Hussein. Ceausescu's downfall is said to have jolted Hussein.

        I read this final paragraph:

       <para>
        Needless to say, Arabs are no more and no less disposed than other peoples to war and cruelty. The historic formula that ``force is the only language they understand'' is not a racist ascription of innate bad character, but a comment upon the absolutism built into their culture. No institutions or political mechanisms, such as genuine representation or free speech, exist to temper or moderate the use of force in a leader. ``L'etat c'est moi'' is the total philosophy of every Arab ruler. Hussein put it clearly when he said recently that in Iraq the law is two lines on a sheet of paper with his signature below.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that statement is pertinent and I believe that it immediately is a preamble to the kind of analysis that has led to the statement the Prime Minister has brought and which the Government and the Opposition support.

       <para>
        In the two minutes remaining to me in this debate I wish to draw a parallel between the end of the Cold War and a solution in the Gulf. The end of the Cold War did not come about this year as a result of pacifism or as a result of living in a flower power world of hippies and peaceniks. It did not come about through isolationism. It came about because the West was committed to peace through strength, to deterrence, to having such a military force that was so understood by potential disturbers of world stability that they never did disturb that stability in a serious way. What brought about the end of the Cold War was a commitment by us to peace through strength.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not a militarist; I support a strong military capability in order to have a deterrent that can win peace through strength. In the same way as the end of the Cold War has allowed the United Nations to work as it was originally intended, as first described in the words of the United Nations constitution in the year that I was born, I believe that will provide the solution in the Gulf. Even putting aside the analysis of Arab cultural leadership to which I have referred, peace will be achieved through strength. There will need to be a full commitment to the need to use force again. We all hope that force is not needed, but it is the commitment and the potential of the use of that force that will lead to the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and to peace and a genuine solution to the problems in the Gulf that we all wish to see achieved as soon as possible.

         —The subject matter of this debate could hardly be more important to a national parliament. It is of concern to me that the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that was to be presented to the Senate by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) will not now appear at the beginning of this debate. I am not questioning the right of any of my parliamentary colleagues to deny leave. I was not one of those to deny leave, but I believe that the matter was serious enough for the Minister to deliver his statement to this chamber. That would have set the tone of seriousness which this debate deserves. Despite the fact that the Minister did not deliver the statement, I believe that by and large the debate has been conducted in measured terms, as the subject deserves.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have had the statement for some time and have studied it. Over the past two or three months I have considered this question deeply, as have others. I have agonised over the issue and asked myself, `Is Kuwait an area of such strategic interest to us as to warrant deployment of our forces?'. That question is being asked throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It is a question with which each one of us has had to come to terms and to which each one of us has had to come up with a personal response. We are dealing with a very grave situation indeed. We are dealing with the lives of our own people as well as with the lives of hundreds of thousands of others.
       </para>
       <para>
        On a narrow interpretation of our strategic interests, the answer to the question as to whether Kuwait is of such strategic interest to us as to warrant deployment of our armed forces is no. The supply of Gulf oil to us or to our trading partners so far as it relates to oil from Kuwait or from Iraq would not of itself demand such a response. But, even on this narrow interpretation of our strategic interests, the question must be raised as to what happens next if Saddam Hussein is allowed to get away with what he has done.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement raises the possibility-indeed, it seems to infer the likelihood-of Saddam Hussein extending his actions further in the oil-rich region. It talks about the possibility of Iraq extending its hegemony through very crucial areas of that region. I wonder why the statement raised these as questions without giving very substantial information to the Parliament as to why they were being raised. I refer to the following passage on page four of the Prime Minister's speech:
       </para>
       <para>
        As well, Australia has been deeply concerned by the consequences for the Middle East as a whole if Iraq's aggression was allowed to stand. Who could doubt that having swallowed Kuwait, a stronger Iraq would not then turn on its other neighbours? Who will explain how Iraq could then be prevented from establishing an hegemony over the entire region; an hegemony backed not only by chemical weapons, but sooner or later by nuclear weapons as well? And who could doubt the brutality of that hegemony?
       </para>
       <para>
        These are not scare-mongering speculations. They are serious assessments of the regional consequences of allowing Iraq's aggression to stand.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a statement made by the Government. Presumably, the Government has a very sound reason for stating that serious assessments have been made of the regional consequences of allowing Iraq's aggression to stand.
       </para>
       <para>
        One, of course, has heard and read of those possibilities. I assume that the Government has intelligence information against which it has made such an assessment. Even under the narrow interpretation of the term `strategic interests', it seems that there needs to be an affirmative answer to the question, `Is Kuwait of such strategic interest to us as to warrant deployment of our armed forces?'.
       </para>
       <para>
        But there is a broader, far deeper and more meaningful interpretation which needs to be placed on the term `strategic interests'. In short, it is world peace. World peace surely is of ultimate strategic interest to Australia. Action is surely needed to tell those who use brutal force that their actions will not be met by appeasement and that there will be a response based on the principle of defence of human rights, including the rights of people of all nations to be protected from unprovoked aggression.
       </para>
       <para>
        It may be said that there are a whole range of areas in this world where peoples have been denied that right and where unprovoked aggression has taken place. Indeed, in this area of the Middle East, how often have we heard in this chamber the true story about what has happened in Lebanon over the last 15 years? It is tragic. I believe the Western world has not faced up to that issue. There are other areas in that Middle East region where there is aggression and denials of human rights.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last year, we saw the results of years of violations of human rights in China manifested almost symbolically in the killings in Tiananmen Square. There are examples of the denials of this right. But just because we have not faced up properly to those violations and denials of human rights and national integrity, does that mean that we should not face up to the situation right here and now? Does that mean that we should let this aggressor, Saddam Hussein, get away with his invasion of Kuwait and with his hostage led terrorism at this time? In my view, certainly not.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, the answer to the question as to whether it is in the strategic interests of Australia to warrant the deployment of our armed forces in the area is in the affirmative. But the questions remain: to what extent should that occur? Should we continue with the measured limited response that has taken place heretofore? Can we, as has been done by many speakers, laud the United Nations for its actions? Quite frankly, Mr Acting Deputy President, dealing with the latter question first, I am yet to have my faith restored in the United Nations. I am very concerned at the possibility that blind eyes have been turned to violations of human rights in other areas in order to get this vote through the Security Council without veto.
       </para>
       <para>
        I noted a report only last Friday from an international news service that the West, it appears, will be toning down its response to the violations of human rights in China. It is denied that this has anything to do with the fact that China did not use its veto power in the Security Council. But there is a worrying question in the back of my mind about that. Time will tell. I certainly will be looking at the actions of this Government as to whether its views on the violations of human rights in China have been mollified.
       </para>
       <para>
        To what extent should we commit our armed forces? The Prime Minister's statement indicates that we will continue with the strength of the task force but that it will be placed into a more strategic and effective position in the Gulf area. At this point I would like to congratulate the members of the armed forces in the Gulf area for the actions that they have taken on behalf of the people of Australia. They deserve our congratulations and support. The same goes for the crews of the other vessels that are making their way to that region.
       </para>
       <para>
        Are sanctions going to work? It appears that sanctions are not working in the sense that they have not resulted in Saddam Hussein changing his tack. The statement goes into that question and makes an assessment that it appears that the current level of sanctions is not sufficient at this stage to change the view of Saddam Hussein. President Hussein is a dictator; he is not particularly concerned about the pain suffered by the people of Iraq. I agree that, as was implied in the statement, Australians have had good relations with the people of Iraq. Nothing that I say and indeed nothing, as far as I can see, in this statement reflects on the people of Iraq. This is a clear message being given to Saddam Hussein and as such it is my view that it deserves the support of this Parliament and the people of Australia.

        GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON VIDEO MATERIAL
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has either implemented or set in train many of the recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Video Material which reported to the Parliament in 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee produced 29 recommendations dealing with the method of classification of films and videos, the type of material which ought to be in those classifications, the organisation administering the legislation and the public and industry perception and observance of the classification categories.
       </para>
       <para>
        The administration of censorship in Australia is a complex system which depends upon a great deal of co-operation between the Commonwealth and each of the States and the Territories to achieve uniformity. The power to censor is shared between the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories. The Commonwealth, under its Customs powers, controls the importation of censorable goods. The States and Territories control the sale and exhibition of film, videotape and printed matter through `point of sale' and `public exhibition' powers. The Commonwealth, through the Office of Film and Literature Classification, provides the co-ordinating body which classifies material, by arrangement, under State/Territory law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The implementation of many of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee therefore are not matters on which the Commonwealth can act on its own. The consideration of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee has been done in co-operation with the States and Territories with a view not only to improve the existing structure but also to maximise uniformity throughout Australia. Some of the recommendations of the Committee extended beyond Commonwealth and State participation. The Committee recognised the important role that the film and video industry plays in the community both in the censorship/classification process and its pivotal role in the entertainment industry throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consultations with the States and Territories and with the industry have been most productive and results are not apparent in video stores, in advertisements for films, and on posters advertising both film and video releases.
       </para>
       <para>
        IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments have welcomed the recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee. A majority of the recommendations have either now been implemented or are now in the process of being put into legislation. Some were put to the State and Territory Governments and were rejected because of resource implications and some were discarded because of the difficulty in implementation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has wholeheartedly supported what it considers to be the two most important recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee. These are the improved labelling of films and videos with the provision of more information to allow members of the community to make a more informed choice, and a public awareness campaign to inform people more precisely about the classification categories assigned to films and videos and to heighten the awareness of people in the community of the kinds of films that they and their children might see in each of the categories.
       </para>
       <para>
        UNIFORM MARKINGS AND CONSUMER ADVICE
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation is not in place in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania, and is in the legislative programs for other States and the Northern Territory, to improve the labelling on video cassettes and on films. Members and senators will be aware of the changes which have taken place in video outlets since May 1989, when the new requirements were announced. Although the new requirements do not have legal effect until the legislation is passed in each State, the distributors of video cassettes have co-operated with the Office of Film and Literature Classification by implementing changes in anticipation of the new laws. If members and senators survey the latest video releases in any of the video outlets throughout Australia, they will find clearly set out along the front bottom cover of the video cassette the classification symbol, an indication of the age group of the audience considered appropriate to watch the video, and a description of the category.
       </para>
       <para>
        All videos classified after the 1st of May 1989, which are beyond the `G' category, have been assigned consumer advice by the Film Censorship Board. This consumer advice appears clearly marked under the classification description on each video.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similar advice is also being provided with the classification of theatrical films and this advice, together with the classification description similar to that required on videos, will appear on all film posters and in all large newspaper advertisements for films. In smaller advertisements, the classification symbol will be more prominently displayed. A sample copy of the new markings is set out in Attachment `A'.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of decisions taken by the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers, the description of each category is now the same across Australia. The film and video industry has been involved in the application and design of the new requirements and has co-operated with the States, Territories and the Office of Film and Literature Classification in the final result. All of the these matters were canvassed in Recommendations 3, 4, 5 and 6.

       <para>
        PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN
       </para>
       <para>
        Recommendation 28 of the Joint Select Committee has been implemented by funding a public awareness campaign. The campaign is oversighted by a Steering Committee with Commonwealth (through the Office of Film and Literature Classification), State, Territory and industry representation. The campaign objectives include informing the community about:
       </para>
       <para>
        * the meaning of the classification symbols and categories
       </para>
       <para>
        * the role of parents in the selection of material to be viewed by minors in their case

        * the process by which films are classified
       </para>
       <para>
        * the factors influencing the classification given to a film.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first stage of the campaign is to establish present levels of community awareness to enable uniformed design of a campaign communication strategy. This stage is nearing completion and it will provide the information for the campaign proper.

        TIGHTER GUIDELINES FOR VIOLENCE
       </para>
       <para>
        New guidelines were approved by Censorship Ministers in June 1988 and adopted by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. These guidelines accommodate the concerns of the Committee, especially in relation to violent material. In addition to the guidelines, the Ministers requested the Chief Censor and the Chairman of the Films Board of Review to tighten up the application of the guidelines to films which contained violence and were in the top end of the `M' and `R' categories. The new guidelines implement the suggestions in Recommendation 25.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to incorporating the suggestions made by the Committee, the new guidelines were rewritten so that they could be more easily understood by members of the public and by the film and video industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The guidelines contain a preamble which sets out the context in which they operate and the general principles which apply when making classification decisions. The principles are drawn from the legislation of the States and Territories, all of which have some bearing on the final classification decision. A copy of those guidelines is also attached marked `B'.
       </para>
       <para>
        RECALL PROVISIONS
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has provided the Film Censorship Board with the power to reclassify its own decisions after a two-year period. This enables the Board to vary previous classification decisions which do not accord with contemporary community standards. The Board has reassessed 13 videos. The results of the reassessment will be made known when all States and Territories have altered their legislation. The changes to the legislation incorporate existing appeal provisions and provide time for video retailers to take material from shelves if the reassessment results in the material being refused classification. All steps will be taken by the Office of Film and Literature Classification to inform video retailers of any revised decisions by advertisements in the national press and notification through trade papers.
       </para>
       <para>
        NOTIFICATION OF CLASSIFICATION DECISIONS
       </para>
       <para>
        Recommendation 18 sought the preparation of regular up to date consolidations of classification decisions that would be available to the public. Such a consolidation, incorporating video classifications from February 1984 (the commencement of the video scheme) until June 1988, was produced in conjunction with a private printer in December 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        No further such publication has taken place but, in line with Recommendation 18, it is now proposed to publish cinema and video classification decisions electronically on the Telecom Discovery public network.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will result in `on-line' access for subscribers to a database of classification decisions. The service will enable users to request reports for their particular needs and will overcome the difficulties associated with searching through issues of Gazettes. The Gazettal of decisions will be discontinued once the services goes live in the last quarter of 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes have been discussed in some detail with the different segments of the film and video industry and with the States and Territories. The rights of members of the public to inquire about the classification of films and videos from the State offices or from the Office of Film and Literature Classification will remain the same. As the Discovery system becomes more widely known, it is hoped that members of the public might be able to use the network directly or the outlet at the local video store or public library to obtain more information.
       </para>
       <para>
        OTHER MEASURES
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation is now in place in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania and is planned for the other States and the Northern Territory to give effect to Recommendation 8 that videotapes do not contain trailer advertisements for titles classified higher than the featured title on that videotape. While the legislation is still pending in some States, the video industry has complied voluntarily with this recommendation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The States and Territories have agreed to extend up to 60 days, instead of the present 14, the period within which police may obtain certificates from the Chief Censor as prima facie evidence before a court (Recommendation 23).
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal and State Ministers have also agreed, as suggested in Recommendation 17, that videos referred to the Federal Attorney-General by a State censorship Minister will be passed on automatically to the Film Censorship Board for reassessment. This means that the reassessment by the Film Censorship Board will have an Australia wide application.

        AUSTRALIAN LAW REFORM COMMISSION
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Law Reform Commission was requested by the Attorney-General on 10 May 1990, following consultation with State and Territory censorship Ministers, to examine and revise censorship laws and report by 2 June 1991. A copy of the reference is attached marked `C'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The aim is to formulate model Commonwealth legislation which will retain existing standards and arrangements but will simplify and co-ordinate censorship practice and procedure throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recommendation 19, dealing with closing the gap between the criteria for prohibition contained in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the criteria to refuse classification contained in Section 25 of the Australian Capital Territory Classification of Publications Ordinance, 1983, and Recommendation 29, that Commonwealth censorship legislation be dealt with by substantive legislation, are matters referred to the Law Reform Commission.

       <para>
        EXISTING PRACTICE
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee made a number of recommendations which support or modify slightly existing practices within the Board or about the composition of the Board or the Film and Literature Board of Review. Thus the recommendations which favour a single classification system, the value of part-time appointees to the Film Censorship Board, the retention of the Film and Literature Board of Review and the lengths of appointment to the Film Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review (Recommendations 14, 15, 26 and 27) all reflect current practice.

        In addition, a reorganisation of the Office of Film and Literature Classification has provided for a modest research capacity for the Office as envisaged by Recommendation 16.

        Further, the Director of Public Prosecutions already has the necessary delegation to prosecute under the Ordinance, a delegation which conforms with the general Commonwealth prosecution policy (Recommendation 22).

        RECOMMENDATIONS NOT APPROVED
       </para>
       <para>
        Several of the recommendations made by the Committee did not meet with the approval of all of the Governments. In some matters the Ministers agreed that the subject matter need not necessarily be dealt with on a uniform basis but would be for each individual State and Territory to make up its own mind on the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ministers did not approve the creation of a new `Non-Violent Erotica' category as suggested in Recommendation 1 by the Committee to replace the present `X' classification. The question of the content of the proposed new category (Recommendation 2) therefore did not arise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ministers also rejected the recommendations that hard-top cinemas be permitted to show material classified `NVE' (Recommendation 12); that video outlets, including mail order video outlets should be registered (Recommendation 20) and the recommendation that the language criteria for `PG' be the same as for `G' (Recommendation 24).
       </para>
       <para>
        The Ministers considered the question of display of `R'-rated material in a separate room in video outlets. They decided this was not a matter where it was necessary for uniformity and that it would be for each State and Territory to consider what measures were appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        New requirements for cinema and video advertising, effective from 1 May 1989, apply to all cinema and video releases classified after that date. The requirements deal with advertising on the front and back of video covers, video cassettes, posters, newspaper advertisements and other material, advertising films or videos.

The `X' classification is not available for public exhibition use. In addition to this information, consumer advice provided by the Film Censorship Board in relation to all films above the `G' classification shall be displayed. The appropriate consumer advice will be provided on the classification certificate issued by the Board. The advice will be short.

        The changes were the subject of consultation between the Chief Censor and the Cinema and Video Industries, providing the latter with the opportunity to make suggestions about the form of the new proposals prior to their implementation. The changes were finally approved at the meeting of the Standing Committee of Ministers responsible for Censorship matters, held in Melbourne on 2 March, 1989.

       <para>
        Relevant legislation in all States and Territories is to be amended to enable the Chief Censor, from time to time, to determine the size and form of censorship markings to be included in cinema and video advertising by publishing a notice in the Commonwealth Gazette. The Chief Censor will make such determinations after consultation with the Cinema and Video Industries and the Standing Committee of Ministers responsible for censorship.

        GUIDELINES FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF FILMS, VIDEOTAPES AND PRINTED MATTER
       </para>
       <para>
        PREAMBLE
       </para>
       <para>
        Adults in a free society should be allowed as far as possible to see what they wish, and creative artists, including filmmakers, to depict what they please without fear of intervention by the State.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is generally accepted, however, that the exercise of these rights carries certain responsibilities and must be subject to a number of constraints for the good of society as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our right to see what we please cannot be allowed to infringe the rights of others. Children and young people, in particular, must be adequately protected from material likely to harm or disturb them, and people who may be offended by certain material have a right to expect that it will not be thrust upon them against their will or without warning.
       </para>
       <para>
        Equally, the community has the right to ban material considered likely to endanger public health or safety, or grossly to offend accepted standards of public decency. Thus, films depicting child sexual abuse or bestiality, for example, or offering guidance or instruction in methods of terrorism, military subversion or drug abuse will be refused classification.
       </para>
       <para>
        The attention given to acts of violence in modern society, especially sexual violence, has created a justifiable concern among many people that the depiction of violence in popular entertainment will encourage acts of imitation. Even if it could be shown that this was unlikely to occur, the feelings of those who abhor violence of any kind and consider its depiction in extreme forms degrading deserve respect. Any depiction of violence in films and videos must therefore be subject to careful scrutiny, and reserved, where appropriate, for mature and/or adult audiences.
       </para>
       <para>
        The primary responsibility for protecting children and young people from harmful material rests with their parents or guardians. In discharging that responsibility they have a right to expect assistance from the State, especially as films and videos are so readily accessible. They must be confident that material to which children may be exposed has been carefully examined and appropriately classified.
       </para>
       <para>
        The classification of films and videos is intended, therefore, both to protect children and young people, and to respect the sensibilities of adults who are concerned about violence and its effect on the community, and would consider certain kinds of material personally offensive.
       </para>
       <para>
        GENERAL PRINCIPLES APPLYING TO THE GUIDELINES INCLUDE
       </para>
       <para>
        * Adults should be free to see what they wish provided there is sufficient protection for young people, and those people who do not wish to see certain material should not have it thrust upon them.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The classification should reflect what a reasonable adult person would consider within the acceptable limits of community standards for that age group.
       </para>
       <para>
        * The closest attention is paid to the portrayal of violence and, in particular, sexual violence.
       </para>
       <para>
        * Certain classes of activity, such as child sexual abuse, bestiality, and the incitement or encouragement of terrorism are refused classification.

        ADDITIONAL CONSUMER INFORMATION
       </para>
       <para>
        Films and videos in the upper limits of the `PG', `M' and `R' categories will carry, in addition to the classification symbols, consumer advice and, where necessary, a warning as to possibly offensive content.
       </para>
       <para>
        This advice will appear prominently on the cover of each video, on the cassette itself and in all advertising material.

        Other:
       </para>
       <para>
        Discreet informational and/or anti-drug references. Mild supernatural or ``horror'' themes may warrant `PG'. Minimal nudity if in a justifiable context.

       <para>
        M Mature (suitable only for persons 15 years and over)
       </para>
       <para>
        Material which is considered likely to disturb, harm or offend those under the age of 15 years will be classified `M'. While most adult themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in this classification.
       </para>
       <para>
        Language:
       </para>
       <para>

       <para>
        Violence:
       </para>
       <para>
        Realistic violence of medium intensity may be depicted, but violent depictions with a high degree of realism or impact are acceptable only if contextually justified.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other:
       </para>
       <para>
        Drug use may be depicted, but not in an advocatory manner. Supernatural and ``horror'' special effects usually warrant an `M' classification.

       <para>
        R Restricted (18 years and over)
       </para>
       <para>
        Material considered likely to be harmful to those under 18 years and possibly offensive to some sections of the adult community warrants an `R' classification.
       </para>
       <para>
        Language:
       </para>
       <para>

        Drug abuse may be depicted, but not in an advocatory manner.

       </para>
       <para>
        No depiction of sexual violence, coercion or non-consent of any kind is permitted in this classification. Material which can be accommodated in this classification includes explicit depictions of sexual acts between consenting adults and mild non-violent fetishes.

       In speaking to this report I wish to reflect on a news item in Saturday's Adelaide Advertiser which pointed out that a number of railway lines in South Australia have recently been closed and consequently a great deal of heavy freight has turned up on the roads. The article in question mentioned that in some country towns considerable amounts of money had been spent recently on rebuilding and repairing roads and they were rapidly falling into decay because of the closure of railway lines and the consequent heavy traffic being put onto the roads.
      </para>
      <para>
       Interestingly, the comment from an ANL spokesman was that ANL had no public responsibilities or liabilities in this respect. It had no public service responsibilities and its direction was merely to ensure that it was as profitable as possible within the narrow confines of its balance sheet. It is very concerning to those of us in South Australia to observe that this is the case and that there is not some total social costing being done in respect of the cost of providing roads and services for roads as well as the cost of the provision of services for rail. I point out to the Senate that, since ANL has commenced this process of closure of country lines in South Australia, something like 350,000 tonnes of wheat from the 1989-90 harvest, which is currently stored in silos, is now to be transported by road rather than by rail.
      </para>
      <para>
       These centres include Wilmington, Melrose, Booleroo Centre, Wirrabara, Gladstone, Gulnare, Yacka, Brinkworth, Blyth, Hoyleton, Snowtown, Bute, Paskeville, Andrews, Orroroo, Hallett, Robertstown, Stockwell, Cambari, Strathalbyn, Waikerie and Millicent. In all of those areas, some 350,000 tonnes of grain will now be transported by road at roughly 25 tonnes per truck load. It does not require very much knowledge of mathematics to work out how many trucks that means will be passing over the roads, compared with transporting the same amount of grain by train at some 2,000 tonnes per train load. Nor does the situation stop there. Silos presently served by rail are expected, within the next two years, to be shut and will therefore have to be served by road. These include, just in the State of South Australia, Balaklava, Owen, Burra, Farrell Flat, Saddleworth, Tarlee, Hamley Bridge, Roseworthy, Eudunda, Kapunda, Apamurra, Galga, Copeville, Loxton, Paringa, Taldra, Meribah, Alawoona, Wanbi, Karoonda, Peebinga, Gurrai, Kulkami, Pinaroo-that is a large one-Parilla, Lameroo, Geranium and Peake. That is a further 500,000 tonnes of grain to be transported. Again assuming a 25 tonne load per semi-trailer, which is a fairly average load of wheat for a semi-trailer, that is some 100,000 truck loads of wheat being transported on roads which are simply falling apart, whereas 500,000 tonnes at 2,000 tonnes per train is only 250 train loads on railway lines which are already there.
      </para>
      <para>
       I merely make a plea to the Government to do comprehensive social costing and look at land transport as a package rather than allow Australian National to continue to operate in this very narrow profit-oriented way. If it did, this country would be a great deal better off.

       <para in-line="1">
        — I want to speak for a few moments on the Australian National Line (ANL) Ltd annual report 1989-90. I nominate clearly that we are talking about shipping ANL and not Australian National Railways (ANR), which is the authority responsible for rail transport throughout the State of South Australia, about which my colleague from South Australia has just been talking. ANR and ANL are two quite distinct and separate entities.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       My point about ANL, which I also raised today and last Thursday, relates to the concern that ANL, through the generic word `searoad', which is contained in the legislation passed in 1988 to supplement the 1956 Act, has caused some difficulties in relation to Kangaroo Island Searoad. This has meant the possibility of $140,000 in costs being incurred by that firm, which is a new trading enterprise which, in good faith, is establishing, encouraging and expanding the tourism market of South Australia. Yet this Government quango, acting under legislation, has wrongfully, in my view which was supported today by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) in the response to my question, used the Act to imply an impediment and a restriction on a small South Australian company.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would have thought that, in this time of rising unemployment and the very difficult economic circumstances facing the business community, we ought to be giving every encouragement to small entrepreneurial activities, such as those undertaken by this company which is expanding the tourism industry in Australia, rather than placing impediments in its way through ANL. I would hope that, as a matter of urgency, the Minister, through consultation with ANL, will allow some commonsense to come to the fore and say that ANL and the Australian Government Solicitor should desist from their action of threatening to take legal action against that company over the word `searoad' and let the company sort it out in a civil manner through the courts. My understanding is that the South Australian-based company would be more than happy to sort it out as a civil matter through the courts, as it relates to the use of a trade name. It does not have a problem with that. Its only problem was that, under the legislation, it had no right of recourse, having acted in good faith in the past.
      </para>
      <para>
       I hope that the Australian National Line will, at least, reconsider this matter particularly in view of the fact that this company is not listed in the South Australian telephone book and it does not advertise its services in South Australia. So how on earth can there be a duplication of services and how on earth can the company be competing in the same market as ANL in those circumstances? Therefore, ANL ought not use the powers currently incorporated in the Act and we should give encouragement-and the Government should support this-to this young South Australian company, which is attempting to provide a valuable and important extension of the tourism industry in South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       This matter raises another very important question which the Government will have to consider and that is the use of the generic term which, in the case to which I have referred, is `searoad'. In the case of the privatisation of Australian Airlines Ltd, what will we do with the word `airline'? Will that be considered to be a generic word which will be incorporated in the legislation and which will thereafter create difficulties for any airline operating within Australia? It is the same extension- `searoad' and `airline'. It is a matter to which the Government will have to give very serious consideration to ensure that the difficulty that we have encountered with ANL taking the generic term `searoad' to the extreme is not allowed to occur in any other area. It is incumbent upon the Government to act to ensure that enterprises operating with justification in the market place are given every encouragement.
      </para>
      <para>
       I reiterate that we are talking about ANL, not ANR. I wonder whether my colleague from South Australia, Senator Coulter, has that somewhat confused in his comments about the rail freight problem that is occurring in South Australia as a result of the former Labor Government selling the railways to--

        Tonight we were debating-and have been for most of the day-the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Gulf. The statement was a most important one and, as the Senate is aware, we have debated it for most of the time. The speakers list comprised some 12 or 14 speakers-something like that; I am not sure how many-and the last two speakers on the list were Senator Loosley and Senator Crichton-Browne. Both of those speakers dropped off the list without any warning at all. I sat in the Senate for some time, waiting for the completion of the debate, and returned to my room in the knowledge that we had two speakers left. Without warning the response was called on. Indeed even Senator Tate who was to present the Government's response to the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, was also not in the chamber. Because Senator Tate was not in the chamber, Senator Cook incorporated the Government's response on his behalf. I was not in the chamber but came down immediately the debate ended to find that the speech had been incorporated.

        The Government has wholeheartedly supported what it considers to be the two most important recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee.

        It claims that the two most important recommendations were the labelling of films and the heightening of the awareness of people in the community of the kinds of films that they and their children might see in each of the categories. These were recommendations of the Committee, but they were minor recommendations considering the ones that this Committee made. The Government assures the Senate that it has tightened guidelines on violence. I again quote from the Government's response:
       </para>
       <para>
        New guidelines were approved by Censorship Ministers in June 1988 and adopted by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. These guidelines accommodate the concerns of the Committee, especially in relation to violent material . . . The new guidelines implement the suggestions in Recommendation 25.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, of course, a lot of rubbish. They do not implement the guidelines put down by the Committee. I read from the Government's own document in attachment B regarding R-rated videos and what is permitted under violence:
       </para>
       <para>
        Highly realistic and explicit depictions of violence may be shown, but not if unduly detailed, relished or cruel.
       </para>
       <para>
        The unanimous recommendation of the Committee was that the current guidelines for R violence be altered. The R violence guidelines should now read-and I stress this- `Explicit depictions of violence but not detailed', and then the new word being put in on the recommendation of the Committee, `relished'. So it reads, ` . . . but not detailed, relished or gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's new violence criteria is a long way short of that recommended by the Committee. I will again compare the two, because there is a great deal of difference. What the Government permits now is `highly realistic and explicit depictions of violence', but what we recommended were not `highly' but just `explicit depictions of violence'. Then we go on, `but not detailed, relished or gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty'. The Government states, `Highly realistic and explicit depictions of violence may be shown, but not if unduly detailed, relished or cruel'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government makes sure that it adds the word `unduly'. So it is absolute rubbish for the Government to claim, as it says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The new guidelines implement the suggestions in Recommendation 25'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is certainly not the case. It is of great concern to me that the Government, through its Minister, Senator Tate, would put down such untrue statements and try to fool the people in the community that it is abiding by the recommendations of the Committee in this regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's statement goes on that it met with Ministers from all the States, and it assures us that the Ministers did not approve of the creation of a new non-violent erotica (NVE) category, as suggested by recommendation I. The first recommendation of the Senate Committee was that there be a new category of NVE. The Government says that because the Ministers did not approve the creation of a new non-violent erotica category, as suggested in recommendation I by the Committee, to replace the present X classification, the question of recommendation II did not occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was never a recommendation by the Committee that X-rated videos should be replaced by non-violent erotica. The minority of the Committee recommended that, but it was not the recommendation of the Committee, which is always considered to be the majority. I am at a loss to understand why the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) has permitted this response to be read under his name; it is not a truthful document. It says that recommendation I of the Committee is that non-violent erotica be replaced by the present X-rated videos. Recommendation I does not suggest that, and it is completely untruthful of the Government to put down such a report on our Committee, making false accusations. The Government's response states further that, because the Ministers-these are the various Ministers of State-did not agree with that supposed recommendation, the question of the content of the proposed new category, recommendation II, did not arise. Recommendation II states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee draws attention-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, to the non-violent erotica, which would contain the material defined under the current classification of X-rated videos-
       </para>
       <para>
        to the fact that the majority of the Committee disagrees with the proposal . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        So it was not the recommendation of the majority of the Committee but of the minority and, as such, it is a pity that the Government cannot be truthful in its documents. I am very concerned that this has occurred. That leads us to the fact that the Government did not pick up the fact that the majority of the Committee recommended that X-rated videos be abolished. In its report, the Government states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth, under its Customs powers, controls the importation of censorable goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        With this power the Government could certainly make sure that no X-rated videos were allowed in this country. We have recently seen that the New South Wales Government has stopped the production of X-rated videos in that State. I welcome that decision by the New South Wales Government because it is in line with its legislation prohibiting the sale of X-rated videos. We all know that this debate has gone on for a considerable time. We are fully aware that the Government has frustrated the will of every State in this country. By allowing X-rated videos to be sold and rented in this Territory, it has frustrated the decision of the Attorneys-General of all the States to abolish X-rated videos. Every State can buy X-rated videos from Canberra quite legally because of the free trade between States clause in the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to read a very short passage from the speech I made when I brought down a private member's Bill with the aim of downgrading violence in videos and abolishing X-rated videos. In part, I stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        On 30 June this year following the tabling of our report all the Australian Attorneys-General met and as a result of that meeting a unanimous agreement was reached between the States and Commonwealth Attorneys-General. It was agreed that most Australians wanted ` `X'' rated and excessively violent videos outlawed and that the way to accomplish this was that there should be a National approach on the issue. This was necessary . . . because while all the States have for some time banned the sale or hire of ``X'' rated videos under their jurisdiction, the Commonwealth had refused to do so in the territories, resulting in the free trade of these videos being carried out between the States and Territories and so thwarting the States legislation . . . the Government had so strongly supported these ``X'' rated videos that over a period of 4 years it has delayed time and time again any action being taken to support the States in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        Many Government members claim adults should be able to see and read whatever they choose, believing that there should not be any censorship. However, they happily go along with the need for censorship of child pornography, bestiality, etc . . . It is really only a matter of where the censorship line is drawn not whether there should be censorship or not.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the Committee hearings, evidence was given to the Committee by many Social and Behavioural Science Researchers that they believed prolonged viewing of ``X'' rated videos can have very detrimental effects on certain individuals with aggressive tendencies.
       </para>
       <para>
        But perhaps the evidence I appreciated most was given by Professor Sheehan at the Queensland University when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the critical thing in whether or not there will be these so-called effects of sexually explicit material is how aggressive the person is in the first place . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no question that a lot of people are stimulated mildly or strongly by seeing sexually explicit material. When one is aroused one tends to behave as a consequence of that arousal and I think if the person is aggressive aggression will out . . . In and of itself, I do not think that sexually explicit material divorced from aggression leads to strong negative effects. Once you combine sexually explicit material with aggression you have a different kettle of fish . . . The critical thing is how much someone is aroused and how aggressive he is in the first place.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was quoting that from our Committee report. My speech continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        When you consider that evidence in conjunction with other evidence we received . . . and you look at it in the light of the latest Australian survey on domestic violence which shows that 22% (or 1 in 5) of Australian men are so aggressive that they believe it is acceptable for a man to use physical force against his female partner then we have a potentially explosive situation. Females of all ages feel threatened and are becoming increasingly concerned for their personal safety.
       </para>
       <para>
        I went on to explain how women's groups throughout Australia have expressed their concern. Women's groups throughout Australia have unanimously joined together and begged the Government to make sure that X-rated videos are banned. The Government has said that it is too degrading to allow them to be shown in cinemas, but it is content to allow them to be seen as home entertainment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that I should not be disappointed in the Government's response, but I am extremely disappointed that Senator Tate, the Minister in charge of this response, is not in the chamber. I am considerably disappointed that the Government has not seen fit to tell the truth in its report and that it has, indeed, misquoted the Senate Committee's report and attributed recommendations that the minority Committee put up as recommendations of the Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has done this not only with regard to the supposed downgrading of violence, as I have already described-which the Committee certainly has not done-but also with regard to the X-rated videos. But I suppose that the women of Australia, who have deserted the Government in their droves, will just have to wait until we are in government, which will be not too long, before their concerns are addressed. The Government should realise that this is what is happening.

         —Senator Walters has pointed clearly to a number of the inadequacies in the Government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. First and foremost, this is a response by the Government to a joint select committee report which was tabled in the Parliament in April 1988, over two years ago. The Government, only now, makes its response to the Parliament on that report.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As Senator Walters said, the response is shamefully inadequate-I do not know whether she said `shamefully', but no doubt that is what she meant-in a number of other respects. She has pointed very clearly to its inadequacy in relation to the recommendation of the majority of the Joint Select Committee when it came to the question of violence. She has indicted quite definitively how the response of the Government, as contained in its paper, does not match up with the response that is contained in the actual guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, what the Government seems to be telling all and sundry in this response is that yes, it has accepted the recommendations of the Committee so far as tightening up guidelines on violence is concerned. Yet, if one looks at the way that the guidelines have been reframed, in effect it means that they have not been tightened but have been loosened. That is a shameful thing. It is doubly shameful because the majority of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material made the specific recommendation in respect of violence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might say that as one of the majority of that Committee I was amused, to put it mildly, to hear the allegations made both inside and outside this Parliament, and carried on through the press, that whereas the majority of the Committee were very strict on sex that meant that they were not concerned about violence. We heard that come out of the mouths of the video porn merchants here in Canberra time after time. Yet it was the majority of the Committee who did the work on violence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know whether I am out of order, Mr Deputy President-and you will correct me if I am-but the draft on violence of the Chairman, Dr Klugman, was pitifully small whereas our draft, considering the time that was given to us, was a substantial consideration of the question of violence. If it were not for the majority, who were led by Senator Walters as Deputy Chair, I doubt whether there would have been the attention given to violence that was ultimately given to it by this Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Walters has said, the response ignores the fact that, besides the violence question, the majority of the Committee strongly opposed the proposition that there be a new NVE category which would contain the material as defined in the current classification of X.
       </para>
       <para>
        Concerning that recommendation, the majority of the Committee said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        It would entrench X-rated video pornography (described officially as `hard core pornography' . . . in the community under the guise of the misleading title of NVE.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal runs counter to the overwhelming burden of evidence submitted to the Committee concerning the harmful effects of this material and is inconsistent with the findings of the Committee thereon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Almost all of the current X-rated video pornography (and their R equivalents) fall within Category II Non Violent Degrading Pornography and some in Category III (see paragraphs 13.46-13.51 of the Report). Rather than entrenching this material into the community we recommend that the Commonwealth Government introduce substantive legislation to ensure that this material is refused classification for the purposes of Commonwealth laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the recommendation of the majority of the Committee. Where is the response of the Government to that recommendation?
       </para>
       <para>
        As Senator Walters has indicated, all of the States requested that this material be refused classification. The Federal Government, and the Federal Government alone, is responsible for the appalling situation that now exists in Australia in respect of this material. The weakness with which it has approached this-its intellectual bankruptcy about this question-is absolutely appalling. I think history will show when a true study is done of the work that was undertaken by the majority of that Joint Select Committee, that we were the ones who put forward a consistent, valid approach, based on principles which demanded implementation by the Government.

         —Tonight I rise to speak on the adjournment in respect of remarks attributed to Senator Grant Chapman in the 4 December edition of the Adelaide Advertiser concerning our commitment to the Gulf, our naval personnel and the attitude of Australian families whose loved ones are serving with the Royal Australian Navy in the Gulf region.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Three remarks in particular took me aback. I believe they will also take the Senate aback. They were observations made about the Gulf. The article was entitled, `Navy families whingers: MP'. The article begins by saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        A South Australian senator has attacked ``whingeing'' families for ``bleating'' about the possibility that Australian sailors in the Gulf may not be home for Christmas.
       </para>
       <para>
        It then attributes remarks to Senator Chapman directly. He is reported as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        The continual publicity given to whingeing family members does nothing to bolster our image overseas as an elite fighting force but, rather, shows us up to be a pack of wimps.
       </para>
       <para>
        He continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Most Australians must be heartily sick of hearing the constant bleating from families of sailors who are serving on our ships in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        This constant bleating from sailors' families does nothing for the morale of the country or, for that matter, the sailors themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        I found those remarks extraordinary. I informed Senator Chapman earlier this evening that I would be speaking on this matter on the adjournment as I believed those observations should not go either unacknowledged in the Senate or without answer.

The Australian people expect nothing less. That has been very much in the national tradition throughout this century. It is not only a matter of patriotism regarding the service of our armed forces and the duties they are performing but also a commitment on behalf of the country to our international obligations built around a United Nations resolution based on a principle in concert with our allies. Given that, our servicemen are entitled to our support.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If we look at Senator Chapman's remarks in the Adelaide Advertiser we can only conclude that it is an extraordinarily brave statement demonstrating real courage and resolution! At a time when their men are away serving their country, the honourable senator is critical of their women and children. That is really being in touch with public opinion! That is showing one's colours and demonstrating audacity. I doubt that a single Australian would endorse the honourable senator's remarks. It begs the question: for whom does the honourable senator speak? He certainly does not speak for the families. Does he speak for the Navy? I doubt it. Does he speak for Australians generally? I doubt it. Does he speak for the Opposition? We will wait and see the consequences. Senator Chapman is safe and comfortable. He is protected and privileged. Not since Douglas Haig committed the British Army to the Somme have we witnessed front-line daring of this nature. This country's history has not been characterised by anything other than solid support for our service men and women abroad. These remarks break that tradition. From time to time it has been said that we, as a government, are out of touch and that we are distant. Perhaps sometimes that is true. But not on this issue. Judging by Senator Chapman's remarks, he is out of touch-absolutely and embarrassingly out of touch.

        We have had a degree of bipartisanship on the Gulf issue. That is welcome. It should be continued and, wherever possible, it should be extended. Given that, we should have bipartisan rejection of these arrogant and foolish remarks, which constitute sexist nonsense. No-one wants this kind of indulgence to jeopardise Australian policy on the Gulf, international cooperation and our determination in the face of aggression. It is Senator Chapman's remarks, not the remarks of the families, that could damage morale if they were left unanswered. They could damage morale on the ships and at home. They are nothing other than divisive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say just a brief word about our naval personnel serving in the Gulf of Oman and shortly in the Persian Gulf. We are talking about 372 officers and men on the two frigates; we are talking about several hundred dependants. The three ships currently involved-HMAS Darwin, HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Success-left on 13 August. The frigates return to Darwin on 14 December. We are talking about these people spending four months away in a war zone. The families are entitled to be concerned about the safety of their loved ones. They are certainly entitled to want their loved ones home, and home for Christmas. The families are entitled to be spared the stupidity inherent in these remarks as reported. They are entitled to be angry, as they have shown by their response.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the courage that the families of the naval personnel have demonstrated to date, and given their commitment, indeed their stoicism, they are entitled to have a defence made of them in the Senate this evening. The families of the naval personnel have put personal interest to one side in the national interest; indeed, in our international interest. As I said earlier, I cannot foresee anyone endorsing these remarks. I hope no honourable senator would.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is now an obligation before the Opposition, squarely before Dr Hewson and certainly before Senator Hill and Senator Durack. They can remain silent and thereby endorse Senator Chapman's remarks, they can ignore the remarks and thereby give them tacit approval or they can do what I hope they will and publicly repudiate the remarks. The simple choice is theirs. As for Senator Chapman, he can salvage his position by withdrawing the remarks and apologising without reservation. That, too, is his choice tonight.

When Senator Loosely said that he had advised Senator Chapman that he would talk about him in the chamber tonight, I happened to say, `Unlike what you did when you attacked Opposition senators on the National Crime Authority'. Other than Senator Loosely being severely hearing-impaired, all I could say is that he willingly and intentionally misrepresented what I had said. Quite frankly, I did not know and still do not know, following Senator Loosley's gobbledegook, what Senator Chapman said, regardless of whether I agree with it or disagree with it.

         —I repeat that I am sorry the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, is not here because I informed him that I would put forward some views following his answer to a question asked by Senator Coates in Question Time today about the Bay View laundry in Tasmania. I asked Senator Tate whether he could be present. He obviously does not see fit to do so.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Following the announcement of the last Federal election, a group of parents from the Bay View laundry visited Senator Tate with a request for a grant of $183,000 for the continuation of the laundry in Hobart which employs about 37 disabled people. The Minister, in the presence of the parents, rang the Tasmanian branch of the Department of Community Services and Health and spoke to the then Tasmanian State manager, Robin King, who verified that the grant of $183,000 would be available and would be paid following the election. That promise was made.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister told the parents visiting him that the $183,000 would be paid six weeks after the election as it would take about that time, after the turmoil of an election, for the relevant Minister to sign the cheque and get everything through. The parents believed the Minister. However, they had not received one cent of that money eight months later-not six weeks as promised.
       </para>
       <para>
        When making representation on behalf of those people, I established that every word of what I have related was true. The new State manager verified this with me. However, he told me that a review was being undertaken by Peat Marwick Hungerfords Management Consultants, and that the report was due in November. We now learn that that report has been produced and that the members of the Bay View laundry have received $45,000 today to help its cash flow, not $183,000 as promised by the Minister just a couple of weeks before the election.
       </para>
       <para>
        As members of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs would be aware, on Monday I asked the Department about that grant and how it was going. Departmental representatives told me that the full grant was not available. Strangely enough, the next day Senator Coates asked a question of the Minister who said that $45,000 would be available to that laundry today. The Minister went on, and it is not exactly clear what he meant when he said that the consultant firm:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . has been asked to investigate the factors leading to the laundry's operating losses and strategies to secure the viability of the laundry. I believe that the particular strategy coming out of that consultancy will need considerable financial support from the Federal Government, and that support will be forthcoming. I am very confident that funds to implement that rehabilitation of the Bay View laundry service and to secure its viability will come by the end of this month in order to ensure that the consultancy recommendations can be carried through in a way which will support the activity of that very fine institution in Hobart.

I do not know what it means. I hope that Senator Richardson can help me because the group of people who are supporting, as Senator Tate says, this very worthy and fine institution in Hobart are desperately in need of the advice as to whether they will be able to continue supporting disabled working people in this area.

I refer to the promise by Mr Hawke in his 1987 policy speech that, by 1990, no Australian child will be living in poverty. It is regrettable that Mr Hawke did not learn the lessons from 1987. Just last week, we learned that the big lie of the 1990 elections was confirmed. I refer to Mr Hawke's promise that `We won't let there be a recession'.

        I propose this evening to summarise the history of Mr Hawke's broken promise on child poverty from the time he decided to include it in his 1987 policy speech to the present day. It demonstrates, I believe, the style that Mr Hawke has brought into public life in Australia-a cynicism not matched by any other Prime Minister in memory. What distinguishes this Prime Minister, indeed, this Government, is a willingness to give explicit commitments about profound and complex issues which are breathtaking, initially in their boldness but ultimately in their deceit-false commitments relating to matters of great moment which greatly trouble this nation.

        This notorious broken promise by Mr Hawke continues to be a public issue some three years after it was made. Just a fortnight ago, Mr Hawke wrote to Mr Alasdair Webster, the honourable member for Macquarie, following a question raised by Mr Webster in the Parliament. In this letter, Mr Hawke makes the staggering admission that the Government did not have an accepted measure of poverty. How then, we may ask, could he promise that no Australian child would live in poverty when, by his own admission, the Government did not have a measure of poverty? Sir Walter Scott's famous quotation is well illustrated by Mr Hawke on the issue of child poverty. Sir Walter Scott said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        O what a tangled web we weave,
       </para>
       <para>
        When first we practise to deceive!
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I wish to place on record some of the deceptions, obfuscations and buck passing that Mr Hawke has indulged in in an attempt to explain away his broken promise. The first point of note is that it was apparently Mr Hawke's decision, and Mr Hawke's decision alone, to make his unequivocal, unqualified statement in the 1987 policy speech that:
       </para>
       <para>
        By 1990, no Australian child will be living in poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Richardson can confirm, when he stands up to speak, that there was apparently no Cabinet submission or document which would form the basis for this policy announcement. After all, as I have just noted, the Government does not have a definition of poverty. Richard Farmer, the well-known journalist and occasional Labor Party adviser, has informed us that the first version of the 1987 policy speech said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No child shall be consigned by the community to a lifetime of poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second draft of the speech said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No child should be consigned to poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are statements and sentiments which we can all have great sympathy with, but Mr Hawke had to go further. He wanted to capture the newspaper headlines with a dramatic statement. With a stroke of his pen, Mr Hawke changed a sensible and commendable statement to an unqualified promise that:

There is no sign here of any strong commitment backed by detailed policy advice. It has to be said, and it has to be said truly, that Mr Hawke's initial aim was certainly achieved. Newspaper headlines and radio bulletins featured the promise on child poverty that Mr Hawke had made before the nation. Mr Hawke reaffirmed this commitment all through the subsequent 1987 election campaign. On 1 July, just 10 days before the election, Mr Hawke said:

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let me go back a few steps in order to examine Mr Hawke's other deceptions. Since the initial promise, Mr Hawke has been asked numerous questions in the Parliament and in the media about the numbers of Australian children in poverty. Mr Hawke has tried a number of tactics in an attempt to extract himself from this commitment. The first tactic was the tactic I have called redefining the promise. First, Mr Hawke tried to change the promise by undertaking a remarkable series of semantic games and back flips. For example, in the Parliament in April 1988, just 10 months after the policy speech, Mr Hawke said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        How can I say at any time that no child will live in poverty?
       </para>
       <para>
        The answer to that is that he can say it, he did say it, and he said it in the 1987 election speech. He tried to refer us to the small print, saying the real promise was contained in the attachments to the policy speech, which said:
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be no need for any Australian child to live in poverty by 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        This ploy did not work. The public naturally regarded that the overriding commitment was contained in the policy speech televised to the nation on 23 June 1987. The newspaper headlines of the time convey the contempt with which Mr Hawke's effort to redefine the promise was treated. The Canberra Times said: `Hawke back-pedals on election promise'. The Adelaide Advertiser said: `Hawke hit by loss of memory'. Most devastating of all was the headline in the Australian: `Poor children need not depend on Hawkespeak'. It did not work, and so another tactic had to be adopted and this tactic was to blame the parents. This was tactic No. 2. On 23 February 1998, Mr Hawke berated parents who forced poor children out of home. One month later he argued:
       </para>
       <para>
        I can't dictate that no parents will behave awfully to lead kids to run away from home.
       </para>
       <para>
        This tactic proved as unconvincing to the public as his earlier attempt to redefine the promise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tactic No. 3 was worked out. I do not know whether the honourable senators in the chamber on the Labor side were involved in this. Tactic No. 3 was another bold stroke. It was called: `I've kept my promise'. As the political pressure mounted, Mr Hawke and his advisers announced this new strategy. The tactic was to claim that the promise had been kept-not only kept, but delivered early, before the 1990 deadline. On 13 April 1989, Mr Hawke arranged to have a dorothy dixer asked by the honourable member for Petrie, Mr Johns. Mr Hawke answered:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am proud to say I lead a Government which has not waited until 1990 to deliver on its promises. In 1989 we have delivered on that promise to the benefit of 3.8 million children.
       </para>
       <para>
        As usual, Mr Hawke indulged in a massive overstatement. Tactic No. 3 reached its peak in September 1989 when Mr Hawke said at a speech to the annual conference of the Australian Council of Social Service in Melbourne:
       </para>
       <para>
        At the outset of the last election campaign, I committed a re-elected Labor Government to an ambitious and proud goal: the elimination of child poverty in Australia. Since the re-election we have acted with determination to reach that goal-and we reached it ahead of target.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us remember that this is the man who told Mr Webster just two weeks ago that he could not define poverty. In the next part of his speech Mr Hawke again attempted to qualify his big statement:
       </para>
       <para>
        We made it clear that our pledge in this matter was to do what was in our power to do-that is, to create the situation where there was no financial need for a child to live in poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The newspaper headlines reflected the cynicism of the nation. The Sydney Morning Herald's headlines summed up the nation's response:
       </para>
       <para>
        PM's poverty claim rouses angry chorus.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tactic three, `I've kept my promise', collapsed within days as welfare lobbies and others pointed out the absurdity of the Prime Minister's claim.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tactic four is what I have called `I'm (a little bit) sorry'. Within days the backtracking started again. With the election looming, Mr Hawke and his advisers decided that a degree of contrition might restore the credibility of the Prime Minister. Tactic four was to admit a slight error-a drafting error. On 29 October 1989, Mr Hawke said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The shorthand phrase in the speech I consider, in retrospect, was unfortunate.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the following day he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No government in a democracy can ensure there will be no children living in poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        That statement at least is correct. Nevertheless, the debate continued with major welfare agencies demanding action on Mr Hawke's child poverty promise. The election was looming and another tactic was required. With 18 days to go to the beginning of 1990, when it should be remembered that no child should be living in poverty, Mr Hawke adopted an old tactic-call a summit. Undoubtedly this strategy was aimed to divert the attention of the public, welfare agencies and the press with yet another talkfest. Financial assistance, it was argued, was not the only way to eliminate child poverty. What was needed were better services, and the summit of Federal and State governments would help tackle this goal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, all through the 1989 election campaign Mr Hawke was continually pressed on his broken promise, which showed every sign of becoming one of the most infamous statements in Australian history. Tactic six I have called, `Blame the punctuation'-or, more specifically, `Blame the colon'. Some 29 days before the 1990 election was called, Richard Farmer suggested another approach. Calling Hawke's broken promise in 1987 a `mock controversy', he argued that the colon in Mr Hawke's policy speech had caused all the trouble. He urged:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . politicians should never read a sentence with a colon in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        He pointed out that the previous sentence read as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        So we set ourselves this first goal: by 1990, no Australian child will be living in poverty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hawke, it has to be said, unlike Mr Farmer, has never blamed the colon. Tactic six therefore argues that the promise was never a promise but only a goal. Richard Farmer continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite possible to chide a Prime Minister for not achieving his goal but it is quite a different thing in claiming that he has broken a promise.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what the journalist and occasional Labor Party adviser wrote. In the post-March election period Mr Hawke has continued to be questioned on his promise to eliminate child poverty. Newspaper articles and accompanying cartoons continue to keep Mr Hawke's promise before the public. As noted by Richard Farmer in June, the promises become the brunt of jokes in the schoolyard.
       </para>
       <para>
        Welfare agencies and church leaders continue to call for action on child poverty. Archbishop Hollingworth has been viciously attacked by the Prime Minister, we can all recall, because of his concern about the effect Government policies were having on child poverty. Still the questions in Parliament continue. Straightforward questions on 13 and 14 November by Ken Aldred, the honourable member for Deakin, and Alasdair Webster, the honourable member for Macquarie, on the number of children in poverty indicated that the Prime Minister had no idea of the numbers of children in poverty three years after the promise was made.
       </para>
       <para>
        However-and this is quite important-in answer to those two questions he did accept that the numbers could be estimated. For example, he told Mr Aldred that he would have to do the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . refer to my colleague, the Minister for Social Security, to give the precise number that he would use in answer to the specific questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, we reach tactic seven: the sterile debate. What could Mr Hawke and his advisers do? Was there another way of getting Mr Hawke off the hook? I do not know if Senator Richardson was involved in this stunt, but maybe he can tell us the answers. The first step was not to provide an answer to Parliament, but to provide a written response away from the glare of the press gallery. Mr President, I now seek leave to table the letter from Mr Hawke to Mr Webster.

         —In the letter, as I have mentioned, Mr Hawke said that there was no widely accepted measure of poverty. That is correct; on the other hand, no other politician goes around promising to eliminate something he is not prepared to define. But Mr Hawke and his advisers had clearly forgotten Mr Hawke's comments early in July 1987 that families with children would be lifted above the Henderson poverty line.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The letter called the whole issue `a sterile debate'. In other words, people should stop talking about the numbers of children in poverty. Anyone who is concerned about the numbers of children in poverty is, according to Mr Hawke, only indulging in a sterile debate. This strategy is likely to prove as unsuccessful as all his previous attempts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Archbishop Hollingworth is quoted in the Age in October as having estimated that 500,000 children were living in poverty. He spoke of what he called Mr Hawke's `unfinished business'. He warned of the adverse economic effects of the Government's high interest rate policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is where the `big lie' of the 1987 election joins hands with the `big lie' of the 1990 election. In 1990, Mr Hawke said that he would not let there be a recession. Today in the Parliament, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) indicated that the Government had engineered a recession. The Treasurer has engineered the collapse of tens of thousands of small businesses, and he is engineering hundreds of thousands of Australians into unemployment.

         —I will not speak for very long. I think it is only the second time I have spoken on the adjournment debate. The reason I am doing so is that I am concerned, as Senator Walters was concerned, about an answer that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, gave today concerning the Bay View laundry. When I perused the answer that was given and compared it with the press release that Senator Tate put out, certainly I found some matters of concern.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If one looks at the answer that was given by Senator Tate today, one would believe that this matter had just been raised and that Senator Tate had dealt with it very speedily. He said that he had undertaken to give speedy consideration to the matter; his was a great government, and it had come up with $45,000. As Senator Walters has already said, the promise was made to those people before the election in March that they would receive $183,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that in desperation, after getting nowhere with anybody, those people involved approached members of the Opposition, such as Senator Walters and me, and possibly Senator Harradine. I know that Senator Tate was not very happy about that, but I believe that by doing so the people involved certainly brought the matter to a head. I am pleased to see that something has been done immediately, that is, that they have $45,000. I notice that in the press statement, which does give me a little more faith in the Minister's credentials, he says that further funds will be provided this month to implement certain recommendations.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end of the statement the Minister says that as a result of this process the laundry will survive so that employment can be provided. I am rather amazed to see that in the answer to the question, Senator Tate said that Peat Marwick Hungerfords management consultants had been asked to investigate the factors leading to the laundry's operating losses. He knows, I know and I think everybody else in Tasmania knows what caused that problem-it was the airlines strike.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bay View laundry principally relies on laundry supplied by the hotel trade in Hobart. The disastrous airline strike and the downturn in tourism in Tasmania is the reason that the laundry ran into trouble. The Government did not need Peat Marwick Hungerfords to tell it that. I am surprised that the Government had to go to all this trouble. I suppose it has had to do so to justify the amount of money that is going to be paid. I hope the amount of money that will be paid will be the $183,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said earlier, I have always had a lot of faith in Senator Tate. I have trusted and believed in him. I do not know who made the promise back in February-March. But whoever made it, those people, in good faith, have believed that this Government would provide assistance to them. This genuine case has been caused by the airline strike. We see that the quick fix today is $45,000 and `We will wait and see what else we can dish out to you to help you out'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think that is good enough. A promise was made. As the previous speaker-Senator Kemp-said, this Government is very good at breaking promises. I just hope that this promise is not broken and that that very worthy fabricare laundry in Hobart, the Bay View laundry, does receive the moneys it was promised and that the matter will be settled in a very short time.

        I am concerned, as were the other two senators who have spoken and, I assume, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, that the money that was promised will be forthcoming.

The press statement refers to the matter of payments being made-or words to that effect-prior to the end of this month.
       </para>
       <para>
        I expect that that will occur. I know that Senator Tate will appreciate that, if it does not occur, there will be a number of very disappointed people-a number of people prepared to roast the Government from one end of Tasmania to the other because of a broken commitment. I am prepared to leave it now on the basis of the Minister's statement, in the expectation that not only will the promised amount of money be there but also that there will be a guarantee for the future viability of this laundry which, as I say, provides so many jobs for people with disabilities and provides such a good service to Hobart.

         —It is no wonder that this Hawke Labor Government is in deep trouble. As we are all aware, it is in complete disarray with regard to its economic management. Despite lengthy debate in both Houses today on the Gulf crisis and Australia's involvement there, Senator Loosley's remarks earlier tonight demonstrate that the Government is also in some disarray on this very important issue.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Opposition has clearly supported the Government's initiatives concerning the Gulf crisis. It was in that spirit of bipartisanship that my statement-which was reported in today's edition of the Adelaide Advertiser, and which Senator Loosley has attacked tonight-was released yesterday. This Government needs full community support for the decisions it has to take with regard to the Gulf crisis, provided it justifies those decisions with evidence and valid argument. In my view it has justified the possibility that operational requirements may involve our sailors remaining in the Gulf over Christmas rather than returning home for normal family celebrations.
       </para>
       <para>
        If that is a decision which has to be taken in the interests of Australia's role in the Gulf then, harsh as it may seem, we should all support it. However, yesterday's Adelaide Advertiser reported as follows on its front page:
       </para>
       <para>
        The wives and girlfriends of sailors aboard the frigates Adelaide and Darwin last night made a plea to the Federal Government to bring their men home for Christmas as promised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later, the article referred to one particular wife and quoted her as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . she was filled with anger at the news her husband . . . might not be home for Christmas.
       </para>
       <para>
        By attacking me tonight, Senator Loosley is adding his voice to those pleas. He is seeking the popularity of some sailors' families-families whom I believe would be in the minority as against the total number of sailors' families-at the cost of undermining the operational efficiency of our naval commitment to the Gulf crisis; at the cost of undermining decisions which his own Labor Government may need to take, thereby demonstrating to all the extent of the divisions now evident in this failed Government even on issues of fundamental importance such as our Gulf commitment; and at the cost of undermining the total commitment required from the whole Australian community if our involvement in the Gulf is to be successful.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said in several media interviews yesterday on this issue, one can well understand families wanting these sailors to be home to share Christmas together; one can certainly sympathise with that desire. One can accept families privately commenting that they wished that their spouses or children could be home for Christmas; that is only normal, and indeed such private comment would be acceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In today's Adelaide Advertiser the sister of one of the sailors, in response to my comments, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We all know they have to go but to say that we miss them and want them home is not whingeing . . . it's just having human feelings.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is certainly very true, but it is not the sort of comment to which I was referring. The sort of comment to which I was referring was the report in the Adelaide Advertiser of the previous day where a group of sailors' families was making a public plea to the Government to bring the sailors home for Christmas against what may well be contrary operational requirements. That is an entirely different matter from some private expression of a wish that people's sailor spouses or children should be home for Christmas. It is an entirely different matter to seek to bring public pressure on the Government through media statements complaining about a possible change in operational requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unlike Senator Loosley, I was prepared to support publicly his Government's decision on this matter; unlike Senator Loosley, I was prepared to speak out for those sailors' families who, whatever their private anguish about the dangers to the sailors, are willing to accept bravely and quietly the need for them to fulfil the task they were sent to do. It is my belief that those families are in the majority and it is only a minority making public complaint-a minority with which Senator Loosley has aligned himself thus undermining his Government's policies and the efforts of our sailors in the Gulf.
       </para>
       <para>
        When someone joins our Services, let us remember that he does so on an entirely voluntary basis. Fortunately we no longer have conscription in this country, which we had some years ago, so people who join our services-whether it is the Royal Australian Army, the Royal Australian Navy, or the Royal Australian Air Force-do so voluntarily in the full knowledge that they may well be sent anywhere in the world at any time and at short notice to defend Australia's interests. One assumes their families also have full knowledge of that requirement and share that decision with them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this instance our sailors have been sent to do a job in Australia's interests in the Gulf. As was earlier indicated, they may well have been expected home for Christmas, but if a change in operational requirements makes that impossible, it must be accepted. Public complaint against such a change in operational decisions is highly damaging to their morale. Our sailors need total commitment and support from every Australian and most importantly from their own families to stay and complete the job they were sent to do and then to return home in the knowledge they have been successful and have successfully done the job we sent them to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        A tug of war between their families and the Government to bring them home before the job is completed will severely undermine their morale. Such public pleas will also give Saddam Hussein wonderful comfort. Let us not forget that the Vietnam War, whatever the rights or wrongs of that war, was in large measure lost at home because of the loss of will to fight and continual calls to bring our boys home. Seeing reports such as that in yesterday's Adelaide Advertiser will only encourage Saddam Hussein to the view that he has only to wait long enough and pressure will build in the home countries of the United Nations forces to bring the boys home. It will give him much comfort to see reports of that nature in the media.
       </para>
       <para>
        From a strategic viewpoint every encouragement must be given to our servicemen to stay and finish the job. Did the families of servicemen in World War I, World War II and in the Korean War demand to have their boys sent home for Christmas? Of course not; indeed, they were away for several Christmases without public complaint from their families, and so it must be if that is the operational requirement in this situation, as difficult as that may be for the families involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his remarks tonight Senator Loosley referred to public opinion. Despite the fact that my comments were reported in a front page article in the Adelaide Advertiser, a relatively small number of people have reacted by calling my office. About 20 people did so, and the majority of them support my stand. That is despite the fact that, in a situation such as this, it would be more likely that those hostile to such a statement from me would contact my office to express their opposition to it. In other words, one is more likely to be contacted by people reacting negatively rather than positively to such a comment.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is Senator Loosley who is out of touch with the public and indeed with the majority of families of personnel serving in the Gulf. I am confident that the majority of those servicemen's families want their relatives serving there to stay and finish the job and not to come home with the job half done. It is those families who are prepared to quietly bear the burden of anguish, which I share with them should the worst happen. It is they who are showing bravery and fortitude, along with their relatives at the front line. It is on their behalf that I spoke out yesterday, so let Senator Loosley speak out for the vocal minority and let their comments, which were blown up by the media, undermine the morale of those with serving relatives and undermine the efforts of Australia to evict this madman, Hussein, from Kuwait.

They have been sent there to do a dreadful job by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) without the consent of many Australians. Seeing as they are doing that job, yes, they need our support. But surely Senator Chapman does not expect every Australian who disagrees with the Government to stay silent. In a democracy we have the ability to speak and we need to speak. If our version of the truth is different from the Government's, then we are morally bound to speak, particularly in a matter like this where Australians are possibly being committed to a war.

        I do not agree with the situation. I did not agree with it on 10 August when the Prime Minister sent the original deployment.

        As for Senator Chapman's rhetoric about a job half done, it sounds as though he just cannot wait for the weapons to start to fly.

We should be talking about a negotiated settlement and mediation to avert a war situation, not champing at the bit to get in there and start the firing. I can hardly believe, except that I have just sat here and heard it, that somebody would speak in those terms about the deployment of Australian naval officers in the Gulf. It is just terrible to think that they are being so strongly supported to get on and do the fighting because they have not finished the job. I do not think that the original job was intended to be one of fighting, though unfortunately that may have changed somewhat in the last few days.

        Talking about a dereliction of duty, Senator Button, in his effort in the Parliament today, did not have the guts, the temerity or the interest in the issue to deliver the Prime Minister's speech. When he was called upon to do so, he consistently refused. The words need to be said because if a war follows in the Gulf, in history the Prime Minister's statement will be seen as the document which will have committed Australian men and women to that war situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I asked Senator Button, `Why didn't you just read the statement; it would have taken a lot less time than all the argument about it?', he said words to the effect that he could not be bothered, that he was sick of reading speeches. That is truly outrageous. He is the Leader of the Government in this chamber. This is the only chamber where there will be any debate on this subject. There was no debate in the House of Representatives about it whatsoever because there is concurrence between the two major parties on this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        So this is the statement which will be referred to in future years, if a war breaks out, as the one that committed this country to war, yet the Leader of the Government in the Senate did not have the guts or the interest to even read it. This is the most significant statement that has been made in this Parliament certainly since I have been here, and I would argue in the life of any sitting member of parliament in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The significance seems to have been lost on most members of parliament. I find it truly a contempt of the Senate that Senator Button could not be bothered to read the statement. Even when he was asked to do so, he consistently refused. It was very pig-headed behaviour.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that on the 7.30 Report tonight the Prime Minister stated that the Government will consider any request for increased commitment. Again, it fills me with great sorrow to hear that the Prime Minister has made that kind of statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Alan Ramsey, on ABC radio a short time ago, said that there was no real dissent detected within Australian Labor Party ranks in Canberra today. That is from the media's point of view. I know that that is not true. There are people who are very concerned about this statement and, as I suggested earlier, I wish that, for their own integrity, they would speak out about this. Voters need to know who in the Government ranks is supporting this slide towards war and who is not supporting it. Alan Ramsey also said that the Prime Minister got what he wanted after the various factional meetings yesterday and that he has not had his wings clipped in terms of extra deployment of forces. I think that is pathetic, but that is too mild a word to use.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is like the slide into any war. There is just a little bit of an engagement and then a little bit more as it is requested. By whom it will be requested we are not told. Presumably it will be by the United States military command because there is no United Nations military command; it does not exist. The Prime Minister did not even need to be invited to do so when he contributed the Australian force so generously in early August. No doubt as the opportunity arises in future he will make further commitments. I do not know whether anybody in the Labor Party has said to him, `We won't wear it. We won't let you get away with it'. But that is what has to be said. The Prime Minister's stand at the moment is like being a little bit pregnant. He is saying, `Well, we are just committing a little bit here. We are not really going to get involved'. Of course, if the shooting starts there is no way that the Australian forces will be able to get out and the Prime Minister will not even want them to get out. He is more concerned about supporting the Americans in this than anything else, and that includes the lack of concern about the Australian hostages.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have said before but I think it needs to be said again that war will not solve the problems in the Middle East. The roots of the problems lie in colonialism, complicated by oil. Iraq was created by the British out of three Ottoman provinces with nothing in common and denied open access to the sea to prevent it from becoming too strong. During the war with Iran, Iraq was supported by the Saudis in the west to oppose the power of Iran and Islamic fundamentalism. Weapons poured in. For that, 30 countries were responsible. They included the United Kingdom, the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, France and China, the latter three being the main arms suppliers. Saddam Hussein ran up terrible debts in order to pay for these weapons and resents the oil states with wealth not letting him off the hook now. That is largely what the dispute with Kuwait, which led to its invasion, was all about-not that I am excusing it and I do not want to be misinterpreted as doing so because it was not excusable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dispute over the oil field on the Iraq-Kuwait border, along with frustration at the lack of access to the open sea from the port of Umm Qasr past two uninhabited islands that are part of Kuwait, reflects this. These two islands could be part of a negotiated settlement, and this is one of the things that Saddam Hussein has been calling for. But his calls for talks have until now met with a stony silence from the United States.

         —I think all of the issues of the Middle East should be put on the international agenda and the way to proceed is through a negotiated and mediated settlement. War should not be considered at any stage, particularly at this stage when sanctions are just beginning to bite. As I said earlier, it took 12 years for sanctions to be effective in the case of South Africa, and it took four short months in this situation before the initiative of the United States started drumming up the noises about oil and, in so doing, jeopardising the chance for a peaceful and negotiated settlement.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is a way out that is possible, but to be honest it is unlikely that the United States will remove its massive forces without actually using them-and I regret to have to acknowledge that. The only thing to make that possible is to remove what support there is in the multinational force, and it is very interesting to observe that there are many chinks appearing in this multinational force for which Mr Baker and President Bush have been trying to gear up support in the lead-up to the United Nations resolution last week.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been said-and I am quoting Malcolm Booker from the Canberra Times today:
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the most important aspect of last week's resolution is that instead of consolidating the anti-Iraqi alliance it has virtually isolated the US. The members of the Security Council have in effect said to the Americans, ` `Go ahead and attack the Iraqis, if you dare, but it is your responsibility''. Britain is still pledged to go along, but there is no sign that the French have changed their stand that their forces will not be placed under US command and that they will make their own decision as to whether they will be used. And no-one now expects that either the Syrians or the Egyptians would join in a US-led attack on Iraq.
       </para>
       <para>
        Neither would the Soviets. The Soviets are too mindful of the pain that they caused their own citizens, to say nothing of the Afghan people, in the Afghan war just a short time ago. They will not get engaged in the fighting.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it seems to me as though the administration of the Government of the United States, not the people, could be likened to military junkies. They have refused to talk up till now, and they should have started the talking months ago. We need to remove the support system, and that is the only way to wean them off the drug of militarism. They cannot fight alone, so if various nations withdraw the support from them a war will not happen. That is why I argue for Australia to be out of the Gulf region. That is why I argue for the Australian Government to reassess its commitment and to get out now while it can.
       </para>
       <para>
        I totally deplore the statement made today by the Prime Minister because I think it is this slide towards war which we have seen happen before. The supreme irony is that it was the Australian Labor Party that got us out of the Vietnam debacle and it is the Australian Labor Party which is now getting us into the Gulf war. There is a real danger of the 15 January deadline. War could begin before that time via a deliberate concocted ploy-and we must not rule out that possibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will suggest a hypothetical scenario to the Senate: there is a big loser in this issue if a negotiated settlement is found and if war is averted-which we all surely fervently hope for-and that big loser would be Israel. The United States would look very silly continuing to veto United Nations resolutions in future calling on Israel to get out of occupied territories, because the veto has not been used in this situation. The fact that the veto is not being used is meant to be a new dimension in international politics. So it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that under some concocted pretext, the truth of which may never be revealed, missiles could start to fly.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we could slide into this war, notwithstanding United Nations resolutions, and the 15 January deadline could be pre-empted. It will be virtually impossible for Australia to withdraw once we are closely engaged and under US command. Australia would therefore find itself in an undeclared war, as it did in Vietnam-a war with enormous consequences. My strong belief is that Australia should have no part in this slide towards war.
       </para>
       <para>
        I, as a representative of the Greens, Western Australia, in concert with the Australian Democrats, speak for millions of Australians who say, `Not in my name'. Let us consider who wants to gear up for war in the Gulf. It is not the people of the world; not the veterans of previous wars. It is the old men and politicians, with the exception of Mrs Thatcher when she was still Prime Minister of Great Britain.

Senator Walters, Senator Calvert and Senator Harradine all referred to an answer which Senator Tate gave today in Question Time concerning the Bay View laundry. I have no specific facts to add to what Senator Tate said today, but I understand that the Bay View laundry is an enterprise conducted by a group of disabled people and it is indeed a worthy cause. Therefore, I treat the remarks of the honourable senators seriously. I will follow the matter up with Senator Tate in the morning and I hope to get some more information for honourable senators on that tomorrow. I cannot add anything specifically to what Peat Marwick Hungerfords have been asked to investigate or to whether or not that means $183,000. I do not know the status of the investigation or how far it has gone, so that is something I will have to check in the morning.

It is something the Government has responded to many times. It is so old and so tired-a bit like Senator Alston-that we just do not see it necessary to answer.

        In respect of Senator Chapman, we probably have not heard the last of the reaction to his comments in the Advertiser. I can say quite categorically that the Government is appalled by Senator Chapman's efforts. One wonders how one silences the cry of a wife or a child for a husband who will not be there at Christmas. Whether one has to accede to the request is another matter, but how anyone can attempt to criticise the women or the children for even being upset is beyond my comprehension. Nonetheless, it is a question that will have to be answered by Dr Hewson and the Liberal Party of Australia, not just by Senator Chapman, because the Government will be keen to learn of the Liberal Party's response to Senator Chapman's extraordinary and rather silly call.

        Finally, in response to Senator Vallentine, I can understand how bitterly disappointed she may have been when the Security Council carried the resolution it did the other day, but at some point in time those who seek to invade neighbouring countries, to murder and pillage and then to keep hostages will have to know that there is a price to pay, that the world will no longer tolerate that kind of behaviour. The fact that finally we are seeing an active and effective United Nations is, I think, to the benefit of the world as a whole. Far from saying that Senator Vallentine represents millions of Australians, I believe that on this particular question she represents very few.

        —On 1 June 1990 (Hansard page 1734) Senator Hill asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Given that in most cases the costs incurred in preparing environmental impact studies of major new developments are not tax-deductible, does the Minister agree that the taxation law is lagging behind community concern and the requirements of government concerning environmental protection? Will the Government include this issue in the current review of taxation arrangements applying to mine-site rehabilitation and removal of offshore petroleum platforms?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       Environmental impact studies for new projects are not generally tax deductible as they are considered to be capital in nature. In the case of some mining operations however, environmental impact statements may form part of exploration and prospecting expenditure and such expenditure is deductible under the mining provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government has a strong commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development. In furtherance of this commitment, the 1990-91 Budget Statement included an announcement that capital expenditure on mine site rehabilitation is, subject to some minor limitations, to be fully tax deductible.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Budget also contained an announcement that a review is to be undertaken by Treasury into the taxation treatment generally of capital expenditure incurred by business in relation to the environment. The scope of this review will include consideration of the taxation treatment of environmental impact studies.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is anticipated that the results of this review will be announced in the 1991-92 Budget.
