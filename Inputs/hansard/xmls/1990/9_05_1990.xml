       Medicare: Abortions
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469,274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.

       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws the attentions of the Senate to our opposition to any attempt to restrict access to the rebate for abortions under Medicare.
      </para>
      <para>
       Medicare is a universal health care system and as such the availability of any schedule item should never be determined on the basis of the moral values of a minority of citizens. Equity and access within the present system should be the right of all Australian citizens and guaranteed to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Webster Abortion Funding Abolition Bill would, if successful, severely limit the availability of rebates for items 6494, 274 and 275. The effect would be twofold-further discrimination against all women (particularly those who could not afford the full cost of this procedure) and an invasion of the confidentiality that exists between client and medical practitioner.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any related items on the Medicare schedule.

      <para>
       The undersigned citizens of Australia, and custodians of the Earth, oppose the patenting of animals, and the processes for altering them. Animal patents would *reduce biodiversity, *compromise animal welfare, *concentrate ownership of breeding stock, and *allow companies to appropriate the fruit of centuries of selective breeding. We note with concern that many applications for animal patents have been lodged with the Australian Patents Office and without your intervention they may soon be approved.

      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned shows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Nurrungar is a US military communications base located about 500 km north-west of Adelaide. Last year, the Australian Government renewed its lease for another 10 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nurrungar receives and processes information on Soviet missile launches and nuclear tests from US satellites. Nurrungar is also part of the US Star Wars network. The base therefore involves Australia in preparations for nuclear war.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nurrungar is an acknowledged target in the event of a nuclear conflict.
      </para>
      <para>
       With the launch of new satellites in the early 1990s, any arms control role Nurrungar may possibly have played will be redundant.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has little control over or even knowledge of Nurrungar's role, thus undermining our independence and sovereignty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nurrungar is part of a land claim by the traditional owners of the area, the Kukutha people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Available figures suggest we pay $30 million a year towards the cost of running Nurrungar.
      </para>
      <para>
       Latest opinion polls show 51% of Australians do not want US communications bases with a nuclear role.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should:
      </para>
      <para>
       Immediately serve notice on the United States Government to terminate the lease on Nurrungar.

       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the Senate of their concern regarding proposed changes to the laws governing credit reporting, as suggested in the Bill `The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed reforms will:
      </para>
      <para>
       Restrict the legitimate use of credit checking by business who sell/supply goods and/or services to their customers on credit terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposals/reforms will prevent businesses from determining the solvency of their customers and will increase the financial risk of credit providers, leading to an increase in company liquidations and individual bankruptcies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additional costs to business from bad debts due to the lack of adequate credit checking information will result in the increased prices/charges and will result in credit providers refusing credit facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate will call on the Government to refer these proposals restricting credit checking to a Senate Standing Committee for further consideration before proceeding with the matter.

The Committee sought, at very short notice, original documents to satisfy itself that all relevant material was available to it; and the ADC did not have copies of at least some of the documentation. The Committee, having completed its inquiries, considers that the original documents should be returned to the appropriate custodians, to ensure the integrity of the organisation's records. The Committee has, of course, retained a copy of every document produced to it.

        â€”by leave-I thank Senator Ray for his cooperation in relation to notice No. 8, which will restore certain Bills to the Notice Paper at the stage they had reached when the Parliament was prorogued. We have no difficulty with the Australian National Maritime Museum Amendment Bill being restored to the Notice Paper. It has been on the Notice Paper of one House or the other now, I think, for the last five years and at some stage ought to be debated. The same applies to the Senate (Quorum) Bill.
       </para>

      <para>
       I understand that restoration of the Privacy Amendment Bill to the Notice Paper at the stage it had reached, which was just prior to entering into the committee stage, would in fact facilitate the reference of this Bill to a Senate committee. I understand it is not intended that we proceed with this Bill during this four weeks of sitting. We, however, would just like to clarify with the Government the general nature of what we understand to be the Government's proposed further amendments to the Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       Once we have had an opportunity to look at the general thrust of the Government's proposed further amendments, we will then be in a position to make a determination as to whether the Bill should be restored at the stage which it had reached in order to be sent off to a committee. We would just like to clarify those matters in advance. Once that has been done I am sure we can come back to the arrangement which Senator Ray previously indicated. I take this opportunity to thank Senator Ray for his cooperation on this matter.

       <para>
        FEDERAL AIRPORTS CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990
       </para>
       <para>
        A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that government business enterprises (GBEs) should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The GBEs within the Transport and Communications portfolio, in addition to producing final goods and services for consumers, also produce intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, with a resulting impact on Australia's overall cost structures and the ability of Australian businesses to compete internationally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government sees the commercialisation of GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvements in efficiency. GBEs such as the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) are therefore being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with the disciplines traditionally associated with private sector enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, together with the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1989, represents the legislative changes necessary to finalise the Government's reform of its aviation industry enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reform package accords broadly with reform packages for other enterprises in the Transport and Communications portfolio which were announced in the ministerial statement of 25 May 1988 ``Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises''.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, as a relatively recent piece of legislation, the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 already incorporates a number of measures which accord closely with changes made to other public authorities through the GBE reform process. For example, the Act establishes corporate planning and financial targets as the basis for Government oversight of the FAC.
       </para>
       <para>
        To some extent, therefore, the Bill represents fine-tuning of the existing strategic controls over the Corporation to bring them more closely into line with other reform packages agreed by the Government. It also removes a range of detailed controls which the Government still exercises over the activities of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to presenting a package of reforms for the Federal Airports Corporation, the Bill includes provisions which will allow the Corporation to participate in arrangements to prevent or deal with hijacking or other acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. I now turn to specific provisions contained in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        A major change provided for in the Bill is the scrutiny of proposed statutory charges levied by the FAC under the Act by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). The Government believes there is a need for visible checks and balances to be put in place to ensure that there is no perceived misuse of the FAC's monopoly position. The Minister will retain the formal power to disallow charges and be given the power to set replacement charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions are intended to enhance the effectiveness of the Minister's present power to approve or disapprove charges, by providing the Minister with the opportunity to consider any report of the PSA before making a decision and by enabling the Minister to set charges to replace those which are unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In line with the philosophy of moving from oversight of day-to-day operations to an emphasis on results and Board accountability, the Bill removes a range of day-to-day controls exercised by Government, including controls over the terms and conditions of individual borrowings, the approval of individual contracts, the purchase of shares and the establishment of subsidiaries and partnerships. These are now appropriately the responsibility of the Board.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides greater recognition for the role and purposes of the Board, and greater emphasis on Board accountability for the performance of the Corporation. It also provides for an increase in Board size from 7 to 9 members.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other provisions in the Bill relating to appointment and dismissal of Board members, conduct of Board meetings and the appointment and powers of the Chief Executive Officer reflect more clearly the respective roles of the Minister and the Board and clarify issues of administration of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is fully satisfied that appropriate scrutiny of expenditure by the FAC will be maintained through the strategic oversight process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the FAC currently pays a range of Commonwealth and State taxes and duties, it is exempt from payment of Commonwealth sales tax and Commonwealth income tax. This Bill removes that exemption and provides for the FAC to be fully subject to Commonwealth sales tax with effect from 1 July 1990 and Commonwealth income tax with effect from 1 July 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill has no immediate financial implications for the Commonwealth, although, over time, the reforms of the Federal Airports Corporation included in the Bill are expected to enhance the efficiency of the Corporation and improve its returns to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The imposition of income tax on the Corporation for the 1991-92 financial year is expected to result in increased revenue to the Commonwealth. The amounts cannot be accurately quantified at this time, as they depend on a number of factors including the profitability of the Corporation, the extent of tax deductions obtained and the tax rates prevailing in the 1991-92 financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Liability for payment of Commonwealth sales tax, with effect from the beginning of the 1990-91 financial year, will result in increased revenue to the Commonwealth. The amounts will depend on actual purchases by the Corporation and cannot be accurately quantified at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 1990
       </para>
       <para>
        A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs.

GBEs such as the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) are therefore being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with the disciplines traditionally associated with private sector enterprises.

       </para>

        However, as a relatively recent piece of legislation, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 already incorporates a number of measures which accord closely with changes made to other public authorities through the GBE reform process. For example, the Act establishes corporate planning and financial targets as the basis for Government oversight of the CAA.

It also removes a range of detailed controls which the Government still exercises over the activities of the Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to presenting the package of reforms for the CAA, the Bill also includes provisions relating to the carriage of dangerous goods, clarification of the provisions relating to statutory liens on aircraft and protection from State laws where the CAA performs a function directly related to the regulation of air safety. The Bill also implements two amendments arising from recommendations of the first report of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to specific provisions contained in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        A key element in establishing an environment within the CAA which will encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency is the proposal to remove Public Service Act coverage of its employees, thereby making the CAA Board the direct employer and allowing a more flexible and business-like approach to the management of the Authority. Transitional arrangements contained in the Bill provide that existing staff will continue to be employed, initially, on the same terms and conditions. Mobility provisions of the Public Service Act will continue to apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another major change provided for in the Bill is the scrutiny of proposed statutory charges levied by the CAA under the Act by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). The Government believes there is a need for visible checks and balances to be put in place to ensure that there is no perceived misuse of the CAA's monopoly position. The Minister will retain the formal power to disallow charges and be given the power to set replacement charges.
       </para>

       </para>
       <para>
        In line with the philosophy of moving from oversight of day-to-day operations to an emphasis on results and Board accountability, the Bill removes a range of day-to-day controls exercised by Government, including controls over the terms and conditions of individual borrowings, the approval of individual contracts, the purchase of shares and the establishment of subsidiaries and partnerships.

       </para>
       <para>
        Although the CAA currently pays a range of Commonwealth and State taxes and duties, it is exempt from payment of Commonwealth income tax. This Bill removes that exemption and provides for the CAA to be fully subject to Commonwealth income tax with effect from 1 July 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated earlier, other provisions in the Bill, unrelated to the reform measures outlined above, include measures to implement, as far as practicable, the recommendations of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force's first report that the cost to industry of proposed standards of aviation safety should be taken into account by the Authority, and that significant offences in the regulations relating to crucial areas of air safety should be included in the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also strengthens the role of the Authority in specifying conditions for the carriage or consignment of dangerous goods and provides for the establishment of dangerous goods training programs for air operators and freight forwarders.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Act currently requires the Authority to grant individual permissions to carry or consign dangerous goods and to specify conditions in respect of each such permission. The section does not enable the Authority to grant general permissions. The amendments will empower the Authority to grant general permissions, in addition to the specific permissions currently provided for. Such permissions would be specified in Civil Aviation Orders or the Civil Aviation Regulations and would be subject to such conditions as the Authority specifies in the Orders or Regulations, as the case may be, in relation to the particular permission.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to ensure the effective screening of dangerous goods the Act will be amended to provide that an air operator must not carry air cargo and a freight forwarder must not accept any air cargo unless it is accompanied by a declaration of the contents of the cargo.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provisions in the Act relating to statutory liens on aircraft have been amended to rectify a deficiency in the definition of that term, and to extend the existing protection offered to the Authority and its officers to cover actions brought for recompense of economic loss suffered as a result of seizure of aircraft under the statutory liens provisions. The Act already provides that when an aircraft has been seized under a statutory lien then neither the Authority nor its officers may be sued for loss of, or damage to, the aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides that a state law will not apply to the Authority or its property where it is necessary for the Authority to perform functions directly related to the purpose of regulating air safety. The particular functions are the provision of air route and airway facilities, air traffic control and flight services on aerodromes, rescue and fire fighting services and search and rescue services.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is intended that this particular provision will only be used where the matter is essential to the performance of the Authority and negotiations with a State or local government authority have been unable to result in resolutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the recommendation of the Attorney-General's Department, the Bill amends existing pecuniary penalty provisions to bring the Act into line with recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1914.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill has no immediate financial implications for the Commonwealth, although, over time, the reforms of the Civil Aviation Authority included in the Bill are expected to enhance the efficiency of the Authority and improve its returns to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The imposition of income tax on the Authority for 1991/92 and subsequent financial years is expected to result in increased revenue to the Commonwealth. The amounts cannot be accurately quantified at this time, as they depend on a number of factors including the profitability of the Authority, the extent of tax deductions obtained and the prevailing tax rates.

       <para>
        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to preserve its continuity from 1 July 1990-the Act is otherwise scheduled to terminate on 30 June 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        In light of the 30 June 1990 expiry date for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, I, as honourable senators will recall, appointed a Committee for the Review of Export Market Development Assistance in December 1988. This Committee, chaired by Professor Helen Hughes of the Australian National University, was charged with examining Government measures providing financial assistance for exporters under the Export Market Development Grants Act and schemes established under the Australian Trade Commission Act. The Hughes Committee presented its report to me in July 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators will also recall that on 28 February this year the Prime Minister and I jointly released the Government's decision on the Hughes Committee report. The Government accepted the majority of the Committee's recommendations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In our announcement, the Prime Minister and I foreshadowed that amendments to the EMDG Act arising out of the Government's adoption of the Hughes Committee's recommendations would operate from 1 July 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst this is still to be the case, the recent election and the need to consult widely with interested bodies and persons about the precise nature of the new provisions required in a revised EMDG Act to give effect to the Government's decision, and the regulations which will underpin many of the extended services which will now become eligible under the EMDGs, precluded the required substantive amendments to the EMDG Act being brought forward in this Parliamentary Sittings. The Government wishes to ensure that all possible views are taken into account so that the best possible framework, within the limits of the Government's decision, is implemented in respect of the revised EMDG Scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, I have brought this Bill forward at this time to preserve the continuity of the EMDG Act so that no exporters will be disadvantaged by the Act lapsing through the effluxion of time.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is intended to bring an EMDG Amendment Act implementing the Government's announced changes to the EMDGs forward in this year's Budget Sittings, effective from 1 July 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        No financial impact is expected to arise from the current amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill was a previous Bill so the second reading is already on the record.

       <para>
        This report is the first under a general inquiry into the development of the Senior Executive Service (SES) begun by the Committee in June last year. It was largely completed in February. However, the cancellation of the two sitting weeks scheduled for February prevented tabling before the election. The Committee completed its considerations of the report on 18 April 1990 and resolved that the report be printed and tabled.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report covers the single issue of performance pay. The introduction of performance pay is currently under consideration by the Government and the Industrial Relations Commission and the Committee chose to make a special report on this matter so that our concerns could be given some weight when the decision is made.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Committee collected evidence on a wide range of other issues relating to the SES, it will take some time to consider and report on that evidence. I hope and expect that the Committee appointed in this Parliament will complete the inquiry with a further and more wide-ranging report in the Budget session.
       </para>
       <para>
        Committee concerns
       </para>
       <para>
        The report makes it clear that the Committee has serious concerns about the rationale for the introduction of performance based pay for the SES, the proposed arrangements for its introduction and the uncertainty which appears to exist about some structural and procedural aspects.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard  the remainder of my tabling statement, and I seek leave also to continue my remarks at a later time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Leave granted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The main theoretical justification for linking the pay system to performance is to provide an incentive for improved performance [para 18]. However, most of the official witnesses were vague on the exact nature of the anticipated benefits [para 34]. There is very strong evidence, especially in relation to experiments with performance based pay overseas, which suggest that costs as well as benefits can flow from linking pay and performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The possible costs include the demotivating effect on staff not rated as eligible for performance based pay, antagonism between groups participating in the new pay system and those which do not and adverse effects on group cohesion and cooperation. There may also be a disproportionate focus on the reward system to the detriment of organisational goals. It can be difficult to separate individual performance from group performance and, in many parts of the Public Service, it may be difficult to define performance at all [para 32].
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was sufficiently concerned by all this to recommend that performance based pay not be introduced until a formal study of the costs and benefits is undertaken and it is established that significant net benefits are likely [para 40].
       </para>
       <para>
        Some witnesses suggested that the performance based pay proposal involved an attempt to evade the wage guidelines [para 18]. It was also suggested that the new system would become market rather than merit related [para 35]. The Committee concluded that, if there is a case for market parity in SES remuneration, it should be argued openly, allowing full consideration of relevant issues [para 35].
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee stressed that, if loss of better performers among senior staff is the main problem, there are other options for dealing with it [para 36]. In particular, it should be possible to expedite measures already planned to improve the conditions of professionals like lawyers, accountants and engineers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Implementation
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear from the overseas experience of performance based pay that success depends on careful implementation [para 42]. The Committee has made recommendations aimed at avoiding significant potential problems if the proposal for performance pay does proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have recommended that, if performance based pay is introduced, coordination arrangements be improved in specific ways. We also recommended that implementation be phased in, with no agency being allowed to introduce performance based pay until it has operated a staff appraisal system for at least one year and that system has been independently certified to be effective. We recommended that the certification procedure include surveys that establish staff acceptance of the fairness, validity and reliability of the appraisal system and that the full results of the evaluation of the appraisal process be made public.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another recommendation is that, if performance pay is introduced, it be extended to the groups immediately below the SES at the same time as it is available to SES officers. We considered this desirable both for pragmatic and ethical reasons.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the time the Committee took evidence, no final decision had been made on whether details of performance payments to individuals should be public knowledge. We heard arguments both ways and the relevant academic literature is also divided on this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee concluded that the case for openness in public administration outweighed any possible increase in efficiency available from privacy on salary matters. Relevant to this conclusion was a belief that these efficiency gains would be, at best, problematic due to the difficulty of measuring public sector performance and the consequent ease with which the system could be manipulated. Public knowledge of levels of performance based payments might actually increase efficiency by forcing a higher general standard of honesty on those operating the system [para 66].
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee also recommended that performance based payments should be made largely or wholly in the form of bonus payments rather than as a supplement to regular salary payments. This was seen as enhancing the `at risk' element in the pay system which is generally seen as central to its motivational effects.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommended measures to ensure reasonable consistency in performance pay policies across the Public Service. We also drew attention to the need, already acknowledged by the Government, for adequate funding of any performance pay system that might be introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Flow on effects
       </para>
       <para>
        Committee consideration of this matter largely occurred in the first two months of the year. Developments since then, which are not reflected in the report, deserve a brief personal comment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposal to substantially improve SES remuneration in this way has significant implications for the groups immediately above and below the SES. The so-called feeder groups-Administrative Service Officers Class 7 and 8 and their professional equivalents-have begun industrial action based, in part, on perceptions of a large and increasing gap between their conditions and those of the SES. Department heads have also argued for a substantial wage rise partly on comparability grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the performance pay proposal was structured to avoid the problem of comparative wage justice, it appears to have been unsuccessful. It is also clear that performance based pay will not be a solution to any problems that might exist in regard to inadequate levels of pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para>
        In its report, the Committee expressed some sympathy with the professed intention of the performance pay proposal but also offered strong reservations about its practicality. Some members, myself among them, concluded that the proposal was inappropriate and fatally flawed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be a fair reading of the report to conclude that the Committee was not impressed with the level of policy development shown in this case. The performance pay proposal has not even been considered by the Public Service Management Advisory Board, although that body has a statutory responsibility to `advise the Government on significant issues relating to the management of the public service . . . . . and to be a forum for consideration of management activities affecting the Australian Public Service as a whole'. Such policy development as has occurred has been divided among three separate coordinating agencies and the Committee was not convinced that there has been adequate coordination of their activities [para 43].
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope that this report will both influence and improve the policy debate on executive remuneration in the public sector. There is certainly scope for a better debate than has so far occurred.

        The statement read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        This report follows a report on the timeliness and quality of annual reports presented by the Committee during the winter recess last year. The report I now table was largely completed in February. However, the cancellation of the two sitting weeks scheduled for February prevented tabling before the election. The Committee completed its consideration of the report on 18 April 1990 and resolved that the report be printed and tabled.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its June 1989 report, the Committee concluded that there had been a steady improvement in annual reporting, that the current standard was relatively high but that there was room for improvement. The Committee made recommendations aimed at improving various aspects of timeliness and quality of annual reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1989 report attracted considerable interest in the Public Service and it seemed to the Committee that there was a marked improvement in timeliness of tabling of the 1988-89 annual reports. We decided to examine this issue in a short follow-up to the earlier report.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report aims to be an overall comparative survey without going into the substance of the contents of reports. Each of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Committees will separately report on the substance of annual reports of agencies within the portfolios they review. The report covers the eighteen executive and five parliamentary departments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, the Committee was pleased to report that it was correct in its initial impression of a general improvement in reporting.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was a very marked improvement, for example, in timeliness for the 1988-89 reports. All but two of the 23 reports reviewed were tabled by the end of November 1989. Eight of the 1987-88 reports, by comparison, were tabled after November 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were also pleasing improvements in the numbers of departments which included indexes and other aids to users in their reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee noted that the length of all annual reports but one had increased, as had the amount of material appended to reports. This was largely the result of a new requirement for departmental annual reports to include detailed audited accounts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recognised that annual reports in the Australian Government sector are far larger and more complex than the reports of public companies or those of most State Government instrumentalities. This is not necessarily a bad thing. There is growing pressure for reform of this aspect of private sector performance and there are inevitable differences in public and private sector accountability systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new requirement to include audited accounts of departments in annual reports proved superior to the former practice of tabling of a single consolidated audit report. However, the accounts of nine departments were qualified in some respects, although five of the audit qualifications were minor. The Committee felt strongly that this number was too high. It notes that a similar number of qualifications were made to the departmental accounts in the previous year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another new requirement for 1988-89 was for reporting on measures taken to enhance social justice. It was apparent to the Committee that some departments took this requirement more seriously than did others. The Committee found that the departments of Community Services and Health and of Social Security were particularly effective in their reporting on social justice. Many other departments limited their reporting to brief comments on their access and equity plans.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, the reporting on statutory and non-statutory bodies in departmental annual reports was mixed. The report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which coordinates the annual reporting guidelines, provides a good model for reporting under this heading. However, many other departments failed to report fully, or sometimes at all, on bodies within their portfolio.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the few reservations outlined above, the Committee welcomed a significant improvement in the general quality of the majority of departmental annual reports. Perhaps the most important cautionary note is that the trend to longer and more complex reports may cause difficulty if it continues.

      <para>
       I appreciate that Senator Macklin is motivated by the fact that the Procedure Committee would take the paper, study it and eventually come back to the chamber with certain recommendations, but there are very considerable matters to be raised and a number of honourable senators would want to participate in the debate prior to the Procedure Committee considering this particular matter, and put certain views on the record in terms of what might be called a going-in position on this question of electronic voting.
      </para>
      <para>
       The paper which, Mr President, you have presented and which was circulated to us quite recently, is very detailed. It runs to some 16 pages and has a large number of attachments dealing with the question of electronic voting in a number of overseas parliaments. Because this is a matter which deals with the operation and the conduct of the chamber per se, it would not normally be a matter which would be decided on a party room level; in other words, those senators, like myself, who are inherently opposed to the system of electronic voting would not be in any sense corralled into dealing with this matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also take the opportunity to put on record certain views about this, against the possibility that if the matter does go to the Procedure Committee and the Procedure Committee reports at some later stage, I might not have the opportunity to make those views known at the time that the Procedure Committee reports.

        â€”Senator Hamer says that it would be a very quick report, but given the celerity with which the Procedure Committee has tended to deal with these matters, I am not persuaded even by the comments of my distinguished colleague. The matters canvassed in this report are not simply restricted to the question of electronic voting. For example, they deal with the question of recording of votes without division. We have in the past somewhat made use of this procedure.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I well recall on the last occasion that I was dealing with a piece of legislation-it was the electoral legislation that Senator Robert Ray, Senator Macklin and I were handling last year-and we came to the third reading of that Bill. Because we had crept a minute or two past 12.45, I simply rose in my place to indicate that we would not divide the Senate on the third reading but that I wished to record that all members of the Liberal and National parties would have voted against the third reading of the Bill if a division had been called.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was only to suit the convenience of the chamber that the division was not called. Nevertheless, it simply appears in the Hansard that I rose and said that all members would vote against the Bill if a division were called, but there is no division list. As a result we are not sure, for example, where Senator Harradine, Senator Dunn or Senator Vallentine might have stood on that particular matter because a division was not called.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a suggestion on pages 15 and 16 of the President's report which deals with the question of whether the party leaders should be authorised to make a statement and, having made a statement, that names should in fact be printed in the Hansard and in the Journals of the Senate so as to allow people to record their views in a more formal fashion. We have a comment again on page 15 that the question of cost may or may not be germane to our consideration. A figure of $80,000 is mentioned.
      </para>
      <para>
       Frankly, given the squeeze which there is on the Senate's budget, one of the additional things that the Opposition welcomes in Senator Walsh's translation to the back bench is that there may just be a Minister for Finance who takes a view that the Senate should be more adequately funded to undertake its activities. This is, I suppose, likely to be a vain hope, but I am in the process at the moment of keeping vain hopes alive, at least for the next couple of days.

       If, however, the Senate budget is to be continually constricted, there will be a real question to be asked as to whether $80,000-and $80,000 in this building tends to become somewhat more than $80,000-is in fact the correct allocation of Senate scarce resources in order to establish a system of electronic voting in order to save what the paper calculates may be a matter of only a few hours over the course of a whole parliamentary year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other matters which the President's paper raises include the question of guarantees that only the person who is supposed to vote, votes. Then there is the question as to whether people can change votes as they watch the little lights go up, or whether they would have to lock in their votes and then the lights would all go on together-which would be great fun. We have had quite interesting examples where people have missed votes. They have come in and said, `Somebody else stole the lift and we were not able to get in it, and therefore we were excluded'. Now we are going to have the problem of people saying, `Well, I didn't have my glasses with me and I pressed the wrong button'.That may or may not be the case. A quite legitimate comment is made on page 3 of the paper about the capacity to adjust pairs quickly. More than that: unless the voting has to take place at the senators' desks, the actual process of the public act of voting, as it is described, is one which needs to be taken into particular consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       So if the question is that the bells are to be rung for the appropriate period, that all senators are to come in to their places, that sitting in their place they will press the appropriate button or insert the appropriate card-if they remember to bring the card with them and they do not have the card in the desk and if somebody has not knocked off the card, and if they have not tried to put it into an automatic teller machine by which it has been seized and not yet returned to them-all of these matters need to be looked at.
      </para>
      <para>
       If, however, the voting is to take place by people coming in, sitting in their place and pressing the appropriate button, some time would be saved in looking around the chamber and the Whips actually writing down the numbers. From time to time-although nobody would normally admit it-there are people actually present in the chamber who should not be present in the chamber because some Whips' arrangement has been made and the Whips develop a selective myopia and names do not appear, names which were supposed not to appear because there was a pairing arrangement. Those sorts of things, which actually make the system work in a more effective fashion, could be comprised by this proposal.
      </para>
      <para>
       The paper is very useful in making the point that the claims often made that there are in the House of Commons and elsewhere far more regular procedures, under which everybody knows when a vote is to be taken and when those members of parliament in the United Kingdom who are under the Whip and who pay particular attention as to whether it is a one-line whip or a three-line whip actually bother to turn up for the vote, are based somewhat on a misconception. The President's paper is very useful in dealing with that matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       It seems to me that a legitimate complaint is often voiced by colleagues on my side and, indeed, by members of the Labor Party, that from time to time when a vote is called for, only the Democrats and some independent senators sit on one side of the chamber, while all other senators sit on the other side of the chamber. It may well be that if Senator Macklin were really devoted to the principle of saving time, he would call for fewer divisions when he knows that the Democrats will be the only ones voting on one side. If the Democrats were to do this, they would not be able to go out into the electorate and say, `Look, the two major parties always vote with each other. We are the only purists who make sure that all of these divisions take place'. If one were to analyse the amount of time which is taken up by the Democrats calling for divisions, as distinct from the major parties calling for divisions, one may be provided with an interesting set of new statistics.
      </para>
      <para>
       The disadvantages of electronic voting are well set out on page 11 of the document. The proposition that electronic voting would cause more divisions to be called seems to me to be a potential nightmare for all of those who are considering the question of the saving of time. I believe that in due course this matter, the Senate having formally requested a report on it from you, Mr President, will have to be considered by the Senate. It is probably correct that the Procedure Committee or some similar committee should be asked to study your paper, Mr President, eventually make a response, and then bring forward any proposals for changes, including any proposals for changes to the Standing Orders. If that were to be the case, I hope that members of the Government would be left in the same position as members of the Opposition parties-that is, they should be able to exercise their vote entirely on the basis of their own beliefs and conscience, and the matter should not be perceived to be a matter for Caucus.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposal to refer the matter to the Procedure Committee at this stage is not supported by the Opposition. We believe that the political parties and the independent senators should have more time to consider this matter. It may well be that, having considered it, they will want to make a decision on it at that time, rather than send the report to the Procedure Committee, bearing in mind particularly that the President's paper is a detailed and comprehensive one-one which I cannot imagine would be substantially altered or improved by referring it to the Procedure Committee. We would be more inclined to support the option of making the President's report an order of the day so that we can decide whether the Senate is in favour, in principle, of the introduction of a system of electronic voting. If it is so in favour, the Senate may refer to the Procedure Committee, the Standing Orders Committee or some other appropriate committee the mechanism by which the President's report should be adopted and put in place.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are not in favour of referring this matter to the Procedure Committee at this stage. We would be happy to have discussions with Senator Macklin and with the Government over the further handling of this matter. If I were to seek leave to continue my remarks, perhaps that would mean that the matter would be automatically stood over. Perhaps, given my remarks, Senator Macklin may be inclined at least to accept some temporary halt to the resolution of this matter. From my understanding of the Standing Orders, I think I will seek leave--

        At the outset I welcome the three new senators who were sworn in yesterday. I understand that another one will be sworn in today. I think it is pertinent, particularly from my point of view, to make an observation in respect of Senator Bell from Tasmania-it is a rather healthy sign which I hope is a permanent one-that when the nomination of Senator Bell was put to the Tasmanian Parliament by the Australian Democrats and was considered by that Parliament it was the unanimous decision of the Parliament to appoint Senator Bell to that vacant position. It is proper to remind the Senate that most of the 26 people who voted three years ago not to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of former Senator Don Grimes are still in the Tasmanian Parliament and attended the joint sitting which agreed to the nomination of Senator Bell. I hope that that is a sign that the decisions of political expediency which mean that the wishes of a party which is seeking to replace a senator who has resigned are not carried out will no longer occur in the future and that all parliaments will act in an appropriate manner, as has been the case with the present replacements.

         â€”That would mean that Senator Walters would never get here. I understand that some senators will make their maiden speeches today, so it is not my intention to go into all the areas covered in the Governor-General's Speech in great detail. I will confine my remarks to one area that will be of great concern during the term of this Government. I refer to a topic that is very widely discussed publicly-that is, the need for much more efficient industry in Australia. I totally agree that that is what we need.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It needs to be recognised that an enormous contribution has been made to changes in industry structure and the efficiency of industry by the trade union movement. It has been prepared to enter into an accord with this Government, the purpose being to streamline awards. At the moment we are going through a process of award restructuring. At the end of that period, hopefully, there will be much greater opportunities for workers to achieve far greater skills and far greater job satisfaction. As a consequence, industry will become far more efficient, and everyone in this country will benefit from that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter I really want to address-and it is something that the Opposition should take on board over the period of this Government and into the future-is that the Opposition and many employers, although I do not say all employers, should look at the approach that the trade union movement has taken and adopt a far more cooperative approach, and look at a whole range of efficiencies that industry can carry out.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no way that we will get the sort of industry that we need in this country simply by legislating for voluntary agreements or legislating to give people the power to abolish penalty rates and all those sorts of things. That is not going to get us to a position where employers and employees in this country understand and accept the need to have greater efficiency in industry and greater excellence in the products being produced. That can be done only by a change in the whole culture of this country so that everybody understands that that sort of efficiency benefits all of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem we have is that the culture of both the Opposition and employers leads them to believe that the only way to improve efficiency in industry in this country is to be continually looking at cutting the wages of employees and putting people off if one is running into difficulties. They never really use the skills and knowledge of those people to increase the efficiency and prosperity of the company's operations.
       </para>
       <para>
        To emphasise that point, I refer to an article that appeared in the Weekend Australian of 7-8 April. A survey was carried out by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the State Bank of New South Wales into manufacturing conditions and future prospects in New South Wales. It is interesting to note that that survey asked people what sort of action they would take if their businesses were deteriorating. The survey asked a whole range of questions and compared directly the attitudes of Australian businesses with similar businesses in Japan and the United States.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to go through all the questions asked; I simply refer to two sets of figures. One question asked employers what they would do if their businesses were running into economic problems. In Australia, the answer given by 34 per cent of firms was that they would immediately reduce their labour costs and employee numbers. The same answer was given in Japan by 12 per cent of firms and in the United States by 19 per cent. When firms in Australia were asked whether they would reduce other costs, only 20 per cent said that they would compared to the 43 per cent in Japan who said that that would be a priority and 40 per cent in the United States.
       </para>
       <para>
        That, in itself, emphasises one of the real problems that we have right throughout the business community in Australia and, of course, on the other side of the chamber. Those people see reduced costs and increased efficiencies as being related only to labour costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned one area where industry in this country could substantially reduce its costs, and there could be great benefit to the environment. There should be a reduction of energy use by companies right across the country. I cite some figures that I have been given concerning a company in Victoria, Enersonics Pty Ltd, involved in energy audits and advising all sorts of companies across the country on what sort of savings can be made. A reduction in energy in the electrical area of a medium sized research complex in the western suburbs of Melbourne was demonstrated in a very short space of time to be 45 per cent. In a small office and shopping arcade, a 35 per cent reduction in the use of electricity and a 50 per cent reduction in the use of gas or oil was achieved. In a six-storey office block, a 35 per cent reduction was achieved in the use of electricity and a 60 per cent reduction in the use of gas or oil. In a four-storey office block, a 40 per cent reduction was achieved in the use of electricity and a 50 per cent reduction in the use of oil. All these figures can be verified.
       </para>
       <para>
        I give some actual dollar amounts. In 1988 an audit was undertaken at a manufacturing plant whose annual energy costs were $1,750,000. The annual savings as a result of this audit totalled $416,000. A research laboratory whose energy costs were $490,963 saved $180,000 in energy. A brass forging plant with energy costs of $1,179,000 achieved savings of $556,000. A steel forging plant with energy costs of $1,143,000 achieved savings of $662,000. The list goes on. Those figures indicate the real question confronting industry in Australia. We do have to look at a whole range of efficiencies if we are really going to become leaders in industry, particularly manufacturing areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my home State the actual power bill per year for Comalco Ltd is $36m, which is an extraordinary figure. However, the bulk of that bill is an amount for a bulk power purchase. Regardless of whether Comalco introduced efficiencies to cut down the use of power, the company would still have to pay the same amount of money. In my view, that sort of arrangement continuing into the future in this country is just crazy economics.
       </para>

        At face value, it seems to me that if those bulk contracts were not there and Comalco did not have the payment of a certain amount of money forced upon it-that is, it still pays the same money even if it does not use the power-substantial savings could be made. A company like Comalco could look at pre-heating its plant with natural gas for instance, which I would think would save extraordinary amounts of money.

        I certainly hope that over the period of this Government those questions will be very seriously addressed by both sides of this Parliament, by industry, and by people generally. Enormous savings are to be made by both large and small enterprises. If we do not address these questions, we will continue wallowing around in this argument and the cross-fire between the Opposition and the Government, with the Opposition saying the only way efficiencies can be achieved in industry is to cut back wage costs and continually look at ways of getting people out of the work force, when in fact the most valuable asset we have are those people in the work force who have a great deal to contribute in all sorts of ways, not only in energy efficiencies but in other efficiencies. The real skills that those people have to contribute to industry, to the management of industry and to where industry is going have been neglected for many years. I think that we could all contribute greatly to the industry of this country if we took that matter on board, and proceeded in that way into the future.

        In closing, I congratulate the Australian Labor Party and the Goss Government in Queensland. I have read in the newspapers and have been advised that the Queensland Government has just announced a decision to pay superannuation owing to some one thousand South East Queensland Electricity Board workers who were sacked by the National Party Government seven years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is an absolute disgrace that for seven years workers who, by a decision of the Queensland Industrial Commission, were entitled and ready to go back to work, were prevented from doing so and were sacked by the Queensland Government. Not only did the Queensland Government do that but it denied them their rights. I understand the total amount owing to those people was somewhere in the vicinity of $10m. I want to place on record my congratulations to the Queensland Government for its courageous decision. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to move the motion.

         â€”Let me get on to the Address-in-Reply and to the important matters contained in it. We have been asked by the Whips to speak for less than our allotted time, and I certainly wish to cooperate with that so I hope I will be no more than, say, 15 minutes. There are a number of matters I wish to speak about which arise as a result of the Governor-General's Speech yesterday. First of all, the Governor-General gave such an excellent speech because of the return of the Australian Labor Party Government for its fourth historic term. The Speech outlined the Labor Government's program for the next four years. Already a number of people have commented that there will be a very busy program over the next three years to deal with the matters contained in the Governor-General's Speech. I think that reflects the commitment that is in the Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Since the Parliamentary Labor Party's return to Canberra in informal discussions it is very pleasing to note that throughout the Parliamentary Labor Party, and not just in the Cabinet, there has been a real commitment to get on with major reform. We are not going to waste the opportunities that we have in our fourth term to carry out those reforms, whether they are in the major economic area or in the so-called micro-economic reform area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make a couple of comments about the result. The other day in Adelaide at the Senate declaration of the poll I noticed that, unfortunately for the Australian Labor Party, we won only two out of the six Senate positions. The Liberal Party of Australia, quite rightly, was pleased that it had won three out of six. It was also pleased that in my own State it won the seat of Hawker from the Labor Party, but we evened that up by winning back the federal seat of Adelaide. Despite the pleasure the Opposition has had of a reasonable result in the Senate, winning seats like Hawker and having had a very good result in Victoria, when it comes to the bottom line the Labor Party still forms the Government of Australia. In politics there are no second prizes.
       </para>
       <para>
        We on our side of politics have unfortunately suffered losing elections on many occasions in the past. Certainly in my younger days, in the 1950s and 1960s, as a young supporter of the Labor Party, the never-ending success of the coalition in winning elections was quite disillusioning. I never thought that in my lifetime I would see a Federal Labor government elected four times in a row and have a chance to govern uninterrupted for a decade. The fact that the Party has been able to win four in a row reflects well on it. Some people have commented that this was an election the Labor Party stole, that it was a lay-down misere for the Opposition to win. I suspect that is partly right. I make no bones about the fact that I thought a Party which went to the electorate when interest rates were around 17 per cent would be in a very hard position to win re-election.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the reason we won is that though a majority of the people in the electorate may have been willing to vote us out, a bigger majority was not willing to vote the Opposition in. That came down to the fundamental position that the credibility problems of the Opposition could not be overcome in its presentation, and that is why it lost the election.
       </para>
       <para>
        I see today in the press, published for the first time, that the accurate two-party preferred vote is supposed to be 49.8 or 49.9 per cent for the Labor Party and 50.1 or 50.2 for the coalition. I presume that has been done by an accurate two-party preferred vote count-out in every one of the 148 electorates around Australia and that it takes into account a proper two-party preferred vote-Labor-coalition-in each of the seats, even in seats such as North Sydney where an independent won and Mr Mack's preferences should be counted between Labor and Liberal. Either way I concede the fact that it is overwhelmingly likely that the Labor Party did not get the majority of the vote. It is a reflection of the single-member constituency system that it is possible mathematically for that to occur and that if effective campaigning takes place in the right electorates a government can be returned. It is in no way a gerrymander, and I hope honourable senators opposite do not start shouting about a gerrymander. There is not malapportionment. The boundaries are drawn on a one vote, one value basis with a 10 per cent discrepancy. It reflects the fact that the Labor Party is better at winning and holding marginal seats than the Opposition. We have proved our ability to out-campaign the coalition in the critical seats. I think that has to be recognised by the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to matters in the Speech in which I have a particular interest, I want to refer to the section dealing with communications and transport. The Government has outlined, amongst other things, two major areas of reform and change, one dealing with telecommunications and Telecom Australia and the other dealing with rail transport. I fully support the idea that we must upgrade our rail systems if we are to have a more efficient land transport system in Australia but I warn that I do not believe the Federal Government should be required to provide massive amounts of funds to do so while there are six different managements and six different ownerships around Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are too many examples of the State rail systems not being managed efficiently on a national basis. I believe the Federal Government should put money in, but only on the basis that there will be a central management that is effective and ensures that there is proper efficiency for the delivery of rail transport in Australia. We cannot go on having interstate trains where, when we get to the border, we change the crews, the operational management and so on. I believe that in this modern age that has to be overcome very quickly if we want a decent rail system that serves the Australian community, and particularly the need for more economic reform in our transport system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecommunications is another area of the Speech in which I am interested. There has been much debate recently because of the Australian Telecommunications Authority (Austel) report which recommends allowing competition against Telecom Australia for cellular mobile phones. The fundamental issue that has to be addressed is whether in a country like Australia it is appropriate that the network system of communications which presently is a monopoly for Telecom, as agreed to by Parliament over now nearly 90 years, should be allowed to be broken up and to have competition. I believe also that there are very good arguments for maintaining the actual network as a Telecom monopoly. Telecom is a government monopoly which is responsible, through its board, for reporting to Parliament. I also believe that, in a modern age, whoever has access to information and its distribution has power and influence. I further believe that it is probably more appropriate in a social context that whoever controls the information distribution system in a country should be responsible directly to parliament through a government organisation or statutory authority such as Telecom. However, I also concede that many areas of competition in the add-ons, as they are called, could be looked at and opened up without affecting the operation of the first network. As they proliferate with modern technological development, the provision of the add-on services in telecommunications can be thoroughly investigated, and I believe that is an area where competition would be acceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, I have been asked to limit my remarks to less than 15 minutes, and I want to conclude on a number of brief points. First, I want to make a couple of remarks about a good friend of mine who is not in the Ministry any more-Senator Peter Walsh. He chose not to stand for re-election. At the moment the Opposition is taking some succour from the fact that Senator Walsh is making and writing remarks which it thinks are critical of the Government's performance. I think that Senator Walsh, in his usual inimitably frank way, has raised a number of issues that have to be debated by the Government. However, I also want to say to the Opposition that, if it thinks he may be tough about Government policy, he is much more rigorous in his denunciation of the Opposition's performance and policy in the economic area over the past seven years than is any comment he may make about the Government. Walshy, as we all call him, often takes the view that the community and the Labor Party have not learned the lesson about the need for economic efficiency and economic reform. My own view is that I do not think that over the past 10 years anyone in the Labor Party has done more than Peter Walsh to make members of the Labor Party economically literate. He has probably educated us about the need to make judgmental decisions regarding economic priorities. What Walshy taught us is that there are no easy decisions; tough decisions have to be made, but they should be based on equity and against privilege wherever it may exist. I want to pay a tribute to Peter Walsh: both as a friend and as a colleague he has done much to educate me about the realities of how a government should govern for all the people without fear or favour.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, my parliamentary Party has selected me to chair the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade over the next three years. I accept it as a great honour to be nominated by the Government Party in the Parliament and I look forward to chairing that Committee. I accept the view that in status the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is probably the pre-eminent joint committee of the Parliament. I do not know whether chairmen of other standing committees or joint committees would agree with that, but that is the informal comment around, and I suspect that, amongst members of the Party in government, there is always keen competition to chair and to serve on the Committee. I accept that responsibility and I look forward to the Committee's work over the next three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, the Labor Party is going into the 1990s as the Government of Australia for its fourth term. I believe the 1990s will be as significant in Australia as were the 1890s, 100 years ago, which was the decade of Federation. I believe also that the 1990s will be the decade when not only the most significant economic reform and structural change take place in this country but also, I hope, serious constitutional debate will take place as occurred 100 years ago when creating the Federation. I hope we have a mature debate in this community about the need to change the Constitution to meet the requirements of having a governmental system in Australia that is effective and efficient for the twenty-first century. I do not think that anyone would say that in the twenty-first century it is reasonable to govern a country with a Constitution drawn up on the precepts of what existed in Australia in the nineteenth century.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also hope that, as part of that debate, we can look at constitutional change that leads to the establishment of a republic of Australia. I believe that, on 1 January 2001, the centenary of the foundation of the Federation, it would be most appropriate that Australia declare itself a republic and that it is most appropriate for that to occur. It is more appropriate for the future of our country and our own region that we are recognised as a fully independent country. We recognise the fact that Great Britain, for its own reasons and quite appropriately, is more and more drawn into what is happening in Europe and will be part of some European federation in which the old concepts of the so-called British Empire or British Commonwealth will no longer exist. We will stand and fall economically and socially by our relationships with the Western Pacific or the Asian region. I think it would be much more to our advantage to be identified as a republic in those relationships rather than as a constitutional monarchy, which does give some impression, at the very least, that we still have constitutional connections-and subordinate connections-to Great Britain.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, I hope that the 1990s is a decade of not only economic reform in this country, which it will be, but also constitutional reform. I do not believe that we will effect the most efficient economic reform in this country unless we have serious constitutional changes to enable that economic reform to take place. As a part of that, over the next decade, I hope we can have a mature debate about the evolution of a republic and I think that generally the year 2001 would be the most appropriate date for Australia to declare itself a republic.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is with great pleasure that I second the motion relating to the Address-in-Reply and look forward to participating in the debates in this chamber over the next three years as a member of the Labor Party in government, with a major package of change in this country that is so necessary.

        I congratulate all new senators who have been elected. At this stage I particularly mention those who are taking their place in the chamber within these few days: on my side, Senator Olsen, who yesterday replaced Senator Tony Messner; Senator Ian Campbell from Western Australia, who is replacing the former Senator Chaney; and the honourable senator to be, O'Chee, who takes his place in the chamber tomorrow and who will replace the former honourable senator, John Stone. Tony Messner is from my State and he made a major contribution to the work of the Senate and my Party over a long period. I would like to recognise that contribution through this speech this morning. Senator Chaney I mentioned yesterday; and Senator John Stone, although he may not have been here for long, certainly will be remembered. His intellect was admired by all and I think he introduced a new dimension. The intellectual jousts between him and Senator Walsh were always stimulating.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to say at the outset that I intend the Opposition in this place to be a constructive Opposition. We have no wish to be destructive. We believe the plight facing this country demands far more than that. We will press this Government upon its promises and we will demand of it the highest standards, standards to which we believe the community is entitled from a government of Australia. We will urge of this Government the types of reforms that we believe this country needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also want to say finally as an introductory point how highly I regard the institution of the Senate in the Parliament of Australia. We will use the Senate and its committees to continue the task of improving the Government's legislation, a task that we have now undertaken for some years in opposition. We will use the Senate and its committees to enhance the financial accountability of government and to guard against administrative abuses. We will continue to make constructive contributions, within the traditional bipartisan way in the committees, to important areas of policy reform. In other words, we will seek to enhance the standing of this institution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will turn to the background in which we must place the Governor-General's Speech of yesterday. This is a time of critical importance in Australia's history. I am an optimist and I look forward to the next century and the celebration of 100 years of federation. I think we all should recognise that these intervening years, the 1990s, are going to present enormous challenges to all Australians and particularly to those of us who have been given the privilege of providing a lead-whether it be in government, in opposition or as individuals in the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a period of dramatic international change. The ideological abyss which has divided the world community during the period of my lifetime is suddenly being broached. The pace of change is staggering. There are those, of course, who would wish to see a more ordered transition, but when the chance for freedom comes it must be grasped. With any change there are risks, and the political and economic transitions now occurring will bring instability and some danger. Australia and other democratic nations must act with courage and constructively help ease the trauma associated with such change.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new multipolar world will in many ways be more challenging. Australia has had a comfortable niche within the Western alliance: very much a supporting role. A new maturity is going to be called for as Australia develops new political and economic relationships in a less structured environment. The world may not necessarily be a safer place. Competition and rivalry, as demonstrated by history, seem to be part of the nature of mankind.
       </para>
       <para>
        In our own region we will find particular problems and challenges. The ideological thaw of eastern Europe has not reached North Korea, China or Vietnam, although we have of course in recent times witnessed the cry for freedom. We approach the first anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. We witness the people of Cambodia still suffering the misery of conflict, the Philippines suffering continuing political trauma and many of its people suffering economically. The residents of Hong Kong are worried about 1997, when the Red Army will legitimately move in, and for us, closer to home, there are ongoing troubles in Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific states.
       </para>
       <para>
        In economic terms we see in the international community a picture of contrasts-a growing and powerful European Community, and the dynamism and expansion of the Asian market, even though its key players might be suffering a few hiccups. Japan has perhaps a few more challenges than before, but nevertheless is continuing its inexorable march to economic superpower status, although demonstrating a few signs of stress. The United States of America, still the first economic power in the world, is similarly experiencing some strain under new realities. By contrast, the Third World remains debt ridden and impoverished, with some of the worst deprivation within our own region.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against this background we see an Australia which must address not only the changes occurring in the surrounding world environment but significant economic, cultural and social changes within. Our society has become increasingly more complex and more multicultural, with greater social variances and a changing age profile. Governments must now respond to different social and cultural demands, different family structures and an ageing community. As we know, governments must also respond to a much more environmentally sensitive and demanding community.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also a country of contrasts. The gulf between the rich and poor has deepened, and, whilst most Australians continue to share a reasonable standard of living, we also share an enormous and growing debt. It is a debt which I must say, without wanting to be unduly provocative at this time, has more than quadrupled under Labor. I raise the issue because resolving Australia's debt crisis is probably the greatest challenge facing government. It is unhelpful, furthermore, as this Government has sought to do, simply to blame the private sector when about half of that debt-that half being some $64 billion-is in fact public debt. Private indebtedness itself has been built within government-set taxation and other investment parameters. It is this level of debt and Labor's attempt to constrain its expansion by high interest rate policies which contributed to the Government's record low primary vote in the last election.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the Governor-General's Speech, seen against the background of the Government's record and the constraints of the accord to which we must look to see whether Labor is capable of providing the lead necessary to reverse Australia's economic decline. Ordinary Australians have a right to be worried. They see the infrastructure of our country deteriorating. They experience the roads and railways every day. They see them in a sorry state, and yet they must be a key to our economic recovery. It is not surprising that this Government now has to pay out some $5 billion a year in interest payments alone.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australians have witnessed a shady generation of entrepreneurs seeking short term enrichment through paper shuffling rather than building productive enterprise and then, unfortunately, crashing-to the detriment of our international standing. We see an export profile much as it was generations ago: a country still reliant upon primary production and extractive industry, although now supplemented with a reward for providing recreational facilities for those who are doing better elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we are witnessing a scenario we so often see elsewhere in the Third World: the cost of high technology, high value added imports exceeding the return from the export of low value added raw materials, and therefore huge current account losses each month. We in this country maintain our First World expectations and, more often than not, our First World standard of living. But we have not built a balanced, sophisticated First World economy in order to sustain this lifestyle, and so we borrow.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the past this Government has failed to provide the lead, the policy prescription, to a more efficient, productive economic base. Its high interest rate policy to dampen demand has in fact crushed local competitive capacity. It has contributed to an ongoing cycle of inflation which has further inhibited our international competitiveness. It has driven Australia into a recession, a recession of its own making.
       </para>
       <para>
        A recession might in turn dampen demand but it will not lead to a more efficient and productive Australia. So I look to the Governor-General's Speech for ways in which Labor intends to bring interest rates down and I and my colleagues remain disappointed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I look for hope of a reduction in total taxation in order to increase incentive and there is none. Of course, under our system governments cannot force greater productivity and greater efficiencies. They must offer incentives or reduce disincentives. One such burden is the cost of inefficient government enterprise, and although privatisation is occurring all over the world, even now in eastern Europe, it is rejected by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I look for ways in which the Government will reduce unnecessary regulation. I do not speak about regulation for necessary safety standards or environmental standards, but regulation which stifles flexible and creative productive endeavour for no real community advantage, but sadly I find no change to the snail-paced program of the last Hawke Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I look for a freeing up of the labour market, reform which will reward productivity, yet again I am disappointed. Programs for improving our infrastructure are slow moving and inadequate. The Inter-State Commission calculated that container terminals overseas are at least 60 per cent more efficient than in Australia. The Government's program, in answer to that, is designed to lift our efficiency by 30 per cent. The challenge, which this Government does not seem to understand, is not to be more efficient than we were last year, but to be more efficient than our competitors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why does this Government continually accept a compromise? It does so because consensus is the cornerstone of the Hawke leadership. Consensus arises out of compromise and consensus might be an appeal to human nature which wins elections but it has retarded this Government's capacity to reform. Labor now has too many debts to repay, too much baggage to carry. Thus we saw this tired speech of yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        I give the Senate the example of the waterfront union leader whom some of us saw on the television program on the weekend and who said, `If foreigners want to trade with Australia they will have to do so on our terms and conditions'. The accord means compromise with that sort of blind attitude, an attitude which will drive this country bankrupt. There is no workable alternative to a Liberal prescription of placing faith in individual Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        More of the same, which is the Government's answer, is leading us backwards. To put up the barriers again is not an option. With such a small domestic market, trade must be our lifeblood and only international markets will offer the economies of scale we will find necessary. Special deals for particular industries might work in a guided democracy such as Singapore-although Victoria may now be looking to try it-but in our system the reality is that the benefits and thus distortions simply get locked in.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not wish to be negative. What we wish is to impress upon the Government the urgency of this economic challenge. We are becoming less relevant in the world community and less able to influence events in ways which are in our best interests. We are suffering a loss of sovereignty as we become more economically dependent upon others. Ultimately our security and our independence will be at risk. In the meantime our standards of living will fall and more importantly we will have a reduced capacity to support those who particularly need the support of government-the aged, the disadvantaged and the infirm. We will have less capacity to protect our own environment and help others of the undeveloped world to protect theirs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that governments do not like the concept of their influence being reduced, which is a product of this Liberal prescription I outline, but there are so many other areas in which the Australian Government could be putting positive endeavour, some complementary to the subject I have been discussing. Such areas include ensuring the best possible education system for this country, education that could put us at the forefront of technology and help us out of our isolation. We have major immigration debates ahead, questions on the quality of health care and health funding for this nation, environmental issues for Australia, debates on social policy, drug abuse, homelessness, all of these challenges that face government. There is a long way to go before Australia can be said to be a completely fair and just society. These are the real challenges which should be facing this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should add as I draw to a conclusion that the Liberals have been communicating this message of faith in individuals for a long time. Alfred Deakin during debate in the House of Representatives in 1912 said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We rely upon our citizens working for their own families and their own future to develop our resources and perfect industries in a way that could never be attained by a regimented body of public employees marshalled under political control and bring political pressure to bear in their own class interest, no matter how ruinous its effects might be upon Australia's interest at home and abroad. Big as Australia is, immense as her resources are, she cannot live alone any more than any other continent can.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nothing has really changed. I repeat the message we bring to the Government in this debate-it is not too late; it is a matter of urgency. Release the shackles and provide a new freedom for individuals to achieve their maximum potential. Give individuals the opportunity to take up the challenges and the opportunities of the 1990s. By doing so, the Government will be ensuring Australia the best chance of entering the new century, strong and confident.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”The election that took place a short time ago was an important election for Australia's future and for this Parliament. The Australian Democrats were led into that election by Janine Haines, who unfortunately was not able to win the seat that she was running for in the House of Representatives.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When she started out on that process-I remind the Senate that she made that announcement about two years ago-the media almost universally were writing stories that come the next half-Senate election the Democrats would not get anyone elected and hence would be relying on only the three continuing senators. By her application, incredible hard work and dedication to the task, Janine Haines achieved the highest vote that the party has achieved since it was founded and in the new Parliament the highest representation that we have had in this place. In the minds of most people, the Australian political scene was shifted away from what has been perceived as a rigid two-party system but which since Federation has always been at least a three- or four-party system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Her successes are now being felt within the party in general. We certainly believe that we are now operating in a new context. That, I think, is a very important context, not the least of which is that a considerable number of seats in the House of Representatives were won on a second preference vote from Australian Democrats voters. It is difficult at the moment to estimate those, particularly because of the problem of New South Wales giving its returns to central headquarters, but on our rough estimation-and I hope that later today I might have the firm figures-52 such seats in the House of Representatives were determined by voters who gave their first preference to us and their second preference to the people who won the seats. Thirty-three of those seats were Labor Party seats; 19 were Liberal-National Party seats, on our estimation. The figures may change slightly, but in any event the overall figure will be around 50.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason for that, I think, is that for the first time the issues on which the party was founded and to which it has dedicated itself since 1977 captured the public imagination. I refer to the fact that in our 1977 founding document we talked about a sustainable economy. Unfortunately that topic only found its way into the Speech of the Governor-General on 8 May 1990 when he said in the fourth paragraph that in fact the Government was going to dedicate itself to strategies for ecologically sustainable development.
       </para>
       <para>
        We still do not think that the true import of that particular proposition for sustainable development has been understood. We still believe there is a lot of work that we have to do to direct people's attention to what is happening and to what needs to happen. We have never seen a division between the environmental debate and the economic debate. We believe that the type of division is a fallacious one.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I may give an example that I have used a number of times before-it seems to me that it really illustrates very strongly the argument that the Democrats put forward-if we took a rationalist economic line we could very well say that, if a child dies, that family is better off. We could say that if all we were judging it on was the dollars and cents. Since the same number of dollars and cents are coming into that family and there is one less mouth to feed, it might be said the remaining members of that family would be better off.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course I do not believe there is one person in Australia who would hold to that. Everyone would want to say that that family is worse off. We are not talking about dollars and cents; we are indeed talking about a whole host of other values that this society should, and hopefully does, hold dear. We are talking about the values that need to be part of the economic debate and not seen as pure peripheral items that we may get around to if we have time or when all the economic problems have been sorted out. At its base, the economy is there to serve the people of this country. There are no values inherent in growth or anything else unless they are directed to the well-being and the support of the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        That rather silly economic debate that some people in this place and certainly a lot of other people outside have been attempting to pursue for a long time hopefully saw its death knell in the last election. Hopefully nobody would have the temerity to go out in future and argue purely on the notion that growth for growth's sake is a good thing.
       </para>
       <para>
        We hope also that people may start to look at what has been taken to be growth in this country. They may start to realise, for example, that a river into which no toxic wastes are poured and which is not used for irrigation never ends up in our gross domestic product. However, if we build a toxic waste plant right next door and pour the pollutants into that river, that polluted river becomes a drain and as a drain, with its disposal function, it gets into the accounts. Most Australians probably do not realise that they are contributing to the gross domestic product if they have a car crash, or the fact that when we chop down a tree it suddenly becomes part of growth in this country and yet when that tree is standing in the forest and growing it has no economic value.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are absurd propositions-propositions which in the last election I think were disturbed. They are propositions that I think for the rest of this decade will be shown for what they are; that is, mindless assumptions dedicated to values that have been comprehensively rejected by the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        So in terms of my party's performance at the last election, we are the only party in this place to get an increase in its vote, and we also had an increase in our representation. We believe that we had an increase in our representation. We believe that we have been given that additional vote of confidence by the people to continue the tasks that we have undertaken in this place now for the last four parliaments, and now in this the fifth Parliament, in which we have held the balance of power.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think at this early stage it would be useful for me simply to outline what we believe that responsibility entails and what we are dedicating ourselves to carrying out. I wish to make those items fairly clear because in the past there has been a great deal of misrepresentation and I think that at the beginning of the new Parliament it is useful to stipulate once again our views on a number of these matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        First of all, there has been an extraordinary amount of discussion about mandates-even in the Governor-General's Speech we had reference to the notion of a mandate; one of those lovely political science terms that float around, but the meaning of which I think people fail to address in a concrete way.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the election campaign we said that we may not be supporting a particular piece of legislation if whoever was elected went ahead with it and we were attacked both by the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Party. They said that, if they won a majority in the House of Representatives, they should have a free legislative hand. I found it extraordinary that that view was pushed, because one knows that of course parties in opposition have never pursued that attitude. The Liberal-National Party now will in fact be reminded of a number of things it said during the election campaign. I am quite sure it has absolutely no intention of carrying them out in this Parliament; that is, it will not give the Labor Party a completely free hand. Indeed Senator Hill, speaking as Leader of the Opposition, indicated only a few minutes ago that the Opposition was not going to do that. Yet, that was part of the proposition that the Opposition put to the people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our view, and the view we have taken consistently with regard to a mandate, is that under the Constitution the only sensible notion of a mandate is that which is provided to an individual person elected. That person can claim a mandate in the House of Representatives because he or she has been given the voice of the people to bring into this place. Likewise senators from the States. The individual certainly has a mandate. I think it is reasonable, then, to extrapolate from that constitutional mandate that is given to each individual under a party system that if a sufficient number of mandates are gathered together to form a majority in the House of Representatives-and the Labor Party in this case has a majority of those people who received mandates from the people-it has a mandate to govern; that is, for the Executive to carry out the laws passed by the Parliament. It definitely has that mandate and it is required to carry out those laws in a conscientious way. Indeed, Ministers take an oath to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is, however, outside of all that, still another proposition; that is, who has the mandate with regard to the laws? Under our Constitution, all laws are required to be passed by both Houses. Hence it cannot be said that anybody in the last election received such a mandate, because in fact they have not been able to gather together a majority in both places in support of particular propositions. Hence, no party has received from the electorate, quite deliberately, a mandate with regard to legislation and we will continue to do what we have done in the past; that is, address each piece of legislation on its merits.
       </para>
       <para>
        But can I point to a radical distinction between the stance that we have taken and will continue to take in this chamber and that which is currently being debated around the traps-for example, in Victoria, as to whether or not the upper House there may reject Supply, or in Western Australia, where there is talk amongst the Liberal and National parties as to whether they will reject Supply or whether they will refuse to deal with any legislation or whatever else.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is not our view. It has never been our view, and it will not be our view. Our view is that this chamber has a responsibility to deal with legislation presented to it by Government, or by other senators, or by individual members of the House of Representatives who may be successful in getting a private member's Bill through that House. But that is our responsibility. It is not a responsibility to go on strike.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to whether or not we would use the processes of this House to bring down a government, as senators are well aware, since the formation of the party in 1977 we have said that will not be part of our role. Following on from that, it means that there is at least one set of Bills which we guarantee now, as we have in every other Parliament in which we have held the balance of power, to pass.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are the Bills which provide for the ordinary annual services of Government, as the phrase goes in the Constitution. Again, this one has been bandied around and made to appear into all sorts of different items. Basically it is Appropriation Bills No. 1 and No. 2 and the Parliamentary Supply Bill, unless this place does not wish to continue to work, plus the Supply Bills which we are about to deal with-Nos 1 and 2-in this place, which are basically the supplementary Supply until appropriation is passed later in the year. They are the Bills.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not referring to money Bills, which are another whole host of Bills which deal with money. I am not referring to taxation Bills. If people cannot tell the difference between raising money and spending it, I suggest they should learn very quickly, because it is a fundamental element that every Australian has to be aware of. I am not referring to Budget Bills, which are all of those Bills that the Government may bring in during a Budget session. I am not referring to anything other than those Bills which are necessary for the ordinary annual services of Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government of the day, while it retains a majority in the House of Representatives, we believe is entitled to that appropriation and we will continue to do that. Hence, for the life of this Parliament that issue is not on the agenda here, although it may be on the agenda in State Houses. We will not be using the forms of this House to bring down a government. That is merely a reiteration of the fact that it is interesting that since we gained the balance of power that item has been off the agenda here and it will remain off while we have the power in this place to make sure that it does.
       </para>
       <para>
        But all other legislation needs to be examined, we believe, on its merits. The Senate, when it meets after 1 July, will be trialling a new method that I certainly had a hand in arguing through a committee and into this place. I wish it well with that item. It will be an extremely difficult one to operate and to make it work well, but I think it is worth the effort to try to reform the legislative process and to bring in, as was the intent with that particular method, more outside scrutiny of what it is that we do.
       </para>
       <para>
        After all, at the end of the day, the Bills apply to all Australians and I believe that they have a right to be involved at a much earlier stage than simply finding out that a Bill has been passed which causes them to do X, Y or Z. I believe they have a fundamental right in a democracy to know that we are contemplating doing that. If they have an objection, if they have a problem, it is best to learn about it before we do it, rather than after we have done it.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the intent. Whether it will work, I do not know. I think there are a lot of difficulties with it, but I think it is worth the trial that the Senate intends to give it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe there needs to be predictability with regard to legislation; that the Government needs to provide to the Senate much further ahead of time its legislative program and to stick with that program, not to chop and change, and not for people to have a bright idea and then bounce it into the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one considers the practicalities of drafting and the problems that are involved today in 1990 with the drafting process and the fact of bringing those particular Bills into concurrence with so many other pieces of legislation, making sure that unintended consequences are not included, it must mean that Government has these Bills in mind far earlier than we ever hear about them. I believe that the Senate ought be informed that the Government is intending to bring in these particular pieces of legislation and at the earliest opportunity those pieces of legislation should be provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that the Standing Orders, which have been reiterated in a whole new written form, ought to be abided by in terms of the processes by which a Bill goes through the chamber. There are very good reasons for the various hiatuses of time between one element and the next- between the first and second readings, between the second reading and the committee stages. I think all of those are excellent and ought be included.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exercise with regard to legislation we believe should be addressed more and more, and hopefully under the new procedures will be, to the merits of the legislation and not to the political point scoring that a particular piece of legislation may provide. I think we in the Senate have to remember that there is another chamber and that the other chamber is probably far better equipped than this chamber for those political debates. Is it necessary that we spend all of that time yet again on another political debate?
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Senate needs constantly to reform its processes, because if we preach to the community outside about the need for productivity, about the need for growth, about the need to take on new technologies, it is very strange that the first hint of a productivity reform in this place has people scurrying into highways and byways. I think the reaction to the paper on electronic voting is an instance with regard to that, of immediately not seeking to find where good elements might be in that but of saying, `Let us have a look at where the bad elements might be'. If the community and our economy did that we would never move. We would never have adopted the Edison electricity, because at the time gas was cheaper, more widespread and, after all, it had been tried.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I think there is a need for an openminded view with regard to change and to growth as an institution and not for us to think that simply in 1990, because the institution is still in this substantial building, somehow or other it has a reason to continue to exist. The reason must be in the way it acts and what it does, not in the fact that it is written down that it has to be there. I think a useful contribution for this chamber-as I believe it has made an excellent contribution in the last few parliaments-is that it needs to continue that open-mindedness towards change and, hopefully, towards improvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The growth of the Senate committee system, particularly through the statutory committees-there are now three; two have been used in the past and the third one will be operational in the life of this Parliament in terms of the corporations legislation-is a new and a welcome departure, a departure by which, hopefully, those senators who work on those committees will have an in-depth and expanded understanding of a particular knowledge base, which will improve debate in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        The party system is likely to continue into the next Parliament in almost an unchanged way, and it will probably be in the long term future before we see much freeing up of that. But it is a pity that opportunities have been lost in the immediate past to have some freeing of the party control of the Parliament, particularly when there are strongly held views; and we have seen those here in senators in all parties. They can easily be recognised when they occur and, hopefully, the Labor Party, in terms of its internal discussions, will be able to see more opportunity for that movement to be able to take place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate has something to offer the legislative process. We do not know the final numbers yet. The matter is still in the balance even today. If the Liberal Party wins the last seat in New South Wales, the numbers will be: 31 Labor Party, 35 Liberal-National, 8 Democrats, 2 Independents. If the seat in New South Wales goes to the Labor Party, the figures will be very similar to the current Parliament-32 Labor, as they currently have, 34 Liberal-National, as they currently have, 8 Democrats, and 2 Independents. The Independents will have been reduced by one, and we will have increased by one.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is very little change when compared to about 30 House of Representatives seats changing hands. Very little change has occurred between this current Senate and the next Senate starting on 1 July. But I do not think that that should be taken as meaning that the Senate can rest on its laurels. It has a task ahead of it to make sure that it is productive and contributes to the general development of legislation. As I say, the new method will, I hope, do that as the first cab off the rank. But I would also hope that some of those other innovations, which may be uncomfortable to wear, which may require every senator, for example, if one adopted electronic voting technique, to actually know what they were voting about--

         â€”I do not think it would hurt, Senator Baume. It may not change one vote, but at least they would know what they were voting on because they would actually have to address the question. At the moment there is no need to address the question. I would also hope-and I do not think I am speaking out of turn to say this-that more senators in the new Parliament may read legislation. I think somebody from the House of Representatives in the election campaign said that he had never read a piece of legislation in all the 20-odd years he had been in the place. That is an indictment of the person, not something to be said in public. I would have felt that a person would be ashamed to say that. In the debates in the new Parliament I would hope that more senators will contribute and that they will not simply be left to the front bench people on the understanding that that is a quicker way to get through the material. That may not be an acceptable view for the Whips, I know; it makes life a lot more difficult for them. But ultimately, since the Senate is now meeting-and I emphasise to the media that the Parliament is not meeting for seven days; the Senate is meeting for a lot longer than that and it is part of the Parliament. We still had learned political commentators as early as this morning talking about the Parliament meeting for seven days. The House of Representatives may be meeting for seven days but the Senate is not. The Senate is meeting for four weeks. The Senate is now meeting, I think, for something like 40 per cent longer than the House of Representatives, and we shall probably have to exceed even that margin. It will probably have to meet for 50 or 60 per cent longer than the House of Representatives to be able to do its work properly. But I think that is an acceptable thing considering the length of time that other places meet.

        I make a correction to some of the numbers I mentioned. In terms of the preference determinations, the numbers are indeed 38 Labor Party seats, 10 Liberal-National Party seats, which makes 48 seats-not the 52 that I mentioned first of all. So the final exercise, though the Victorian figures are still provisional, seems to be of the order of 48, not 52. But nevertheless, the number of seats so determined, I think, suggests that the policies we put to the people need to be given a great deal of consideration in the new Parliament.

         â€”I begin by congratulating the two Labor Party senators who moved and seconded the Address-in-Reply. Although Labor chose some of its more junior senators, it could not choose a maiden speaker since it had no new senator in this place following the election. So I would now like to congratulate the new senators from the other parties. I congratulate Senator Olsen on his election, and Senator Campbell on his imminent swearing in. I congratulate Senator O'Chee on his imminent swearing in. I congratulate Senators Bell and Lees on having joined us yesterday.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On the speakers list which we have before us there are no Labor speakers after those who have moved and seconded the Address-in-Reply. Perhaps this is an indication of the importance the Labor Party places on the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of the Governor-General. I want to use the time that I have available to me to draw attention to the very poor state of political debate in Australia today and to make the points that the debate is too personal; that it is too trivial; that it is too technical; but above all-and this is the point I want to develop-that it has far too little attention to matters of purpose, to matters of goals and to objectives. It is that factor which has led people to abandon the two major political groupings and to move to support third parties and independents.
       </para>
       <para>
        People had been moving away from the main political parties, from my Party, from the Labor Party, and from the National Party, parties which have previously enjoyed their support. An independent person won election for a seat in a formerly safe Liberal area a few weeks ago. That person offered no specific policies-not one policy prescription. But he did project hope and integrity, and concern and involvement, and that is why he was elected. There are lessons in these voting movements. Either we learn the lessons, we move to understand the trends, and we do something about responding, or else we will continue to see support moving to third parties and to independents.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is sad that so little of the post-election statements of the major political movements so far has related to these lessons. What should we have learnt from the election? It is sad that so little of the comment is related to this phenomenon of the third party and independent voting. It is sad that so little of the comment is related to ways in which we might seek to respond to what is a new and deeply felt public demand that things be done differently.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me return to my assertion that the political debate in Australia today is too technical, too personal, too trivial and too little is addressed to matters of purpose. We should be developing strategic goals first, providing inspiration for people. We should be exciting our young by our political goals and ideals. We should be trying to inspire all Australians. We are not doing it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Maybe we are trying but we are not achieving it. That we do not achieve it is the greatest indictment possible of the current Australian policy. That too much of the debate is too detailed and too technical is sadly borne out by yesterday's speech by the Governor-General. Most people do not understand the various items in the Speech. Most people feel it does not touch them or their lives. I notice Senator Button smiling. Almost no Australian is inspired by what was said. People are not interested in programs that are presented just as activity. They want programs that are presented in terms of the goals to be achieved. People are not interested in activity or structure or money inputs; and it does not have to be like that.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is possible to communicate between politicians and people. We have many examples. There have been great crises in this century in many countries. One characteristic of leaders who have emerged to meet those crises has been that they have been able to articulate goals with which the majority of their people could identify and which these people could follow. The most recent example that comes to my mind is the case of Vaclav Havel, the man who has been chosen as President of Czechoslovakia; the man elected as President of Czechoslovakia. What a statement! That man is a poet. His skill is to communicate brilliantly. In his acceptance speech he communicated the aspirations of a nation crushed by dictatorship and determined to do better. His speech was one of brilliance and passion, not one of dreary details. He did not present himself as a technocrat who would adjust  this or change that slightly but as a person who was going to blaze a new track for his country and to invite people to join him.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has been said of Winston Churchill that in a time of the greatest crisis for the British people, for the United Kingdom, he made of the English language a weapon of supreme clarity and power-and he used that weapon. He used what he could say to gather the people of his country with him in a noble common purpose. Do we hear that kind of political debate today? Not much. Churchill did so without being overly specific as to the details, but being quite specific as to the purpose. To paraphrase his words, he said: 'You ask what is my program. My program is victory'. That is all he would give the people.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not have any such common purpose in Australia today. I do not hear any such common purpose being offered to us by our national leaders. What we are offered instead are statements about input, the number of dollars we are going to spend; statements about structures, the kinds of commissions we are going to establish; the kinds of committees that are going to meet. We have statements about things that are going to be done. The Governor-General's Speech yesterday was full of things which are going to be done, but not where they are going to take us; not what kind of nation we would be once they were done-being busy, being active, doing things. That seems to be enough now for tired governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        One can actually be quite busy doing quite ignoble things. We have had a number of countries this century which have demonstrated just that. We have had it here in this country. Let me give you an example, Madam Acting Deputy President. The Hawke Government just a few years ago decided to withdraw the supporting parents benefit from a particular class of beneficiaries, those whose children reached a certain age. The proposal saved money, but it disadvantaged some needy and vulnerable women and families. Think of that. That was a proposal and it went through. At no time did the Hawke Government present any logical  statement of social purpose behind that action. It did not because there was no logical social purpose behind the action. What it did was to meet a financial objective, to save outlays. There was no defensible social purpose at all. On the contrary, Madam Acting Deputy President, that decision made inevitable the emergence of more latchkey children and made more difficult, inevitably, the task of single parents wishing to be home-makers. If one looks at the purpose that is being achieved, one sees that that purpose is ignoble. That is just one example of a myriad of actions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me now say something nice about the Government. While I criticise the Government for its program as we heard it yesterday, I have to say that in another area it has taken action to its credit. The Government has moved the Public Service towards program budgeting and it now requires that the Budget be presented in program terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means that spending is grouped under programs and that for each program there must be stated objectives-objectives which can be examined and tested and challenged, and which we do examine and test and challenge-and that there should be performance measures related to the achievement of those objectives. Really, what I would ask, Madam Acting Deputy President, is that the same Government apply to itself in what it proposes that which it now requires of the Public Service over which it has dominion.
       </para>
       <para>
        You see, we must judge the Speech of the Governor-General against these kinds of benchmarks. Did the Speech point the way towards a better nation? Did the Governor-General's Speech point the way towards a fairer future? Did it point the way towards new opportunity and hope? Those are the tests which are important today; those are the tests which our electors are trying to make us apply. They are the questions which we are being asked by our young. What will it do for the country? Is it fair? The most famous thing for which John Kennedy is remembered  is not his legislative failure but the words with which he inspired America when he said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country'. People want to know what this program yesterday is going to mean for Australia. It is these tests which are important today, not the specific programs, not just being busy. So let us now look at the Speech of the Governor-General.
       </para>
       <para>
        First in fairness to His Excellency, let us acknowledge, of course, that it was the Government's Speech, uttered faithfully by the Governor-General on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Ministers. So if the Speech is deficient in any way that deficiency must be sheeted home to those who wrote the message, not to the person who delivered the message on their behalf. Recently I re-read Alan Reid's book  The Whitlam Venture. It is good reading for any politician. In it he recounts the night of the election of 13 December 1975 when Labor had suffered a massive election defeat. Alan Reid records that as he left the tally room he had the following thoughts. I will quote  some of his words. Alan Reid wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        As I left the tallyroom I wondered what that victory would mean for the future of Australia and the futures of the average, ordinary Australians of whom I was one.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australians who really did not ask for much but only for the right to work in jobs that would keep themselves and their families in reasonable comfort, for a bit of leisure, for homes that they owned and could take a pride in; for being left alone and in peace and not pushed around by government and bureaucrats; to know that they and their fellow citizens were getting a 'fair go' and that the underprivileged and vulnerable were being helped so that their lives became more bearable and their children had some opportunity to escape the harshness that their parents had known and to achieve a better life style.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Acting Deputy President, those are noble goals for any  nation. They describe an Australia in which I would like to live. They describe an Australia for the achievement of which I would fight and strive. They are purposes which promise the enrichment of a society which embraces them.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Labor Government has not gone down that track; it has not chosen to move towards those ideals. It has done worse than that: it has done the opposite. It has trivialised the opportunity presented by the opening of this Parliament. It failed to set any visionary goals. It was content to identify its actions and its busyness. We have seen not the enhancement of work opportunity but increasing evidence now becoming apparent of fewer jobs being advertised, of pessimism about future prospects for work, of longer periods for those who find themselves out of work, of longer periods between jobs, of fewer jobs available in places where people live.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for Alan Reid's goal that Australians should have jobs which would keep them and their families in reasonable comfort, Labor has a lot to answer for and a lot to explain. Family living standards have fallen, and they continue to fall. We are having more trouble paying for food for our families. We are having more trouble buying shoes and clothes for our children and for ourselves, and so on. Individual living standards are falling too, Madam Acting Deputy President. It is harder to afford small luxuries and it is harder to continue today to do what we could do readily seven years ago. As for picking up Alan Reid's vision of owning a home, a home in which we can take pride, all the movements in Australia are in the opposite direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is almost impossible for young people to afford homes anywhere near their parents in the capital cities. My son is despondent about ever being able to afford a home in Sydney at all. He is a qualified person with good earning prospects. He is in full-time employment and he saves money and yet he has no sense of hope, no optimism, that he will ever be able to own a home anywhere in Sydney. What kind of nation is it that will permit this and say nothing about it when it puts down its program for the next three years?
       </para>
       <para>
        Many decent, caring, responsible Australians are finding it impossible to continue to pay off mortgages on the homes they have acquired. More and more of those Australians are losing their homes. Others are spending larger and larger parts of their income on mortgage payments swollen by record high interest rates. For most of them it is harder and harder to keep that home as they would wish; harder and harder to maintain it properly; harder and harder to furnish it; and harder and harder to enjoy it. And this is after seven years of government. There is nothing in the Governor-General's Speech yesterday to offer  hope to those people; nothing to inspire them; nothing to lead them.
       </para>
       <para>
        As for Alan Reid's vision that we should ensure a fair go for the vulnerable, we should be ashamed of what we see in Australia today. We see more alienated people, not fewer. We see more homeless young people, not fewer. We see more people living below the poverty line, not fewer. We see more and more people giving up the struggle. We find more and more unmet need. And when you look into people's eyes, if you listen to them as they weep, when they tell you how it is, when they tell you how hard the struggle is, only then can you begin to understand what is going on today for those not lucky enough to be living on ministerial salaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        While all this is happening to real people we have to listen to Government rhetoric that seems not to understand, that seems to be unaware, that seems to be dissociated from the real problems, and we have to listen to Government Ministers who give no evidence of caring either. Harshness  is all around us and it is increasing. Far from achieving what Alan Reid had sought, of a fair go for the vulnerable, we see more and more people condemned to experience and continue in poverty and misery, and condemned to repeat the cycle of dependence which that brings with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not a new or a young government; it has had years. I think Senator Schacht boasted about government for a decade. This Government has had most of that decade and it has had all that time to deliver a better life for Australians. It has had time to deliver better prospects and more opportunity. Madam Acting Deputy President, I looked to the Speech of the Governor-General for some hope and direction. I listened for some noble goals. I listened for a vision to lead and inspire young people. I listened for messages that I could present to my children and to their friends. I listened for some message to draw people back to contribute to the mainstream of politics. But I looked in vain.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were no such messages. I found none. There is just one phrase on the first page of a 12-page speech and otherwise it is a technician's document, a testament to being busy rather than being effective. A document may be good for accountants or bankers or economists; good for technocrats who want to fiddle and adjust and fix things at the margins without ever knowing what it is they seek to do for people or where they seek to lead us. Not only that; that document, if that is the best the Government can do, will accelerate the flight of caring people from the main political parties to third and fourth groups and to independents who seem to identify with their needs and their hopes and aspirations even if they do not have specific programs. That is what we are going to see.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to dedicate myself to achieving those purposes identified by the late Alan Reid so eloquently almost 15 years ago. I would like to dedicate myself to trying to assert for individual Australians that there is hope, and to assert at the same time that we in this society have both rights and obligations. In doing that, of course, I would reject the arguments of those libertarians who would argue on the one hand for many rights and on the other for no obligations. But, on the other hand, Madam Acting Deputy President, I would also reject those of my friends who are socialists who identify obligations but are very reluctant to grant rights to individuals, just as I reject the increasing number who would replace the government of people with the administration of things.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to achieve the Alan Reid vision we really must allow the energy, the enterprise and the vigour of Australians to be released, but we must, at the same time, ensure that we undertake our duties as members of a community of caring people, that we remind ourselves that we remain committed to care and compassion and to action to achieve good outcomes. I have to say to you that there was nothing in the Governor-General's Speech yesterday which gave me any hope that the Government was aware or cared very much.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to see a dedication to the good outcomes that characterise so many administrations of my political persuasion in the past. I went back to a speech I gave in this place on the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Bill 1987, a very important speech for me at the time. I quote a little bit of it. I said:
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>

       </para>
       <para>
        The greatest achievements of philosophical liberalism have been to remove such barriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ending of slavery, the emancipation of Jews and Catholics in Protestant England, public education, reform of the electoral system, the vote for women, are just some of them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Fraser Administration, of which I was a part, was the Administration that actually passed an Aboriginal land rights Bill, that took decisive action on promoting the rights of women, that made the first steps towards codifying and registering Australian environmental areas on the World Heritage List, that stopped the mining of Fraser Island, that put into effect the enforcement of the racial discrimination Acts. I am going to fight still, Madam Acting Deputy President, for a continuing Liberal vision of a society of free and powerful individuals each able to control his or her life.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to have seen a Governor-General's Speech which took us somewhere down that road, which identified that vision and those goals and which indicated how they would be achieved. It is only by identifying objectives that we can see where the Government wishes to travel, where it seems to be going, and to know where it has been. Only by identifying objectives can we judge the performance of the Government. It is not enough for the Government to tell us what it is doing. It has to tell us where it wishes to take us when it has done those things.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the greatest single failure of the Government program laid down in the Speech. To the extent that this or any other government continues to avoid setting noble, visionary, admirable, defensible, testable objectives-ones with which many citizens can identify-it will sell short to a greater or lesser degree the community in which it operates. Any government that does that, Madam Acting Deputy President, will continue to oversee alienation and cynicism in its society, as we are seeing today in Australia, and as long as governments do that, so long will governments seem irrelevant to the problems blighting the lives of so many. As long as governments do that they will continue to contribute to the flight of people away from the mainstream of politics.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, Madam Acting Deputy President, I found this speech-not the Governor-General's Speech because he was only delivering what the Government prepared for him-an inadequate testament. It is inadequate because while I knew what was being done I did not know where the Government saw us being taken. I say to my colleagues in this chamber that, while I did not know, neither did a whole lot of other Australians who have talked to me. Their complaint is not so much with what we do but as to why we are doing it and where we are taking them. Until the Government is willing to address some of those questions and to excite and inspire people, so long will the major political parties of this country continue to lose support.

         â€”Madam Acting Deputy President, I listened yesterday with considerable interest to the Governor-General's Speech in which he outlined the Government's plan for the future. I noted that there were numerous references to the Government's commitment to justice and social equity, to creating a fairer Australia. Women and children, it seemed to be put, in particular were singled out as the lucky recipients of the Labor Government's good intentions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One could be forgiven, I think, for expressing some scepticism in the matter. Nobody will forget the 1987 election promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that by 1990 no child would live in poverty. We are now well into 1990 and regrettably we know all too well that that, in fact, is not the case. That was not the outcome. None of us, of course, takes any joy from that fact or from the fact that the Government was not able to succeed in fulfilling that promise. Of course, amongst those are the half million people, including children, who live below the poverty line.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was interested yesterday to listen for some real sign that in particular these people would be better off in the future than they have been in the past. The children I am talking about live in a range of different circumstances. Some of them are homeless because their family situation has collapsed. It has become so difficult and so physically dangerous that they have been forced to leave home. Of course, many of them live at home in a quite loving environment but one that is economically deprived, living on social security benefits or on particularly low incomes. A large percentage of children living in poverty are from single parent families.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a particular aspect of the Government's treatment of single parent families to which my remarks in this Address-in-Reply debate are directed. I welcome the opportunity to raise the matter, which I have raised before in this place on more than one occasion. It continues to be a sore; it continues to make life difficult and stressful for many Australians, a substantial number of whom are low income  earners and almost all of whom are women. I speak today, though, in the hope that something will be done to investigate and follow up the problem more than has been done by the Government so far. I am talking, Madam Acting Deputy President, about the Child Support Agency.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have spoken frequently about the Agency. I had a letter from the Agency inviting me to come to its Melbourne office to look at what it does. It is not with the Melbourne office that I have had any difficulties. People in Canberra and this region deal with an office not in Canberra, but in Chatswood in New South Wales. Let me also say that I have no philosophical opposition to the concept of parents being financially responsible for their children. It is one of the fundamentals of Liberal philosophy that we believe individuals should be free to make their own choices. They should, though, be responsible for the choices that they make. Responsibility of a parent for a child, I believe, is basic and important. It would be my preference that parents be prepared to accept the responsibility for their children without the need for government intervention. I recognise that there will always be some who refuse to accept their responsibilities and until the Child Support Agency was set up we accepted the role of the courts as the  enforcing bodies for the financial responsibility on parents. We recognised though that there were significant problems with the enforcement of maintenance orders through the courts and supported the establishment of this Agency.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a stream of complaints since that time-I refer though, as I said, particularly to the Australian Capital Territory-about the way the Agency is not functioning and meeting the needs of those who are dependent on it. Nobody doubted that there would be some teething problems. There certainly were at the outset. Most related to delays of three to six months in getting maintenance recovery under way. But unfortunately for some women, who under the old regime, through the courts, had been paid regularly, the change left them without maintenance for months, and in many cases the arrears which accumulated in that time still have not been recovered. It is true that some women who were receiving nothing are now getting some maintenance and that is very welcome indeed. I hope that that number grows. But the reports which have come to my notice on a continuing basis suggest that there are significant problems in the delivery of services by the Agency, certainly to people in Canberra and possibly elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like other colleagues I get requests from constituents to make representations for them on all sorts of things-taxation, immigration, social security and health. Some of these require correspondence to the department or the Minister. Frequently a request for help is received by my office and staff will make a telephone contact to the relevant department and discuss the problem with an officer of the department. It is exceptional, in my experience, to have any difficulty in dealing with officers of the Public Service in these situations. Almost throughout, in my experience, where information could be made available it has been made available, assuming, of course, that there is no breach of confidentiality or legal impediment to divulging information. It has always been willingly and courteously provided. A phone call will reveal the status of a case,  the reason for a decision or what is holding up a decision in some instances. But the one glaring exception, in my experience, has been the Child Support Agency.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Agency has no office in Canberra. I cannot suggest that there would be an office of the Agency in every town in the country, but I would have thought it would be possible to have a small office, at least, in the major centres. I want to speak about how the Agency deals with its clients and the experiences that I have had in my own office in dealing with it. I shall not go over the examples that I have used previously when speaking in the Senate about this, but I want to go over some of the things that have come to my notice in recent times and to make some observations about the way I think the Agency is functioning at present.

         â€”The restrictions that have now been imposed by Papua New Guinea, as announced in the last day or so following a week of some uncertainty, extend only to the 12-mile territorial sea around Bougainville. They involve the following particular steps, as announced by Mr Diro yesterday: Restrictions will apply to all coastal shipping to and from Bougainville except ships ferrying hospital and medical supplies, goods for the outer islands and fuel for the generation of electricity at the hospital. The Papua New Guinea Customs and Harbour Board will cease clearing vessels for landing in Bougainville and no pilot services will be provided to shipping services into Bougainville. Flights into Bougainville can only be made on the authority of the PNG Director of Civil Aviation. Services in Bougainville will be affected, including banking and telephones.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The subject of a possible blockade was discussed by me with the PNG Ministers concerned during my visit to PNG two weeks ago. At that stage it was made clear to me that something of this kind was very much in contemplation. I was told at the time that a total exclusion zone extending out to 50 nautical miles was not in contemplation, although it had been considered. Accordingly, I was extremely surprised when a notice to aviators and mariners was issued last week extending the zone out that far, which would, of course, interfere with our shipping lanes, and raised quite fundamental questions of international law.
       </para>
       <para>
        That confusion was subsequently resolved over the course of the next few days. It was a mistake, an unintended exercise, by the PNG authorities. So we were given reasonable notice of their intention to mount a restrictive exercise of the kind that has now been put into place. It was not a matter of Australia being consulted or expressing an attitude on this, because clearly an exercise of this kind, as I made obvious at the time, was regarded by us as wholly an internal matter for the PNG Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to whether Australia might become involved in the enforcement of this set of restrictions, all I can say is that no request has been made of us in that respect. Obviously we would look at any such request on its merits when it arose, although questions of very great sensitivity would manifestly be involved were we to become involved in a matter of that kind.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”The first question was whether I am aware of what invitations were extended. Woodside Petroleum, in terms of the Goodwyn A platform construction, prequalified a number of Australian tenderers. I am aware of that process and of the complete result of the tender outcome, because I was a member of the sensitive contracts committee, constituted by Commonwealth and State governments, in this case the State Government of Western Australia, and met with senior executives of Woodside to review the outcome of such bids. Naturally, the sensitive contracts outcomes are confidential, are commercial-in-confidence, and I am not in a position to reveal them in the chamber, but I am aware of all those details.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        A number of Australian companies did participate and a number of Australian companies had bids which were, by and large, not competitive with major overseas bids. However, following discussions with Woodside and following steps taken by the unions and some of the bidders-in particular, the Press Clough Ltd consortium in Western Australia-the bids were modified significantly because of savings able to be effected due to changes in the industrial relations procedures that were to be implemented for the work to be carried out.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of that, and as a result of the State governments in South Australia and Western Australia as well being prepared to make some concessions-in the case of Western Australia, concessions of about $10m for site preparation and the forgoing of State taxes and charges in the form of payroll tax, et cetera-it became possible for the Commonwealth Government to consider whether it should exercise an existing provision under the Customs Act to waive a customs duty.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that, in view of the importance of these contracts being located in Australia and future offshore work being able to be carried out not only on the North West Shelf of Western Australia but in the Timor Sea, given the prospects for the region, and the high growth of resource development within the Association of South East Asian Nations area, if an incentive were given to these companies to win a major international contract and demonstrate their capacity for quality workmanship, there would be a possibility of setting them up to win contracts in other major developing areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was also a significant improvement in industrial relations not only for Press Clough but, because of the negotiations that were conducted, an improvement in industrial relations commitments throughout the whole of the third stage of the North West Shelf project. On that basis the concession was granted. As a consequence it is now guaranteed that for the life of the piles contracts in South Australia at least 150 jobs will continue and, because of the contract for the modules in Western Australia, 700 jobs will be able to be continued.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that the actions of the State governments in both Western Australia and South Australia to support their local industry and to encourage a more competitive bid, in which case they have won these contracts, have to be contrasted with the attitude of the New South Wales Government. The Deputy Premier in New South Wales, Wal Murray, declined to give New South Wales industry the sorts of benefits, in order to help them be competitive, that the State governments in South Australia and Western Australia were doing. As a consequence the ability of Newcastle to be competitive was simply non-existent. In terms of supporting the particular local industry I think that is a significant consideration as to why Woodside in the end, and in its commercial judgment, decided to award the contracts as it has.

         â€”As honourable senators may be aware, the judge in this case has remanded the accused in custody to face trial again. Obviously I shall try to be as informative as possible in the answer that I give. I have been advised by the Attorney-General's Department and the Director of Public Prosecutions himself that for this reason there are limits on the detail which it is proper for me to provide. I wish to acknowledge straight away that the matter to which the honourable senator refers has been of serious concern to me, and indeed to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney-General. I acknowledge here, as I have to them, that my remarks to the media were most unfortunate in respect of both the presumption of guilt on the part of the person arrested in Thailand and their causing the judge of the trial in Sydney to abort the trial. I accept the error I made and the significance of that error.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister has looked closely into the circumstances surrounding my remarks including through detailed discussions with the Attorney-General and with me. Following these discussions the Prime Minister has also had a detailed letter from the Attorney-General setting out his conclusions. In order as fully as possible to inform honourable senators about the matter I take this opportunity to table the Attorney-General's report to the Prime Minister, and his reply, both of which were copied to me.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having tabled these letters I shall not go into detail but I should mention several key points. The Attorney-General has concluded, and the Prime Minister has accepted, the following: First, in making the remarks which I did, I was totally unaware that the trial was under way in Australia. The Director of Public Prosecutions accepts that I had no knowledge of any trial prior to my remarks to the media and, indeed, that he was the first to inform me that a trial was under way several hours after my press conference when we met on a flight to Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, obviously I had no intention of expressing an opinion which would lead to the aborting of a trial.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, what gave rise to this state of affairs were serious shortcomings in communications to me. There were various conversations involving the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police and my office, and conversations between my office and me, but at no stage before I spoke to the media was I informed of the crucial fact that a trial was under way.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourth, the Government considers it essential that we rectify these shortcomings so that no such situation arises in future. The Prime Minister has directed that a system be set in place forthwith to ensure that the Attorney-General, I and others are informed on a monthly basis of significant trials which are continuing or about to commence.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fifth, as I said earlier, the judge in the trial has indicated that he has remanded all three of the accused in custody to face trial again when the publicity has died down. Our aim is to restore circumstances in which the trial may proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister has weighed very carefully my error, taking into account the circumstances of a breakdown in communication with my office and between my office and me. He has also taken into account the lead role which I have played in the much enhanced collaboration between Australia and other countries in the war against drug trafficking. The matter has been thoroughly investigated and the Prime Minister's deep concern has been made very clear to me.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senators will be aware of my strong personal and ministerial commitment to ensuring that our law enforcement agencies effectively combat the menace of drug trafficking into Australia. Honourable senators will understand my deep regret that, in pursuing this commitment, I inadvertently caused a jury to be dismissed. I am confident that the information system to be introduced at the direction of the Prime Minister will ensure that we will be even more effective in the battle to which I and the Government are committed.

        Dear Prime Minister
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said to you when we discussed the matter, I have looked in detail at the circumstances surrounding the aborting by the Judge of a trial following the remarks made by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, to the media on 2 May 1990. I have spoken at length to Senator Tate and, of course, you and I have had the opportunity for thorough discussion with him.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thought it appropriate that I should write to you to set out my main conclusions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the first place it is clear-and Senator Tate fully accepts-that the consequences of his remarks have been most unfortunate.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you know, in granting a defence application to dismiss the jury the Judge is reported (and I am advised accurately reported) to have said, ``It is most unfortunate that the Minister for Justice made the statements attributed to him while the trial was proceeding''. He referred to his particular concern that Senator Tate had lent the authority of his office to a positive assertion that the person arrested in Thailand was guilty.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tate has assured me that he was not informed at any stage orally or in written submission that a trial was in progress. I am satisfied on this centrally important point that Senator Tate was unaware that the trial was under way. Had he been aware of this I fully accept his assurance that he would not have made the remarks he made. Obviously Senator Tate had no intention whatsoever of expressing opinions which would lead to the aborting of the trial.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the light of this I accept that the repercussions of Senator Tate's comments, while most unfortunate, were nevertheless unforeseen by him.
       </para>
       <para>
        What gave rise to this state of affairs were serious shortcomings in communications to Senator Tate. There were various conversations involving the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police and Senator Tate's office; and conversation between the latter and Senator Tate. But at no stage was Senator Tate himself informed before he spoke to the media of the crucial fact that a trial was under way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shortcomings in communication seem to have occurred at three separate stages.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that when advised by the AFP case officer in the Sydney trial that Senator Tate intended to hold a press conference the Director of Public Prosecutions' instructing prosecutor expressed the view that the press conference should not proceed as it would prejudice the trial. This information was not conveyed to Senator Tate or his office before the press conference.
       </para>
       <para>
        Next, an officer in the Australian Federal Police says that as far as he can recall he informed the Minister's office by telephone that there was a trial going on in Sydney and that the Minister should delete any reference to Australia or the activities of people in Australia from his press release. By implication that same advice would apply to remarks at a press conference. On the other hand, the relevant member of Senator Tate's staff says that while the AFP asked him to ensure that the Minister did not make any reference to ``the Australian connection'', there was no reference to the fact that a trial was underway in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, the staff member says that he informed Senator Tate of the AFP's cautioning about any reference to the Australian connection. Senator Tate recalls that he was told there was nothing to be said about any ``Australian links'' but that at no stage was he informed that a trial was in progress in Australia which might be linked to the person arrested in Thailand. The staff member informed me that he recalled, in relation to ``the Australian connection'', mentioning names to the Minister. The Minister's recollection is, however, that he was told nothing about any particular Australian end of the operation and no mention was made of the names of persons, domestic operations or trials. The staff member has indicated to me that, given the hurried circumstances of the conversation, he has no reason to question the Minister's recollection. Further, Senator Tate has informed me that he interpreted the advice not to refer to Australian links as meaning that he should not refer to particular, current police operations in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The communications were certainly not, therefore, as clear as they should have been concerning the possible implications of comments to the media at that juncture. But it is important, in terms of assessing the Minister's own conduct, that on no account of the communications which took place-that is to say Senator Tate's own account or that of his Office or indeed that of the AFP itself, which recalls making this point, but not direct to Senator Tate, only to his Office-was the Minister himself informed that there was a trial underway in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Director of Public Prosecutions accepts that Senator Tate had no knowledge of any trial prior to his remarks to the media, and indeed was the first to inform Senator Tate that a trial was under way several hours after the press conference when they met on a flight to Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para>
        I consider it essential that we rectify the shortcomings in communication of relevant information which existed on this occasion in order to prevent, as far as possible, any such situation recurring in the future. My Department has recommended to me that consideration should be given to the office of the DPP preparing, on a monthly basis, lists of significant trials commencing or continuing in the ensuing month. They proposed that this list should be circulated to both Ministers' offices, the Department and the AFP. I propose that we accept this recommendation. More generally I propose to bring to the attention of all involved in these matters the importance of complete and timely communication.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have also expressed my dismay to Senator Tate that in the course of his press conference he had presumed the guilt of the person arrested in Thailand. He agrees with me that his comments were unfortunate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Judge has indicated that he has remanded all three of the accused in custody to face trial again when the publicity has died down. It is therefore highly desirable in terms of the administration of justice that the recent developments be put behind us as soon as possible. Our aim should be to restore circumstances in which the trial may proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no doubt that Senator Tate's aim in speaking to the media on 2 May was to reinforce the central point of his press statement and that of the AFP that a major breakthrough had been made, through collaborative international efforts involving Australia, in the war against drugs. It is unfortunate that his concern to demonstrate the success of the efforts in Thailand led him to make remarks which led, in turn, to the aborting of the trial in Australia. But, as I have said, that result was obviously unintended and the mistake reflected in significant measure shortcomings in the chain of advice to him.

       </para>
       <para>
        Having carefully considered your own conclusions as set out in that letter, and bearing in mind what the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs said in his discussions with us, I accept the position which you have put.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to make very clear to you, and to Senator Tate to whom I am copying this letter, that, as I said when we discussed the matter, I agree with you that it is most regrettable that the Minister made remarks to the media which presumed the guilt of the person arrested in Thailand and also caused the Judge to conclude that he must abort the trial in Sydney. I also take the point, however, that Senator Tate was unaware of the trial underway in Australia at the time and agree that this is an important point in assessing the Minister's conduct.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that on no account of the advice which was given to the Minister is it contended that he was made aware of the trial. I accept that the Minister's sole intention was to draw attention to a significant accomplishment overseas, in which Australia had played a major part, in the battle against drugs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shortcomings in communication which led to the Minister being unaware of the trial are unacceptable and must be rectified. Your recommendation that a system be established of monthly reporting of trials is accepted and I want the system introduced forthwith.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian authorities have made great progress in international collaboration to combat the trade in drugs. I am conscious that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs has played a lead role in setting the policy framework for and encouraging this important effort. I want it to continue as a major priority of our fourth term agenda in the area of law enforcement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree with your hope that the circumstances will be created in which the trial in Sydney may proceed as soon as possible.
       </para>

        While I emphasise again how regrettable it is that the recent situation occurred, my concern now is that we move ahead to build on the considerable achievements we have made in law enforcement, including learning the lessons of the recent incident and improving our systems of communication and the provision to Ministers of timely and relevant information.

Like many other Western governments, we have refused to accept in international law their incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940, rejecting the self-proclaimed Soviet sovereignty over them. The Government believes that the recent declarations of independence by their freely elected Parliaments do reflect the aspirations of the Baltic peoples to achieve economic and political independence through peaceful and democratic means. Equally, we do fully appreciate that it is the unprecedented process of reform in the Soviet Union which has made it possible for the newly elected Baltic parliaments to express these aspirations. We urge-I take this opportunity to do so again-the Soviet Government to respect those declarations and to refrain from actions inimical to the interests of the parties concerned.

         â€”To some extent Senator Macklin's question is based on a false premise to the extent that the United States has not formally named Australia as an unfair trader under the so-called Super 301 provisions of the 1988 Trade Act. What has happened rather is that we have simply been mentioned in a report to Congress which the United States trade representative is required to make every year on the trading practices of its major trading partners. The purpose of that report is to assist United States trade negotiators to identify trade negotiating objectives. The section on Australia does cite our tariff regime, customs evaluation practices, export incentive scheme, government procurement program and various local content schemes. In most instances the report simply notes those aspects of our trading regime and notes further that the United States trade representative intends pursuing its negotiating objectives in relation to these matters in the context of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        All that said, we are not especially enthused at this demonstration of high moral tone in relation to our practices against a background where some trading practices of the United States are unquestionably unfair, especially in agricultural trade. The export enhancement program, as we have debated on many occasions in this place, is one of the most trade distorting measures it is possible to construct, and Australia has repeatedly asked the United States to abolish such programs in the interests of freer world trade. It is also worth making the point in the context of our bilateral relationship that the United States continues to enjoy enormous trading opportunities in Australia. It does have a 2:1 surplus with us and this is the second largest surplus that the United States has with any country in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as the latter part of the question, relating to the world trade organisation, is concerned, it is the case that at a recent trade Ministers meeting in Mexico attended by my colleague Dr Blewett, the Canadian Minister, Mr Crosbie, announced the intention to circulate a proposal to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in July aimed at establishing GATT as a fully fledged international organisation using the concept `World Trading Organisation' at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, the idea being to have all the agreements under one roof and to provide a strong, effective dispute settlement institution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Canada's proposal is based on the fact that the Uruguay Round is the most complex and comprehensive round of negotiations in GATT's 40-year history. In addition to market access and agriculture, it covers-as we should know by now-the development of new international rules on trade and services, trade related intellectual property rights and investment measures, and updating codes from the Tokyo Round. The comprehensive result that we all hope will emerge from the round does raise significant institutional questions about how all the new agreements will link together and how a common dispute settlement process will work.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bottom line is this: it is our view-generally shared by the trade Ministers at the Mexico meeting-that the idea put forward by Mr Crosbie should certainly not be dismissed. However, the shape of the Uruguay Round outcome will strongly influence institutional arrangements, so we do need to focus on the substantive outcome first before we get too obsessed with institutional structures. Institutional issues such as a world trade organisation should not detract in any way from that substantive negotiating process, and in particular should not be perceived as some alternative result to it-which might just conceivably be something in the back of the minds of the Canadians.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should also bear in mind that the original attempt to establish an international trade organisation in 1947 did founder due to resistance from national legislatures such as the US Congress. So we need to adopt, as always in these matters, a very healthy sense of realism about its prospects for implementation, even if we do ultimately think at the end of the round it is a good idea.

         â€”I appreciate Senator Boswell's concern about the damage which has been done both to infrastructure and people particularly in towns in Queensland as a result of the floods. The position is generally that the States within broad guidelines and with the agreement of the Commonwealth decide how generous disaster relief packages should be. The Government is committed to providing the full extent of assistance under the national disaster relief arrangements to the people of Nyngan, Charleville and other centres affected by the flooding.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government has given a quarter of a million dollars to each of the public appeals for flood victims as a donor in Queensland and New South Wales and will be contributing more through tax deductability of other donations to these funds. I should say that the natural disaster relief arrangements with the States have worked very effectively since they were introduced in 1978, are very much a collaborative effort between State and Commonwealth governments, and are updated following consultation with the States each year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the honourable senator of what the basic principles of those arrangements are. The Commonwealth reimburses the States for at least 50 per cent of State outlays on personal hardship and distress; $1 of every $2 announced by each State in this area comes from the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, in relation to other relief measures and restoration of homes, businesses and public assets to which Senator Boswell referred, I point out that a basic amount of disaster relief has to be spent by the States each year and after that amount is spent-and in the normal course of events it usually is-the Commonwealth then reimburses the States, first on a dollar for dollar basis, and then with three Commonwealth dollars for every State dollar.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are the guidelines for administration of disaster relief schemes and I think they are arrangements which worked effectively in the case of Cyclone Winifred, the Ash Wednesday bushfires and other disasters and we believe they will work effectively again in this case but, as I make clear, it is a matter of consultation between State and Federal governments on the total amount spent.

Australia has not signed the convention as yet. Becoming a party to the convention is a two-stage process-first signature, and later ratification. Senator Coates would remember that signature to the convention does not make a country a party to the convention but signifies simply that the country will refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the convention until it is ratified or has made its intention clear not to ratify. The second stage is ratification, whereby a country becomes a party to the convention and is bound by it.

        Many of the matters dealt with in the convention concern areas traditionally dealt with by the States and Territories. The Government has begun consultations with the State and Territory governments with a view to establishing whether Australian laws and practices are consistent with requirements of the convention. State and Territory governments were kept advised of developments during the drafting of the convention of the United Nations and are being consulted on the question of signature and ratification. It is true, as Senator Coates has indicated, that many community organisations have indicated their support for Australia's ratification following signature of the convention, and of course most recently Sir Ronald Wilson, a former justice of the High Court of Australia and the new President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, speaking at a function organised by the Uniting Church of Australia, indicated his strong support for that particular convention and that course of action being undertaken by the Government. I understand that the Australian Episcopal Conference of the Roman Catholic Church has also indicated its support for the convention following the Vatican's accession to the convention.

         â€”There are differences of views about that. That would seem to be a likely conclusion, but I think there are differences of views about it because of the impact of various indirect taxes other than the wholesale tax itself. In so far as the second part of the question is concerned, my Department-I assume-has been looking at aspects of a broadly based consumption tax or value added tax, as other departments have. Departments do that as a matter of course if there is a public debate about an issue such as this, as there has been, and a lot of comment has been made in the newspapers and elsewhere. Might I say that I believe that the particular concerns of the Department, as do mine, go to the first part of the question that was asked of me, and whether there is something which can be done to alleviate any further burden on exporters. The Treasurer, in the statement which he made today at the National Press Club, specifically referred to that issue as one which was receiving further examination by the Government, one which has been dealt with in part by the extension of the aids to manufacturing concessions last year, but which is subject to further review by the Government at present.

Firstly, I ask the Minister why the package cost Pakistan only $36m, when the Minister's predecessor originally stated in 1989 that he was hoping to get $100m for the deal? Secondly, in the light of the sale of the Mirages to Pakistan, and the $5m contract for Redeco to work with the Dutch consortium, Nedeco, to design India's new naval base near Goa, I ask the Minister: what controls now exist on arms transfers and other military contracts, given that such sales to countries at odds with each other for over 40 years are hardly compatible with our international responsibility to act to reduce tensions in the region? Finally, I ask the Minister whether there was a difference over the Mirage sale with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Can the Minister say what would be the point of a review of the sale if, once the Mirages had gone to Pakistan, they were then used in a conflict with India over Kashmir or over any other issue?

The package was first placed for disposal by international tender in August 1988 and negotiations began that year. Differences between earlier estimates and the sale price achieved must be considered in light of the availability of surplus military hardware flowing from the events in Europe. Concerning the question of what controls exist on the export of defence goods to overseas countries, I refer the honourable senator to guidelines for exporters, Australian Controls of Export and Defence Related Goods, published in July 1989.

        The current level of tension between India and Pakistan is clearly a matter of concern to Australia, which enjoys friendly relations with both countries. We certainly hope that these tensions will reduce in the future. I note the recent favourable developments associated with the meeting between respective foreign ministries between those countries, which occurred late last month in the United States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence liaise closely on policy concerning defence exports. The sale of the Mirage aircraft was in accordance with Government policy and implemented by both Departments in accordance with that policy. Once the Mirage aircraft are delivered to Pakistan the Government of Pakistan will determine how they are used.

Was Senator Evans's insulting conduct towards Prime Minister Namaliu and the Papua New Guinea Government deliberate or the result of unintended incompetence?

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”The first point to make is that the original question is based on a false premise. I did not at any time, on arrival or in any subsequent statement, criticise Papua New Guinea for not doing more to cut government expenditure, nor did I at any stage cast any aspersions on the scope of the structural adjustment that Papua New Guinea was attempting-the package that it had proposed to the World Bank. What I did say on arrival was this-and I quote from the transcript, which is readily available if honourable senators would like to see it:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I see this visit as an opportunity to get a first hand assessment and update on a number of problems facing Papua New Guinea at the moment and how those problems are being tackled. However sympathetic we may be-and we are very sympathetic to the continuing difficulties that you are facing-we simply can't solve Papua New Guinea's problems for Papua New Guinea . . . We will be looking to evidence of your commitment and the effectiveness with which that's being done.
       </para>
       <para>
        I did, in other words, make the point that formulating a policy response, as appropriate as that policy response may be, is not in itself sufficient. Those policies have to be implemented effectively, and in Papua New Guinea's case in current circumstances that will require a sustained political commitment. So my comments were directed at the need for a sustained commitment and, above all else, effective implementation-and I make no apology for putting the proposition in those terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to Mr Namaliu's reported response to my public statement in question, the circumstances were as follows: the following day after my arrival, questions were put to Prime Minister Namaliu at a press conference-which did convey the impression which Senator Hill, in his press release earlier on, and now Senator Teague have obviously also gleaned from press reports-which conveyed the impression that I had said on my arrival, before meeting any Ministers, that PNG's current budgetary belt-tightening efforts were insufficient, and Australia, moreover, was not prepared in any way to offer extra assistance at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not altogether surprisingly, Prime Minister Namaliu was a little wounded by this, not least because he had been occupied for some weeks previously with a very difficult and sensitive razor gang exercise which had produced what I readily acknowledge was a very impressive budget cutting and structural adjustment program, and was so regarded by the International Monetary Fund, our delegate there, and so on. He did say that he was disappointed and, perhaps to some extent, offended with these remarks which he believed I had made-but I had not-before I had talked to anyone. In fact, as I have already said, I did not make my comment in those terms. I have described the comments I did make. The whole thing generated a quite excited media response, particularly here. It generated quite an excited political response, too. When I met Mr Namaliu for a final meeting just before my departure, the misunderstanding about what I said was fully explained to him. I showed him the transcripts of the press conferences in question, and we parted on wholly amicable terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final part of the question concerned Mr Somare, who expressed his upset a couple of days ago in relation to a report carried in the Canberra Times last Friday which drew upon the remarks of a departmental spokesman about our attitude to Papua New Guinea's declaration of a 50-nautical mile exclusion zone around Bougainville. The remarks of that spokesman and, indeed, the remarks I made myself in a doorstop interview that day, did reflect serious concern at the implications for Australia of that declaration which was made early last week. They also repeated concerns which I had expressed to Papua New Guinea Ministers during my visit a week earlier when I was assured that such a declaration, while it had been considered, would not be made. I have already made this point in answer to Senator Hill at the beginning of Question Time.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his press release, Mr Somare suggested that Australia's interest in this proposed total exclusion zone amounted to interference in Papua New Guinea's internal affairs. I think the following points need to be appreciated: the Australian response that I was making did not relate to the current restrictive arrangements about a 12-nautical mile zone, which do not involve any international shipping lanes. I made it clear in Papua New Guinea, as I have made it clear subsequently, and again in Question Time today, that any decision about the application of a blockade in this area is wholly a PNG affair. Of course, the purported declaration of a 50-nautical mile exclusion zone is not, in any view, simply an internal affair for the country concerned; it is an action which can profoundly affect the interests of other countries. The notice to aviators and mariners that was issued on 2 May warned, after all, that unauthorised vessels sighted within the zone would be fired on without warning by PNG patrol boats. The exclusion zone was also defined as including air space up to 20,000 feet.
       </para>
       <para>
        While no commercial aircraft fly directly over that route, there are certainly Australian ships that pass regularly through the passage between Buka and New Ireland. To the best of our knowledge about eight Australian flag vessels per month transit that passage, while the total number of commercial traffic could be as high as one per day. So it was in that context that I instructed our High Commissioner in Port Moresby to make our rather well-founded concerns known to the Papua New Guinea Government. And it was in those terms that I responded to press inquiries on the subject. I notice that Papua New Guinea has now rescinded notification of the proposed 50 nautical miles total exclusion zone. Mr Diro has said that he was obliged to acknowledge on the part of the Papua New Guinea Government that declaration of such a zone would be a violation of international law. He also acknowledged that it was the product of an internal communications failure. His Government accepted responsibility for the confusion in question.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say finally, in response to this whole affair, that I would hope that my respect for the sovereignty and independence of other countries is well established. In the case of the South Pacific it is at the heart of the policy of `constructive commitment' which defines our approach to the region. Respect for each other's sovereignty is also, as Mr Somare pointed out, at the heart of the Joint Declaration of Principles which this Government concluded with Papua New Guinea in 1987. It is not my practice to comment gratuitously on the affairs of other countries, but when other governments take decisions which affect Australian interests, I am required to make our interests clear. It is my role as Foreign Minister to do so. I did so in a comparable situation last year, when Indonesia temporarily closed the strait between Lombok and Sunda. I can assure the Senate, without any apology whatsoever, I will do so again with any country in the region if the circumstances require it.

He certainly commented favourably on the structural adjustment package that PNG put together. I commented favourably on it when I was there and before I went there, and have also done so since I have come back. Obviously Senator Teague was not listening to the answer I gave. I did not say anything adverse about it at any stage and, therefore, there is no inconsistency whatsoever between the respective favourable comments that I made and those that Mr Ted Evans made.

The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has accepted the Civil Aviation Authority's commission, to carry out preliminary design work for the construction of a general aviation airport facility to be completed at Badgerys Creek by 1992. The phased development of Badgerys Creek airport is an integral component of a comprehensive set of measures which contains a commitment by the Government to construct a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, subject only to the completion of an environmental impact statement.

Is the Minister concerned that this provision, which I remind him was opposed by the Australian Democrats last December when it was introduced, is an effective reversal of the onus of proof for the unemployed given that over 75 per cent of the appeals against the removal of unemployment benefits so far have been upheld? In view of the increasing unemployment which we are now experiencing as a result of the Government's economic policy and anticipated by the Minister himself in today's Melbourne Age will the Minister commit the Government to removal of this provision to ensure that the injustice does not escalate?

         â€”I do not agree with the assessment from ACOSS that this is ill-conceived, unworkable unfair and causing a great deal of hardship. Certainly some hundreds of people are affected by the decision. That is for certain. But I think if we are going to be serious about the policy of encouraging those on unemployment benefits or receiving Newstart or a Job search allowance to get into the work force we must maintain the integrity of the work test. It is very difficult to do that if we allow benefit recipients to move into areas where the chances of getting a job are greatly minimised, and in some cases completely nullified. The real test is how you work back from there to protect the integrity of the test without unduly causing hardship to those who are most in need. I believe that the decision was the correct one, but I believe that there have been some mistakes and inadequacies in its implementation. In the State of Victoria in particular, there was a problem concerning those who were offered Housing Commission homes in an area with less employment prospects, and there was the possibility then that if one did not accept that offer of housing, one would lose one's place on the list. That has been sorted out with the Victorian Housing Commission and it is no longer the case. All unemployment benefit recipients, all those receiving Newstart and Job search allowance, if they are in that situation and they decline the offer of housing, will not lose their place on the list. Other States are being approached. We believe there will not be any problem with that situation pertaining all round the country. We can get around that particular difficulty which was struck in Victoria.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is also the problem of how one equates the employment prospects of individuals with the employment prospects generally in an area. That is where quite a number of mistakes have been made, and I readily acknowledge that fact. That has resulted in some discussions between my Department and the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), whose job it is to make those assessments, and we will ensure that those problems do not occur in the future. Again, I believe we can solve that problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there is a third problem to which there is no solution under the Act, and I intend to approach the Government in the next few days to ascertain whether I can have an extra amendment added to the legislation which will be before the Senate in the next couple of weeks. That concerns those who move for medical reasons. At the moment, there is no scope for adjustment for those families who may move because perhaps a child is suffering from asthma or something like that in a particular area and they want to go somewhere else. I will approach the Government on that score and, hopefully, I will have some success. I do not believe that it is effectively a reversal of the onus of proof. It obviously is an extra test for people but, then again, if one wishes to maintain the integrity of the work test-and I believe that is necessary-I think we need to go along this route.
       </para>
       <para>
        There may be some increase in unemployment this year, but as the Prime Minister repeated today, he and the Government do not believe that we will be in a recession or see any massive increase, so I am not of the view that this injustice, as the honourable senator put it, will escalate. Rather, I think that, by the measures we have taken in the course of the past few days, we can ensure that we will minimise any inconvenience or injustice in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite true to say that the rate of appeals being upheld in cases in this instance is greater by a factor of three than the average of appeals that are upheld generally through the system. I think that is primarily for the reasons I have outlined today. I believe we have taken steps to ensure that that will not occur again. I think honourable senators will see over the course of the next few months the appeal success rates of these matters going back to the same level as occurs across the Department.

Given the effective reduction in public housing and the long waiting lists, many low income people are forced into the private rental market, and, as we know, rentals are often lower in areas of higher unemployment. Can the Minister assure me that we will not continue to strike this problem with this particular provision in the area of private rental, or, failing that, that he will at least look into it seriously?

While rents may be lower, people will still be at far greater disadvantage if they remain on unemployment benefits and simply move to an area to get a lower rent but where there is no possibility of getting a job. So, I do not see it outweighing our main concern, but I acknowledge that it is a concern, and it is something that I will keep under constant review.

       <para>
        The matter I wish to raise, which undoubtedly some people will find trivial, is in our view a matter of some principle. It relates to the attire worn by officers of the Senate and, in particular, the gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. The office of Black Rod is, of course, a very old and distinguished one going back many centuries. It has been part and parcel of tradition and the way in which the Senate conducts its business. The officer who is sent as the formal messenger between this chamber and the House of Representatives has served in the House of Lords in a particular fashion. Much as it may be a matter of some curiosity, the Usher of the Black Rod has dressed in a particular fashion. On ceremonial occasions such as yesterday he not only carries the staff of office which he has, but he wears black gloves, a sword and all of the other accoutrements and trappings of that office.
       </para>
       <para>
        Normally a gentleman Usher of the Black Rod-or Black Rod, as we refer to the office in this place-wears lace. It is a matter of some curiosity, I suppose, but indeed it is part and parcel of a parliamentary tradition. Yesterday when the members of the House of Representatives were summoned here all honourable senators would have noticed the House of Representatives Clerks and senior officers seated at the table in the centre of the chamber and the Serjeant-at-Arms. They were wearing lace, and in that respect they were more splendidly attired than our distinguished officers. Although it is a matter entirely for Their Honours, we also noticed yesterday that the lady and gentlemen of the High Court were not in the traditional robes which judges of the High Court, with the exception of the late Mr Justice Murphy, have traditionally worn when presenting themselves in the chamber for significant ceremonial occasions.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that in relation to Senate officers the matter of attire is not a matter simply of personal discretion but is a matter of the view of the chamber. It may well be the view of the chamber that they should wear cutaway jeans and T-shirts, in which case they will be perfectly entitled to wear cutaway jeans and T-shirts.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the last occasion that some of these matters were raised-I look to the comments made on page 150 and 151 of the fifth edition of Odgers' Australian Senate Practice-the House Committee reported to the Senate about certain matters of dress.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee reported that there were certain standards of dress which were regarded as appropriate and not appropriate, not in accordance with the dignity of the Senate. Indeed the Senate adopted the House Committee report when it was brought before it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I well remember that similar actions were taken when an adviser to a Minister seated himself on the official adviser benches dressed in a poloneck pullover and jeans and the President of the time ruled that that was inappropriate dress and that officers were also to be properly dressed when they entered the chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I remember when the question of dress was raised many years ago with one of your distinguished predecessors, Sir Magnus Cormack, Sir Magnus simply replied, if my Latin serves me correctly, `de gustibus non est disputandum'-good taste is not a matter of debate. It does seem to me that while the officers have their own individual rights and can conduct themselves in a fashion which they think appropriate, where there are significant departures from the tradition of the Senate we on this side are concerned with the form and tradition and the standing of this Parliament. Over the years an attempt has been studiously and deliberately made as a matter of policy to denigrate the traditions, behaviour, standards and the way in which the parliamentary institution is conducted, but those matters do not go without our noticing them; they do not go without our remarking upon them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I appreciate that it may well be that you, Mr President, as the presiding officer, have no specific jurisdiction in the matter or indeed that decisions have been made which may be entirely personal decisions made by the officers concerned in exactly the same way as the question of whether the President should be gowned and wigged is one which is entirely in the hands of the presiding officer of the day.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply wish to raise with you, Sir, the fact that there are a number of members of the Opposition who believe that the traditions of this Parliament are enhanced by certain things and are detracted from by certain things. When changes are made we as the members of the chamber are entitled to be consulted about them and to express an opinion. I express an opinion ex post facto on this matter, which I know is shared by colleagues on this side of the chamber. I say to you, Mr President: we regret it if a decision has been made to depart from a tradition of centuries in Westminster parliaments and almost a century in the Commonwealth Parliament and that none of us has been consulted. A very large number of us believe that the maintenance of even small courtesies, of even small symbolic indications of the particular position of senior officers of the Senate, of senior servants of the Parliament, is to be set at nought simply on a personal whim.

The recent seventy-fifth anniversary of the Australian landing at Gallipoli was one of those special moments in the history of our country. It was an occasion in which political differences were put aside and the leaders of the three major parties were joined in unity of purpose at Anzac Cove.

      <para>
       For those who were there and for those who participated in services throughout Australia the personal sacrifice of our original Diggers was commemorated. In a larger sense, however, the occasion gave us all pause to reflect on our national identity. We all shared the pride of our veterans returning to the site of that original landing-pride at their bearing, their grace and their humour. Watching them during their second odyssey to Turkey, we were reminded that these men and women are a living embodiment of the history of our nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Despite the campaign's failure, Gallipoli was a human triumph-a triumph of bravery, tenacity and courage. As Charles Bean, the official historian, wrote, it demonstrated `an endurance which will never own defeat'. It was at Gallipoli that the term `Anzac' acquired its heroic aura. It was from Gallipoli that names like Monash, Bridges, Simpson, Lone Pine and Quinns Post became household words. The qualities of courage, endurance in adversity, daring in attack and mateship that the Australian forces so consistently showed set a standard for our services in the first and second world wars and subsequent conflicts.
      </para>

       Those Anzac qualities of resilience, initiative and mutual care are needed as much today as before-as much in times of peace as in war. As my Leader Dr Hewson said at the Lone Pine service:

       Our commemorations were not just of the horrors of war but also of the hope that springs in the human spirit, and of the spirit of reconciliation that is now demonstrated in the relations between Turkey and her former adversaries.

In paying homage to our fallen at Gallipoli, to their comrades and survivors, we rekindle a faith in our future.

        â€”On behalf of the National Party of Australia I too would like to support the motion that has been brought before the Senate today by Senator Button. I felt a great deal of pride when I watched the media and saw those 57 old Diggers over there in a foreign land representing Australia, and I thought they did it magnificently well. I congratulate them for the spirit that they showed. It must have been very difficult for them at their age to fly halfway around the world and to be moved in different ways-in buses, walking and so forth all round the areas of battle such as Lone Pine. I think they did an absolutely magnificent job.

       I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) also. I think it was a wonderful way to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Anzac. It was innovative and it was splendid. The fact that these people went over there had some other spin-offs. As I attended my local Anzac Day ceremonies I noticed that a vastly increased number of Australians have become aware of Anzac Day and attended the various services throughout the land. I believe record crowds were in attendance at the major marches in all capital cities. So I believe that the 57 veterans, the eight war widows and eight delegates who went to Turkey to revisit the site of the Gallipoli campaign renewed the spirit of Anzac. They got that spirit through to the people of Australia and they gave the younger people a vision of what Australia is all about. For that reason alone, I believe the campaign to take a delegation of Diggers-some more than 100 years of age; I think the eldest was 103 and the youngest 93-renewed the spirit of Anzac and showed our young people what it was all about.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has been said often enough, and I repeat it today as the grandson of a Gallipoli veteran, that Anzac Day is really the Australian day. It is our traditional Australia Day, the day that we celebrate. That spirit goes right throughout Australia. I saw it in Charleville only the other day, on Anzac Day. The floods had run over the town. The people of Charleville had their Anzac Day parade. All the people of the town turned out, not to celebrate war but to pay homage to Australian veterans of all wars. I thought it was a wonderful tradition that in spite of all the hardships in Charleville, those people put on the ceremony there. It is just another demonstration of the tradition of people helping each other in times of adversity.
      </para>
      <para>
       That spirit was born in 1915 in the Gallipoli campaign. I once again congratulate the Government on taking the delegation of Diggers, war widows and legatees to Turkey and renewing the spirit of Anzac.

        â€”I rise to state the Australian Democrats' unequivocal support for the Spirit of Anzac motion. It is a motion which acknowledges the deep significance of the events of the Gallipoli campaign and the sacrifices of those who fought and died there. It is a motion also which acknowledges the extent to which these events and those who took part in them have helped forge a spirit that is truly and uniquely Australian, and it is a motion which recognises the special significance of the seventy-fifth anniversary of these events and the positive cooperation and unanimity of spirit between the Governments of Australia and Turkey and the veterans of both sides in citing the courage of the many, on the one hand, and yet the futility of war on the other.

       In recent decades, as the ethos of peace begins to prevail over the ethos of war, Australians have had a degree of ambivalence about the `celebration' of Anzac Day. This to some degree reflects Australia's growing multiculturalism. In time this ambivalence will resolve itself. Such ambivalence was encapsulated in Eric Bogle's profoundly moving song The Band Played Waltzing Matilda. I draw honourable senators' attention to the excellent editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 24 April, which explored some of the ambivalence and contradictions inherent in our attitudes towards Anzac. But one thing we are not ambivalent about is that there is no doubt at all that Australians are as one in their indebtedness and gratitude to the heroes who were the Anzacs.
      </para>
      <para>
       As we watched the recent commemorative ceremonies at Gallipoli there was an apparent sense of the profound futility of war. However, sadly, one can notice a growing tendency in recent years to project military action as good and even as entertainment. It is ironic that tonight, in my own capital city of Sydney, I understand that a mock military battle is the major curtain-raiser to the State of Origin rugby league match. Many thinking Australians are alarmed by this emerging Ramboism. Despite these continuing contradictions and ambivalence in our attitude, I rise on this occasion to unequivocally reiterate the Australian Democrats' wholehearted support for the Spirit of Anzac motion.

        â€”As the shadow Minister for both veterans affairs and defence personnel, I am very proud to be associated with what will be a joint resolution of the Parliament. I was fortunate enough to travel in this pilgrimage. It occurs to me that it has some clear parallels with a much earlier pilgrimage recounted in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. We, too, were going to visit hallowed ground. We, too, a variety of people, were going in a caravan, of the twentieth century at least. We were going for a variety of purposes, and each had our own tale to tell. I would be grateful if Senator Evans does not allocate me a particular role in the caravan. It is perhaps in his mind to do so. Nevertheless, it was a very special thing. It is not given to many people to travel as we did in a very closely confined group for a common purpose for 10 days of close, very intimate association. There was a spiritual quality to the entire pilgrimage.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       One of the things that will remain in my memory was seeing those very old soldiers, those very old men of whom we are all so proud, becoming young men again on the arms of our young soldiers. Many of the young men who accompanied us on the Spirit of Anzac, the Qantas aircraft, were roughly in the age group of the young men who fought at Gallipoli. That, somehow, went very much to one's heart. It was much easier to imagine the cheerful young men with their slouch hats who went off to war. Most of them say now that they thought it was an adventure. They learnt very soon that it was not an adventure, but they went with a cheerful spirit and with pride, in that they believed that what they were doing was important for their king and country. It is not for us in this generation in any way to deride their pride.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is very good that today we are remembering their deeds. We are not glorifying war, as speakers have said previously. We are remembering with pride the achievements of those who survived and those who lie on the soil of Gallipoli. Far too many of our young men were left behind at Gallipoli. When I say that those involved in the pilgrimage went for different reasons, one of the consistent reasons that I found when I talked to the old men was that they went to see their mates. They went to pay tribute; they went to say goodbye. Many had never been back. I think many of them were very fearful of going back. The tension in our modern caravan increased the nearer we got to Gallipoli.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think that, on one hand, for many of us younger members of the pilgrimage, the ceremonies on Anzac Day were what we expected to be the highlight of the pilgrimage. On the other hand, for the old men, the day after Anzac Day was probably the day for which they were waiting most intensely. That was the day on which, as best they could, on walking sticks and with the aid of walking frames, many of them blind or nearly blind, they were taken by young soldiers and by the nurses who were their carers, to walk around the areas where they fought and where often they were wounded. Some of them found it very hard to work out the positions where they had spent so many months in 1915. The Turks have reafforested that part of the peninsula. The pine trees are growing up and the pine needles are falling and covering the trenches. It is now hard to see exactly what it was like. I visited there seven years ago. At the time there were no other people on the battlefields and the trenches were very clear. Sadly, many remnants of the battle were clear for all to see and collect. These days, that is disappearing.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the day that the old men visited their battlefields, they came back very late to dinner. They were very quiet. They were tired, but they had gone through a very emotional experience.
      </para>
      <para>
       There were four young Duntroon cadets in the catafalque party at Lone Pine. They were probably the ages of most of the young men who fought at Gallipoli. At the Lone Pine service, young Australians with packs on their backs had come across from Europe to take part and to see what it was all about. Some of them said, `We really came out of curiosity'. But once they, too, had walked the cliffs of Gallipoli, there was no curiosity any more, just an awed fascination and reverence, if you like, at the feats of their forefathers. They had not realised just what an awesome undertaking the battle at Gallipoli had been for everybody who took part in it. The young backpackers climbed with their heavy packs, but they were not climbing under fire; they did not have wet uniforms; they were not clutching rifles; they did not have the holly bush tearing at their uniforms and their skin. They did it under the noonday sun, at peace.
      </para>
      <para>
       This motion refers to the unsurpassed reputation of the Anzacs being an inspiration to us all. I know that those of us who travelled with the veterans have a very special memory. But I am heartened to realise what those young Australians who were there on the peninsula during the Anzac celebrations took away, too, by way of a recognition of the feats of their forebears. It is an inspiration to all Australians to endure, to be brave, to be resourceful, to emulate that irrepressible humour under pressure, to provide loyalty to each other. Those are things that we learnt from the Gallipoli men. But we also have to recognise that from it comes, and should come, a sense of national commitment, as is spelled out in this motion.
      </para>
      <para>
       The sacrifices emphasise the tragedy and futility of war. They emphasise the need to dedicate ourselves to the cause of peace. But I say also that they should remind us that we have soldiers, sailors and airmen and women today for whom we must give the sort of care and encouragement that we have given to our soldiers of other days. Our young men and women in the forces today have inherited this noble tradition. I am quite convinced that, if the need arose, they would fight for this country as their forebears have done. We must not in time of peace forget them, denigrate them and push them to one side. It is true that if we want peace, we will not achieve it by being seen by the world to not be prepared to protect our freedom and to fight for it. Therefore, my Party believes very strongly that peace will be achieved by being seen to be strong.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not wish to take up an undue amount of the Senate's time. Others before me have mentioned that there were many people involved in this pilgrimage. It was a quite massive undertaking. I would like to list some of those people to whom credit must be given. The Returned Services League had the original idea. The RSL and Mr Bill Hall, who put it to the Government, should be commended for the inspiration for the pilgrimage. I would like to pay tribute, too, to the journalists who travelled on that pilgrimage who would perhaps describe themselves as hard-bitten journalists and who, by the end of it, were proud to admit that they, too, cried at Lone Pine. I also pay tribute to the nurses who got so very little sleep throughout the trip, as they were so determined to ensure the health and well-being of their old veterans. Those nurses came from both the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Royal Australian Air Force. There were also doctors from the Department and from the Air Force. There was the band of young men who came from the Australian Army. There was the honour guard as well, and the signallers. The Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Army provided people for administration.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Royal Australian Navy should not be forgotten. At dawn on Anzac Day, as we arrived to take our places on Anzac Cove, we saw out at sea, standing off from the beaches, ships from the navies of Britain, Turkey and Australia lit up. That is how many men fighting at Gallipoli in 1915 would have seen them over those many months.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, we must not forget the tremendous cooperation of the Turkish Government. As the Minister has already said in another place, things did not always go without a hiccup, but we always felt that there was good will and a wish to make it go well.
      </para>
      <para>
       Just before we left Turkey we were taken by the Turkish Government to visit their military museum in Istanbul for a formal farewell. It was fascinating for those of us in the Australian party who were taken on a short tour to see that the Gallipoli campaign occupies a very tiny corner of that museum. Over the centuries the Dardanelles, and all the area covered by Turkey, have been the scene of many battles. To them, this was just a small part in their history. For us, of course, it was in many ways the founding of our nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In that it took us three-quarters of an hour to embark people on to a plane or to disembark them or to get them on or off a bus, and in the administration sense as well, it was an enormous undertaking. The Government is to be congratulated for being prepared to do this, partly for the veterans themselves and partly, I believe, for the nation.

       I say once again how much I appreciate having been a part of that pilgrimage. I am grateful for the opportunity that was given to me to represent the Opposition on the spirit of Anzac trip. I am sure it will be a memory I will never lose. I pay tribute to all those who played such an important part. Whether they were big cogs or small cogs, all played their part with an enthusiasm and a joy which is an integral part of the memories we will all carry away from the occasion.

        â€”I rise to add my few remarks to the words already said in support of this joint motion. The point I highlight is the perspective that I obtained as one who did not go to Gallipoli but who covered the pilgrimage, if that is what it is to be called now, essentially from what the media told me in this country.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I make it clear that in no way are my remarks meant to denigrate or take away from the courage and commitment of our young men-or, indeed, those now very old men who returned to Gallipoli. The impression I got from watching the coverage of this Anzac return was that women were not really a significant part of the Gallipoli symbol at all. On a number of occasions the various media indicated that this might indeed become something of a national symbol for Australia, but I do not believe that we can properly have a national symbol if it is not able to speak to or be inclusive of all the people of this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       In particular, I think the people of Australia need to be reminded of the contribution of women at the Gallipoli campaign and in our two world wars. While we did have one very elderly Army nurse, Kathleen Avery from South Australia, who went on that pilgrimage, I believe there was only one small reference to her, apart from general photographs. The whole story of the Army nurses in the First World War was something that I knew little about until I actually sought that information from the library via the official war history of the First World War, although I have known from the stories that have been told that women did make a contribution over there as well as here.
      </para>
      <para>
       Something like 2,800 women enlisted as army nurses in the First World War and more than 2,100 of those women embarked on overseas duty. In addition, more than 120 women volunteered to work in a variety of ways, principally in nursing and caring for the wounded in England. Of those women who enlisted to serve overseas, 21 died in service overseas. It is, I suppose, a matter of remarkable tragedy that the causes of their deaths were actually cholera, pneumonia and influenza, but I suppose one could say at least that they were not shot to death on the battlefield.
      </para>
      <para>
       The women did have a special role. The challenge that particularly those nurses waiting on the hospital ships off the coast of Gallipoli had to deal with is not something we care to think of. We have heard told the excitement of many young men who thought this was a great adventure; they would go to the other side of the world and take their place in such an adventure. But for those women, let alone those many men, waiting on those hospital ships, what they saw was not a celebration, not a wonderful adventure, but the smashed and broken bodies of those soldiers who survived to be nursed back to some kind of health and the many broken minds of people who suffered shell shock.
      </para>
      <para>
       The sorts of down sides of war that I think we need not only never to forget but also to acknowledge are that so many Australian women had to bear both the immediate effects and the longer term effects as those men returned to this country permanently disabled. Of course I am glad that we acknowledge the contribution of support for people with such disabilities, but I do not think we should overlook the immediacy of those disabilities, that pain and anguish of the women who were nursing those people there and, of course, the families who welcomed or accepted back their broken and wounded men.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other group of women very often forgotten in Australia are those women who maintained the effort during the war and who have kept the tradition alive in their own families and at Anzac ceremonies ever since. Those women very often finished up deprived of fathers, sons and husbands. Many, many thousands of widows in this country can relate just what price they paid in terms of the Anzac events, and I do not believe we should overlook them. They are never seen as a significant part of the war or as heroes of the day but, of course, they are heroes in a very particular way. If we are talking about the powerful sense of Australian national identity that emerges from Anzac, I do believe it is important that we never forget to define the contribution of those families and, in particular, those women who gave up their men and bore the consequences of that giving up of their men through many years of loss, difficulty and, certainly in many cases, poverty.
      </para>
      <para>
       A number of honourable senators have said here that this is never to be seen as a celebration of war. I think we are all utterly agreed on that. It is not seen that way. It is a monument to peace and clearly a recognition of the importance of pursuing peace. In some ways, if we focus forever on the achievements of the battlefield, we can be in danger of celebrating death, and in drawing attention to the contribution of women I suggest that we never forget to celebrate life. It was those women who begat those men who then grew up to give their lives in the way they did, or who were at least injured and made their contribution through suffering. I think that if we are looking at this as a national symbol we must increase or extend the meanings that that symbol embraces and make sure that it is inclusive of the contributions of all peoples from this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wonder, too, what Anzac Day as a national symbol would say to Aboriginal people. Certainly I think this country is still slow to acknowledge the contribution of many Aboriginal men in the armed forces at wartime. Of course, the words I used about the womenfolk apply equally to Aboriginal women in the way that they have suffered the loss of their menfolk.
      </para>
      <para>
       If this is a national symbol, we have to see in what way it speaks to or has messages for people who live in this country but were not born here. In some ways, I suppose the alienation, the loneliness, the feeling of despair perhaps when one is on foreign shores far away from family and home and recognised traditions, may in fact be a metaphor that speaks immediately to people of non-English speaking backgrounds, to the many refugees and migrants who come to this country. In some way, I find that piece of symbolism easier to cope with than the way in which the celebration of Anzac Day acknowledges the great contribution of Australian women.

        â€”I support the motion moved by Senator Button, which is a most important one. I was a member of the parliamentary delegation which attended the very moving services on the Gallipoli Peninsula, particularly the dawn service at Anzac Cove and later the Australian national memorial at Lone Pine. At Lone Pine 2,000 young Australians were killed, for no territorial advantage, no military advantage at all. Very few of them have graves; there was no room or time to bury people at Gallipoli. They were not buried until 1919 and the memorials are memorials of names, they are not graves. The people killed on Gallipoli have no known graves.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       We got a deeply moving impression of what it must have been like being a young Australian there. The Anzacs landed on the wrong beach, a mile from where they were supposed to land, in country that might have been possible to seize in a surprise operation, but against opposition it was impossible for either side-and both sides tried desperately-to advance more than a few yards at a time at the cost of impossible casualties.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gallipoli was a military disaster, and we are not celebrating anything, either a war or a military disaster; we are looking at the sacrifices made by young Australians to achieve what was held to be a national objective and the spirit of the people who did it. Someone said to one of the old Diggers that it was hoped he was not finding it too much of a strain. He replied, `Well, I am 95, I am going to die soon; if I die here, at least I will be with me mates'. That represents a spirit which has lasted 75 years after the event and which at the time made a deep impression on all who came into contact with the Australian troops. Their size, their confidence and their courage made an indelible impression on everyone associated with them.
      </para>
      <para>
       The casualties were very severe. In that campaign 5,582 Australians were killed, 2,012 died of wounds, 1,115 died of disease, 17,904 were wounded. The Australians, by the way, contrary to the impression some people give, did not make the predominant military contribution to the campaign. The British had twice the number killed. The French had more. But what I think is extraordinary is that, despite the fact that 5,000 Australians were killed, only 11 of our people were taken prisoner. Other countries had the ordinary proportion. Seven thousand British were taken prisoner and several thousand French, but only 11 Australians. That gives credibility to a remark that was made by an Englishman, a poet laureate, who was present in the campaign, John Masefield. We want to remember this because it shows the impression the Australians made the first time that they were in an awful situation, really the first time Australians had burst on the world scene. John Masefield, of the Australians involved in the campaign, said:

       the sacrifices . . . emphasises the tragedy and futility of war and the need to re-dedicate ourselves to the cause of world peace.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think that is a very important sentiment. I also think we owe to the elderly veterans who went to Gallipoli for the seventy-fifth anniversary a huge amount of respect. But we also owe them an apology that they were put through the needless torture and that so many of their mates died on those foreign shores so far from home. We also owe a huge apology to the veterans of all other wars in which Australians have died. That was a sentiment that I felt a couple of years ago when the Vietnam veterans had their return parade 20 years after the event. Instead of saying, `You beaut, chaps', we should have been saying, `We are deeply sorry that you had to go through that agony'. In fact they did not have to go through it at all and that is the real tragedy of Australia's involvement in all wars thus far in our history.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a great shame that the myth of the Anzacs continues because the events at Gallipoli are seen somehow as being the birth of our nation. This is the kind of nonsense that keeps being brought forward and that we had for days on end in the media. If that is the birth of our nation I think it is a very sorry nation indeed that is born out of the suffering and slaughter of its young men on foreign soil for no good reason. Why were the Anzac or Australian troops there? This question has not been asked because there is no really good answer to it. We were there because the British Government asked us to be there, and the Australian Government said yes, as it has said subsequently in the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War and in the Vietnam War. Other countries have dictated our foreign policy and our defence policies and we have let young Australians be slaughtered.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is why I think we owe a huge national apology to any service man or woman who has gone overseas to fight in other nation's wars. I do not think that that will ever happen again. I do not think that Australians will ever let that happen again. I sincerely hope not. I think it is rather strange that two very important days in the Australian national calendar commemorate very bizarre affairs. One is the commemoration on 25 April of the butchery of so many of our young men on foreign soil and the other event where the nation seems to come together is a horse race on the first Tuesday in November each year. These are very strange notions of nationhood.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think our sense of national commitment and national pride should spring from other sources, from our ability to live together to create a vibrant and sharing community where we are at peace domestically at home with each other and with our neighbours, with an equitable share of the wonderful resources this country has to offer. We have so much to offer yet we cling to the myth that the nation was born on a foreign battlefield where so many of our young men bravely died-I acknowledge that, of course-for a cause that was not relevant to Australia. They should never have been there. That is the tragedy of it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to support some of Senator Crowley's remarks on the omission of women from the whole scene but add to her remarks that we should recognise not only the participation of women as volunteers or conscripts but also the other darker side of the picture, and that is of the millions of unacknowledged victims of war right through the ages and right around the globe; that is, millions of women and children who have suffered the worst excesses of war-pillage, rape, torture and death. As Senator Crowley was speaking I was reminded of the origins of Mother's Day, and it is quite appropriate that I mention this now because Mother's Day is this Sunday. The first Mother's Day was commemorated in 1888 in the United States when a poet there by the name of Julira Howe wrote a poem calling on women. She was very distressed about the Franco-Prussian war and about the American War of Independence which had recently claimed the lives of thousands of young men and women, mostly men, there. She wrote a poem calling for women to refuse to bear children to be used as mere cannon fodder. She said:
      </para>
      <para>
       We do not give birth so that our children can kill other women's children.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is very important that we acknowledge that aspect also, the unacknowledged victims-heroines perhaps-of war situations. That aspect should not be omitted. That element is omitted from the Anzac tradition or this myth that we have built up about Anzac. I think that is something we should correct.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I said, I do not want to denigrate the sacrifices that these men made when they were younger, and I am very glad that the veterans went and returned safely back to Australia, but I do think we must ask the question: What on earth were they doing there in the first place? We ought to really challenge the decision-making processes of our Government, which continue to this day to be subservient to the wishes of other nations. We are not truly independent. Perhaps Australia will be really independent by the year 2001, the centenary of the founding of the Commonwealth of Australia. By then we might have learned how to be truly independent, to stand on our own two feet and to take our place in the world in conjunction with peace building in our region. That is our role. We have a tremendous opportunity in Australia, and I think we have blown it on so many occasions by being subservient. I think that the continuation of the Anzac myth continues to foster the myth that this was somehow a glorious day in Australia's history. There was nothing glorious about the butchery of so many young men. To them we owe our great and sincere apology.

        â€”Anzac Day commemorations have been known to me since I was a child, but I cannot say that I understood the issues as clearly as I do now. My travelling to Gallipoli with the delegation for Anzac Day gave it a new meaning for me and provided a better understanding in relation to the events of the campaign. I would like to thank the Government and the people of Australia for the opportunity of being a member of that delegation.

       I do not believe that any thinking person would not agree with what Senator Hamer said. For instance, it was a terrible strategic decision and it was a disaster to send people to Gallipoli. It cost the lives of so many people who were so invaluable to this country and who should have been enhancing the future of Australia instead of losing their lives at Gallipoli.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, quite separate from that is the question of those people who went over there without understanding the reasons for the war and not questioning what they would do when they got there. Quite apart from that is the question of how they behaved and the bravery they showed, the mateship, and the good humour. Of course, descriptions of those events over many months contain a lot of humorous stories within the framework of so much horror and sadness. I certainly received a better understanding of the way in which the Turks courageously defended their homeland. I suppose that if somebody came from a far away place and looked at the conflict, he might look favourably upon the Turks, because we had to go a long way to get into that dust-up. One of the war historians said that it was probably the last conflict and the last battle that could be considered to have been fought under the terms of chivalry. I think that was highlighted by the fact that when there were so many dead on the battlefield and an armistice was declared, there was mutual respect. Both the Turkish and Anzac troops exchanged souvenirs and even exchanged commodities which the other did not have. Also, at the end of the conflict, there was no lasting hatred and no lasting dislike of each other.
      </para>
      <para>
       I pay tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for the way in which he delivered his speech, and I record an appreciation of the content of that speech. He said some of the things that Senator Vallentine has said: we were not there to glorify war but, rather, to remember the courage that was shown by those people in that conflict. Based on that experience and other experiences throughout the history of the world, we should maintain a determination that we never again get into the position of conflict where so many lives are lost. We must continue to work for world peace. We should look at the question of mutual assistance between Turkey and Australia and, of course, with other countries. I agree with a lot of what Senator Vallentine said about the abhorrence of war. However, I choose to raise that question at another time. I do not believe, either, that volunteers will ever rush to the flag as they did in those days without an understanding of what the conflict was about. I believe that people read too much to do that these days and they understand the world situation and the arguments between nations.
      </para>
      <para>
       In closing, I would also like to thank the Turkish Government for the way in which it received our delegation and all those people from Australia, the sort of assistance it gave to us and the friendship it generously extended. I am certainly looking forward to returning to Turkey as a country in which I felt at home. I was also struck by the honesty of those people with whom I had dealings, down to the man in the street selling postcards, and also taxi drivers. I wish them all the best in building their nation, as they strive to do, as I dedicate myself and express a determination to build this nation.

       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President: I seek leave to make a Ministerial statement on a review which the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has commenced of the Migration Legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable Senators will be aware of the far reaching changes which were introduced in 1989 into the regime governing our migration administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        After the Parliament enacted the Migration Legislation Amendment Act in June 1989, Regulations were made on 19 December 1989, as required under that Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Large sections of the new Act and Regulations are now being administered smoothly. The Government, however, has heard a good deal of criticism of the operation of parts of the new system not least from the last Parliament's own Committee-the Joint Select Committee set up by resolution moved by my predecessor on 31 May 1989. Accordingly, the Government has decided to act on a number of the criticisms and concerns voiced. The Minister intends to make some changes to the Regulations immediately, and set up a structured process of Parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation to examine further necessary changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should first, however, provide a short overview of the character and direction of the changes to the Migration Act 1958. In amending the Act, the Minister's predecessor laid the basis for quite significant and far reaching changes of approach to migration administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prior to these changes, decision making under the Act had largely been a matter of administrative discretion. Accordingly, there was a lack of uniformity and consistency in decision making. Policies and guidance were scattered across a variety of Departmental handbooks. Instructions were frequently expressed only in broad terms and, in some instances, had essentially evolved over time without being articulated in detail anywhere. This meant that individuals, and their representatives, as well as departmental decision makers, had no coherent body of rules to consult to implement the Government's policy requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister, because decision making powers were vested in him, and policy was a matter of discretion, was placed in the unenviable position of being a general avenue of appeal on the merits in respect of any decision made by any officer of the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was also increasing evidence that illegal entrants and others were using the avenues provided by policy loopholes and procedural complexities to challenge decisions quite properly using the emerging body of administrative law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The introduction of so large a body of Regulations under the amended legislation in a much compressed time frame compared to what was originally intended was required by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act. This resulted in a lack of clarity, and, in a number of cases, unintended consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Minister's predecessor made it clear on a number of occasions that it would be necessary continually to monitor the regulations and amend them as problems emerged. The Minister's predecessor made a number of changes prior to his leaving the portfolio and the changes the Minister is making are part of that ongoing process.
       </para>
       <para>
        Underlying the Government's approach to any review of the legislative framework are our basic objectives of maintaining Government authority over our non-discriminatory migration program and other entry of people into Australia; continuing to ensure that its migration administration has effective means for minimising the potential for abuse of the system by illegal entrants; and retaining the power, through its control systems (including the discretions available to the Minister) to respond sensitively and with compassion when individual cases arise that require special consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Control over the migration program and entry generally is exercised through the codification of policies into regulation so that they are fixed in law. Codification means that policies are clearly specified in criteria and people are clear on their entitlements and obligations. This narrows the range of discretions needed to make decisions. The correlative of this meant that policies had to be spelt out in fine detail. Further, the Department has to have in place proper administrative procedures consistent with the principles of administrative law and these procedures in turn must also be reflected in the regulations. Because of the scope and complexity of migration policies and procedures, this in turn meant a very extensive body of Regulations. To some extent the sheer volume of the Regulations has given rise to some of the criticisms of complexity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second objective of minimising abuse of the system by illegal entrants has also been largely attained by the codification process. By this means it has proved possible to define clearly the entitlements we are prepared to allow for particular groups of illegal entrants, rather than have broad discretionary criteria for illegal entrants as a group. It is quite clear that we must distinguish between those people who become illegal quite innocently and unintentionally through ignorance of proper procedures, and those who exploit every loophole in immigration policies to stay on in Australia even though they have no right to do so. This is by no means easy as considerable ingenuity is directed towards finding loopholes which must then be plugged. And, of course, the Regulations become increasingly complex as these loopholes are plugged.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another related objective is to ensure that those who jump the queue are not advantaged to the detriment of those whose family sponsor their coming to Australia in accord with proper procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other main objectives was that of removing from the Minister the almost intolerable burden of being a court of appeal for all the adverse decisions made by Departmental officers. The Minister sees his role as principally being responsible for setting and correcting the direction of policy. He has powers to deal with the individual case at the primary decision level, but there he is bound by the Regulations. Without going into detail, the Minister also has powers under sections 115 and 137 of the Migration Act to set aside decisions after each review stage. Under these sections he is not bound by the criteria established by the Regulations and has a power to make any decision more favourable to the applicant that he judges to be in the public interest. This is a discretionary power and he is under no obligation to use it. However, the Minister is restricted in the exercise of the power in that the person seeking his intervention must have a review right. The Minister must also report to Parliament if he makes such a decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might also emphasise that the Minister has no intention of intervening under his review powers unless there is serious reason. That is, he shall not be setting aside decisions reached in accord with the criteria established by the Regulations unless he is convinced that there is a gap in policy, that the refusal is an unintended consequences of the Regulations or that an individual case requires special consideration. In these circumstances the Minister shall move to amend the Regulations as necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a considerable amount of criticism of the Regulations on the grounds that they are inflexible, harsh and overly complex. Some of the criticisms raise valid concerns and I shall indicate later how the Minister intends to deal with these. But it is worth noting at the outset that the Regulations work reasonably well in by far the great majority of cases and have caused few problems. The great bulk of the problems have emerged in two general areas. First, people whose circumstances fall outside policy and who were previously handled on an ad hoc discretionary basis. Second, people who are illegally in Australia and who either simply do not wish to leave when they should, or who argue that there is good reason for staying on after they should have left. When numbers of people entering Australia were significantly smaller than they are now, we as a community could accept dealing with these problems by waiving policy on an ad hoc basis. Now, however, the numbers are becoming so large that more formal measures need to be in place to maintain the integrity of the program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister will be approaching the question of changing the legislation in a 3-phase approach. The first phase incorporates those changes where a response is needed immediately, or where further consultation is not needed. These changes are of some significance. The phase will also include a number of technical changes which have only minor policy or procedural implications but which will improve the working of the Regulations and clarify some of the criteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister will also ensure in making changes in the first phase, that provision is made such that people who may have applied after 18 December, but before these changes come into place, are not disadvantaged by any changes relating to their application.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first phase will, in particular, provide greater access to review rights under the transitional arrangements. That is, the Minister accepts that it is quite inequitable to leave people without a review right. The Minister is therefore going to reinstate the Immigration Review Panel to provide a review channel for people who were here before 19 December 1989, had lodged an application before that date and had no review avenue in the event of an adverse decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister also intends in the first place to give effect to some recommendations of the Administrative Review Council in relation to the Minister's powers to substitute a decision more favourable to the applicant at the review stage. As the legislation is presently formed some applicants could be disadvantaged if the Minister were to intervene on his own initiative at the internal review stage and remove from the applicant any review of the internal review decision by the Immigration Review Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, I foreshadow a Bill to amend the Migration Act to ensure that the Minister's discretion to make a decision after the first tier can only be exercised at the request of the applicant and where the Minister is prepared to make a decision agreeable to the applicant. The Bill will maintain the situation that the Minister has no duty to exercise that discretion when requested. The Government will also move to amend the legislation to allow the applicant to appeal to the Immigration Review Tribunal on the internal review decision where the Minister does not intervene.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister will also overcome an anomalous situation with regard to review fees. Where an applicant has appealed to the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Minister has exercised his discretion in favour of the applicant, the applicant will be refunded any fee paid to the Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will also be moving quickly to establish a Joint Committee on Migration Regulations and will seek to ensure that the terms of reference of that Committee facilitate wide consultation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister also now intends that he should report every six months to Parliament on any intervention at any decision-making stage in respect of applications for visas and entry permits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister's reporting will cover an analysis and cataloguing of cases determined by him and will contain his conclusions about possible needs to amend existing regulations or make new regulations. By reporting regularly in this way the proposed Joint Committee will be provided with an opportunity to scrutinise any decisions the Minister has taken and to report to him and the Parliament on the appropriateness of any legislative or regulatory amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister's reporting will also include Immigration Review Tribunal comments about the impact of the Regulations in the light of the cases that come before them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the Minister will reduce the complexity of the application procedures by collapsing the current 97 entry permit classes down to a possible 7; provide changes to relax certain deadlines; provide for the waiver of appeal fees in hardship cases; eliminate the requirement for preferential family applicants for permanent residence in compassionate circumstances recognised in the Regulations, to leave Australia simply to lodge applications in situations where this requirement is unnecessarily harsh and arbitrary; and provide discretion for relaxing the provisions barring the return to Australia of illegal entrants, other than deportees on criminal or security grounds, so as to recognise compelling compassionate circumstances. These changes will meet a number of the more pressing problems which have emerged.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second and third phases will deal with changes which require more time to decide. The Minister intends in the process of finalising these to pursue a structured process of Parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation. The proposed Joint Committee will play a central role in this process.
       </para>
       <para>
        By this consultation process the Minister hopes to avoid the problems which emerged because of the tight deadlines within which the Regulations had to be introduced. In particular, the Minister wishes to ensure that Departmental manuals setting out the Regulations and procedures are in place when the Regulations are changed, and that officers of the Department are given adequate time to digest the changes and be trained in any new procedures which may result.
       </para>
       <para>
        One area the Minister is not addressing in the first phase is the general area of asylum and the special case of the long-term future of PRC nationals in Australia. This area is to be the subject of further consideration by Government. The Minister shall, however, be giving early consideration to humanitarian entry criteria and, in particular, the barriers to the entry of persons who have a right of settlement in third countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the second phase the Minister shall be examining such issues as the health criteria; restrictions on the grant of permanent residence to visitors who marry Australian citizens; and the question of tightening criteria for testing the genuineness of marriage; clarifying the entitlements of illegal entrants to remaining in Australia; and restrictions on temporary resident permit holders having access to permanent residence. But he will be looking at these issues in a measured fashion, and will not be rushing into quick ad hoc solutions to meet the exigencies of particular cases. The Minister is also certain that other issues will emerge as public consultations are carried out. He hopes to have these changes in place beginning in August and to have completed this phase by December.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final phase relates to a general redrafting of the Regulations. The Government accepts that the Regulations could be made less difficult to understand. There are two aspects to this: some of the problems stem from Departmental procedures and the Minister is taking steps to change these in the first two stages of his review. The other aspect stems from language and structure. The Minister will shortly be talking to the Attorney-General about undertaking this exercise as matter of priority. It will, however, probably take about 12 months to achieve this.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the time available to the Minister it was not possible to establish with complete confidence as to which changes in the Regulations that I am foreshadowing today will require changes in the Migration Act itself. This matter is being examined as a matter of priority. The timetable that I have outlined may need to be varied to allow for the processes of any necessary amendment of the Act to take place.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister is confident that by adopting this structured approach to amending the migration legislation we will have a legal regime in place which, on the one hand, will meet the reasonable needs of people seeking to come to or remain in Australia, along with the rights of Australian sponsors. On the other hand, we will continue to meet the legitimate concerns of the Australian community that the numbers of people coming either to stay permanently or temporarily are consistent with the interests of the Australian community.

        This report is clear evidence that the Government has failed to administer the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, is failing to administer immigration programs and has failed to complete its own reforms of the immigration programs. It is no surprise to this chamber that, for seven years now, and with increasing urgency since the report two years ago of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, there is a failure on the Government's part to bring any competent degree of public confidence into Australia's immigration program.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report is also a direct illustration of the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself. I say this because, following the election, we saw the Prime Minister sack his fifth Minister for immigration, Senator Robert Ray. Along with that, he has sacked, or forced to resign, the head of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and has put into his place one of his own Prime Minister and Cabinet Assistant Secretaries, Mr Conybeare. There has been pressure on other senior public servants in the Department to leave their positions and to leave the Department. One very senior member of the Department, apart from the Secretary, has now left the Department, and there has been an attempt to force some others to go, but they have not succumbed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a great concern, detected by the Public Service itself, over the amendments to the Public Service Act which Mr Dawkins moved in 1983 which gave this Government the powers, arguably, to take these actions. Yet, at the time when that Act was debated and adopted in this Parliament, such exercise of powers was not contemplated and certainly was not foreshadowed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Throughout all of these dramatic events there has been no explanation by the Prime Minister. The statement that was put down here today-and in the other place by the new Minister, Mr Hand-makes no reference whatsoever to these dramatic events. Whilst the statement actually admits failure to administer the Department, failure to administer the immigration program and especially failure to have predicted the complexity and inadequacies of the regulation promulgating process, it makes no reference to these dramatic events. I believe that this chamber deserves a full explanation for the actions of the Prime Minister in these regards.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is speculated that the reason for the Prime Minister's dramatic actions is entirely a consequence of the regulation process getting out of hand-that is, the bungle that emerged following 19 December 1989 in Senator Robert Ray's administration of the promulgation of regulations under the Act. This is a puzzle, given the clear statement made by the Prime Minister on 3 April during the election campaign, when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not claim that our new regulations are yet perfect. Robert-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is the Minister, Senator Ray-
       </para>
       <para>
        has made clear that some of the criticism has been fair. But he has also said, and I agree totally, that clearly defined and publicly available rules for decision-making will introduce more certainly, consistency, and fairness to the operation of migration policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        From a total reversal of the Prime Minister's statement during the election campaign it is surmised that, for the want of adequate process in developing the regulations and because of the confusion in this area, he has held not only the Minister responsible and sacked him, but also the head of the Department-that is, Mr Ron Brown-and sacked him.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is well known to this chamber that Mr Brown is no ordinary head of a department. He is a most competent person and a very experienced public servant who brought enormous assets to his job as the head of the immigration department. Prior to that he was the executive officer of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). He had the full support not only of the SBS board in its early stages of development, but also of ethnic community leaders and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, and of all sides of discussion of immigration and ethnic affairs matters in heading that statutory authority. Prior to that he had very senior jobs in the Department of Social Security. In fact, I first met and grew to be very fond of Ron Brown when he was the director of the Social Security Department in my State of South Australia. As a new senator 12 years ago I had an office in the same building at No. 1 North Terrace in Adelaide.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no explanation why this good man-free of any public controversy, free of any criticism prior to his spontaneous sacking by the Prime Minister-has gone. I do not believe that it is because he failed to implement the policy of his Minister. I believe he implemented it perhaps too well.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a grave injustice that a senior public servant, or indeed any person, can be sacked so contemptuously by Mr Hawke and this Labor Government. Labor thinks that it can be proud and arrogant immediately after winning an election, even if so narrowly, and take such actions. What in fact it shows is that the Labor Government-and this is again reinforced by the statement put down by the Minister today-is on the back foot because it failed to win votes from the general public on immigration matters, and it failed to win support from ethnic community leaders; it had somewhat taken them for granted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Labor did not allow public consultation in this massive amendment to the immigration legislation, and in the enormous tomes of new regulations that were to be the foundation for the operation of the immigration program. The ethnic leaders were not consulted at all. They started to put pressure upon the Prime Minister during the election campaign, and he realised that he had made grave errors in the way in which, over the last 18 months, the Labor Government had gone about immigration and ethnic affairs policy. So the Prime Minister looked around for a scapegoat. As a signal particularly to ethnic community leaders, whose votes he wanted to buy, he sacked Senator Robert Ray, who over the last 12 months had only too carefully been fulfilling and putting into place the policy that Cabinet had endorsed. Mr Brown was sacked as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put this Government on notice that the Opposition will watch most carefully every aspect of the Government's relations with not only ethnic community leaders but all Australians in so far as there are changes in policy during the life of this Parliament. Mr Hand, the new Minister, is also on notice. He has been moved from an area where he failed to gain public support-that is, as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-an area of enormous controversy during the past Parliament. There was unnecessary controversy because he stirred up a civil war over the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposal. That was evident in the debate in this chamber during the months and months of questions that were directed to Senator Tate on the other side of the chamber. That failure on Mr Hand's part as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs must not be repeated in this area of immigration and ethnic affairs. There must be public consultation, there must be an open approach and there must be an early set of explanations as to why the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, has made these dramatic decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there is any evidence of the Hawke Labor Government changing immigration policy just to buy the votes of some ethnic community leaders-and against the national interests of Australia-there will be very sharp criticism not only from the Opposition but from the entire Australian public. I remind the Senate that there have now been six Ministers for immigration during the Hawke Government period: Stewart West lasted 1 3/4 years; Chris Hurford, 2 1/4 years; Mick Young, nearly one year; Clyde Holding, who was seen to have failed in his job, only half a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the dramatic point when the FitzGerald report was before us and when there was an unprecedented lack of public confidence in immigration, a desperate measure was taken by this Government to appoint Senator Robert Ray, a new Minister with authority and credibility, to come in and act in the national interest with a whole new set of policies, to tidy up the Act, to set up thousands of new regulations, to codify the immigration program, and to ensure that the criticisms that the Opposition had been making for five years were positively responded to.
       </para>
       <para>
        He did his best, but he did not do it very well. Instead of acknowledging those deficits only, the Prime Minister has gone much further and wanted to wipe clear the slate of all those who tried to put the Senator Robert Ray and Ron Brown period of immigration and administration into place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Hand is the sixth Minister. The others have all come in for enormous criticism in this Parliament and Mr Hand will have to lift his game and start with careful explanations of these activities of the Prime Minister if he is going to win any public credibility or attention in this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have referred to the dismay that has gone through the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Hundreds of public servants in senior positions, even overseas, argue that Mr Brown adequately addressed the agenda set by Cabinet. As they see it, he sharpened the economic focus of the Department. As they see it, he did the bidding of his Minister, Senator Robert Ray. What kind of security do you think they feel now when a new Minister has come on board? They will have to give formal allegiance to the policy that may be developed in the coming months, but there is a grave uncertainty and insecurity that has been introduced into immigration, even within the Department itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that the statement made today seeks to address some of the massive problems related to the regulation process and I will come to those in due course. I wish to remind the Senate that in the very first week that Senator Ray was appointed, in an article in the Age newspaper I commended the appointment and said that the Prime Minister had seemed to accept the failure and the enormous low in immigration under Minister Holding and that it was time to make a fresh start. I said the ball was at Senator Ray's feet. I said:
       </para>
       <para>
        He has, quite genuinely, received good wishes from all sides in Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        But if he fails to renew public confidence in immigration, that same Parliament will be unforgiving. For the sake of all Australians, his task is to turn away from the Hawke Government's five years of failure.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Parliament, in the light of the statement that is before us today, should be unforgiving. Senator Ray was not given full cooperation to achieve the task that he had set out for himself and now even those achievements have been put in jeopardy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In some ways it all began with the bombshell of the FitzGerald report in mid 1988. This soundly weighed the immigration policy of the Government and found it entirely wanting. In 73 recommendations it set out the way to recover public confidence in immigration. A few months later the Government's response to the FitzGerald report, which had been warmly received by the Opposition, appeared and was totally inadequate. To the extent that there was any approaching of the FitzGerald report's recommendations it was the activity of a new and authoritative Minister, Senator Ray. Even that now is in jeopardy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was on the basis that certain assurances were given and certain amendments achieved that the Opposition agreed to the massive change in immigration law in mid 1989. But despite the amendments that we were able to gain to that immigration Act, there has not been the follow-through in the regulations that were then formulated and which guide the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hold in my hand two reports, both of which are confidential. One is the first report to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations given to him on 28 November last year. The other is the second report also given to the Minister on 12 December last year. Even though we were a joint select committee of this Parliament we have not been free to bring the reports to the Parliament. So as a member of that Select Committee I can give only some general description of these two reports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reports are full of specific recommendations to meet the inadequacies of the draft regulations that were to be promulgated on 19 December last. I remind the Senate that was a few days before this Senate rose, before this Parliament finished its sitting prior to this week. The statement put down today by the Minister for Immigration does go some way to responding to the specific recommendations in those two reports, but the public does not know what were in the reports and this Parliament does not know.
       </para>
       <para>
        A great deal of effort was put in by the Committee; some 25 meetings were spread out over six weeks. Senator Jenkins is in the chamber; as another member of the Committee she is very familiar with the enormous effort that went into the formulation of those reports. We found that the draft regulations, had they been promulgated as intended by the Government, would have been an unmitigated disaster for this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Prime Minister is trying to explain his dramatic decisions following the election as a positive response to the Opposition's criticisms as set out, for example, by some of us in these two reports, he may be feigning to take up the constructive measures that we have proposed to rescue the immigration program of Australia. But I do not believe that that is the entire explanation of the dramatic changes. I believe that the press has got a large degree of this right and so have those with an interest in immigration in this country who have been receiving rumours that the Labor Government under Prime Minister Hawke and Minister Hand is seeking to go much further away from the recommendations of the FitzGerald report. They are wanting to go back to open vote buying through family reunion programs, even though they know in their minds and hearts that it is not in the national interests of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those such as Senator Walsh or Senator Robert Ray who argue outside or inside Cabinet that this is not responsible of the present Labor Government need to be listened to. If there is a failure on the part of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Minister, Mr Hand, to respond to those responsible warnings, it will come to light and there will be much to be paid with regard to debate and criticism in this chamber.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me focus for a moment on yesterday's opening speech by the Governor-General in the opening of Parliament. On page 10 of the speech there are some four paragraphs that relate to immigration and ethnic affairs. These paragraphs are cliched. They sound innocuous and they paper over the issues that I referred to at the outset of my speech. If this was the only knowledge that the public had of the state of immigration in this country, they would go off to sleep-as many honourable senators appeared to be doing, especially on the Government side, while the Governor-General was giving his speech. It talks about a whole set of principles which are accepted on all sides in this Parliament. It does not refer at all to the issues such as were raised by Senator Walsh and reported widely in the press even as recently as yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Walsh is not only speaking out on economic issues but also he is speaking out on the question of immigration, and half the Labor Party want to shut him up-including Mr Hand and the Prime Minister. But on the other hand, those from the Centre Left, including the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, or even those of the Left, such as the honourable member for Cunningham, Mr West-and, for all I know, Senator Cook and Senator Tate, who are sitting here in the chamber-want to listen carefully to what their esteemed colleague wants to be saying because, frankly, Senator Walsh has been in the Cabinet for the last seven years, he has observed the way decisions have been made and he is alert to the inadequacy of these dramatic decisions by the Prime Minister and the way in which Mr Hand has been appointed and other changes have been made to the Department and to policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Walsh has blown the whistle on the Hawke Labor Government on immigration. Senator Walsh has said that immigration decisions by this Government are in disarray. We hear of the changes related to vote buying by Labor instead of actions being taken in the national interest, and that seems to be one of a number of the decisions of the Labor Government about which Senator Walsh is rightly critical.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have not time to refer to the Opposition's contribution to the regulation review through the select committee. I note, however, that there was no public consultation during that review. There were some select submissions made, but all on a confidential basis. There was a compressed time of only six weeks to consider the draft regulations. There were serious deficiencies about review, about the exercising of compassion, and about a whole range of particular issues related to visas. The Opposition members on that select committee were Mr Ruddock, the shadow Minister; Mrs Sullivan; Mr Cobb; and me. In mid-December we urged the Minister to defer the legislation and we said we would facilitate amendments concerning the operation of the legislation so that the whole mess could be put right during January, February and March, if necessary, before the new Act came into effect. But he did not take up our genuine offer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to refer now in particular to some pages of the Minister's statement. The preamble is very brief. It does not even mention the FitzGerald report. It does not mention the Opposition's insistence on crucial amendments to the primary Act, amended in June last year. It does not mention the actual reports of the parliamentary committee. However, it does give the three principal reasons why the legislation was reformulated. On page 2 of the statement there is an admission of confusion and failure. In the second paragraph there are these words:
       </para>
       <para>
        This resulted in a lack of clarity-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is a euphemism by Minister Hand for confusion-
       </para>
       <para>
        and, in a number of cases, unintended consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is his best euphemism for failure. The Minister sets out on that page some basic objectives of the immigration program under his superintendence, and certainly there is no controversy about those basic objectives on any side of the Parliament. On page 3 he refers to the ministerial review and I note that in the fifth paragraph he sets out a new set of criteria for ministerial intervention in immigration decisions. He talks about a serious reason being required, quite rightly, but then refers to `a gap in policy', `unintended consequence' and `special consideration'. These three phrases are new; they are therefore very important in determining those matters which the Minister will bring to this Parliament in the six-monthly reports which he has announced.
       </para>
       <para>
        On pages 4 and 5 the Minister talks about the first phase of decisions to change the present immigration system and to overcome the mess. Every one of those changes, those phase one announcements, whether it concerns the review procedure, the reestablishment of a joint parliamentary committee, the necessity for the Minister to report regularly to Parliament and the content of those reports, or particular administrative changes, is responding to the parliamentary committee's recommendations to his predecessor, Senator Ray.
       </para>
       <para>
        Phase two concerns those decisions to be put in place between August and December this year. It addresses the need for up-to-date departmental manuals; the question of asylum, in particular Chinese nationals' temporary residence in Australia following the events in Tiananmen; the definitions in the regulations relating to health, to spouses, to marriage; and some change of status matters. Again, all of those matters are responding to the select committee. Finally there is the general redrafting of the Act and indeed the vocabulary of the regulations themselves. The Opposition has no trouble with the suggestions that are made there because they have been in fact sponsored by us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that this whole statement is further evidence of the failure of the Hawke Labor Government to bring public confidence back to immigration in this country.

         â€”The Australian Democrats welcome the statement of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) because it vindicates the stand taken by the Democrats on the Migration Amendment Act of June 1989 and the regulations tabled on 19 December last year. It seems that we may be able to replace bureaucratic nonsense with sensible and realistic criteria. The Minister's statement is virtually a complete backdown. The very title gives the game away: Review of Migration Legislation. In the past two years we have been through the process of the FitzGerald review of immigration procedures, the Government's response, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bills, and finally the promulgation of the regulations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That the Government concedes in this title to the statement that a review of migration legislation has become necessary demonstrates that the whole thing has been a monumental disaster. I have said on a number of occasions that I believe that the legislation was written by bureaucrats for bureaucrats, and I would go further and say that the Immigration Department has hoodwinked a succession of Ministers in the past and I believe that Senator Ray has been their most gullible victim. This statement by the Minister gives hope, I believe, to the Senate that finally the interests of the Australian community at large may be served, rather than the interests of bureaucratic procedures. I would also ask why if, as is stated on page 4 of the statement, the regulations work reasonably well, a major review is necessary and why has the machinery of the Parliament been passed over in favour of an arbitrary departmental review?
       </para>
       <para>
        I would further ask, why not rewrite the whole Act now, as recommended by FitzGerald, which should have been done in 1989? Indeed, as was said in May 1989 by the Democrats, the legislation significantly infringes human rights, But this is more than a technical problem. The whole thrust of the Act and regulations discriminates against human rights in favour of economic and bureaucratic criteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        We learn on page 5 of the statement that an applicant will be refunded any fee paid to the Tribunal, if the Tribunal finds in his favour. But since the Tribunal acts to enforce regulations derived from the public interest, I ask why should the appellant pay at all? Prospective immigrants and immigration officers will be most relieved to read on page 5 of the statement that the Minister will reduce the complexity of the application procedures by collapsing the current 97 entry permits classes down to a possible seven.
       </para>
       <para>
        The unofficial consolidation of migration regulations, which was put together after 19 December last year and which I received in January, contains some 130 pages. There are 195 regulations and eight schedules. There is a section on fees and there are some 27 migration review regulations. Immigration officers have found it extremely difficult to apply the details of the regulations and we have all read reports in the newspapers during the last few months about that. Prospective migrants have been given in some cases false information, in others misleading information, and in others misleading advice and conflicting advice. Indeed, it has been a nightmare for all concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The immediate former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, may well say that it seemed to be a good idea at the time. But when he stated that there might be changes to the regulations, he flagged this last year during the debate in December and it was flagged again in the newspapers. But here we read on page 6 of the statement of present Minister Hand that these changes will meet a number of the more pressing problems which have emerged.
       </para>
       <para>
        We read also from the statement that there will be changes to relax certain deadlines. That could have been dealt with in June 1989 when I brought forward some 42 amendments to the then immigration Bill. Some of the changes flagged here by the Minister in his statement could have been dealt with last year. Some of these problems need never have arisen and I would say should never have arisen.
       </para>
       <para>
        We learn from the statement that there will be provision for the waiver of appeal fees in hardship cases and in special compassionate circumstances. This again was flagged nearly a year ago by the Democrats in debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        We read in the statement that in compassionate circumstances there will certainly no longer be requirements which are unnecessarily harsh and arbitrary; as far as illegal entrants are concerned, compelling compassionate circumstance will be given consideration. The Government has heard a great deal of criticism of the operation of parts of the new system. It heard it not only from the Democrats last year but also from knowledgeable immigration law specialists when the Act was first introduced and later when the regulations became public.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe the Minister did go into this with a good heart. Indeed, in December 1988, in the Government's response to the Fitzgerald committee report, the Minister said that changes from that time would be demonstrably open, consistent and equitable, with no more decisions being made behind closed doors. In the attempt to codify the immigration procedures in these regulations it has been found that it has not been possible to do that. The Government was warned and the Minister was warned, but no attention was paid to those warnings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The regulations were tabled in December last and since that time we have had what I think could be termed one almighty mess as far as our immigration procedures are concerned. I will refer to a few details in the paper.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister said, `Large sections of the new Act and regulations are now being administered smoothly'. I think from the remarks I have previously made and those made by Senator Teague that the public at large would realise that that statement must be taken with a big pinch of salt. I must also be critical of the Opposition, because both the Opposition and the Democrats realised last year from our first reading of the legislation when it first came forward-I believe it was introduced in March-that it simply could not work as it was and the fact that it depended on so many regulations which at that time were totally unseen meant that it would be extremely difficult to administer. As Senator Teague said when he spoke, at a later time the Opposition came to an arrangement with the Government and the legislation was subsequently passed in the Senate in June. But those amendments were simply not enough. I would say that the Opposition, by aiding and abetting the Government in the way that it did when the legislation was passed, has brought us further to the situation in which we now find ourselves. I deeply regret that the Opposition could not support any of the 42 amendments that I brought forward last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 2 of the statement Minister Hand talks about unintended consequences. Well, the Government was warned time and time again. The consequences may have been unintended by the Government, but certainly they were brought to its attention on a number of occasions last year and, as Senator Teague has said, also by the joint committee. Again on page 2 we read that the Minister will have the discretion to respond sensitively and with compassion when individual cases arise that require special consideration. The Government had the opportunity to make provision for that in the legislation so that it would have been before the Parliament and it could have been debated properly and not been dependent on regulations and I point out that we have not yet seen the regulations in their final form. I commend the Minister for stating in this paper that we are unlikely to see them for at least another 12 months. By now the Minister and the Department must have realised that the situation is so complex that it simply cannot be cobbled together at the last moment. The Minister says that the Department has to have in place proper administrative procedures. We all realised that, of course, and found the regulations in their cobbled together state most improper and very awkward to deal with.
       </para>
       <para>
        On page 3 the Minister states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . we must distinguish between those people who become illegal quite innocently and unintentionally through ignorance of proper procedures, and those who exploit every loophole in immigration policies to stay on in Australia even though they have no right to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course we must. But in the original regulations and in the legislation there appears to be no intention to distinguish between those who became illegal innocently and those who did so deliberately. In fact, the regulations dealing with that particular aspect were unnecessarily draconian right around. The statement says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The other main objective was that of removing from the Minister the almost intolerable burden of being a court of appeal . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet the Minister, by giving himself discretion, and also discretion not to use that discretion, as it states in this paper, still leave, that in some disarray. We read that the Minister has the powers under sections 115 and 137 of the Migration Act to set aside decisions at each review stage. Way back last year I argued that discretion must be available at all stages of the review process because it is quite impossible to codify every possible event in human lives and every possible event and complication that can arise when people seek or are forced to seek migration to Australia. What must be most welcomed is that the Minister now must report to the Parliament if he changes decisions and this must be done openly, and that any changes made by the review panels and the Review Tribunal must also be reported to the Parliament. What has been unconscionable has been the move toward there being no parliamentary accountability as far as our immigration procedures are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister says, on page 3:
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a considerable amount of criticism of the Regulations on the grounds that they are inflexible, harsh and overly complex.
       </para>
       <para>
        Well, that again is nothing recent. Three phases are mooted, three changes which will occur in three phases. The first phase will give greater access to review rights under the transitional arrangements. That was a matter which has caused particular concern to a number of people, professionals in the area and also those with great concerns in the area-that we have a transitional period while we move from one system of immigration to another, and that people have been denied their review rights. I am very pleased to see that that will change, and Minister Hand is to be commended for foreshadowing those changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        A Bill is foreshadowed, a Bill which will amend the Migration Act to ensure that the Minister's discretion to make a decision after the first tier can only be exercised at the request of the applicant and where the Minister is prepared to make a decision agreeable to the applicant. Also, the Minister will seek to overcome `an anomalous situation with regard to review fees'. As I said before, I believe, and the Democrats believe, that the whole area of review fees needs to be looked at very thoroughly. There seems to be a fee for virtually having a page turned over and, indeed, prospective migrants to this country will now find it extremely difficult if they cannot front up with fee money as required all the way along the line, especially if reviews are to be involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Joint Committee will be re-formed, and that is to be greatly welcomed. Also, the Parliament will have the opportunity to review and scrutinise reports put forward by the Committee. I regret very much also that the two reports put out by the Committee, after a great deal of work and after a great number of meetings both during parliamentary sessions and out of those sessions, have not yet come before the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a final conclusion, I would refer back to 14 December last year, when I moved and the Senate passed the following motion:
       </para>
       <para>
        That . . . the Senate condemns the Government for setting in motion the process of making complex and weighty Migration Amendment Legislation which depends heavily on Regulations, which are themselves equally complex and weighty, without first giving the Parliament a proper opportunity to scrutinise and approve those Regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        That amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill of December last year was passed by the Senate, and although Senator Ray described it as one of the grossest inaccuracies ever carried by the Senate, I believe that the words given here by Senator Teague and myself belie that absolutely.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister's statement is a bald admission that the legislation was hasty, inadequate and inflexible, as we argued way back in 1989. It is a bald admission that the Department has not yet got its act together in a number of ways. At this stage the Government should be launching into an independent review of the objectives, standards and culture of the Immigration Department. The Democrats believe that if this is not done soon, no amount of amended legislation or amended regulations brought forward bit by bit will solve our current problems. It is necessary for the Minister to exercise authority here and to cease being mystified and/or misled by officers of the Department. Indeed, I would agree with Senator Teague that statements should be made in this Senate and in the Parliament as a whole as to exactly what has happened in the Department this year and why we have the sackings of major people in the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nonetheless, I commend Mr Hand for his political common sense in tabling the statement today. At least we have an expression of problems that exist. At least we have a paper before us which, although inadequate, must be regarded as a first step to at last moving in a more sensible direction and not moving at a pace at which I believe neither the Parliament nor the Department nor the Minister were capable of putting forward sensible legislation and regulations. It is to be regretted that those regulations were brought forward on 19 December in such a hurry.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I asked the Minister what would be the consequences of delaying the tabling of those regulations, I was told that all the pamphlets, the brochures, the booklets and the explanations were ready to go and there would be absolute chaos if they were not tabled at that time. In fact, we now find, in this statement, that one of the reasons given by the Minister for the messy state of affairs since the tabling of those regulations is that the officers have not been able to be correctly and properly briefed. So I would suggest that there was not a straightforward understanding last year of what the situation actually was, and it would have been much better for the legislation not to have been passed in haste, as it was in the first half of last year, and for there to have been proper consultations with all parties concerned, and then we would not be wasting time backtracking continuously and now having, at this late stage a review of migration legislation. Unfortunately, it is necessary, and I am sure that the Committee will continue to do its best to help the immigration area by putting forward regulations and amended legislation so that our Department can get itself out of its chaotic situation.

        PETROLEUM (AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA ZONE OF COOPERATION) BILL 1990
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the `Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an area between The Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia' which was signed on 11= December 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The introduction of the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill is required to fulfil certain of our obligations under the Treaty and in particular to enable the Ministerial Council and Joint Authority to exercise the rights and responsibilities prescribed in relation to the exploration for, and exploitation of petroleum resources in Area A of the Zone of Cooperation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Meanwhile the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill provides a series of amendments to legislation that would otherwise be inconsistent with certain provisions of the Treaty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treaty has a ten year history. Negotiations with Indonesia over sea-bed boundaries in 1971-72 left unsettled the delimitation of the sea-bed boundary in the Timor Gap area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Negotiations were reopened in February 1979. After several rounds of talks, however, it became clear that it would be difficult to reconcile the two countries' competing sea-bed boundary claims. Both Governments subsequently began exploring the possibility of a provisional `joint development' regime for petroleum resources, to operate pending final agreement on the precise boundary. The concept of a Zone of Cooperation was then developed, whereby both countries would jointly invite contractors to explore for and exploit petroleum resources under production sharing contracts in the disputed area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Agreement on the text of the Treaty, which is incorporated as the Schedule to the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill, was reached by officials on 27 October 1989. The formal signing by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ali Alatas, took place on 11 December 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Timor Gap Treaty is the most substantial bilateral agreement concluded in the forty year history of Australia's relations with Indonesia. The Treaty represents a unique approach to the settlement on a provisional basis of a dispute over territorial delimitation. This constructive approach has established a basis for cooperative exploration for and exploitation of petroleum resources which would otherwise have been indefinitely delayed by efforts to define a single boundary line. The Zone of Cooperation is an area of very high prospectivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The zone of cooperation consists of three areas. Area A is the area of joint development where the control of petroleum operations will be exercised by a Ministerial Council and a Joint Authority on behalf of Australia and the Republic of Indonesia. The Joint Authority will be responsible for the day-to-day management of petroleum operations in Area A and will report directly to the Ministerial Council, a body comprised of an equal number of Australian and Indonesian Ministers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Area B is the area of sole Australian jurisdiction, but Australia will pay 10 per cent of gross Resource Rent Tax revenues from this area to Indonesia and notify Indonesia about petroleum operations in the Area. Area C is the area of sole Indonesian jurisdiction, and Indonesia will notify Australia about petroleum operations in that Area and will pay 10 per cent of its Contractor's Income Tax Revenues from this Area to Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, together with the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill, is therefore directed at making Australian law consistent with the provisions of the Treaty. The Treaty includes four annexes. Annex A provides maps and the coordinates of the Zone of Cooperation. Annex B is the `Petroleum Mining Code for Area A of the Zone of Cooperation' which governs operational activities relating to exploration for and exploitation of petroleum resources. Annex C is the `Model Production Sharing Contract between the Joint Authority and (Contractors)', being the basis on which production sharing contracts for Area A should be concluded. Annex D is the `Taxation Code for the Avoidance of Double Taxation in Respect of Activities Connected with Area A of the Zone of Cooperation'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principal financial impact will be the prospective receipt of sales proceeds by Australia from the production sharing arrangements. The basic principle of the Treaty is that the Joint Authority, exercises the rights of the two countries in the exploration for and exploitation of their petroleum in Area A of the Zone of Cooperation. The Joint Authority is to enter into contracts with corporations to explore for and produce petroleum. In return, these contractors will receive a share of the petroleum produced, to which they will acquire ownership at the point of tanker loading.
       </para>
       <para>
        Primary responsibility for the marketing of petroleum rests with the contractor. There are, however, safeguards to ensure that petroleum is marketed at world prices. Provision is made under the Model Production Sharing Contract for the Joint Authority to determine the value of petroleum sold by the contractor to purchasers, such as affiliates, that are not third parties. In addition, the Joint Authority may market any or all of the petroleum produced with the approval of the Ministerial Council, when the Joint Authority can receive a better price than the contractors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The method of sharing petroleum production between the contractor and the Joint Authority is provided in Section 7 of the Model Production Sharing Contract. This provides for three progressive stages in this sharing of crude oil production, between the Joint Authority and the contractor. The Joint Authority's share is to be paid intact and in equal shares to Australia and Indonesia. The initial stage is the shared first tranche petroleum. In the next stage, contractor's investment credits and operating costs are recovered from production revenues. The final stage is the sharing of residual production.
       </para>
       <para>
        First tranche petroleum amounts to 10 per cent of crude oil production during the first five years of production and thereafter 20 per cent. On oil production up to a daily average rate of 50,000 barrels per day, this first tranche petroleum is to be shared in the ratio 50:50 between the Joint Authority and the contractor. For the next 100,000 barrels per day of production first tranche petroleum is to be shared in the ratio 60:40 between the Joint Authority and the contractor; and for production above 150,000 barrels per day the respective sharing ratios are 70:30.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second stage provides the contractor with production equal in value to investment credits of 127 per cent of exploration and capital costs together with all operating costs, including exploration costs and depreciation of capital costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third stage allocates residual production once investment credits and operating costs are recovered. The split of this production is based on the same progressive sharing arrangements between the Joint Authority and the contractor as applies to the allocation of first tranche petroleum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revenues from first tranche natural gas production are shared constantly 50:50 between the Joint Authority and the contractor. Following the recovery of investment credits and operating costs, residual natural gas production is again shared in the 50:50 ratio.
       </para>
       <para>
        An additional and prospectively significant financial impact is the taxation receipt from business profits derived from Area A. Both countries' will apply their taxation legislation to contractors deriving profits from their operations in Area A but in such a way that only 50 per cent of business profits and losses are taken into account by each country. As noted, Australia is obliged by its Treaty obligations to pay 10 per cent of its gross Resource Rent Tax revenue from Area B to Indonesia. Neither revenues from production sharing, nor taxation receipts from business profits from petroleum operations in Area A, can be estimated until more is known of the petroleum potential of Area A.
       </para>
       <para>
        A third element in this overview of financial impacts is that the provisions to apply to individuals working in Area A provide that residents of Australia will be subject to Australian taxes, and residents of Indonesia will be subject to Indonesian taxes. Double taxation provisions apply to business profits and salaries of individuals who are residents of neither Australia nor Indonesia.

        The Joint Authority will be self funding from contract fees. Such fees will not, however, be receivable until contract bids are received and contracts are subsequently awarded. This may not occur until some twelve months after the Treaty enters into force. The final element in the financial impact of implementation of the Treaty is therefore the initial working capital for the Joint Authority estimated at $US2m. Australia is required to advance its half share or $US1m. It is anticipated that this advance will be repaid within five years. The scope of the Treaty extends well beyond production sharing, taxation and the arrangements for the Ministerial Council and Joint Authority. The Treaty, under Articles 12 to 30, covers the range of issues likely to be encountered in the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum.

        These include the prevention and minimisation of, and liability of contractors for, pollution of the marine environment. For this purpose and civil claims generally, the legislation provides that State and Territory courts are vested with federal jurisdiction in relation to acts or omissions done in Area A resulting in damage or liability suffered by Australians. This will include liability for the pollution of the marine environment.

        There are a range of other Articles in the Treaty covering other activities, contingencies and potential developments arising out of the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum in Area A. These include surveillance, security measures, search and rescue, air traffic services, and health and safety for workers. These and other issues will be dealt with through a range of rules, regulations and procedures required by the Treaty.

        This package of legislation gives effect to the Treaty and its Annexes which govern all aspects of the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum in Area A of the Zone of Cooperation. The regime established by the Treaty for Area A of the Zone of Cooperation is unique compared with similar joint development zones in other parts of the world in both the complexity and comprehensive nature of its provisions. The joint nature of those provisions do not simply replicate the system existing in either Australia or Indonesia, but combine features of both in an innovative and practical arrangement.

       <para>
        This Bill provides a series of amendments to legislation that would otherwise be inconsistent with the provisions of the `Treaty Between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an area between The Indonesian Province of East Timor and Northern Australia'. The text of the Treaty is the schedule to the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990, or Treaty Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments relate to legislation pertaining to the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum in Area A of the Zone of Cooperation. Area A is the area of joint development where a Ministerial Council and a Joint Authority will exercise the rights and responsibilities of Australia and Indonesia in relation to the exploration for an exploitation of petroleum.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Crimes at Sea Act is amended so that it applies in Area A consistent with Article 27 of the Treaty. Northern Territory criminal law will apply to offences by Australians, while Indonesian law will apply to Indonesians. The provisions, consistent with the Treaty, deal also with persons who are neither permanent residents nor nationals of either Australia or Indonesia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other parts of this Consequential Provisions Bill are provided to make Australian legislation consistent with Articles of the Treaty dealing with the application of customs, migration and quarantine laws, industrial relations issues and changes required to permits which had been issued under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in Area A.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Customs Act is amended consistent with Article 23 to make it an offence, without authorisation, for persons or goods to be brought directly to or from a resource installation in Area A without first entering or returning to either Australia or Indonesia. Goods taken to, or brought from Area A, for use in petroleum operations are not liable to customs duty, but are subject to duty if they are transferred permanently from Area A to another part of Australia.
       </para>

        The Industrial Relations Act amendment provides for employment contracts and collective agreements entered into under Article 24 of the Treaty to specify the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as an available mechanism for the settlement of disputes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Migration Act is amended to allow control of persons moving onto and from resource installations in Area A and by regulation to allow the application of that Act in Area A if that proves necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments provided to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 redefine the scheduled `adjacent area' to exclude Area A of the Zone of Cooperation, and hence place it outside the scope of this Act. These amendments provide that those parts of permit areas extending outside Area A are to be renewed. Provision has been made in the event that compensation is found to be payable in relation to the termination of permit areas in Area A, in terms consistent with paragraph 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution. Legal advice to the Government, however, is that no such compensation will be payable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Quarantine Act amendments are similar to those made to the Migration Act. These control persons, goods and equipment leaving or entering Area A for quarantine purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The financial impacts of these amendments are relatively less significant than those relating to the Treaty Bill. The non-liability of goods to customs duty, when used in petroleum operations in Area A, has the potential to relieve importers from duty over a broad range, but generally this exemption from duties would be within the level of 10 per cent to 20 per cent. Until the petroleum potential of Area A is better understood and hence development plans can be prepared, there is no basis on which to estimate the impact of this provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The object of these amendments is therefore to apply existing Commonwealth legislation in Area A in a manner which is consistent with the Treaty.
       </para>

        I commend the Bill to honourable senators. I indicated earlier that the Explanatory Memorandum which I presented in relation to the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill also covers this Bill.

         â€”This report arose from a reference made by the Senate on 17 October 1989. Events have rather overtaken the purpose of this inquiry, although some matters can still be drawn from the report and from the events of that time which may be worth following up in the future. Senator Brownhill was anxious to talk about this matter. He told me that he may make some criticism of the way in which the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute was chaired. I was Chairman of that Committee. Many people will be surprised when I read out the list of senators who were members of that Committee because all of them are normally fairly silent in this chamber. They are people of absolute courtesy. Some senators may be surprised to learn that, as members of the Committee, they had the ability to express themselves clearly.

        The airline pilots dispute was quite a tragedy. Indeed, it was more than a tragedy. Some awful things came out of that dispute. It seems to me that the dispute was brought about by a lot of misunderstanding, by many people putting their heads down and charging when they should not have. As a result of the dispute, the community was denied crucial services. The tourist industry was devastated and the pilots themselves underwent an awful trauma.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report makes no recommendations, mainly because, as I said before, events overtook the inquiry. For example, part of the inquiry concerned whether the military aircraft that were used were safe. By the time we wrote the report, the military aircraft had been taken out of the service that was being provided by the airlines to the public. I think it was agreed that whatever happened during the dispute there was never a time when the air service was unsafe. Differences among Committee members arose out of the question of whether a reduction in safety was one that merited more or less concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the safety of airline travel, Mr Dick Smith made a very important point. He is now the Chairperson of the Civil Aviation Authority. He said that travel by air is 400 times safer than road travel. That point is referred to in paragraph 4.113 of the report. I think we ought to take on board the point that air travel is safer than road travel. A few tragic events in recent times have indicated that that is so. I think that is something from which we can learn in the future. Air travel should be made more readily available to people than it presently is. It saves people from having to travel by road and it is a safer way to travel.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were asked some legal questions about certain issues. It is very difficult for any Senate committee and, indeed, for the Senate itself, to give any definite legal opinion, simply because we are not the arm of government which is deputised by the Constitution to do that. That seemed to me to raise some problems. In the future, if we refer questions to any committee, we ought to take on board the fact that it is very difficult for the Senate and its committees to express any definitive opinion about legal affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next point I want to make is that one person interested in the tourism industry was most concerned, as one would expect him to be, about the devastation that the dispute caused to the industry. When asked what solution he would give, he mentioned the invoking of the essential services legislation. Indeed, in this context there was also a common law action taken in Melbourne against the pilots, before Mr Justice Brooking, in which damages were awarded. My view-and I say it in this context-is that common law actions against unions should not be pursued.

         â€”It is very bad to create in an industrial culture a climate where people go round wielding the proverbial big stick. We have heard arguments again and again in this chamber about the need for productivity and the need to get everybody on side, and we certainly do not keep people on side by invoking the law and by trying to bludgeon people into a course of action. I say that in the context where, from our side of the chamber, there was some encouragement at an early stage for taking common law action. I simply state my view that one should not take common law actions in an industrial context and should certainly not invoke the use of sections 45d and 45e.

        So, in my view, we can learn from the strike the following matters: firstly, the need for industrial relations to be conducted in a calm and clear atmosphere and in an atmosphere of goodwill; secondly, if I have a criticism of the action of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, it is that it conducted its industrial relations and industrial action in an ill-advised fashion. I think the decisions it made were made too late and were too ineffective. When a leadership has the responsibility of guiding workers, be they airline pilots, plumbers or anybody else, it has a responsibility to conduct its industrial action in a way that benefits its members and the community in general.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next thing I want to say is that air safety has been proved in Australia and, in that context, more thought should be given to enabling more people to travel by air than is presently the situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next thing I say-I have already mentioned this-is that the Senate should not readily refer questions of the legal meaning of things to committees or even deal with them ourselves in the sense of trying to find answers to those issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Senate very kindly gave the Committee the right to meet while the Senate was sitting. In my view, it is time that that entitlement was extended to all committees. There is more and more sense in the Senate giving permission to the Senate committees to meet during sitting times.

         â€”I rise to speak as one of the two members of the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airlines Pilots' Dispute who felt it necessary to dissent from the majority report on both occasions that the Committee presented a report. In saying that, I do not condone the actions of either party in this particular dispute. The dispute was initiated by the actions of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots but we must remember, though, that one month after the dispute started the Federation was prepared to enter into bona fide negotiations to resolve the impasse that had occurred as a result of the initial actions and the actions at that particular stage of the airlines themselves who refused to enter into any negotiations.

        I do not deny the right of the airlines not to enter into any negotiations, but the airlines also had a legal obligation-Senator Cooney talked about the law a minute ago-to provide services within Australia under the two airlines agreement. It amazed me that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who has always been a mediator in strikes and industrial action, did not attempt in a constructive way to bring those two parties together.

        The third term of reference related to the nature and extent and legality of the compensation arrangements entered into by the Government and the airlines. This was a highly technical area, a highly technical reference, which required a detailed knowledge of constitutional and statute law. Senator MacGibbon and I wanted and needed expert advice-and so did the rest of the Committee-but the decision of the majority of members of the Committee was to seek advice from the Attorney-General's Department on the legality of the Government's actions in paying compensation to the airlines. It was taxpayers' money that was being paid to the airlines. Since it was the Attorney-General's Department which advised the Government initially, Senator MacGibbon and I viewed it as farcical and irresponsible that the Department should be placed in a position of being the sole arbiter of the Government's actions.
       </para>
       <para>
        An area that Senator Cooney made mention of a moment ago was the question of safety, which was the main part of the reference. Of course, there is more to safety than just `safety'. As Mr John Calwell, an executive committee member from the New South Wales Technical and Air Safety Working Group of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators, stated, there is a safety culture, which is just as important as anything else. An essential item of that safety culture is that priority be given to safety over commercial interests. I think it is highly necessary, the way things have turned out and even for the future, that safety have precedence over commercial interests. He went on to say that there should be cooperative attitudes among all sections of the industry, a willingness to apply and abide by the most stringent safety regulations and a career structure which encouraged stability in the industry. That is an area that concerned me in this inquiry.

        I have sat on many committees in this Parliament, and I feel that I have always benefited from the opportunity to delve into various subjects and learn more about them in order to help the Australian people concerned. I regret, however, that the same comment cannot be applied to this particular Committee. For a start, my view is that it was always intended by the Government to be a whitewash. There was no real intention to get to the bottom of the issues and no real attempt to question in depth anyone who might have told us what we needed to know. At each turn my colleague Senator MacGibbon and I were confronted with almost a conspiracy of silence. We had the airline executives telling us regularly that flights were almost back to normal when the reality was that they were not. We had flight attendants hampered in what they could tell us because they had to keep their jobs and work with foreign crews, at which so much criticism had been levelled.
       </para>
       <para>
        We had claim and counterclaim of intimidation and of legal challenges. A great deal of acrimony surrounded this dispute, and that is understandable. There was not, however, in my view, the old Australian concept of fair play.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will cite one particular example. Early in the sittings of the Committee I had the opportunity to visit with a former public servant who had extensive knowledge of civil aviation operation procedures. He had expressed a willingness to talk with me because he had already spoken and written publicly on issues surrounding the dispute that had disturbed him. But some minutes before I met him he had been handed a libel writ. I guess that means very little to those in public life but to this man it was quite devastating. He was not a young man or in particularly good health. When I saw him he was virtually in a state of shock and fearful that he was about to lose the home and pension that he had secured. The big boys can play rough and dirty if they like but I would have thought the rules are that you pick on someone your own size. In this case that did not happen.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe this report has brought anything to light. As we say in our dissenting report, we are of the opinion that the approach taken by the Committee lacked objectivity and impartiality. We state further that the participation of the Prime Minister was a significant factor. We do not know his full involvement in the dispute or his reason for it, and perhaps never will. We do not know the motive behind the actions taken by the airlines. We know what the pilots intended and wanted but whether their actions were, in hindsight, unfortunate, ill timed or just ill considered is perhaps for others to judge.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do know-and we did not need a Committee to tell us-that the tourism industry and the travelling public have suffered enormously. The full impact on society includes the now altered preferred modes of travel. The impact on business structure and viability for so many industries and towns will take years to calculate. This report could have answered many questions. I regret that it did not. It now remains for the evolution of time to disclose the real story behind it all and what effect it has had and will have on the airline industry and all that that incorporates.

        With deregulation just about to start we will all wonder whether it was worth while, whether it was necessary and whether, if the Government had really tried, the two combatants in the dispute could not have been brought to the table when they wanted to get to the table so that the dispute did not cost so much to the Australian community and to the Australian economy.

         â€”The Senate is debating the presentation of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute, which was a select committee set up toward the end of last year when we were experiencing the most expensive strike in Australia's history and arguably the most mismanaged industrial relations exercise by any government in the history of this nation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The dispute is not over yet but in the nine or 10 months it has been running it has already cost this country billions of dollars. It has had a major impact on our reputation overseas as a tourist destination. It has sent hundreds of thousands of people in the tourist industry out of jobs and made them bankrupt. In many ways the accounts are not yet in for the consequence of this dispute. There is also a very great indirect cost. One of the tragedies of the dispute is that, because only about 4 to 6 per cent of the Australian community fly, the great majority of Australians were not aware of the direct impact of the strike, let alone the consequences on our balance of payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a very great indirect cost which is most marked on the professional core of pilots who provide an essential skill in a highly developed community. Over 350 of those pilots, the cream of the internal airline pilots of this country, have gone to overseas airlines. Malaysian Airline System, Singapore Airlines Ltd and Cathay Pacific Ltd have picked the cream, the eyes, out of our best pilots. Gulf Air, Taiwan Airlines, the second Korean airline, a number of European airlines and some American airlines have also benefited. The Malaysian airline took all the check and training captains out of Australian Airlines Ltd, and that is why Australian Airlines had such a very difficult job getting re-established afterwards, because the heart of their piloting expertise had gone.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, through the stupidity of the Government and the way that it mishandled the dispute, we subsidised our competitors in the international routes in our region with millions of dollars in transferring those people. To the 350-plus pilots who resigned to work overseas must be added a similar number, or more, of pilots who took premature retirement rather than stand up to the bullying tactics of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines. Somewhere near half the pilot core in this country left the industry and we are left with a bunch of people who have nowhere near the experience and expertise to fulfil what is a highly technical job.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another thing that has not dawned on the Australian Labor Party yet is that its actions have changed the face of industrial relations forever in this country because the ALP, the great protagonist of the unionists and proponents of stand-over tactics in industrial relations, used the Australian Defence Force as strike breakers. It ran the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy around the country as strike breakers. That is unheard of and absolutely unconscionable. The Services in this country exist to defend it and to render aid to the civil authorities when there is an emergency, not to get involved in commercial operations and least of all to subsidise the Government's old mates in Australian Airlines and Ansett by offering ridiculously low charter rates for aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        What else did the Government do? It brought in overseas labour-not Australian scab labour but overseas scab labour-to break the strike. What is worse, compounding that, it resorted to common law actions. No wonder Senator Cooney is uncomfortable about that. He has spent a lifetime making a living out of union relations, defending unionists when they tried to take on the community in various ways and blackmail it. He finds that, under common law, the Government of which he is a member is suing people-under common law-who dared to withhold their services. Voluntary employment agreements have been introduced-things that the Goss Labor Government in Queensland is now trying to eliminate.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is all good basic stuff from an industrial relations point of view but it is very difficult for the Labor Party to defend. I think that we on this side of the chamber can be grateful because when we get into government and are faced with recalcitrant unions we have a precedent we can follow with great equanimity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite doing all those things the Government refused to recognise the national interest, which was to resolve the dispute. The dispute could have been resolved from 12 September onwards, within a one-month period of the dispute coming on. The evidence that was given to the Select Committee showed-and it was never refuted-that members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots were prepared to enter into negotiations with their employers to resume their services. Not once did the employers negotiate with them. Not once would the Government say to the employers, `For the national good, see if you cannot reach agreement'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today what is the position? We are not back to normal yet. Before the dispute Cairns in my own State used to have 23 flights a day. There are about eight now. People who want to fly to Rockhampton or Mackay just have to fly when the airline wants to run its one service a day. All of this is because we had a Government that colluded with management to pursue whatever goals management had at the time. Anyone who doubts that there was collusion between the Government and the airlines should look at the ridiculous gift rates that the Government charged the airlines for the charter of the Air Force aircraft and Navy aircraft at the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the ironies of it all is that everyone has forgotten now what the strike was about. It occurred because the airline pilots wanted a raise and the Government said they could only have 6 per cent. The contracts that were signed-and Senator Cooney is smiling at this-provided at least a 30 per cent rise. The contracts that the Government approved provided at least a 30 per cent increase in the salaries of the pilots. Today pilots who are flying for Ansett and Australian are now getting between $175,000 and $200,000 per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of those pilots have exceeded or are exceeding their flying hours and they are looking forward to three months holiday. In other words, the Government's action in refusing a price rise has given at least a 30 per cent increase to airline pilots and, in some cases, it has given them a 100 per cent increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Brownhill talked about the dishonesty in the evidence given to us by the airline management. They lied about the services that were being offered and being flown around Australia. They also misled us about the number of pilots they had. Some of their management practices are open to doubt. I want to put before the Senate one case of a pilot who flew for TAA between 1970 and 1978. He was dismissed because he was mentally unstable. He reapplied and he was refused re-employment with TAA. Then, after the dispute, he came back, and he was signed on. He was dismissed again when they found out how bad he was. Then he made some death threats and the whole thing went public. The interesting point is that the management has been at pains to play down the death threats. No-one has answered on behalf of the company why this man, who was fired because he was mentally unstable, was ever re-employed. I would have thought that a general manager of that company would have had the resignation of the personnel manager and the chief pilot on his desk before sunset on the day that was discovered.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also want to say something about the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation, because these are two statutory authorities that were set up by this Labor Government in the guise that they are independent. Both bent over backwards to cooperate with whatever the Government's policy was at the time. The CAA was very badly caught out in a regulatory role and it acceded to any requests the companies made in the early part of the dispute. Later it took fright when it realised what it was doing and it tried to apply the letter of the law, but it certainly did not operate as an independent authority. The same applies for the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, which operated as an organ of the Government's propaganda in not enforcing standards at the time.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is one of the shabbiest exercises in industrial relations we have seen. It has cost the country billions of dollars. It has, as Senator Brownhill said, reduced the margin of safety that formerly existed in the Australian airline services. We now have airlines manned by pilots who lack the experience of those before the dispute. We have aircraft manned by crews that lack the morale, the cohesion and the goodwill that existed before the strike. It is my fervent wish that this country gets through the next two or three years in these disturbed circumstances without having a major accident.

       <para>
        The statement read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate referred the matter of accommodation for people with disabilities to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in June 1989 during the Senate's consideration of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        At that time, the Committee was inquiring into a related matter-the employment of people with disabilities. The Committee decided to examine both matters together and scheduled an extensive series of public hearings and visits between August and November last year. The program was disrupted, however, by the pilots' dispute as it became impossible to form a quorum for all but a few hearings. The Committee decided to defer further consideration of the employment inquiry in order to meet the reporting deadline for the accommodation inquiry of the first sitting day in March 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee held nine days of hearings and inspections in January to complete the accommodation inquiry. The announcement of the Federal elections in February made it impossible, however, for the committee to finalise its consideration of the report prior to the election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although point (a) of the Committee's terms of reference specifically referred to intellectual disability, the rest of the terms of reference did not restrict the Committee to that one type of disability. As the Disability Services Act refers to intellectual, physical, sensory and psychiatric disabilities, the Committee encompassed all those four types of disability in its inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prior to the enactment of the Disability Services Act in 1986, Commonwealth funding of accommodation for people with disabilities was largely restricted to the funding of hostels and nursing homes under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974.
       </para>
       <para>
        For some time, there has been a growing realisation that nursing homes, hostels and institutions were no longer appropriate forms of accommodation for people with disabilities. They largely segregated people with disabilities from the rest of the community, restricted their lifestyles and offered few opportunities for choice.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1984 the present Commonwealth Government set up the Handicapped Programs Review. After an exhaustive inquiry and consultations, a report entitled `New Directions' was issued in 1985, recommending radical changes to assistance programs for people with disabilities. These changes were incorporated in the Disability Services Act 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 5 of this Act made provision for Principles and Objectives. These were issued separately and gazetted on 9 June 1987. The Principles state that people with disabilities have the same right as other members of Australian society including the right to receive services in a manner which results in the least restriction of their rights and opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        These rights contained in the Principles under the Act give effect to the provisions of the Declaration of the Rights of Disabled Persons proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1975.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Principles and Objectives received overwhelming support throughout our inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        An area of contention during the inquiry was whether people with severe or profound disabilities could cope with living in the community instead of in a hostel, nursing home or institution. Any concern that such people could not live in group homes was dispelled during the Committee's visits. Members of the Committee met people with profound multiple disabilities who had successfully adjusted to community living after having spent a long time in an institution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee also received evidence from many people and organisations about the successful transition of people with different types and levels of disability from hostels or nursing homes to small group homes or other types of community accommodation. For example, the Nulsen Haven Association, a service organisation in Perth told the Committee:
       </para>
       <para>
        We noticed some very significant changes . . . With the people themselves, their whole life has changed and the quality of life has improved. Their daily routines are more flexible; they fit in with their needs, not with the needs of a larger accommodation option. They have developed some very special social networks in the community which are very valuable.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is essential that people who move out of hostels or nursing homes have access to any training they need and are given enough support on an ongoing basis to enable them to live in group homes or other types of community-based accommodation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The level of support will vary for each individual. It will probably change over time, reducing for many people as they settle in to community living, but increasing for other people with progressive disabilities, such as muscular dystrophy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Disability Services Act, the support needs of all consumers will be assessed individually and will vary according to the type and severity of the disabilities. Although the Government has set notional maximum levels of financial support, additional support will be given if a service provider can demonstrate the need for it. The Department of Community Services and Health has assured the Committee that it is trying to maintain as much flexibility as possible, in keeping with the spirit of the legislation and its Principles and Objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was required to compare the cost of funding the types of accommodation funded under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act with the types of accommodation eligible for funding under section 10 of the Disability Services Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee found that it was too early to make any realistic assessment of comparative costs. Most nursing homes and hostels had yet to undergo their formal reviews with the Department of Community Services and Health. Until those reviews are held, and changes to accommodation agreed to by the service providers and the Department, it will be impossible to assess both transitional and recurrent costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee received evidence from service providers who have made the transition to community-based services that, generally speaking, recurrent costs for community homes have been lower than those of nursing homes, except where higher support needs have had to be met.
       </para>
       <para>
        In planning a transition to community-based accommodation, service providers and government need to take account of the availability of generic services, such as medical and dental services, shops and transport. Access to such services will help people with disabilities to participate as fully as possible in the wider community and will avoid the dispersal of scarce disability funds into services which duplicate those already available in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee believes that the programs designed to provide support to keep people with disabilities in their own homes, such as Home and Community Care, the Attendant Care Scheme, or the 325 Program, should be expanded to cater for the growing demand for those services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Disability Services Act is based on a flexible approach to types of accommodation for people with disabilities which may be funded under the Act, provided that they adhere to the Principles and Objectives. The Act does not prescribe the number of people who can live together, but the Department of Community Services and Health told the Committee that it would become increasingly more difficult for a service provider to show that accommodation was consistent with normal community living as numbers in a house increased above about five or six.
       </para>
       <para>
        People with disabilities should have a choice in the type of accommodation in which they live and it must be an informed choice. If a person is to choose between different types of accommodation, that person must either have had experience of those types or have been given suitable training beforehand, with support from parents or advocates when needed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision of adequate respite care services is an integral part of ensuring that quality care is available for people with disabilities. The availability of planned or emergency respite care enables many people with disabilities to stay with family or other carers rather than live in accommodation provided by a service organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee supports the principles of the separation of services to reduce the possibility of any one service provider exercising undue control over a person's life. Where it is necessary for an organisation to provide more than one service, it should be treated as an exception to the rule. When an alternative service becomes available, it should be substituted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The total number of people with disabilities in Australia is not known. The Department of Community Services and Health assessed the number as about 93,000 who might qualify for assistance under the Disability Services Act. The large majority of these people do not receive any assistance under the Act, although some might receive State Government support.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was told by many service providers during the inquiry that they had waiting lists of people who were seeking supported accommodation. Although the names of some people would appear on waiting lists of a number of service providers, there is, nevertheless, an unmet need for government support.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the Department told the Committee that there is an unmet demand for support under the 325 Program, the Attendant Care Scheme and Home and Community Care. The Department of Community Services and Health can only support disability services within the limits of the annual budget for the Disability Services Program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee therefore recommends that sufficient funding be provided in the Budget for the Disability Services Program to ensure that adequate resources are available to support people with disabilities when they move to community housing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee received evidence that there has been a lack of co-ordination in some States and Territories between Commonwealth and State officials and between different State departments. Many service providers receive assistance from both Commonwealth and State Governments. Housing and transport are two forms of assistance which are mainly provided by State Governments while ongoing personal support has been the main form of Commonwealth Government help. Often assistance from one government is dependent on complementary assistance being made available from the other, but a lack of co-ordination between governments or between departments sometimes makes the provision of assistance at the same time difficult to achieve. The Commonwealth and the State Governments should ensure that there is effective co-ordination between their services for people with disabilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Service providers, particularly in New South Wales, were critical of a high turnover of project officer staff in the Disability Services Program of the Department of Community Services and Health, arguing that it hampered negotiations between service providers and the Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee found that the level of classification of project officer positions, inappropriate selection procedures and inadequate training programs all contributed to the problems referred to by service providers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommended that the Department of Community Services and Health establish effective selection processes and effective training programs for project officers working in the Disability Services Program, with the aim of appointing people who have the capacity, motivation and experience to succeed in this demanding job.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the passage of the Disability Services Bill in 1986, it was amended in the Senate to include psychiatric disabilities as well as physical, intellectual and sensory disabilities. The Commonwealth Government has, however, given low priority to assistance for people with psychiatric disabilities, as this area has traditionally been the preserve of State Governments. During the inquiry, there were a number of submissions urging the Commonwealth Government to take a more active role in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government accepts the responsibility under the DSA to provide funding for accommodation support services for people with psychiatric disabilities. The Commonwealth Government should consult and negotiate with State and Territory Governments so that an appropriate adjustment in Commonwealth/State financial arrangements can be made to cover the resulting transfer of funding for some services from State or Territory Governments to the Commonwealth Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee supports the Disability Services Act and its Principles and Objectives. From the evidence obtained during the inquiry, people with disabilities enhance their lifestyle and show improvements in personal development and health once they move to community-based accommodation. With adequate support, even people with severe or profound disabilities can live in community-based accommodation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another important consequence of people moving from nursing homes or hostels to community-based accommodation has been the increased contact with family and friends as well as the ability to form new relationships in that community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I emphasise that a move from a large facility to a group home is not necessarily the ultimate option. It is often a stepping stone to an even less restricted type of accommodation, such as living alone or with one other person. The Committee spoke to a number of people in group homes who were planning to do just that. Support needs to be available for people to move to the least restrictive option.
       </para>
       <para>
        I'd like to express our thanks to those who made submissions to the inquiry and those who allowed us to visit them at home. I also pay tribute to the progressive service organisations and organisations representing people with disabilities and their families who have campaigned over many years to bring about the changes in community attitudes and government policy which have enabled people with disabilities to take their rightful place in the community. In conclusion, I'd like to thank the Secretariat staff and members of the Committee who sacrificed their January break to complete this inquiry on time.

         â€”Mr President, in speaking on this motion, I have the great honour and privilege of standing before you as a senator for Queensland. As you will no doubt be aware, when our Constitution was created, it was the intention that the rights of States be protected through the creation of the Senate as the States' House. The people of Queensland, whom I represent, are proud and loyal Australians, but they are, equally, proud Queenslanders. In the 133 years since the proclamation of our State, ordinary Queenslanders have worked with courage and drive against great adversity to create a State which we, perhaps a little immodestly, believe to be the equal of any in this country. That same drive and that same courage are exemplified today by the people in the flood-ravaged interior of our State. It was a cruel irony indeed that washed away years of drought with the worst floods in the recorded history of this country. Many ordinary people, in towns like Alpha and Jericho and Charleville, lost everything that they had to show for years and years of struggle.

        For some, alas, the tragedy will be too much, but for others the pioneer spirit on which this country was built has been reborn anew. I take this opportunity to beg the people of Australia and all of the members of this Parliament to offer these people every assistance, irrespective of cost. We must throw away the rule books, because this is a quite extraordinary disaster. These people require not loans but grants, and they require real assistance to ensure that they can rebuild their lives as they were before the floods. If we refuse this help, then we will be turning our backs on our duty to our fellow Australians to give them assistance in a time of desperate need. I do not believe that we should do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        On a much happier note, last night I had the great pleasure to be elected a senator of Australia by the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. As you realise, the Legislative Assembly of Queensland is the representative body of that State. I watched the proceedings of the House from the Strangers Gallery and I hope and pray, now and in the future, that our State members in Queensland will serve the State according to its needs and will keep foremost in their minds its future prosperity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the casual Senate vacancy which I fill was created by the resignation of Senator John Stone. Without doubt, filling any casual Senate vacancy is getting in to things at the deep end; but to attempt to replace John Stone is, I think, a bit like jumping into the Marianas Trench. Senator Stone was, in his time, a Rhodes scholar, Secretary to the Treasury, and a man whose intellectual contribution to this country would be very difficult indeed to rival in any sphere. I take this opportunity to personally thank John Stone for his kindnesses to me over the last week and a half, and I also take this opportunity to wish him, as I am sure all senators would wish him, every happiness in his future endeavours. He is a great Australian, and I feel that if I could do half as good a job as John Stone, I would be doing pretty well indeed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the election of John Stone to this chamber in the first place was, I believe, a tribute to the foresight and to the philosophical strength of the National Party of Australia, of which I have been a proud member for the past nine years. I was first introduced to the National Party through my acquaintance with the late Sir Bruce Small, who exemplified perhaps better than anyone else the free enterprise spirit of our National Party. We of the National Party are firmly committed to the creation of conditions in which people with enthusiasm and drive and initiative, people with a love of free enterprise, are allowed to work for the betterment of their families, themselves and this nation as a whole. In working for themselves they work for all of us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that one of the things that mark our party apart from others is its broad base of members. In almost every meeting I go to I see it. From truck drivers to shopkeepers, from farmers to professional people, they are all there; and they are united by one thing, which is a commitment to hard work, to honesty, and to the Australian way of life. For those reasons I am very proud to be counted amongst their number.
       </para>
       <para>
        That broad base in the community of which I spoke is important for another reason too. Australia is becoming an increasingly cosmopolitan country. Many people are migrants or are children of migrants. Our community is made up of a multitude of different ethnic groups. As you may or may not know, I am descended from Irish and Chinese ancestry. My father's family migrated to Australia from China between the wars. On my mother's side I am a fourth generation Australian. Both my parents, as well as my brother and sister, have travelled down to Canberra by bus to be present today. I thank them for their encouragement and assistance throughout the years.

        Before coming to this place I had, Mr President, the very good fortune to travel widely and also to read law at Brasenose College, Oxford. Amongst the numerous names of well-known old members of my college, I single out two. One is Field Marshal Earl Haig, and the other is John Buchan, the author who was to become Lord Tweedsmuir and the first Governor-General of Canada. I single them out because there is a very good story told of how John Buchan during the First World War acted as a courier for Haig.

        Apparently, the young officer was in the habit on his frequent train journeys from the front to headquarters of changing into his pyjamas to go to sleep. On one particular occasion he awoke just as a train arrived at the station where the headquarters was situated. With great presence of mind he quickly pulled on his long boots and his greatcoat and tumbled out of the train and gave Haig a very soldierly salute. Unfortunately, there was one problem: there was a gap between the boots and the greatcoat which exposed a portion of coloured pyjamas. Haig, looking him up and down, just said, `Well, Brasenose never was a terribly dressy college'. I would hope-as my predecessor, Senator Stone, said in his maiden speech-that at no time shall my dress here offend.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dress aside, I believe that my time at Oxford was a tremendous opportunity to study and I would very humbly hope that some of the wisdom prevailing there may have rubbed off on me so that I might be better able to serve this great country in the decision making and problem solving ahead. I select for you three of those problems-the environment, the economy, and the challenge facing youth-for consideration today, Mr President.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, I have had the very good fortune to travel around a fair bit, but I am always proud to come back home to Australia because of how beautiful this country is and how pristinely clean it is. Unlike Europe or northern America, we are not cursed with acid rain. Nor are we cursed with piles of garbage building up in the streets. And it must remain that way.

       <para>
        I cite as an example too the Antarctic Continent, of which Australia is a major custodian. This ice locked landscape constitutes the last great wilderness left to mankind. Its ecology is terribly fragile and without doubt tied to our global future in ways far too subtle or too numerous for us to appreciate fully. I believe Australia has a duty to protect this jewel, at least until it can be more properly understood. It may very well hold valuable insights into our world which are the key to the long term survival of mankind on this planet. For example, it was from the Antarctic that we first observed the growing hole in the ozone layer. I believe there are probably many other secrets which it holds which will in due course be revealed to us if we preserve and cherish the Antarctic as it deserves.

        All in all, these are very exciting times in which to live and we have many challenges facing us environmentally. But I warn everyone of one thing: the environmental debate must not become marginalised by sensationalist, single issue arguments, but rather we must take the broader view and look to make the protection of our environment part of our everyday lives. The environment is not just about rainforests or wetlands; the environment is the whole of the Australian land mass.
       </para>
       <para>
        We city dwellers have a lot to learn from the man on the land, because he is on the whole a very good manager and custodian of the environment. This is because he is in sync with it and because he is so totally dependent upon it to continue providing an income for himself, his family, his children and his children's children. I urge all to take note of this. I urge all to seek the broader view and look for a balanced perspective from which we can attain sustainable growth without squandering this nation's birthright. Sustainable growth should also be an objective in our approach to the economy.

       <para>
        When I was selected by the National Party in Gympie a little under a week and a half ago, I made a promise that I would travel around Queensland and listen to what Queenslanders had to say and take their voice to Canberra and let it be heard. I would have wished for longer to travel but, in the brief time that I have available to me in my discussions with electors and in what I heard from them, it became very clear that their principal concern was on matters economic. Never before has this country been in such a perilous economic condition. It is time we started talking about it, using simple everyday language.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very easy for us here to talk about our attitudes to things in terms of the words `wet' or `dry' or whatever; but remember, to most people in the population, these words are equated with whether or not one uses underarm deodorant. The important thing is that we talk about facts. It is a fact that our net foreign debt currently stands at $118 billion. Just to pay the interest on that will cost us next year well in excess of $12 billion-or $7,400 for every man, woman and child in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us get one thing right: we will be paying that money away. We will, all of us, pay it every week in higher taxes to meet the Government's interest bill. Small businesses will pay it in the money that leaves these shores and never comes back. Ordinary workers will pay it because at the end of the day, no matter how hard they work, no matter how productive they are, there will not be the money to reward them as they deserve. That is the legacy of the last seven years, a legacy which our children will probably still be paying off in 20 years' time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say these things very deliberately, Mr President, because I have grave doubts about our ability to meet our foreign debt commitments. Gross foreign debt currently stands at one-third of gross domestic product although in 1983 when the present Government came to power it constituted only 13.8. per cent of GDP.
       </para>
       <para>
        Foreign investment is nowhere near as dangerous as foreign debt. Foreign investment, properly managed, represents a stake in the future of this country through the creation of jobs and industry. Foreign debt represents a disembowelling of the economy as money is ripped away from the pockets of ordinary Australians and put in the hands of people with no long term interest in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hand in hand with high foreign rates, high interest rates which crucify business and which make the great Australian nightmare, interest rates are higher than they have ever been in Australia's history. The ordinary people of Australia are screaming for interest rates to be brought down because they can no longer bear the cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prime lending rates are in excess of 18.5 per cent. Under the current Government these interest rates are rivalled only by the horror years of the Whitlam era. The lesson is very simple. It is this: high interest rates equal business failure and misery for small business and workers alike. Business needs a chance to breathe, and whilst it is breathing it needs direction. Businesses must be encouraged to borrow to invest, not borrow to spend or borrow to speculate, because only in that fashion can we build a solid and stable economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Allow me to address too the buzz words of micro-economic reform. I assume by this Canberraspeak we mean reform of that small portion of the economy fortunate enough to survive the ravages of the current Treasurer (Mr Keating). We in the National Party are firmly of the belief that competition in the marketplace is essential for our long term economic future, but we are also of the belief, however, that competition must be accompanied by competitiveness.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this Government is fair dinkum about reforming our economy it will and must start with the labour markets. It is absolutely critical that the terms of employment are decided by the employer and the employee together and not by the faceless members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and certainly not by yesterday's men in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We need voluntary employment agreements which, I hasten to add, are just that-voluntary and agreements-because in this fashion we will get the flexibility to help our economy recover. Only in this fashion can we ensure that our factories and businesses work efficiently and that we get real returns on capital investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make all these comments on the economy because I grew up as a young child in a different world where happiness and prosperity in this country seemed to belong to us as a right, but for the next generation of Australians the future is not so rosy. Attendant with our economic woes have come broken homes, latchkey kids and a growing despair amongst young people. School students are struggling to find places in tertiary studies and they are struggling to pay for those places if they are lucky enough to get there. Tertiary education must be understood to be an investment in the future of this country and must be treated accordingly. It is shameful that it pays better to be on the dole than it does to be a student on Austudy and we have to do better by our young people. We have to encourage them to study and not drive them away. But they are the lucky ones, because many fall by the wayside well before that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot fail to observe with anything less than a sense of tragedy the growing drug abuse and homelessness amongst young Australians today. This, I believe, is something that we must address immediately. We must ensure that nobody in this country has his life counted for nought. We must address the problems of young people to ensure that each and every one of them has the opportunity at least to seize for himself prosperity and happiness and in so doing make this country great.
       </para>

        May I remind this chamber that in the past youth has not let this country down. Many of those who served in two world wars were not old enough to vote. Many were too young even to have enlisted but they concealed their ages because they knew their country needed them and they were not going to stand idly by. I am before you very humbly as what I understand to be the youngest person to occupy a seat in this chamber. I am also here on behalf of another generation of Australians that is just as keen as those who went before. We love our country and all that it stands for and we ask for nothing but opportunity and incentive to stand up and be counted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia should and must harness the powerhouse of young people who are ready to fight for its future. In all our deliberations here I would beg that we remember one thing: that my generation represents the future of this country. Give us the chance and we will answer the call. Give us the task and we will carry the load. Give us your trust and we will not let you down.

         â€”It is now well over a month since the Hawke Labor Government was reelected for an historic fourth term. The passage of time will continue to dim the memory of that great day, but before we forget about it completely, there are some important points which arose on election day which I feel duty bound to bring to the attention of honourable senators and to express my own personal reservations about.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let me say at the outset that the reservations I have concerning the conduct of the election in no way relate to the behaviour of any candidate or any political party; on the contrary, in my State at least the election was conducted in a spirited but fair manner by all parties concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matters which I would like the Senate to take note of relate to the conduct of the count. The first of my concerns arises from the treatment of scrutineers in some booths. There were many cases of a distinct lack of cooperation on the part of employees of the Australian Electoral Commission in their treatment of scrutineers.
       </para>
       <para>
        In one notorious case, the State member for Playford in South Australia was informed that he had no right to test the validity of the votes cast. He was then informed that he would be allowed to test the validity of the votes cast, but only after they had been tallied and the numbers checked. He was later told that he would only be allowed to check if the ballot did not take a long time to count. When the count was finished, he was told that, unfortunately, the ballot had taken longer than the returning officer was prepared to spend counting votes and, therefore, the checking by scrutineers for validity or otherwise of votes cast would be dispensed with altogether. Frankly, I find that unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a mystery to me why officers in charge of booths would behave in this manner. Perhaps it could be that they consider scrutineers an unnecessary encumbrance. Perhaps it could be, as has been suggested to me by a colleague, that they are just sick and tired of party scrutineers pre-empting official results, and they simply crave a little limelight. Whatever the reason for this behaviour, it seems obvious to me that to prevent scrutineers from fulfilling their duties to the candidate who appoints them is an unacceptable solution to whatever problem the Electoral Commission is attempting to remedy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that Senator Schacht took up this matter with the Electoral Commission before the election, and asked that it instruct its divisional returning officers to comply with the wishes of scrutineers and count slowly where those scrutineers so desired. The Electoral Commission declined to do so, and left it to officers in charge of booths to determine their own procedures. This abrogation of authority led to situations such as the one which confronted the member for Playford, which I mentioned earlier. Counts were rushed and it was impossible to obtain results from some booths.
       </para>
       <para>
        While rushing through a count in this manner would prevent their reporting of unofficial results, and it did, it could also prevent a complete and thorough scrutiny of a count. The two are very similar processes. I am not sure whether the brains trust at the Electoral Commission realise it, but a good scrutineer-and in the Australian Labor Party there is but one type-can check the validity of votes and determine preferences at the same time. It is a simple process, and one which does not extend the count by any great degree.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been told that in some electorates in South Australia the divisional returning officers gave their poll officials the instruction that the Federal office declined to give. The scrutiny was done in a way that allowed preferences to be determined. The count was not unnecessarily delayed, and all parties involved appreciated the sensible approach of those officers.
       </para>
       <para>
        For all the years that I have acted as a scrutineer for the Labor Party, no problems have ever arisen because scrutineers were allowed to examine ballot papers at will. If all participants in the count behave reasonably, they can all get the information that they desire without ignoring or damaging the interests of any group. There is no question in my mind that before the next Federal election, the Electoral Commission should give every divisional returning officer the direction that they should cooperate with scrutineers, and allow them to validate votes and determine preferences as they desire.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter that I wish to raise briefly is similarly a question concerning the time taken to count the vote. There was, in my State, no mention of the Senate count on the night of the election. There is always an unseemly rush to count the votes for the House of Representatives-and justifiably so, considering that determines who is to form a government for the next three years. But during the television coverage for the 24 March election, I do not think I heard one report concerning the Senate count. It is important that some votes are counted for the Senate, so that when the media spotlight is at its brightest-on election night-the people of Australia are made aware of what is going on, and who is going in to the upper House of their Federal Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am not certain whether the problem was with the delay in counting the Senate vote but, whatever the problem, it is one which is depriving this chamber of publicity which it quite richly deserves.
       </para>
       <para>
        My final comment concerns the length of time taken to count the Senate vote. At the declaration of the Senate poll for the State of South Australia, both Senators Teague and Crowley commented that the time taken to count the Senate vote was inordinately long. The electoral Commission must look at its methods, and determine a way to complete the count earlier.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before I conclude, there is one final point I would like to make. In case my comments have appeared overly critical of the Electoral Commission, let me make clear my appreciation and support for the fine work that the Commission does. On the whole, we are very well serviced by our Electoral Commission. It is important, however, that where problems do exist, those problems are addressed and resolved. I hope that my criticisms are not seen as being made in anything other than the constructive spirit in which they are intended.

         â€”It is with sadness and with pride that I pay tribute tonight to Edwin Meredith Williams, known as Ted Williams. Ted was born in Subiaco in Western Australia on 31 December 1923. He died on 20 March 1990. I was present when Ted collapsed and died while speaking at the annual general meeting of the Asbestos Diseases Society of Western Australia. He died while he was in the midst of a passionate diatribe describing how unionists who became members of parliament had betrayed asbestos workers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Ted Williams had studied engineering and worked in Wittenoom in Western Australia from 1948 until 1950. He suffered from an asbestos-related disease. The Asbestos Diseases Society of Western Australia was formed in 1979 and Ted became a member in 1986, and from then until the time of his death he played an executive role in the society. I would like to add that I am very proud to wear the badge of the Asbestos Diseases Society of Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like so many others, Ted was concerned that worker's claims for compensation were unconscionably slow to be addressed. He was a dedicated member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union for over 40 years and he served in various capacities as a union official. He was also a dedicated member of the Historical Society of Western Australia-indeed, a very rounded man.
       </para>
       <para>
        Ted had an unceasing commitment and genuine dedication beyond the ordinary call of duty to the Asbestos Diseases Society of Western Australia and I would like it on record in this place that Ted Williams died in the call of duty while fighting for justice and the recognition of asbestos diseases victims and their families. I express my condolences to his wife, Gloria, and the family.

        â€”The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I have answered this question for the period from July 1987. The Department of Community Services and Health has only operated as a single unit from that date. To obtain the information sought by the honourable senator prior to July 1987 would involve considerable resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) The table below lists all the surveys/opinion polls conducted by my Department and agencies for which the Department is responsible, since July 1987.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) (b) &amp;(c) See table below. With regard to (c), the number of agencies invited to submit proposals is provided, but not the names and tender prices of the unsuccessful agencies, for reasons of commercial confidence. Research companies are generally selected on the basis of competitive submissions from a short list of consultants whose specialised expertise and suitability for the assignment are known to the Department. It has been the practice for many years to consider market research services to be covered by the exemption given for Management Consultancy Services, which were specifically listed in Finance Regulation 52aa (2) as being exempt.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) Details of the sample size for each survey are generally available in the reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) (i) &amp;(ii) Details and characteristics of those sampled are generally available in the reports but research companies are not required to divulge the exact number of participants in group discussions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) The names of participants in group discussions in the surveys are not available for reasons of personal privacy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) Yes. I will provide copies to the honourable senator on request, unless the reports are considered to be commercial-in-confidence or they have not been provided because they are fully covered in the reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) It is likely that some unrelated questions were asked, for example to provide demographic data to ensure that samples were statistically representative.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Yes. Where the reports have been completed and publicly released, I will send copies to the honourable senator on request.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No. In most cases, computer printouts are not held. In some cases, they are included in the reports.

         Senator Cook
        </name>
       </talker>
       <para in-line="1">
        â€”The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The potential environmental effects of Brisbane Forest Products' woodchip export operation were fully assessed, but it was decided that these effects were not significant enough to require the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sawmillers Exports prepared an environmental impact statement on its woodchip export operation in 1977, at the request of the Commonwealth Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development and the New South Wales Minister for Decentralisation and Development. Neither my office nor the Department of Primary Industries and Energy holds a copy but I understand that the library of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories holds a copy which the honourable senator would be able to borrow.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The decision in 1983 to allow Sawmillers Exports to export woodchips derived from silvicultural residues was made only after a long assessment by the relevant Commonwealth and State authorities, including a twelve-month trial of the removal of this resource. During this time, no environmental problems were identified and no substantive reasons were advanced to justify refusal of the company's request. The decision to allow the use of silvicultural residues also took into account the findings of the State Pollution Control Commission's 1975 public inquiry into woodchipping on the New South Wales north coast and the 1977 report on woodchipping by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. Both of these reports found no significant environmental objections to the use of silvicultural residues for the production of woodchips.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although Sawmillers Exports is permitted to obtain woodchips from freehold land, it may do so only after approval has been given for each property by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. To date, the company has only once, in 1985, sought such approval and this request was granted only after advice was received from the Commonwealth and State environmental authorities, the State Department of Agriculture and the Soil Conservation Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       The 1989 decision to increase Sawmillers Exports' maximum export tonnage was based on advice from the New South Wales Forestry Commission that there would be sufficient sawmill and logging residues in the company's area of operation to satisfy the request without any change to forest operations apart from the removal from the forest of additional wastes which, in the absence of the woodchip export industry, would almost certainly be left in the forest to rot. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories also advised that it had no objections on environmental grounds to the proposal.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In line with standard procedures, the environmental implications of any proposal by Brisbane Forest Products to amend the conditions of the export licence would be fully assessed. Whether that assessment would include the preparation of an environmental impact statement would depend on the details of the application and other circumstances at the time.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Government is already involved in forestry and forest products research, including the use of hardwood pulpwood, through the CSIRO Division of Forestry and Forest Products. The Government is also discussing with industry the establishment of forest industry research funding arrangements whereby the research needs of Australia's forest and forest products industries will be addressed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government has recently legislated to exempt from wholesale sales tax certain printing and writing paper, tissues, toilet paper and paper bags if they are made wholly out of recycled paper. The Government is also trialling recycled paper in selected Government departments.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister also indicated on 19 March the Government's intention to develop a national waste minimisation and recycling strategy in co-operation with the States and industry. The Government will be seeking the establishment of minimum goals for rates of recycling.
      </para>
      <para>
       Any decision to establish a new pulp or paper mill should be based on commercial considerations by the company involved and should not depend upon government incentives for any particular process or feedstock.

      <para>
       (4) No fruits or vegetables are allowed entry only on the basis of voluntary fumigation. All imports are inspected for pests and disease. If pests of quarantine significance are found fumigation or other appropriate treatment is required to disinfest the product. At the choice of the importer some imports known to be prone to general insect infestation are fumigated at set rates after inspection for disease as this allows quicker release of the product rather than wait for the more detailed examination required for insects.

        â€”The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In response to the Lindsay Committee report the Government, in 1988, issued a quarantine policy statement ``Australian Quarantine-Looking to the Future''.
      </para>
      <para>
       Appendix II to this Statement detailed the Government's response to each of the 59 recommendations put forward by the Lindsay Committee. This record shows that the Government fully accepted 51 of the recommendations, rejected 2 recommendations and determined an alternative approach to the remaining 6 recommendations. Details of those recommendations rejected or altered are as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Rejected-The Government rejected Recommendations 41 and 42 relating to the collection of charges for quarantine services as it believed that the existing system of user pays fee for service charging under which 60% of the cost of the service is recovered from users, was more equitable and efficient than that recommended.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Alternative Approach Adopted-The Government adopted an alternative approach to a group of recommendations (numbers 13, 14, 15, 17, 23, 26) relating to the transfer of a range of quarantine functions from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to the Australian Customs Service. The Government decided that a more cost efficient and effective arrangement was to transfer these functions to each State or Territory and have them provide a single quarantine service on behalf of the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consistent with Recommendation 50 of the Lindsay report, a Strategic Planning Group has been established to facilitate implementation of those recommendations adopted by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the recommendations were an affirmation of existing practices, some were able to be readily implemented and others requiring major work will take longer eg. those that depend upon the outcome of negotiations with third parties such as the states or overseas countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Strategic Planning Group is operating to a 2 year time-frame (beginning December 1988) for implementation of the Government policy statement and all new arrangements/policies have either now been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.

       (1) In relation to the World Heritage nomination of Fraser Island and Cooloola, which are the core of the Great Sandy Region, upon what basis did the Minister reach the conclusion `I wouldn't like to think that Australia would put up a park which wouldn't pass the test and at this stage of the game I don't think that Fraser Island would pass' which was reported in a Brisbane Channel 7 news interview broadcast on Friday 27 October 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) How does the Minister reconcile his position with that of a former Minister for the Environment (Mr Newman) who advised the Parliament in December 1976, when Fraser Island was the first site to be listed on the Australian Register of the National Estate, that the Commonwealth Government would give consideration to World Heritage listing for Fraser Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Has the Minister initiated any evaluations of the significance of Fraser Island's outstanding attributes recognised by the Fraser Island Environmental Inquiry and the then Minister for the Environment.

       (4) Is it true that the Minister has never taken the opportunity to inspect Fraser Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Did the Minister also tell representatives of the Fraser Island Defenders Organisation on 7 June 1989 that he was prepared to consider a new nomination for World Heritage for the Great Sandy Region but that Fraser Island Defenders Organisation would have to prepare the nomination from its own resources without Federal assistance or support.
      </para>

       (6) Is Fraser Island going to be like Kakadu which was vociferously denounced by Senator Evans as `clapped out buffalo country' only to become part of Australia's, indeed the world's natural heritage.

       (1) At this stage there is no World Heritage nomination for Fraser Island. In my view much more work is required on assessing the possible World Heritage values of the Great Sandy Region and developing a management regime consistent with those values before Australia will be in a position to convince the World Heritage Committee that the Region meets the stringent criteria for World Heritage listing.

In addition the Queensland Government on 17 January 1990 announced agreement with the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) to hold an independent economic and environmental inquiry into logging on Fraser Island. No doubt in the course of the inquiry the natural and cultural heritage values of the Great Sandy Region will be canvassed. I support this initiative from the Queensland Government and look forward to seeing the results of the inquiry.

      <para>
       A science information service is one of a number of possible means of raising awareness of science and technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       In August 1989 $20,000 was provided to the Academy of Science from the Science and Technology Awareness program towards a feasibility study of the proposal for the establishment of an Australian Science and Technology Information Service (ASTIS). This was in addition to an amount of $10,000 contributed from Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce funds in June 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government recently received the feasibility study report for ASTIS. The Government is, however, not convinced that the proposed media referral service is likely to be the most cost-effective means of raising awareness of science and technology. In our consideration of this matter we have also been guided by overseas experiences with media referral services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has therefore decided not to provide further support for ASTIS. Instead, the resources available for awareness promotion will be utilised in a range of direct programs such as public lectures, and seminars on science issues, provision of educational resource materials, interactive projects at science and technology centres, and integrated media productions on science and technology.

      <para>
       The work at Mr Clarke's property has not been abandoned, but CSIRO's involvement has been greatly reduced for the following reasons:
      </para>
      <para>
       Some seven years ago it was decided, by the then Division of Forest Research, that resources should be concentrated on a detailed study of the biology of forest growth. This high priority study was designed to provide information that could be extrapolated to guide forest management under a wide range of conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The intensive nature of the study required a site close to the Division's Canberra laboratories. A suitable location was found at Pierce's Creek.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was necessary for the Division to reduce its work at Mr Clarke's property in order to free up resources for the higher priority work at Pierce's Creek.
      </para>
      <para>
       Apart from the distance of the Tarago site from Canberra (about 80 km), a further difficulty was that, despite being resown, the pasture component of the agro-forestry system performed very poorly because of environmental factors.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the Tarago studies should ideally extend over a long period, it is possible to carry out the research in phases so that results can be reported progressively. The studies have already been reported through conferences and field days. The results of a decade of work at the site, during which the trees have been established and pruning completed, are being written up and it is hoped to provide further progress reports on the project in due course.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) The ANZAC Ship Contract contains a general provision under which the Commonwealth may terminate some or all of the work under the Contract. In broad terms, the Commonwealth's liability in the event of such termination is to compensate the Contractor for loss or damage substained as a result. Anticipated profits on the remaining work which would have been completed are excluded from the assessment of loss or damage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The contract between the Commonwealth and the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) contains clauses which allow the Commonwealth to terminate the contract, or any part of the contract, upon giving notice in writing of its intention to do so. In this event the contractor is entitled to submit a claim for compensation in respect of loss or damage sustained.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The ANZAC Ship Contract also contains specific provisions for termination, at the option of the Commonwealth, after delivery of either four or eight ships. Liability provisions are similar to the general termination clause but, the Contractor is obliged to use its best efforts to achieve specific reductions in the contract price.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Commonwealth has entered into a contract with ASC for six submarines. The contract does not specifically provide for cancellation of individual submarines but all or any part of the contract may be terminated by the Commonwealth as stated in answer to (1) (b) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Neither project contract contains cancellation penalty provisions over and above the costs already incurred or committed by the contractor. However, the contractor could take legal action to apply for further compensation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) Sections of the Combat System Specification which forms part of the ANZAC Ship Contract are classified as they disclose performance details. The remainder of the contract is UNCLASSIFIED.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Submarine Contract is UNCLASSIFIED.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The ANZAC Ship Contract is treated as `COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE' because it contains pricing, schedule, equipment selection and other details which, if released publicly, could disadvantage the Prime Contractor in its dealings with sub-contractors and suppliers and in the general execution of the contract.
      </para>
      <para>
       The contract between the Commonwealth and ASC is `COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE'. This provision was made at the insistence of ASC and is normal commercial practice in contracts of this nature in order to protect the commercial interests of the company. Any breach by the Commonwealth of this commercial confidentially could:

       (2) It was not a precipitate decision.

       (3) The Government made a significant contribution in assisting the States to police their safety regulations by providing the means to obtain from the Australian Customs Service details of all individual company imports of materials handling equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The availability of import data from the Australian Customs Service gives the States a ready means of checking import details against equipment registrations and will be of significant advantage in improving the policing of safety standards applying to materials handling equipment.

They are spread out over several hectares of the hospital grounds. As a result, air conditioning systems used in the hospitals vary considerably in size, number and capacity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) None of the hospitals has a centralised air conditioning system in the true sense of the word but some buildings are air conditioned by built up systems which consist of one or more refrigeration and heating plants, with several air handling plant rooms.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other buildings within the hospitals are air conditioned by packaged type air conditioning which may be self contained or a split system type. Room type air conditioners have also been used.
      </para>
      <para>
       There remain many buildings situated throughout the grounds of all the hospitals which are not air conditioned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Maintenance on the air conditioning units is carried out on a cyclical preventative maintenance program. Various pieces of equipment require different maintenance intervals.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Air conditioning systems are maintained in the same manner in all hospitals. Australian Construction Services (ACS) are responsible for all asset maintenance in Veterans' Affairs hospitals. Preventative maintenance on plant is based on ACS Guide Schedules for Preventative Maintenance which recommend the servicing frequency for components and systems.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The Department of Veterans' Affairs is required under Government direction to utilise ACS for all its asset maintenance. ACS may subcontract the servicing of the systems.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) As ACS is responsible for all asset maintenance on behalf of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, it remains responsible for ensuring contracts are honoured.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) There are no known instances where contracts have not been honoured.

        â€”The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Australian Government has made it clear that it cannot accept the claim of the military regime in Myanmar that the elections set for 27 May 1990 will be free and fair while key political figures remain in detention and disqua-lified from standing for elections and while restrictions remain in force severely limiting the way in which political parties are allowed to conduct their campaigns.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Australia's policy towards Myanmar has been one of unequivocal support for democratic political and economic reform and for an improvement in the human rights situation in that country. The Government's concerns about the human rights abuses, in general terms and in relation to specific cases have been repeatedly and unambiguously made known to the Myanmar authorities. Decisions on the nature, manner and timing of such representations have been based on considered judgments about the most effective means of achieving the Government's fundamental objective of improving the human rights situation in Myanmar.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Australian Government does not seek to direct the manner in which Australian companies conduct their business in other countries. Such companies are free to enter into joint venture or other agreements in Myanmar on the basis of their own judgment. The Government does not accept that, because it places no constraints on Australian private commercial activity in Myanmar, its policies on the wider issues of democratic freedom and human rights can somehow be held to be modified.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Australia has never indicated support for the regime in Myanmar, for the way it came to power, or for its continued suppression of opposition groups. Australia has been, and will remain at the forefront of those countries seeking genuine political, economic and human rights reform in that country. The Government's record clearly shows it has taken every opportunity to encourage the regime to improve its human rights performance and adhere to its own undertaking that the elections will be free and fair.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has regularly made strong representations direct to the authorities in Myanmar requesting that key political figures be allowed to stand for election and has called upon the authorities to lift the oppressive restrictions on political activity so that political parties can campaign effectively in the period leading up to the election.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has made its views known in very clear terms and will continue to do so. I would draw the honourable senator's attention to the major statements that I have made on the Government's policy towards Myanmar, the most recent being on 19 January, 23 February and 1 March. I am sure that these meet her concerns.

      <para>
       (1) &amp;(2) International pilots entered Australia during the second half of 1989 either as Specialists under temporary residence policy or as employer nominees under migration policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Specialists entering for periods of up to 12 months may apply directly to any Australian office overseas and assessment is usually made without reference to an Australian office of my Department. In my Department's records, specialist temporary resident visas are not classified by occupational category and consequently it is not possible to provide much of the information requested by the honourable senator in relation to these visas. As an estimate, it is considered that approximately 300 pilots entered the country as temporary residents during the period July to December 1989, for stays varying from less than one week up to 12 months.
      </para>
      <para>
       The figures for pilots visaed under the Employer Nominee Scheme are as follows:

      <para>
       (4) Again I am unable to provide accurate figures in answer to this question. I would like to point out however that highly skilled persons coming to Australia to take up positions either as temporary or permanent residents are processed with priority. Applications for temporary visas for periods of stay of less than 12 months are generally processed within one week of lodgment. In the case of employer nominees, where the employer seeks to have the services of his nominee urgently it is the usual practice to issue a conditional migrant visa, which enables the migrant to enter Australia before all processing has been completed on the understanding that permanent resident status will be granted only after all requirements have been met. This conditional visa can often be issued within a month of application, providing the applicant has completed all formalities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The 35 pilots visaed for permanent entry were accompanied by 58 dependants.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) &amp;(7) Three pilots who entered as temporary residents have applied to change status to permanent resident. None of these applications has been finalised as yet due to large backlogs in processing change of status cases.

        â€”The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) Australia has declared a 200 nautical mile fishing zone around Australia and its external territories, excluding the Australian Antarctic Territory. The Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ) excludes certain waters where there would otherwise be an overlap with similar 200 nautical mile zones claimed by neighbouring countries, whether or not Australia has entered into a delimitation agreement with the country concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian 200 nautical mile zone around Norfolk Island abuts the New Zealand exclusive economic zone and the French exclusive economic zone generated by New Caledonia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Within the zone an inshore demersal line fishery on the Norfolk Plateau is fully exploited by traditional Norfolk Island fishermen. This inshore region has been closed to all other fishermen who may wish to fish for demersal fin fish. The inshore region is excluded from consideration in the remaining answers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Any Australian vessel with a current unrestricted Commonwealth Fishing Boat Licence may fish for pelagic species in these waters but few, if any, fish the area because of its remoteness and unproven resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       An offshore trawl fishery outside the Norfolk Plateau was established under new management arrangements which came into effect on 1 April 1990. Under the arrangements no long term entitlements have been issued to fish commercially for demersal species in these waters. One application to undertake short term exploratory trawling has been approved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under access arrangements applying from 15 December 1989 to 31 October 1990, 250 Japanese longliners are permitted to operate in the AFZ. If any of these vessels choose to fish in the portion of the AFZ surrounding Norfolk Island they may do so but in the past few have fished the area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) For vessels engaging in demersal fishing, a current Commonwealth Fishing Boat Licence is required with an endorsement specifically permitting either trawling or line fishing.
      </para>
      <para>
       Japanese tuna longline vessels hold Foreign Fishing Boat licences issued under an agreement between the Governments of Australia and Japan.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) As of 1 April 1990, the limitations set out in Fisheries Notice NIF 1 apply to these waters for dermersal fishing.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are no specific restrictions on pelagic fishing by holders of an unrestricted Commonwealth Fishing Boat Licence.
      </para>
      <para>
       Japanese tuna longline vessels are currently permitted to take all species of tuna and billfish by longlining, together with all other species of finfish which are incidentally caught. These vessels are not permitted to fish within 35 nautical miles of the Norfolk Island baseline.
      </para>
      <para>
       A number of other conditions also apply to Japanese tuna longline operations, including radio reporting of catch and position ever two days and the carriage of official observers as required.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) The exploratory trawling operation which has been approved is a joint venture between an Australian company and a Japanese company using a Japanese vessel.
      </para>
      <para>
       The only other vessels currently permitted to fish commercially in these waters are licensed Japanese longliners.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) The vessel approved to undertake exploratory trawling must remain outside a rectangle of approximately 30 nautical miles by 50 nautical miles around the Island, which prevents trawling on the Norfolk Island Plateau and slope areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       Appropriately licensed Japanese vessels are not permitted to fish closer than 35 nautical miles from the Norfolk Island baseline.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) The Australian Fisheries Service (AFS) is responsible for monitoring the activities of commercial fishing vessels in the waters of the AFZ adjacent to Norfolk Island. AFS and the Norfolk Island Government have recently cooperated on a project to install radar on the Island which will allow Norfolk Islanders to participate further in the surveillance of their adjacent waters.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both the RAAF and RAN carry out periodic surveillance of the area and enforcement activities as required on behalf of AFS. Coastwatch is responsible for coordinating these activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The surveillance and enforcement program has not detected any infringements of Australian fisheries laws in Australian territorial waters adjacent to Norfolk Island in the past three years.

It had been the practice for many years to consider market research services to be covered by the exemption given for Management Consultancy Services, which was specifically listed in Finance Regulation 52aa (2) as being exempt. More recently however the full tender process has been used.

       We, the undersigned, senior spokespersons for Numbulwar, Bickerton Island, Angurugu, Ngukurr and Umbakumba, write to request that you withdraw your office from holding the plebiscite scheduled to be conducted in this area 14-17th November 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       As you are aware, the Land Rights Act makes no mention of a plebescite, a ballot, a vote or the Electoral Office playing a role in this matter. We feel very strongly that by doing this favour for Mr Hand/N.L.C., you are being duped by vested interests and contributing to unacceptable political unrest in all our communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Our request for the Electoral Office to withdraw from the separate Land Council debate and let D.A.A. fulfil their obligations to us Aboriginal people is based on the following points.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) The separate Tiwi Land Council formation under the present Land Rights Act required no plebiscite. The Tiwi set the precedent.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Land Rights Act makes no mention of a plebiscite, voting, ballot or the Electoral Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) D.A.A. has at least three reports from its senior officers over the past 12 months, all reports say the same thing. All Aboriginal people want a separate S.E. Arnhem Land Council and no one wants an outside plebiscite.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The plebiscite is in contempt of our petition, signed by over 1,000 Aboriginal people, to the Governor-General. (A copy can be provided)
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) There are already serious breaches of the plebiscite rules.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The plebiscite rules map shows an incorrect S.W. boundary that has confused everybody here and D.A.A. It is not the boundary the D.A.A. consultant recommended.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The ballot paper designed by a D.A.A. ``expert'' disenfranchises nearly all senior Aboriginal people-it demands literacy as a skill.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) There will be no scrutineers or supervisors provided by any of our communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) There will be no acceptable disputes committee formed. (see attached)
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) The voter qualifications are wrong and will cause arguments, fights and violence on the day and after. There are fights here now on this matter. Are you going to be responsible for any deaths and injury over this problem on the day and in the future?
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) The N.L.C. are playing political games-see attached letter where they oppose the plebiscite to the Minister but publicly support it.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Our F.O.I. for D.A.A. files and officers diaries will not be through before the plebiscite. Another denial of natural justice for us Aboriginals.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will totally boycott the plebiscite. An absolute moratorium across all S.E. Arnhem Land. We have consistently stated this for six months. D.A.A. knows and have not told you. The plebiscite will be a $50,000 unnecessary waste of tax payers money.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the plebiscite goes ahead against the Land Rights Act and all Aboriginal people we represent, there will be big trouble.
      </para>
      <para>
       The media will tell all of Australia of the tragedy which takes place on this day of your making.

      <para>
       (1) There were a total of 63 planned ADF activities which were affected by the removal of their air support due to the assistance to the civil airlines. However, only 14 tasks were totally cancelled. Of particular significance in the cancelled tasks was the cancellation of most of the planned Naval HS748 electronic warfare training. The majority of other tasks were either delayed or had movement support provided by some other means. A full breakdown of the tasks and exercises affected is contained in TABLE 1.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted that the table contains only those activities which were programmed prior to the commencement of the support operations. There were activities which could have been expected to be programmed during the period, but which were not undertaken due to the known lack of aircraft. The full number and nature of these activities will never be known but one major area was the movement of duty personnel; alternate methods had to be found to move personnel on courses, postings and entitled leave.
      </para>
      <para>
       Overall, the effect on Army operations was not as significant as might have been expected as the disruptions occurred in a reduced activity period following Exercise Kangaroo 89.
